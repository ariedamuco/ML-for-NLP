 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment that S. 1802, the reauthorization of the Surface Transportation Board (Board), failed to pass the Senate. I have spoken out in favor of the Board on many occasions. I want to reemphasize today my commitment to seeing that the Board will be in business for a long time and will be given the resources that it needs to continue its vital work. 
The Board is the independent economic regulatory agency that oversees the Nation's rail and surface transportation industries. A healthy transportation system is critical to sustaining a vibrant and growing economy. Under the able and forward-looking leadership of Linda Morgan, the Board's Chairman, who was with us on the Commerce Committee for many years, the Board has worked to ensure that the transportation system is both healthy and responsive. Although it was established to be principally an adjudicatory body, the Board has reached out to the transportation community in an unprecedented way. It has handled the crisis in the West appropriately, letting the private sector work it out where possible, but intervening when necessary. It has initiated proceedings at the request of Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison to review the status of access and competition in the railroad industry, and its actions have produced a mix of government action and private-sector solutions. With its staff of 135, it puts out more work than much larger agencies, issuing well-reasoned, thoughtful, and balanced decisions in tough, contentious cases. Just recently, in the Conrail acquisition case, the Board issued one such decision that is good for my State, and for the Nation. 
But the Board is stretched thin. It needs to train new people to replace the many employees who are likely to retire soon. And next year, it will continue to expend resources monitoring the implementation of the Conrail acquisition and the rest of the rail network. The Board needs adequate resources to do the hard work that we expect it to do. 
Because we need the Board, and because the Board has done a fine job, I am here today supporting a clean reauthorization bill. I supported the Staggers Act when it was passed, and I think in large part it has been a success. 
I know that there is some concern about how our transportation system ought to look, and that there are many important issues on the table right now. Several of those issues are being handled by the Board, in connection with its competition and access hearings. I am confident that the Board will do the right thing with the issues before it. 
However, some of the tougher issues that have not yet been resolved--for example, the substantially more open access that some shippers want--are not for the Board. They are for us, and they are real. But the fact that the railroads and those who use the system have a lot of ground to cover on these legislative issues should not hold up the Board's reauthorization. Legislative change is our job. The Board, working with the law we gave it, has done its job. I want to thank the Board in general, and Chairman Morgan in particular, who has my unqualified support, for a job well done. The Nation needs agencies like the Board and public servants like Chairman Morgan.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to congratulate two nominees, Mr. Hal Creel and Mr. John Moran, upon their confirmation to be Federal Maritime Commissioners. 
Hal Creel, a native of South Carolina and my former Senior Counsel on the Maritime Subcommittee, has been a Federal Maritime Commissioner for four years. He has served the last two and a half years as the agency's Chairman. As Chairman, he has demonstrated a wide-ranging knowledge of the maritime industry and an outstanding ability to oversee industry activities. Our Nation is extremely fortunate to have such a dedicated individual at the helm of this important government body. 
Mr. Creel and the Federal Maritime Commission are responsible for overseeing all international liner shipping in the U.S: over $500 billion in trade. His efforts in the controversy surrounding Japan's restrictive port practices come immediately to mind. 
The Government of Japan for many years has orchestrated a system that impedes open trade, unjustly favors Japanese companies, and results in tremendous inefficiencies for anyone serving Japan's ports. The FMC, under Mr. Creel's guidance, met these problems head-on and he was instrumental in bringing the two governments to the bargaining table. The bilateral agreement that resulted paves the way for far-reaching changes that can remove these unfair barriers to trade. The progress made to date has occurred in large measure due to the Commission's firm, results-oriented approach. I urge him to continue to keep the Japanese honest, and to perform their agreed upon obligations. 
Hal Creel also has led the Commission in its efforts to resolve unfavorable trading conditions with the Peoples Republic of China and Brazil. These trades pose differing problems, but circumstances that nonetheless restrict U.S. companies or render their business dealings unnecessarily difficult or simply inefficient. 
Hal Creel is widely respected by all sectors of the industry as an involved, knowledgeable Chairman who can be trusted to make impartial decisions based on all relevant factors. This has been evidenced by the objective, informed decisions he renders in formal proceedings, his voting record on important agency matters, and the evenhanded enforcement program administered by the Commission. As Chairman of the FMC, Hal Creel has worked hard to curb harmful practices and create equitable trading conditions for the entire industry. He takes a personal stake in these matters and works hard to obtain industry compliance with the laws passed by this Congress. But those who willfully violate the law or intentionally disregard the Nation's ocean shipping policies as contained in the Shipping Act are dealt with appropriately. 
These are turbulent times in the liner shipping industry, times that call for effective and respected leadership from our Nation's regulatory body. Mr. Creel provides that leadership now, and I am certain will continue to do so as the industry enters the new environment that will result from the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 passed by this body last week. 
I am proud of the accomplishments and fine work Hal has done at the FMC. I am also proud that he is a native South Carolinian. He certainly has continued the fine tradition and excellence he established as a staffer and senior counsel for the Senate Commerce Committee. His reappointment is well deserved. 
I also wish to convey my support for John Moran to become a Commissioner at the FMC. John also is a former Commerce Committee counsel who served all members of that Committee with distinction. John and Hal worked together at the Committee on a bipartisan basis, slugging through tough issues and serving all of the Members well. 
For my Senate colleagues who do not know Mr. Moran, his only fault is that he is not from South Carolina. He has demonstrated his abilities and intellect time and time again. He is well suited to be a Federal Maritime Commissioner. Currently, John works representing the American Waterways Operators, as their Vice President for legislative affairs. John also has an outstanding reputation within the maritime and transportation industry sectors. 
I congratulate these two deserving individuals, who have been appointed to the agency which plays such a critical role in international trade.

In the health facilities section of the Health Resources and Services Administration, reference is made to a project intended for the Medical University of South Carolina. Inadvertently, the word `Medical' was not included in the statement of the managers; however, that word's inclusion was clearly the intent of the managers.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to honor and thank an individual who has been a tremendous asset to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee for the last two years. That individual is Carl Truscott, a United States Secret Service agent who has worked with Senator Gregg's committee staff in preparing the fiscal year 1998 and 1999 CJS Appropriations bills. 
Carl has been responsible for making policy and fiscal recommendations on the budgets of many of the Department of Justice programs. He's done this with integrity, an eye for detail, and a true bi-partisan spirit. Paramount to Carl's disposition is his belief in doing a good, thorough and fair job, which translated into him working closely with my staff and the Justice Department, ensuring that everyone was on the same page in regard to determining what would be best for the Department of Justice, for the interests of our States, and for the interests of our Senators, regardless on which side of the aisle they sit. 
I'm sure Carl is moving on to bigger and better things--and I'm also certain he will earn the genuine appreciation for his hard work that he has won time and again here in the Senate. Carl will be missed by this Subcommittee. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors, and thank him again for all of his excellent work for the Commerce, Justice, and State Subcommittee.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to commend and thank Dereck Orr, who worked with me and my appropriations staff this last year on putting together the fiscal year 1999 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill. Dereck came to me last year as a Presidential Management Intern on detail from the President's COPS office, and proved to be a tremendous asset during this difficult appropriations process. 
If ever there was a year to learn about Congress and the Appropriations process, it would be this year. The Commerce, Justice, State subcommittee had a long three days of debate on the floor of the Senate in July, a month-long conference with the House of Representatives, and extension of deadline after deadline in completing action on our bill and the Omnibus Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1999. Throughout this entire process, Dereck maintained poise, integrity, responsibility, and unfaltering support for me and my appropriations staff in getting the job done. He came in weekends, worked late at night, and basically worked above and beyond the call of duty. In particular, Dereck tackled the controversy-ridden issues surrounding the Census Bureau and worked with that agency and the House and Senate Appropriations staff on finding viable solutions for funding concerns and realistic means of addressing the Bureau's policy concerns. Dereck also versed himself in the Department of State title of our bill, making recommendations to staff during the conference on our bill. 
Dereck was truly an asset and welcome addition to my committee staff this last year. He came to me highly recommended by those that worked with him at the Department of Justice; he lived up to those recommendations and then some. Dereck is now back at COPS where they again will benefit from this excellent work. We will miss him here in the Senate, but certainly wish him, his wife, Kim, and their new addition well in all their future endeavors.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my Commerce Committee colleagues in supporting legislation to authorize the U.S. Coast Guard. This agency enjoys widespread, bipartisan support--and for good reason. The Coast Guard has an important job and does it well. Last year alone, the Coast Guard conducted 12,449 fisheries enforcement boardings; prevented 103 thousand pounds of cocaine and 102 pounds of marijuana from reaching the streets; gave safety instruction to 570 thousand recreational boaters; responded to 13,654 reports of water pollution or hazardous spills; prevented property loss of $2.5 billion; and saved almost 5,000 lives. 
The legislation before us today recognizes the vital contribution that the Coast Guard makes to the war on drugs. It authorizes $100 million over the President's request in fiscal year (FY) 1999 and FY 2000 for drug interdiction. This will allow the Coast Guard to conduct more operations like the one carried out by the Coast Guard Cutter Dallas in November of 1997. The Dallas, which is homeported in my hometown of Charleston, was participating in a joint surveillance operation with the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, and the Colombian Navy. During the operation, the Dallas fired 25 warning shots in pursuit of a 40-foot boat spotted off the coast of Columbia and recovered 1 of the 2 tons of cocaine netted in the operation. 
This bill authorizes a Coast Guard budget of $3.8 billion for FY 1998, $4.07 billion for FY 1999, and $4.35 billion for FY 2000 covering six appropriations accounts: (1) operating expenses; (2) acquisition, construction, and improvement of equipment and facilities; (3) research and development; (4) retired pay; (5) alteration and removal of bridges; and (6) environmental compliance and restoration. In addition, it authorizes $10 million in FY 1999 and $35 million in FY 2000 for capital expenses related to LORAN-C navigation infrastructure.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, because of my schedule I was unable to attend the vote to table the Patients' Bill of Rights. The tabling of this legislation was wrong. We are telling the American people that the insurance industry is more important than the patients. We must not let the insurance companies take the place of family physicians in deciding what is appropriate care for patients. 
Let me share with my colleagues a situation that occurred in South Carolina. Ms. Lisa Baughman lives in Charleston. She has a type of cancer called `multiple myeloma.' Her doctors at the Medical University of South Carolina are the best in the country at treating her particular condition, and they gave her chemotherapy in preparation for a bone marrow transplant. 
That is not a light matter, Mr. President. Anyone who has ever watched a friend or relative fight cancer knows it is serious and takes courage, prayer, and all the support you can find to go through that. 
Her doctors did what doctors have to do now. They called the insurance company and got `pre-approval' that the bone marrow transplant would be covered. 
But the day before the operation, the insurance company said she could not have the operation in her home town with her expert doctors. She would have to fly to another state because the insurer had a contract with a different hospital that was cheaper. This was literally the day before the operation. Can you imagine the mental anguish of going through chemotherapy, coming to the day before a bone marrow transplant, and then being told `not now, not with your doctor, not in your state, not in your home town, who knows when'--all with your life hanging in the balance? 
Her doctors protested that she was too weak and needed immediate treatment. The hospital in Charleston offered to do the operation for equal or less payment than the out-of-state hospital. But the insurer would not yield and tried to fly her alone, holding her medical files in her wheelchair, to the other hospital. She got them to approve a relative to accompany her. 
When she arrived, there was no one to meet her at the airplane with a wheelchair, no hotel room reservation, indeed, no `room at the inn.' These things had been promised. 
So she eventually showed up at an appointment with the new doctor chosen by the insurance company to learn about her case. He said he couldn't do the operation for another three weeks, but that she should be getting her care in Charleston, South Carolina at the Medical University because they had the best people. In fact, he had been taught by the surgeon in Charleston. 
She had no choice but to fly home. She contracted pneumonia in her weakened condition and is in the hospital right now, trying to recover. Because of the delay, she has to go through chemotherapy again before she can have the operation. 
That should not happen in America. No one should be forced to go through chemotherapy twice because an insurance company overrides an expert surgeon's orders and delays critical medical treatment. It should not happen, and there is no one in this world who can do anything about it except the United States Congress. 
Because of a Federal statute insurers cannot be sued for making injurious medical decisions and are not accountable to many state requirements. I do not know what we tell someone like Lisa Baughman if we go home this year without fixing this problem we created. 
Congress has stood by and watched while `managed' health care has taken over. Perhaps that was the wisest course for a while, because we do not have all the solutions. But if we do not agree on basic groundrules for fairness, patients have no protection and it is a race to the bottom. We cannot blame HMO's, insurance, or anything else if the Congress continues to refuse to act. 
Let me list some of the groundrules that we should enact with the Patients' Bill of Rights: 
People trained in medicine, not accountants should make life and death medical decisions. Every patient should know their doctor is free to give his or her best advice and decide the best course of treatment, without restriction from the insurance company. 
Every patient should know that specialty care is available if needed. 
Citizens should know when they go to the emergency room, that their insurance will pay instead of haggling over the bill and denying payment afterwards. The last thing someone needs while rushing a sick child to the emergency room is a gnawing worry about payment. 
Women should be able to visit their OB/Gyn without going through a gatekeeper. 
People with longterm illnesses also should be able to see their specialists without getting a referral every time. People pay premiums to get health care, not a runaround. 
Some people say this is radical socialized medicine, but I think people see through that. This argument is an old red herring and it is starting to smell. 
What we are talking about with this Patients Bill of Rights is just the health care we always thought we had, but now it is being taken away. I have spent decades pushing medical research and building the medical research base in South Carolina. I was trying to build expertise in life-saving treatments in my home state so my constituents could be cared for, not so they could be denied and sent somewhere else on a day's notice.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to express my continuing support for S. 1194, the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act. 
It is ironic that the Balanced Budget Act--which purported to expand seniors' freedom of choice--took away most of the rights they already had to spend their own dollars to purchase health care of their choosing. Many senior citizens and disabled individuals in my state are outraged at this loss, and justifiably so. I must concur with the comments made recently by Art Spitzer, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of the National Capitol Area in an amici curiae brief in United Seniors Association vs. Donna Shalala: 
`. . . the government should be able to say `We are going to provide a certain amount of health care, and that is how much we will provide and we are not going to provide more than that.' But it seems quite outrageous to us . . . that the government could say `and you may not get any more health care than we are willing to provide you, even if you and your doctor agree that it would be good for you, even if you are able to pay for it with your own funds.'

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the South Carolina Semester in Washington Program, hosted by the Institute of Public Affairs at the University of South Carolina, provides outstanding Honors College students at the state's public universities an invaluable opportunity to work as fellows in Congress, the Administration and in the private sector while pursuing an academically rigorous program of study and examination in Washington, D.C. 
This program joins a number of other prestigious offerings sponsored by many of the finest colleges and universities from across the Nation. Not only do these fellows assist in taking care of the business of the Nation, providing a tremendous service to Congress, the Agencies and the entities supporting them, by doing so these exemplary young people represent the best for the future of government at the local, city, county, state, regional, national and international levels. 
As the South Carolina Semester in Washington completes its seventh year, the program continues to demonstrate that these students and the campuses they represent are some of the finest in the country. To date students have participated from USC Columbia, Clemson University, the College of Charleston, the Citadel, South Carolina State University, University South Carolina Aiken, Winthrop University, Lander University and the University of South Carolina Lancaster. For the Fall of 1998, the program will add its first student from Coastal Carolina University. Certainly few states can demonstrate a more comprehensive involvement from its higher education community. 
The offices which participate are essential to the quality of the program. The time spent by professional staff in the office setting mentoring these students is a contribution to success; not only in this program but to these young people for a lifetime. Over the years the following offices have been gracious host learning sites for the South Carolina Semester in Washington fellows: Senator Strom Thurmond, Senator Fritz Hollings, Congressman Floyd Spence, Congressman John Spratt, Congressman Jim Clyburn, Congressman Bob Inglis, Congressman Lindsey Graham, Congressman Sanford, Congressman Ed Whitfield, Congressman Cliff Stearns, former Congressman Butler Derrick, former Congressman Robin Tallon, former Congresswoman Liz Patterson, former Congressman Arthur Ravenel, the Senate Commerce Committee, the White House, the Department of Education, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Corporation for National and Community Service, the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the South Carolina State Washington Office, Barron Birrell and the American Council of Life Insurance. 
The participants during the 1997-1998 academic year further enhanced the reputation of the program for reliable, diligent and intelligent contributions to their workplace. These students, their university, hometown and placement include for the Fall 1997 semester: Mary Borowiec, USC Columbia, Columbia, S.C., Congressman Lindsey Graham; Cara Carter, USC Columbia, Spartanburg, S.C., Congressman Mark Sanford; Katherine Graham, USC Columbia, Charleston, S.C., Office of the United States Trade Representative; Scott Harris, Lander University, Batesburg, S.C., Congressman John Spratt, Kim Hartwell, USC Columbia, Lexington, Kentucky, the White House; Charlene Miller, USC Columbia, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, Senator Hollings; John Sallee, USC Columbia, Lexington, Kentucky, U.S. Department of Education; Beth Sims, Winthrop University, Darlington, S.C., Congressman Bob Inglis; Amber Stamegna, USC Columbia, Mount Pleasant, S.C., Barron Birrell. 
For the Spring 1998 semester, the participants include: Heather Brooks, USC Columbia, Charlotte, North Carolina, Congressman John Spratt; Derham Cole, USC Columbia, Spartanburg, S.C., Congressman Bob Inglis; Ryan Lindsay, USC Columbia, Clemson, S.C., American Council of Life Insurance; Anne Knight, USC Columbia, Columbia, S.C., Congressman Jim Clyburn; Amy Milligan, College of Charleston, Mount Pleasant, S.C., Congressman Floyd Spence; Becky Sibilia, Clemson University, Bridgewater, New Jersey, Senator Strom Thurmond; Josh Staveley-O'Carroll, Clemson University, Charleston, S.C., Senate Commerce Committee. 
Mr. President, I wish to commend the Institute of Public Affairs at the University of South Carolina for implementing and coordinating such a fine program. Dr. Doug Dobson and Dr. William Mould have been instrumental in the successful tenure of this offering. I also wish to salute the other campuses and offices which make the effort to give quality to this endeavor. Finally to say well done to these outstanding students in hopes we will enjoy their contributions to society from positions of leadership in the years to come.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to direct that the vessel Little Toot, Official Number 938858, be accorded coastwise trading privileges and be issued a certificate of documentation under section 12103 of title 46, U.S. Code. 
The Little Toot was constructed in Panama City, Florida in 1988. It is a tender vessel, which can be used also as a small tugboat, and was constructed by Marine Fabricators for Structures, Inc. It is 25.2 feet long, 12.2 feet wide, 4.1 feet deep, and self-propelled. 
The vessel was purchased by Marinex Construction Company, Inc. of Johns Island, South Carolina, which purchased it in 1997 for intended use as a working tugboat in the harbor of Charleston, SC. The vessel has never been registered with the Coast Guard and has been sold a number of times. U.S. documentation laws require documentary proof of continuous U.S. ownership. The current owner has not been able to locate all the necessary documentation to prove continuous U.S. ownership, and therefore I am introducing legislation to waive the requirements of the coastwise trade law. 
The owner of the Little Toot is seeking a waiver of the existing law because he wishes to use the vessel as a tugboat. His desired intentions for the vessel's use will not adversely affect the coastwise trade in U.S. waters. If he is granted this waiver, it is his intention to comply fully with U.S. documentation and safety requirements. The purpose of the legislation I am introducing is to allow the Little Toot to engage in the coastwise trade and the fisheries of the United States.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to thank the Chairman and Senator Ford for their support on this issue. This is a simple matter of fairness and equity. The unreasonable and anticompetitive conduct of the United Kingdom has gone on far too long and exacted an unacceptable toll on the Carolinas. 
Mr. President, the Secretary awarded the Charlotte-London (Gatwick) route to US Airways on September 12, 1997. On May 7, 1998, US Airways announced plans to launch nonstop service in competition with British Airways, providing a convenient one-stop service from dozens of cities in North and South Carolina. Unfortunately, US Airways was forced to cancel this service because of the UK refusal to provide commercially viable access to Gatwick. 
It is now time for the Secretary to assert our rights and enforce the Bermuda II Agreement. 
Mr. President, before the Secretary enters into negotiations on a new broad bilateral agreement, equity dictates that the Secretary must resolve this issue.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2279. This is an important bill that we must finish before we adjourn. Without it the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) cannot spend any money on airport improvements, and airports in my state of South Carolina and throughout the nation would have to stop needed improvements that will bring better, safer air service to local communities--service which allows those communities to attract and expand businesses. 
The bill authorizes approximately $10 billion per year for the FAA for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. This will allow the FAA to focus on its most important mission--safety. Last year, more than 500 million passengers boarded planes and arrived at their destinations safely. Out air traffic control system is the safest in the world, but it needs to be upgraded if we are to remain the world's leader. 
The FAA is about to deploy new controller work stations--first in the Seattle en route center, and later in other en route centers. New controller work stations should also begin to be deployed within the next year under the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) contract. 
More needs to be done. The National Civil Aviation Review Commission (NCARC) reported that unless something is done, the air traffic system faces gridlock. The FAA has estimated that future passenger growth will be about 3.5% per year through 2009, with enplanements going from 561 million in 1998 to 821 million in 2009. More controllers and more equipment are needed. Not only are we looking at relying on satellites to track aircraft, but each of our airports will need to expand. Concrete, new lighting systems, new terminals, and new security measures are required. 
Right now, with the passage of last year's tax increase on the air carriers, the Airport and Airway Trust Fund is flush with money. The FAA estimates that the Trust Fund will take in total receipts of $10.622 billion in FY 1999. Only about 60 percent of the FAA's budget comes from the Trust Fund, with the remainder coming from the General Fund. There is more than enough money in the Trust fund to pay for the Airport Improvement Program (AIP), and I wish we could invest more funding for the program than is included in the bill. 
Next year I will fight to make sure that we restore the trust in the aviation trust fund by taking it off budget. The state of South Carolina has an airport in every county. These airports serve small and large communities that benefit from the opportunities that are created by construction on an up-to-date airport. For example, runway improvements at the Greenville/Spartanburg Airport allowed the South Carolina Upstate to attract BMW to build its North American plant there. AIP funding helped the former Myrtle Beach Air Force Base become the Myrtle Beach Jetport, bringing hundreds of tourists to vacations on the South Carolina Grand Strand. Whether it is Orangeburg, Marlboro County, or Hilton Head, South Carolina needs strong air transportation infrastructure. I can tell you as I travel around the state how critical aviation is. I have supported these interests for many years. This bill allow us to continue to meet the needs of the state and country. 
Finally, included in the managers' amendment are provisions of the Visit USA Act, introduced earlier this year as S. 2412 by Senator Burns and myself to further the international standing of the U.S. travel and tourism industry. As co-chairman of the United States Senate Tourism Caucus along with Senator Burns, I know that the tourism industry is a winner for the United States. In my state of South Carolina, tourism generates over $6.5 billion and is responsible for 113,000 jobs. Over 46 million international visitors came to the United States and spent over $90 billion in 1997. These visitors generated more than $5 billion in Federal taxes alone. To compete with other nations for a larger share of international tourism over the next decade, we must support an international tourism marketing effort. Provisions of this legislation would do that by authorizing appropriations for the marketing program of the U.S. National Tourism Organization (NTO). This authorization would allow the NTO to continue operations beyond the October 11 sunset date. 
This legislation is the product of a lot of hard work by many members of the Commerce Committee. I would like to thank them for their dedication to improving America's airport infrastructure and bolstering the safety of airline travel. I look forward to expeditious consideration and passage of S. 2279.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Certainly, unit M09 has been part of the coastal barrier system since the passage of the Coastal Barrier Resources Act in 1982. In 1987, a portion of Edisto Island was annexed by Colleton County from Charleston County. In 1988, after public notice and comment, the Fish and Wildlife Service recommended that this unit be expanded to include additional areas on Edisto Island. The Fish and Wildlife Service was not advised that a jurisdictional transfer had occurred and provided maps relating to Edisto Island to Charleston County, rather than Colleton. Because Colleton County did not have the appropriate maps, they provided inaccurate maps to landowners at a time when significant economic development were being made.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today marks a milestone in the history of my state, in the history of the Senate, and in the history of the United States. Today Senator Strom Thurmond, the longest-serving Senator in United States history, cast his 15,000th vote. This is a proud moment for not only Senator Thurmond but for the great state he serves and for the venerable history of this institution. 
What is perhaps even more remarkable than the number of votes Senator Thurmond has cast is the thought he put into each of those votes and the conviction with which he has voted. I have not always voted with the Senior Senator from South Carolina, but I have never doubted he cast each vote with no consideration other than the good of our state and nation in mind. 
This is one of many records the senior Senator from South Carolina has achieved. I well recall rising last year to pay tribute to the Senator on the occasion of his setting a new longevity mark in the Senate. In fact, Mr. President, Strom Thurmond's entire life is remarkable for his ability to blaze a trail for others and set new marks. 
Many of my colleagues today have spoken of Senator Thurmond's gracious manner, his compassion for others, and his profound respect for the traditions and the history of the United States Senate. Indeed, no one possesses these qualities to a greater degree than Strom Thurmond. 
Senator Joseph Biden said today, `politics is personal.' And as he pointed out, Strom Thurmond understands this better than anyone. No one knows better than Senator Thurmond that the Senate's success is directly related to its members' decorum and the warmth of their personal relations. Senator Byrd spoke movingly of Senator Thurmond's presence at a memorial service after the death of his grandson. I have no doubt that many other Senators could tell similar stories. Strom Thurmond is as devoted to his colleagues as anyone I have ever known. For him, friendships transcend party lines. 
Of course, Senator Thurmond's loyalty and dedication extend beyond the confines of this room. An ardent patriot, he left his life as a father and judge behind to volunteer for combat duty in World War II and participated in numerous campaigns. Senator Thurmond is one of those rare people who we can say with certainty loves America even more than he cherishes his own life. 
If it is possible for one person to embody the traditions and personality of an institution, Strom Thurmond personifies the United States Senate. He is a man of respect, good will, humor, energy, principle, integrity, and loyalty. It is no exaggeration to say that serving the people of South Carolina and the United States is Senator Thurmond's life. Today we have the great fortune to repay his dedication in a small way by making the sort of personal gestures for which Senator Thurmond is famous. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to congratulate my colleague and old friend on the occasion of his 15,000th vote.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there has been quite a bit of discussion in Washington recently about the need to tell the truth. Well, I have always believed people should tell the truth--in private and in public. That is why I have long opposed the biggest lie, the biggest fraud in this town--the so-called federal budget surplus. The truth is there is no surplus. We continue to borrow money from federal trust funds--mainly Social Security--to mask the budget deficit. Meanwhile, the national debt skyrockets. 
I rise today, Mr. President, to draw the Senate's attention to an editorial which appeared in the Sunday, August 30, 1998 edition of the Spartanburg Herald-Journal, published in Spartanburg, SC. This editorial points out the fraudulent nature of the budget surplus and criticizes Congress and the President for failing to tell the American people the truth about the budget. I quote the Herald-Journal: `The truth can be seen in the national debt. That debt is continuing to grow and will keep growing over the next few years. Your budget is not balanced if you continue to go deeper and deeper into debt each year.' 
The editorial goes on to argue that our priority should be to balance the budget honestly and begin to reduce our national debt, rather than give in to the near-term appeal of further tax cuts--no matter how much merit the individual cuts may have. Mr. President, I have been beating this drum for years now. For the past two years, for example, I have offered budget resolutions to urge we stay the course to balance the budget and begin to reduce the debt. 
In fact, I support many of the proposed tax cuts. I have consistently supported making health insurance costs for the self-employed 100 percent deductible, and I have voted to eliminate the marriage penalty three times in this year alone. But each time I have also voted to pay for these tax cuts, so that we stay on course to balance the budget. This should be our top priority. Only by reducing the national debt will we be able to whittle away at our whopping $363 billion in annual interest costs.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this morning I missed the vote on the Fiscal Year 1999 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report, which this body approved by a wide margin. I missed the vote due to a long airline delay--a delay especially vexing to me because I had scheduled my departure from South Carolina to arrive here in plenty of time to vote on this legislation. Had I been here, I would have been proud to cast an `aye' vote for this bill. 
As a combat veteran, I'm convinced a strong and vigorous military is vital to our nation's security and interests. The Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report is crucial to strengthening our armed forces, and it is tremendously important to the people of South Carolina. 
I was proud to work with fellow Appropriations Committee members to secure additional money for projects at the Parris Island Marine Corps Recruit Depot, McEntire Air National Guard Station, Spartanburg Air National Guard Center, Beaufort Marine Air Corps Station, and Charleston Air Force Base. In addition to strengthening our military, these projects will help the brave men and women in uniform who serve on these bases and their dependents. 
I was proud to help make the 1999 Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report a reality, and I'm pleased to see it approved today by the Senate.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Surface Transportation Board (Board) for its recent actions approving the application of CSX and Norfolk Southern to acquire Conrail. As the Board's 424-page written decision of July 23, 1998, explains in great detail, this merger transaction as approved will bring railroad competition into the East like no merger has ever done before, and it will provide the opportunity for economic growth and more jobs both on and off the rail system throughout the Northeast and the South, including my state of South Carolina. I appreciate the way in which the Board acted in this proceeding in the public interest, promoting more competition while preserving the strength of the transaction as proposed. 
The Board is the independent economic regulatory agency that oversees the nation's rail transportation industry. Under the leadership of Linda Morgan, the Board's Chairman, who was with us on the Commerce Committee for many years, the Board, with its staff of 135, puts out more work than much larger agencies, issuing well-reasoned, thoughtful, and balanced decisions in tough, contentious cases. In particular I would like to commend the efforts of Linda Morgan, the Chairman of the Surface Transportation Board. Prior to assuming the Chairmanship, Linda worked for the Senate Commerce Committee. Her tireless efforts were integral in completing difficult work in a relatively small time frame. When we eliminated the Interstate Commerce Commission, I think that we underestimated the degree of work and the complexity of issues that continue to be brought before the Board, and in hindsight I believe that we cut personnel too deeply. The Board has recently issued decisions dealing with the rail service emergency in the West; several difficult rail rate cases; matters involving Amtrak; and proceedings initiated at the request of Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison to review the status of access and competition in the railroad industry. In each of these matters, it has taken on hard issues and has resolved them fairly and competently. 
The CSX/Norfolk Southern/Conrail proceeding is the most recent example of the Board's ability to address difficult issues with broad ramifications and reach a result under the law that promotes the public interest by best addressing the needs of all concerned. In that case, the Board was presented with a merger proposal that was inherently procompetitive. The railroads themselves brought to the Board a transaction that overall would create two strong, balanced competitors in the East with the ability to provide improved and more competitive rail service opportunities throughout the Northeast and the South. The transaction contemplates substantial investment in railroad infrastructure, which we desperately need to accommodate the Nation's expanding economy, and it is expected that, over time, the merger should produce over $1 billion annually in quantifiable public benefits and numerous other benefits. 
Although the overall competitive and other benefits of the merger proposal, which were reflected in several negotiated settlements, were well recognized, various interests wanted the Board to impose conditions to address environmental and safety issues or to modify the competitive balance reflected in the original proposal. It was in addressing these requests that the Board represented the public the best. The Board encouraged CSX and Norfolk Southern to work further with the various rail users and other interested parties and see if they could resolve the remaining issues themselves. As a result of this process, many settlements were reached, which undoubtedly produced resolutions better than the Government could have directed from Washington, D.C. Where settlements could not be reached, however, the Board acted responsibly and fairly. After two long days of oral argument, it issued a decision that smartly balanced the competing interests and imposed various conditions to mitigate environmental impacts; to preserve and improve the competitive posture of affected shippers and regions without upsetting the integrity of the procompetitive merger transaction that the railroads originally presented; to promote balanced regional economic development by assuring that smaller railroads that provide essential services will be viable and will continue to be able to compete; to recognize the legitimate interests of rail employees; and to promote a safe and smooth transition to a more competitive and efficient rail system in the East. 
The Board's action on this merger application will preserve and promote competition throughout the Nation; will ensure an improved transportation network that will connect the North and the South in historic ways; and will provide that, overall, shippers will be better off after the merger than they were before, and that none will have fewer service options than they had before. I congratulate the Board on its action in this matter, and on its other significant work since its creation in 1996. 
On Wednesday, July 29, the Commerce Committee overwhelmingly approved a one-year reauthorization of the Board, which I joined Chairman McCain in sponsoring. I want to reemphasize here today my commitment to seeing that the Board will be in business for a long time and will be given the resources that it needs to continue its vital work.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today Senator Burns and I are introducing a bill, the Visit USA Act, which will further the international standing of the U.S. travel and tourism industry. As co-chairman of the United States Senate Tourism Caucus along with Senator Burns, I know that the tourism industry is a winner for the United States. The Visit USA Act would improve U.S. international marketing and services to travelers in the United States by: creating a toll-free number for international travelers to call for assistance in their native language; improving signs in transportation facilities; and authorizing appropriations for the marketing program of the U.S. National Tourism Organization (NTO). 
Tourism is more than cameras and Bermuda shorts. Travel and tourism is a big business. Last year it produced a record $26 billion trade surplus, and the industry continues to grow. In my state of South Carolina, tourism generates over $6.5 billion and is responsible for 113,000 jobs. Over 46 million international visitors came to the United States and spent over $90 billion in 1997. These visitors generated more than $5 billion in Federal taxes alone. To compete with other nations for a larger share of international tourism over the next decade, we must support an international tourism marketing effort. The Visit USA Act would do just that by providing for international promotion of the United States while making travel to this country simpler and more understandable for our foreign guests.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Thank you Mr. President. I rise to update the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee on the status of the CH-47 engine upgrade program, which the committee reduced by $27.3 million in its reported bill. The basis for the reduction was program delays. 
The committee's action has called Army leadership attention to the delays in getting the FY 1997 and 1998 funds on contract. This delay was due in part to disruptions from relocating the contracting office from St. Louis to Huntsville and in part to unsuccessful, protracted efforts to use commercial pricing practices on the contract. 
I understand that the strong support from the CINC's combined with the Committee's recommendations made completion of these contracts a high priority. I am pleased to report that the FY97 kit production contract was signed July 1 and that the FY97 engine conversion contract and the FY 1998 kit production contract was signed as of July 29. Further, the full rate production contracts are scheduled to be signed early in fiscal year 1999. 
Fortunately, production of the engine conversion kits has been underway on a letter contract since December 1997 with actual engine upgrades now underway and on schedule at the Greer, South Carolina plant to meet the initial delivery of upgraded engines in October 1998.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the chairman for that assurance. I hasten to add my support for the upgrade program, which is done in part at two separate facilities in Greer, South Carolina. 
While I voted for the bill in subcommittee and full committee, I strongly urge the chairman to give careful consideration to restoring full program funding in conference based on this new information. The upgrade program is just phasing out of its low rate initial production phase with the FY 1999 funds. Maintaining the production schedule is critical to controlling costs and achieving efficiencies. The FY 1999 funding in question starts full rate production for which all the necessary Army approvals have been given.

Mr. President, today, I, along with Senator Thurmond, introduce duty suspension legislation designed to continue the importation of certain rolled glass into the United States duty free. This product is not manufactured in the United States. Upon importation, the rolled glass will be further manufactured in a facility at Fountain Inn, South Carolina. 
I believe that this duty suspension will assist with employment in South Carolina. This facility manufactures glass-ceramic cooktops for the North American appliance industry. Continuation of this duty suspension will allow for the most efficient manufacture of this high end product in South Carolina.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the opening of the 1998 tobacco marketing season in my home state of South Carolina. 
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States is one of the world's leading producers of tobacco. It is second only to China in total tobacco production. Tobacco is the seventh largest U.S. crop, with over 130,000 tobacco farms in the United States. 
In South Carolina, tobacco is the top cash crop, worth about $200 million annually. It also generates over $1 billion in economic activity for my state. Tobacco production is responsible for more than 40,000 jobs on over 2,000 farms and continues to account for about one-fourth of all crops and around 13 percent of total crop and livestock agriculture in South Carolina. 
It has been a hard year for tobacco farmers in my state. In June 1997, farmers found out about a settlement between the State Attorneys General and five tobacco companies. This settlement created insecurity in these farmers' lives, as well as in their communities, as they tried to prepare for the upcoming tobacco season. After learning of their exclusion from any type of compensation in this settlement, their quotas were cut by 16 percent from the previous year. This means the farmers' income will decrease by 16 percent in the next marketing year. 
While the Senate debated comprehensive tobacco legislation, the tobacco companies acknowledged to tobacco farmers that they had made a mistake in not including them in their original settlement negotiations. These companies promised farmers they would be included in any future negotiations. Now we hear the State Attorneys General and the companies are again negotiating a settlement, and once again the farmers have been excluded. 
In recent years, we have seen a rise in tobacco imports, as domestic purchases by companies have declined. This has had a direct effect on the economy of my state. Many of the rural towns in South Carolina have grown up around producing tobacco, and decreased demand for domestic tobacco has affected them greatly. I hope these companies see the need to purchase more domestic tobacco and decrease the amount of tobacco they import. It is imperative for these rural communities' economic stability that domestic tobacco purchases rise. 
I also want to take this time to recognize a man who will begin his 50th season of auctioning tobacco. Kelly Ritter started auctioning tobacco in 1948, when times were a lot different. Back then tobacco was not seen as it is now, but rather as a way of life in the developing communities of South Carolina. Technology may have advanced in tobacco production over the last fifty years, and markets may have gone up and down, but it is a relief that there is still a constant in the production of tobacco--Kelly Ritter. 
Mr. President, in conclusion I want to wish the tobacco farmers and warehousemen in South Carolina the best of luck this year. I wish that I could be down in South Carolina for this festive occasion of opening day, but duty calls. Although I can't be there physically, they all know that I'm there in spirit. And as hard as I have worked in the past for them, they can expect me to work even harder to ensure farmers and their communities remain economically sound.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as with everyone in Congress and the nation, my thoughts today are with the victims of Friday's shooting and their families. And like many of my colleagues, I wish to pay tribute to the heroism of Capitol Police officers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson and to mourn their passing. 
This is a terrible time for the Congress and the nation. It reminds me, Mr. President, of having to write the families of dead comrades in World War II. How does one summarize the achievements and meaning of two lifetimes in a short letter or brief remarks? How does one do justice to men who gave the last full measure of devotion that others might live? Consoling the families of the dead and doing justice to the ultimate sacrifices and nobility of heroes is never easy. It is particularly hard in time of peace, when we take our safety and security for granted. 
But even in peace time, Mr. President, unfathomable evil exists and threatens to shatter our security at any moment. Officers Chestnut and Gibson knew that the price of our safety here in the Capitol was their unceasing vigilance; and they showed us that even in peace time, the heroism of brave and selfless individuals like them often is all that enables us to live in freedom and work in safety. It is easy to forget this; but we must not forget, and Friday's events ensure that we will not forget. Officer Chestnut, a South Carolina native who served with distinction in the Air Force for many years, would not want us to forget. He knew the price of freedom, and he was willing to give his life for his fellow citizens. 
Who knows how many lives officer Gibson saved by confronting the gunman, Russell Weston, outside the office of Representative Tom DeLay? Who knows how many tourists and staffers would have died were it not for the bravery and heroism not only of officers Gibson and Chestnut but of all the Capitol Police? 
Friday's shootings were a reminder that all of us who live and work on Capitol Hill owe an unpayable debt to the Capitol Police. The brave men and women of that force put their lives on the line for us every time they put on a uniform. It is their job to stand between us and harm's way, and they perform it with unceasing devotion and consummate professionalism. We should all give thanks to God that we are protected by these officers. And we should realize that it is thanks to their zealous devotion to duty that we live in freedom from constant fear and danger. 
For those of us who see the Capitol Police every day, it is easy to forget they are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. Officers Chestnut and Gibson were not only exemplary guardians of the public safety--they also were dedicated and loving family men. Each leaves behind a wife and three children. These shattered homes are the legacy of one lunatic's senseless violence. 
Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson's heroic deaths are all the more painful for the loss their families will forever feel. We whom they died to protect can only hope that the nobility of their sacrifice and the priceless ideal for which they gave their lives--not us, but freedom and democratic government--will be of some small comfort to their families. 
I join with all Americans today in offering my deepest thanks to these men, my condolences to their families, and my promise that their sacrifice will not be forgotten.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act. I have always supported federal credit unions because of their vital role in providing access to credit, particularly for consumers of moderate means. This bill would allow credit unions to continue to offer this outstanding level of service. 
The Supreme Court's recent decision in the AT&T case cast a shadow of uncertainty over credit union membership. The decision threatens to disrupt the financial affairs of millions of hard-working families by forcing credit unions to limit future memberships and placing current memberships in jeopardy. This legislation responds to the Court's decision by clarifying the credit union field of membership. It protects existing credit union members and membership groups, while allowing approporiate expansion. In addition, it further protects consumers by ensuring the safety and soundness of credit unions through improved regulatory safeguards. 
H.R. 1151, as reported by the Senate Banking Committee, is critical to consumers across the nation. Credit unions serve many families who have trouble obtaining credit elsewhere. In particular, credit unions are absolutely essential in the area of small consumer loans. For those in need of a loan to purchase a new car, put down a rent deposit, or buy a new washer and dryer, the local credit union is a valuable resource. In today's world of mega-mergers, credit unions continue to be there to provide affordable and personal financial services. 
Both the House of Representatives and the Senate Banking Committee approved H.R. 1151 by overwhelming margins. These votes are evidence of the strong support behind this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1151 in a similar fashion.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as the Senate conducts its business today, South Carolina mourns the passing of one of its greatest citizens. Buck Mickel, a man who stands as a giant in the history of the Carolina Upstate, passed away Thursday morning, July 23. One of the greatest pleasures of my life has been my long friendship with Buck. I count it a privilege to have known him and to have learned from his example. 
Every moment of Buck's 72 years was spent in dynamic enterprise and productive activity. He was a tireless dynamo, a man whose vigor and energy was rivaled only by his bold ideas, humanitarian impulses, and sincere humility. No simple description of Buck does justice to the scope of his activities or the importance of his full life to the lives of everyone who lives in the Upstate. 
Buck was a savvy businessman. When he took the reins of Daniel Construction Company in the early 1960s, he steered it from its position as a successful, regional business to a thriving, global company. By the time he retired from active management of the company in 1987, he had expanded Daniel Construction's business, taken it public in 1969, and merged it with Fluor Corporation in 1977 to create today's construction and engineering giant, Fluor Daniel Corporation. In the meantime, he created thousands of jobs for South Carolinians and other Americans and helped lead the way in the creation of overseas operations for U.S. companies. 
In fact, after Buck `retired' (any use of this word in connection with Buck Mickel must be taken with more than a grain of salt) in 1987, he continued to travel the world to help groom young Fluor managers for eventual leadership within the company. 
Leadership was the theme of Buck Mickel's extraordinary life. His sense of duty and responsibility, with the recognition that he was a natural-born leader if ever there was one, informed every aspect of Buck's life. 
Buck's prodigious achievements as a businessman and his famed savvy qualify him as a great success on their own. Les McCraw, who succeeded Buck as head of Fluor, summed up Buck's position in his field. `To say that he was a giant in the construction industry is a gross understatement,' Mr. McCraw said. `He clearly was one of the all-time leaders in that industry and had been for 40 years.' 
But Buck's friends know his greatest passion was not commerce. He was consumed by a desire to enrich and expand the economic and cultural life of South Carolina, and he devoted every waking minute to those twin tasks. Robert Royall, South Carolina's Secretary of Commerce, said Buck `loved South Carolina as much as anyone I have ever known and contributed more to developing the state than anyone in my lifetime. . . . He was constantly thinking about ways to help the state.' 
Buck stayed in regular contact with almost everyone in public life in South Carolina. I spoke to him just last week, and as always, he was spinning ideas about how to help the state. In fact, Mr. President, the universal reaction among public figures in South Carolina since Buck's death has been disbelief. It's just hard to believe that a man so vital, so full of ideas and concern for others, could pass from among us. It may take awhile for us to realize the full import of his death, but when we do, I believe Buck's death will hit us as hard as any in our state's history. 
Highest on the list of Buck's achievements is the revitalization of downtown Greenville, SC, and the tremendous development of the region's economy. As the Greenville News wrote, Buck `put his imprint on virtually every civic project in Greenville for almost half a century.' Buck was instrumental to Greenville's building its Peace Center for the Performing Arts, which has won national acclaim as a venue for the live arts; restoring numerous dilapidated buildings in Greenville proper; luring important businesses back to the downtown area; and raising funds for a new sports arena. These developments have transformed Greenville in a way impossible to imagine if you haven't lived there, Mr. President. 
Of course, Buck's beneficence and energy were by no means limited to Greenville. He helped attract Michelin, BMW, and other international businesses to the state. Buck supported secondary education--his support helped make the Governor's School for the Arts possible--and higher education. He and his wife, Minor, were active with Furman, Clemson, and Wofford Universities, as well as with the University of South Carolina. Buck rose from humble origins and relied on a scholarship to Georgia Tech University, so he knew the importance not only of education but of financial support for those in need of aid. He and his wife gave generously of their time and money to South Carolina colleges and endowed many scholarships. 
Buck Mickel's life has touched almost every life in my state. Because Buck was so humble and modest, most of those he helped do not even realize the debt they owe him. With Buck Mickel's passing, South Carolina has lost one of its greatest civic and business leaders. Quite honestly, Mr. President, I don't know how we will replace him.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank Chairman Gregg in the first instance. I have had the occasion to handle several bills myself. I have watched it for over 30 years. Several Senators on our side of the aisle have remarked along with me in the back of the cloakroom that they have never seen a bill that was better managed and that Senator Gregg has done an outstanding job, which I want to note for the Record. 
As the distinguished Senator stated, the staffs on both sides have just done an outstanding job. They worked around the clock. I have never seen this many amendments actually move in this short a time. It couldn't have been done, of course, without the folks here right at the front desk on both sides of the aisle. 
Let me thank Jim Morhard, Kevin Linskey, Paddy Link, Carl Truscott, Dan Quam, and Virginia Wilbert, of the majority staff; and Lila Helms, Emelie East, and Dereck Orr. Actually, as Senator Gregg has pointed out, Lila has come in now to replace Scott Gudes, which is next to impossible. He was as good as there ever was. But she has already brought that statement into contest. She, Emelie East, and Dereck Orr have been working around the clock and have been doing a great job. 
I am glad that the Senator from New Hampshire notes this for the Record. Too often we forget that we couldn't handle these bills without Scott Gudes, and Dereck Orr on our side of the aisle. I can tell you that.

For example, researchers at the National Ocean Service laboratory at Charleston are playing a critical role in developing methods for detecting Pfiesteria toxins. The reduction of toxin outbreaks must rely on bringing our combined federal, state and academic resources to bear on the problem in a cooperative and cost effective manner.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to briefly discuss a provision in this legislation which I was pleased to sponsor. The interstate network of railroads faces several problems. As you are aware, several areas in the United States currently experience serious rail freight congestion. We frequently hear of delays on the delivery of goods for two to three weeks because of rail congestion. With more train traffic, there has also been an increase in rail related accidents. There is no comprehensive system which manages the interface between trains and cars at the huge number of highway crossings in the United States. In South Carolina alone, there are 32,000 crossings. This situation is compounded in many parts of the country. Congestion is worsened and safety is jeopardized because passenger trains, high-speed trains, and freight trains all use the same track. 
Unlike the national tracking of air traffic that assures millions of safe passenger air miles each year, comprehensive automated management and control of movement and location in the rail industry does not exist. The Transportation Safety Research Alliance, a non-profit public/private partnership which includes industry and research institutions, is seeking to develop an advanced, integrated technology system that would provide direction, movement, and highway crossing control for the rail freight industry. Without such a system, we are going to experience more accidents endangering the public safety and more delays to shippers and consumers that harm the Nation's commerce. This bill includes language directing the Federal Railroad Administration to provide $500,000 towards the development of this project. I want to thank the Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Shelby, and the Ranking Member, Senator Lautenberg, for including this language. I appreciate your leadership in the Conference to ensure that this provision is included in the Conference Report.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. 
With respect to this particular sense-of-the-Senate amendment, it really goes right to the heart of the expression `Saving Social Security first.' The fact is, as we talk about campaign finance reform, the abuses and the scandals of campaign finance reform are not corporate money, labor money, soft money, hard money, Buddhist temple money, Lincoln bedroom money. The scandal of campaign finance is the looting of the Social Security fund by politicians who want to get reelected, whereby they determine every year that they have a big surplus. 
The reason for this amendment, of course, is the constant chatter, particularly on the other side of the Capitol, about Social Security, surpluses, and taxes. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-hollings-sc-14-19980722</DOCNO>

Mr. HOLLINGS. These are the updated figures: 
In 1998, the trust fund surplus is $105 billion in Social Security; in 1999, $117 billion; in the year 2000, $126 billion; in the year 2001, $130 billion; in 2002, $138 billion; in the year 2003, $146 billion; in the year 2004, $154 billion; in 2005, $165 billion; in 2006, $173 billion; in 2007, $181 billion; and in 2008, $186 billion. 
So what you see in the projection here with respect to so-called surpluses that are now being quoted by the President, distinguished Members of the House of Representatives, distinguished Members of this particular body, on page 11 of the Congressional Budget Office report, you will find that what we actually are spending over the 10 years in order to get down to a deficit in the year 2008--they finally reduce the deficit down according to these magnificent projections over a 10-year period--the deficit is down to $1 billion by using $1.621 trillion of Social Security trust funds. 
Last evening--let me compliment the distinguished Senator from Minnesota--Mr. Grams talked at length about the various countries and how they approach the Social Security problem. He referred in several instances to the Social Security problem--this is just late last evening--to the `looming crisis,' the `coming crisis,' the `fiscal crisis.' And most of what he says, by the way, I agree with, but there is no real crisis in Social Security if we only stop spending the money. 
The problem is that the politicians, both Republican and Democrat, see the Social Security trust fund as a cookie jar they can stick their hands in to get their favorite programs. Look here, they think, I can get my children's program; oh, no, I get my marriage penalty tax reform; I get the corporate taxes here; I get the estate taxes over here; I get another capital gains tax there; oh, no, I want to spend it for Medicare. This is just the biggest scandal I have ever seen, because that crowd up there in the gallery--namely, the media--will not report the truth. 
I hope they look right at the Congressional Budget Office report from the 15th of this month, just a week ago. These are the supposedly nonpartisan figures. On page 11 you will see that the deficit goes up, in 1998, to $105 billion; and then, in 1999, to $119 billion; in the year 2000, $127 billion; and the year 2001, $124 billion. 
I remember back in 1993, when we on this side of the aisle passed the Budget Act, the Republicans claimed that if we passed that particular 1993 budget plan, the economy would go into a nose dive; there would be a depression. My friend on the Republican side of the aisle, the chairman of the Finance subcommittee, Senator Packwood of Oregon, said he would give us his house if this thing worked. Our distinguished friend in the House, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Congressman John Kasich, said he would change parties and become a Democrat if that thing worked. 
It has worked. It has worked, Mr. President, until now. That is why I, the Senator from Wisconsin, and other Senators here wanted to be heard on this. Because what is really occurring is, everybody is dealing out the Social Security trust fund to various programs in an illegal fashion--certainly in an immoral fashion. They are running around telling everybody, you can count on Social Security, except for the baby boomers. It is not the baby boomers in the next generation, it is the Members of Congress on the Senate floor and on the floor of the House. We, willy-nilly, are savaging, ravaging, looting Social Security. And there is not any question that the law disallows this.

Mr. HOLLINGS. The majority of the members of this commission--I am just paraphrasing--stated that the Social Security trust funds should be removed from the unified budget. You will see that in report there. 
When they submitted the Greenspan report, the Commission said to remove Social Security from the unified budget. I struggled, as a member of the Budget Committee, for almost 7 years to get it done. But I kept moving. I kept trying different ways. I tried on Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and that particular budget approach. But in the summer of 1990--that is why I can remember November 5--before the Budget Committee, by a vote of 20 to 1, we removed it from the unified budget. We got it on the floor of the Senate in October, and 98 Senators--if any Senator who was here in October is still here, any Senator who was here in October of 1990--they voted just that way, to remove it from the unified budget. 
I will get, later, the vote record and we will put that in the Record. I am not trying to embarrass or account for any Senators, but I am trying to emphasize that this body has pledged time and time again to save Social Security first and to stop looting the fund.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. 
This takes us from President Truman, in 1945, down to President Clinton's 1999 budget and the one we passed in the U.S. Senate. 
You will see when President Bush left town that the actual deficit was $403.6 billion. That was how much we were spending. In 1993, we passed the budget act I mentioned earlier, and we brought the actual deficit down to $349.3 billion. Then, in 1994, to $292.3 billion. In 1995, to $277.3 billion. In 1996, we reduced the deficit down to $260.9 billion. In 1997, to $187.8 billion. In 1998, it is down to $105.3 billion. You can see in 6 years, we have gone down, down, down, down. 
The Congress and the President should be credited. We have a wonderful economy, the lowest interest rates, lowest unemployment rate, the highest business investment, more home ownership in America, consumer confidence at its highest, stock market going through the roof. We acknowledge that and take credit for it. We participated in it. 
Just when we ought to stay the course and continue to reduce the actual deficit, we have an election coming up in November. Oh, boy, they see that cookie jar, and they are breaking ranks now. They voted for this particular amendment unanimously in the Budget Committee. They might want a second-degree amendment. I just want to get an actual vote, because colleagues on this side want an actual vote so we find out where they all stand. 
I think they can outmaneuver us, there is no question about that, if they don't want to vote. But they can't change this record. We have a situation where instead of reducing the deficit, they want to go back and start to increase deficits, as I related, again and again for each year for 5 years running. 
They are all talking about surpluses as far as the eye can see. Mr. President, the surpluses as far as the eye can see are the Social Security surpluses. These are the moneys that belong, under the law--Greenspan said put it off budget. We put it off budget. We continue to spend the money. I keep raising the points of order, and they just ignore it and go on. 
Right now the word is, `Wait a minute. If we vote for this, you can't get your tax cuts.' Well, come, you can't get your tax cuts, because the only way you can get your tax cuts is to loot the moneys out of Social Security. That is how you get tax cuts. That is how you get all of these programs that increase spending. 
In order to do it, they want to use $105 billion of Social Security in 1998. In order to get the tax cuts, how do they justify that list the distinguished speaker put out? He had capital gains, he had estate tax elimination, he had the marriage penalty, he had tuition tax credits for private education--he just got it all in and said, `Just watch them vote against that, and we'll go after them and say, `Tax-and-spend, tax-and-spend, tax-and-spend.' The truth of the matter is, he is the one increasing taxes, because as you do this, as you loot the Social Security fund, the debt increases, as we see by the CBO record; and as the debt increases, spending for interest goes up. It cannot be avoided. It is going to be spent. That is exactly what is going on. It is fiscal cancer. 
Let me say a word about that. I was on the Grace Commission, Mr. President, and worked with Peter Grace. We were against waste, fraud and abuse. At the very time we put out this magnificent volume, which was 2 inches thick, of our wonderful work of eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, we were creating the biggest waste in the history of Government; namely, deficits and the national debt. We cut revenues, we increased spending, we didn't pay for it, and the debt went up, up, and away. Whereby it was a little less than a trillion dollars when we first started with President Reagan--it was $903 billion at that particular time--it has gone up now with 12 years of Reagan-Bush to over $5 trillion. Of course, it has gradually gone up even though we have been reducing the deficit each year. At this minute, we will spend, if we approve the budget that has been approved in the Senate and what they confirmed over on the House side, over $100 billion more than we take in. 
On April 15, we are supposed to complete the budget work. I have been on the Budget Committee since we instituted it. Modestly, I say I used to be the chairman, and we did reduce spending at one time. Now it is July, and we haven't even had a conference. They appointed everybody in the conference committee from both budget groups, but they can't confirm because they can't face up to each other and say, `Wait a minute. Somebody is going to tell the secret that the only way there are any surpluses around here is the budget trust fund surplus that we have to loot in order to get all of these tax cuts, children's programs, Medicare costs,' and everything else of that kind. The media doesn't even report it. It is a scandal. 
There it is. We started the biggest waste at that particular time. You have to understand why this is given sanction even in the business community. I have argued with Alan Greenspan about this one. He loves the unified budget. That business crowd doesn't want the sharp elbows of Government crowding in to the bond market running up interest costs, running up inflation. They don't serve in public office. They don't have to face the statutes, laws and policies that we enact as Members of the Congress. They say, `Oh, it will be taken care sooner or later.' They go ahead with the unified budget pointing, if you please, Mr. President, to the difference between the corporate economy and the country's economy. 
The corporate economy, of course, is higher profits. The country's economy is for the good of society. And they don't necessarily meld. Or it is good for the corporate economy for NAFTA to go like gangbusters down in Mexico. That is where General Motors is headed with that strike. Actually, Honda exports more cars than General Motors this minute in the United States of America. We are going out of business. 
I have lost 24,000 textile and apparel jobs since NAFTA. Those are good jobs. It is an industry that under President Kennedy we found out is necessary to the national security. After steel, it was the second most important. It was a finding in the sense you couldn't send the soldiers to war in a Japanese uniform. You had to have clothing. 
Seventy-five percent of the clothing within the view of us in the U.S. Senate is imported. We are at the water's edge of whether or not we are going to have that industry. 
The other industry is going down, because in the corporate culture, if you can save--it is shown that you can save a good 20 percent of your labor costs, 20 percent of volume, by moving to a low-wage, offshore country. 
So if you have $500 million in sales, you can move offshore. Just keep your corporate office, your sales folks, but move your manufacturing offshore and you make $100 million. Or you can continue to stay here and work your own employees--they call them associates now--and go broke because your competition is gone. The multinationals could care less. They are in the business of making money. We are in the business of making a good and strong economy. 
And America's strength is like a three-legged stool. You have on the one leg your values. That is strong. We sacrificed to go to Somalia. We are now out in Bosnia. No one questions the values of the United States of America. We have the second leg, of course, which is the military. That is strong. But the third leg, the economic leg, is fractured, and intentionally. 
That is the corporate culture, corporate economy--move on down to Mexico. And they promised at the time, of course, that we were going to increase the balance of trade that we had of $5 billion. Now it is $15 billion negative. They said we are going to create 200,000 jobs. We lost 400,000. They said it was going to solve the immigration problem. It has gotten worse. They said it was going to solve the drug problem. It has gotten worse. The actual Mexican worker is taking home 20 percent less pay. So they have suffered. 
The $12 billion that we paid in there to keep it from going totally under has gone back to Wall Street. It should have gone into a common market approach where we could have developed in Mexico--and I would vote for it this afternoon--the institutions of a free economy, a revered judiciary, the right of labor to strike, the corporate interests of owning property, the right of appeal, and those kinds of things. 
Over in Europe, the European countries in the common market approach taxed themselves for 4 years, $5 billion before they allowed Greece and Portugal. 
So what happens? We use the free market approach, which is good for the corporate economy, but not the country's economy. And therein is where we are really headed with the fiscal cancer that is eating us alive here, because you have $1 billion a day. We are going to meet tomorrow, and we are going to spend another $1 billion for nothing. We are going to meet on Friday, and we are going to spend another billion in this Nation's Capital for nothing. We can meet on Saturday, and we are going to spend another $1 billion for nothing. We can meet on Sunday, and we are going to spend, like it or not, another $1 billion for nothing--total waste. 
Here we were trying to stop waste, fraud, and abuse, yet under the Grace Commission we instituted the biggest waste. I thought finally--finally--we had gotten on it. We not only were bringing down the deficit, but in his message to the Congress, the President of the United States said, `Save Social Security first.' And every Congressman and every Senator said, `Amen, brother. That's what we want to do.' Everybody went off the floor and had their little interviews. `We've got to save Social Security.' 
So we go into the Budget Committee, and we get a vote and unanimously vote for it. But now conferences are ongoing with respect to the parliamentary maneuvers to make sure that you do not vote. They can have a second-degree amendment. We will come back later on with other bills. We will have our chance. Oh, we will just nag them and never get to a vote, but we will point it out from now until October: `Save Social Security first.' 
There is no surplus. This country has fiscal cancer. If you keep spending up, up and away, interest costs on the national debt will mount, with the debt increasing each year for 10 years running. These are not surpluses as far as the eye can see, but rather deficits as far as the eye can see. 
And this particular report of the Congressional Budget Office--if that is the case, Mr. President, you can see at a glance that Congresses that are going to be meeting in the next century--for the millennium and for the next century--we will meet, we will put a little bit in Social Security, we will put a little bit in defense, and a big bit in interest costs on the national debt, and we will not have any Government. 
Now, judging by their Contract with America, that is what they want: to abolish the Department of Education, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Energy, the Department of Housing, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Just get rid of highways--they do not even want the highway system. They objected around here and said it busted the budget when we used highway moneys for highways. Very interesting. 
We passed a highway bill, and all we used was the gas taxes for highways. But, oh, no, they wanted to rob the highway fund for foreign aid or any other particular project that they had in mind. 
Because of the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, we changed that. I commend him for doing it. We finally agreed that after this year we are going to spend highway gas taxes, highway money on highways. Boy, I am telling you, just to get something normal, decent and understandable here in the U.S. Congress is next to impossible. 
But there it is. We have a resolution that says, `Save Social Security first.' Now, they can get into parliamentary maneuvers. I guess one thing is: Move to commit the bill, like they did earlier. They can do another one to commit the bill with instructions and hide behind it. 
But I can tell you, whatever the maneuver is, the issue is clear; it is almost undebatable. I want them to say, `I am wrong on the figures I have given.' I want them to say the CBO is wrong on the figures or whatever. I want them to get up here and debate it and say, `No. It is necessary to spend the Social Security trust fund.' That is all I want to hear them say. But I do not believe you are going to hear a Senator in the Senate say that. They all are going to hide behind the maneuvering here and second degrees and third degrees, and move to recommit, and everything else possible; and we will get a rollcall on that. And that will be the call on whether or not you want to continue to loot Social Security. 
I know my distinguished friend from New Hampshire does not want to do it. There is Senator Feingold there. Under the unanimous consent, of course, we agreed that the distinguished leader of this particular bill, our chairman, is to regain the floor, but I hope the other Senators here who, of course, are cosponsoring--and I put this up so we can actually get a vote on a sense of the Senate. 
And don't tell me that this is not relevant to State-Justice-Commerce. It is relevant to the fiscal state of the United States. I can tell you that now. We do have fiscal cancer. The media is not paying any attention to it. They are all hiding under the unified, unified, unified. It is against the law. I have given you the law. It is against policies. It is against the vote of the Budget Committee. 
But there is a quiet discussion. I listened on the weekend shows, and again and again they were talking about surpluses here, surpluses there, including, of course, the Administrator here of the Congressional Budget Office. If we have that report--I would like to refer just one second to that particular report so you can see even she disobeys the law. You cannot get even the Congressional Budget Office--the conclusion, on page 13:  
An unexpected increase in revenues in 1998 has virtually ensured the total Federal budget will be balanced for the first time in almost 30 years. 
False, according to her own records, her own figures. 
The previous pages showed that is not the case. On page 11, all she has to do is read her own document. 
An unexpected increase in revenues in 1998 has virtually ensured that the total Federal budget will be balanced for the first time in almost 30 years and nothing currently visible on the horizon seems to threaten a return to deficits in the near term if policies remain unchanged. 
I know I wouldn't use her to do my income tax return. I would be in jail, I would be gone, with that kind of doubletalk. 
There is no surplus. But when the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Madam June O'Neill, comes and says there is nothing on the horizon, when she shows that in order to say that you have to spend $1.621 trillion of the Social Security trust fund, Social Security by the year 2008, supposedly, if this weren't occurring, would have a surplus of $2.252 trillion. 
Look at that, on page 11 of this particular report--$2.252 trillion. Yet everybody is going around with solutions to Social Security. The only solution, and the first solution, is to quit looting the fund. There won't be any $2.252 trillion. That is why you have all of the bills in to solve the Social Security crisis, the Social Security shortfall, the baby boomer problem. All nonsense, all out of the whole cloth. 
She is talking again and again, `However, if any other number of assumptions that CBO has made turn out to be off the mark, budget outcomes could be quite different than projected, even if there are no changes in policy. For instance, if CBO's economic projections prove to be just a little too optimistic, surpluses could be much lower than anticipated.' 
Surpluses--there isn't any surplus in the report. There is a surplus, supposedly, in Social Security. That is where the surplus is. Section 13301 of the Budget Act says don't spend Social Security surpluses, don't count on them in reporting a budget; don't count on them, Congressional Budget Office, when you analyze a budget. But she willy-nilly talks about surpluses. It is just amazing to me, until you see her projections, of course, of the interest costs. 
Again, on page 11, she finds that interest costs on the national debt are just going down, down, down. It has been increasing each year anywhere from $10 to $20 billion. The debt has been going up. The interest costs--even with that increased debt, even though interest rates are down, the interest costs have been going up. 
If you want to see the pressure brought by the Speaker on the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, look at that series of figures straight across the board. She finds that from 1958 to the year 2008 the actual interest costs decrease $11 billion. 
Totally out of the whole cloth, this is made. They kept nagging her and they held up the Budget Committees. The Budget Committees don't meet; they don't sit down and confer over the budget. They go on the weekend talk shows and put out all the documents about tax cuts, spending programs, and put in here these optimistic figures. 
The Director of the Congressional Budget Office has responded to the pressure of the Speaker of the House; there isn't any question in this Senator's mind. We know what is going on. 
I wish the media--whether print media, TV media, or any other media--would please, please, please, report truth in budgeting. That is what we had when we had Gramm-Rudman-Hollings--truth in budgeting. We sold it over on this side of the aisle, 14 votes up and down. Our Democratic colleagues, majority, voted to cut spending over the objection, at that time, of the leader, over the objection of the chairman of the Budget Committee. But there was a conscience back in 1985. 
Now, in 1998, it has become the game of the day: Just look over and find whatever you want in the $100-some billion Social Security surplus, and it grows each year. It is only $105 billion this year; 10 years out, it is $186 billion. So we have plenty of money to spend for plenty of programs until we run right up against the wall, run right up against the wall, and the interest costs eat us alive. We have fiscal cancer. We won't acknowledge it. 
I am glad and proud, on behalf of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, to bring up this sense of the Senate. It is more important than the entire State-Justice-Commerce bill or any appropriations bill. Unless we get ahold of our senses and vote a sense of the Senate that we save Social Security first, we are gone.

Mr. HOLLINGS. It is absolutely the case. The only place you can find this kind of money for tax cuts is here in the Social Security trust fund, which is a violation in and of itself of section 13301 of the statutory laws of the Budget Act of the United States of America. President Bush signed it, 98 Senators over here voted for it, almost unanimous over in the House of Representatives. We voted for it. But it is not hit-and-run driving. Let's stop right there. 
Let me emphasize, in 1994 we were really distraught with respect to the takeover artists. Individuals were coming in, the corporations, and literally taking the pension funds, paying off the corporate debt, and taking the remaining money and running. The employees were left high and dry. So we passed the Pension Reform Act of 1994. 
Now, our good friend, the former pitcher up there from Detroit, Denny McLain, became the head of a corporation. As the head of the corporation, last year he had paid off the company debt with the pension fund. That was made a felony. He got an 8-year jail term. If you can find what jail he is in, tell him, next time, instead of running a corporation, run for the U.S. Senate; instead of a jail term, you get the good government award up here for looting the pension funds to pay your debt. 
That is exactly what we are doing. We go against the formal law that we passed ourselves. We go again the policy set for corporate America. But when it comes to us, we have to get reelected. The worst campaign finance violation and abuse is using Social Security trust funds to reelect ourselves, telling them we are trying to protect Social Security.

Denny McLain, who was an all-star pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, got sentenced to 8 years for using the pension fund to pay off the company debt, in violation of our law, the Pension Reform Act of 1994. Yet, we do it here in violation of our own law and policy of 1994 for corporate America. Fine and dandy. I would tell him to, next time, run for the Senate, and instead of a jail term he will get the good government award.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me tell you why you miss the point and how you danced around it. Now, here is the difference. It says, `The CBO has estimated'--this is the Domenici-Lott resolution; sense of the Senate--`The CBO has estimated that the unified budget surplus will reach nearly $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.' Absolutely false and in violation of section 13301, Madam President. 
Without reading the whole thing--`Exclusion of Social Security from all budgets.' 
Now, how do you get $1.5 trillion without using $1.621 trillion, $1.621 trillion of Social Security money? That is the first mislead here. They first say that they are not going to use Social Security, but then they talk about a budget surplus. And the only way they can really mislead and continue the fraud and continue the campaign finance fund for all of us politicians to get reelected is to talk about tax cuts and surpluses when there are not any. There are not any, Madam President--absolutely none. But they use $1.621 trillion in order to get to the $1.5 trillion.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Now, we find out with this, Social Security is only one-half of the problem. The truth of the matter is that this year we will owe--these are CBO figures--$732 billion. We will owe Medicare, $113 billion; and the hospital and SMI, $34 billion; military retirement, $133 billion; a deficit in civilian retirement of $460 billion; a deficit in the unemployment compensation of $72 billion; a deficit in the highway trust fund of $23 billion; a deficit in the airport trust fund of $10 billion; a deficit in the railroad retirement trust fund of $20 billion; and others, like Federal Financing Bank of $55 billion. 
I only limited it to 1 year, trying to get their attention to what is going on this particular year. We can extend it out. There is no difference there. But don't go along with this continued fraud. Don't go along with this continued trickery. There is $1.652 trillion overall. Social Security is less than half; almost $1 trillion from the military retirement and civilian retirees and unemployment fund. 
So the Government, us politicians, have been running around and gabbing about everyone. I thought I could get the seniors to pay attention to Social Security, but they are only paying attention to Medicare and Medicaid. I have been trying my best to get them in that particular movement. The military retirees don't understand it, and civilian retirees don't understand it at all. 
So what is really wrong is not only that CBO has estimated the unified budget surplus will reach nearly $1.5 trillion when there is no surplus, they act like they are trying to give dignity and credibility to unified budgets. There is no surplus. Look on page 11 of the CBO report, and for the next 10 years there is listed a deficit, gross deficit. It is listed there in the column like I emphasized--otherwise, returning all remaining surpluses. 
At this point, tell me, where is a surplus in the Government accounts? None--N-O-N-E. In fact, deficits--they mislead and say once we make a plan for Social Security, we can continue to spend the Medicare trust funds, the military retirement, the civilian retirement, the unemployment, the railroad retirement, the highway trust fund, the Federal Financing Bank. All of these are deficits--not surpluses. 
So they say I hope we can get together and fuzz it all up, and there is really no difference here. This is a cancer, I emphasize again, a fiscal cancer because unless and until it shows instead of surpluses over the next 5 years--and that is what we are talking about, this year's deficit, $557 billion spent more than we take in. Deficits, deficits, deficits--not surpluses. And we add that to the national debt, the interest costs go up. According to June O'Neill, it doesn't, but I can tell you right now it will go up. 
You can see Mr. Greenspan hedging his bet right now. When we do that, we will go back to the interest rates we had 10 years ago, and we are going to be eaten alive. So we have fiscal cancer. Nobody wants to talk about it, and we want to come up on the floor of the U.S. Senate with this nebulous language `return all remaining surpluses to the American taxpayer.' If you have them, Brother Hollings would be for that. But I don't want to mislead the American public. I haven't been nearly 50 years in public office to come here with this kind of fraud and doubletalk to the American people. There are no surpluses. I challenge them to point out the surplus in the highway fund, point out the surplus in Medicare, point out the surplus in military retirement, point out the surplus in civilian retirees, in unemployment, railroad retirement, Federal Financing Bank, all of the rest of them. 
All of them are in deficit. That is why the debt has gone through the ceiling, and that is why we are increasing spending faster than we can cut it. It is $1 billion a day we are increasing spending on the interest costs on the national debt. Who in his right mind is going to cut spending $365 billion? That is our problem. The best way to ignore it is to put it under the rug, come in here and `return all remaining surpluses.' They still 
want to use that language to give in to Speaker Gingrich over on the House side; that is what they are trying to do. 
That is why we are raising this all-important point right now. If I can get their attention, just this 1 year we will have accomplished our intent here. I retain the balance of our time.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, let me go right to the point made by the distinguished Senator from Texas. He said, `We believe the tax burden is too high.' We all agree on that. But what is increasing that tax burden rather than decreasing it is this profligate spending, increasing the deficit, and increasing the debt. 
If you look on page 11 of the Congressional Budget Office report, you find out that we increase spending over what we bring in for the next 10 years, and there is nothing but deficits. There are not any surpluses. There are not any surpluses. 
Go right to the point of, yes, the President did submit a budget, and he increased spending $70 billion. You look on page 10 where the total went up to $1.721 trillion. The budget that passed the Senate with the vote of the distinguished Senator from Texas increased spending $70 billion. The President is guilty. The Congress is guilty. 
This Senator tried a budget freeze. We had a vote on it last year, tried it again in the Budget Committee, and couldn't get any support. They call it the `Fritz freeze.' 
But the whole point is, return all moneys or surpluses to the taxpayers. Common sense would indicate that there must be some surpluses after Social Security.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, these are all deficits. I have asked the other side that sponsors this resolution to, for heaven's sake, show that dumb Senator from South Carolina where the surplus is. Show me the surplus, and I will hush and vote for your resolution. But you can't show me a surplus. 
There is nothing but deficits in these reports. And mislead the public so that we can use Social Security as a slush fund to reelect ourselves--that is what we are doing. It is the greatest campaign finance abuse that I know of to continually have the word `surplus' come out of the mouth of that side of the aisle. There ought to be ashes in their mouths. They oppose--in fact, still are. 
Down in South Carolina, I have a young Republican colleague running around hollering `the biggest tax increase in history.' Of course, we know it was under President Reagan and Senator Dole. That has been analyzed in every newspaper. But I plead guilty, I voted for that tax increase. It is not the biggest. 
What happened was, we cut spending $250 billion. Yes, we increased taxes $250 billion. We downsized the Government by over 300,000 Federal employees. That is what has the economy good--lowest unemployment, lowest inflation rate, biggest business investment, stock market through the ceiling, more home ownership, more young children getting help in receiving health care. We are in good shape. 
If we can't talk the truth to each other now about where we stand fiscally, we never will. This is one grand fraud. That is what has occurred. 
For those who fought us on down the line, instead of $250 billion--yes, the revenues went up. 
Where is the amendment that says do away with the Social Security increase that we put in that they are now blaming me for? Where is the amendment that says we reduce the gas tax increase that they are blaming me for? I go home and they are blaming me. Yet, they want to come up here and holler, `Oh, the economy is so good; man, we got surpluses everywhere; now what is in order is, let's all now have a bunch of tax cuts.' 
I want to expose that fraud. Don't go along with this Republic resolution to fuzz it, using the word `surpluses.' As my sister used to say, `Saying it so doesn't make it so.' 
There is no surplus. If they can find one in the Federal Government, God bless them. I will join me. But these are all deficits.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I will give it to my colleague from New Hampshire, and he can get everything, the Congressional Budget Office figures. And the main point to be made, Madam President, is just that. Where you see an actual surplus down here in 1998 that they project of $63 billion, in order to do that they had to use trust funds of $168.3 billion. They used not only Social Security but all the rest. And then where they project for next year an $80 billion surplus, they had to use $199 billion in trust funds from Social Security and the retirement funds. That is how they talk that language. And I am trying to stop the doubletalk and talk sense to the American people. 
I retain the remainder of my time.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I think we can bring this right into focus for everyone. The Senator was reading from page 10 about surplus, and I have already been critical, of course, of the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, because that is using surplus funds, that is using trust funds and moving them. The question would be--just turn the page--on page 11 you have the Federal debt, 2002, $5.927 trillion, and then why, if you have surpluses those years that you are talking about, and return those surpluses to the taxpayers--why is it, in 2003 it increases, in 2004, in 2005, in 2006, in 2007, 2008--why does the debt go up, if you have surpluses?

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, 2004-2008, you use the year 2004, $154 billion of Social Security moneys to make it a slush fund; 2005, $166 billion; 2006, $173 billion; 2007, $181 billion; 2008, $187 billion. 
That is how you use the word `surplus.'

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, assuming the Senator was correct, the reason you don't walk away, if you can possibly ever quit using Social Security as a slush fund, is the almost $1 trillion--that is why I put this chart in--from Medicare. We are still using Medicare. There is a surplus in Medicare right now. We have debated that. But we are using that to balance the budget. Military retirement, civilian retirement, unemployment, highway, airport moneys, railroad retirement, the other funds there, Federal Financing Bank and others--it is $1 trillion worth of other moneys. 
If we could ever stop using those, which are deficits, and make them balance, just in the black instead of in the red, then I would go along with all the tax cuts. I want to go along with the tax cuts anyway. I voted to save the tax increase on guns just yesterday. I voted to cut the other so-called penalty, marriage penalty, on another item. I don't mind cutting taxes. But, overall, let's not act like we have money to spend when we are going broke, and that causes the debt to increase, which causes the interest costs to increase, which causes the waste to increase. 
They act like, `We can play the game and we will get to it later.' That is what is really hurting us, the $1-billion-a-day interest costs on the national debt for absolutely nothing. 
I reserve the remainder of our time.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am still nonplused as to the particular content of those Executive orders. I say nonplused. I know the President, and if there is one group he really yields to, it is local and State governments, having been a Governor, having come to office as a new, whatever they call this thing--leadership, Democrat, or whatever else. He hadn't been necessarily on the side of the Federal Government but on the side of State and local governments. 
I understand the misgivings of the Senator from Tennessee, and I understand what he said, that the Governors have asked and yet, apparently, the White House has declined. That is why I am nonplused, because I would like to know a little bit more about it, and I am checking right now those Executive orders and with members of our Governmental Affairs Committee, which does have jurisdiction on this particular matter. 
In short, in other words, Executive Order 12612 and Executive Order 12875, the Senator from Tennessee says they change a basic presumption from federalism--local and State levels to be employed and approached, before we take over at the Federal level--with which I agree. I happen to think that the President agrees, too. That is why I want a little time to check this out.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on this particular amendment, I talked previously with the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin. I thought it was in conformance with the actions of the committee with respect to the cable rates. When we passed the 1996 Telecommunications Act, we mandated that cable rates would not increase, under that particular act, until March of 1999. Thereafter, of course, rates did increase in accordance with the 1992 act. 
The 1992 act allowed increases with respect to additional channels and additional services and costs incurred in expanding and in competing. That, generally speaking, is as I understood it with the cable companies. Because we have had complaints I, myself, looked at it earlier this year. The FCC has been monitoring it. We discussed this with Chairman Kennard and the other Commissioners as they came on in their confirmation hearings. They have been monitoring it. 
As I understand, the distinguished chairman of our Commerce Committee, Senator McCain of Arizona, is headed to the floor. Because I have been engaged in other matters, I didn't even realize we had a hearing scheduled for Tuesday of next week on this same thing, to hear from the Commissioners on what has occurred. So I would not favor this particular resolution. It is not just a matter of 30 days, it sort of preempts the committee in its action with respect to listening to the Commission and finding out. 
I know, good and well, we are all familiar with the 1996 Telecommunications Act provision against increase in rates through March of 1999. Of course, then we relate back in all of these percentages. It sounds, in the resolution of the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin itself, that all you need to do is look at the percentages and they are in excess of the inflation rate and everything else. The inflation rate is not the question. It is the question of the services, the channels, and the programming itself, and the costs of expanding and competing. 
I think perhaps this would have a disruptive effect on that particular trend at this time. The committee has yet to have heard from the Commission itself and from those engaged in this particular business. 
So I just comment that the chairman of the committee and the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Burns of Montana, are on their way, as I understand it, to the floor. I didn't want to just waste this time and let it go past on the premise: Wait a minute, in 30 days---- 
Incidentally, the Federal Communications Commission is just like a tenth-round boxer. They have more mergers, more rulings, and everything else like that, trying to implement all the petitions that they have before them. You could not find fault if they could not find out in 30 days, 60 days, or 90 days. 
So I do not think this is well taken, with respect to what the Congress has asked the FCC to do. They have had one backup of time, trying to make findings here, after their particular investigations. Mind you me, if there are 60,000 lawyers registered to practice in the District of Columbia, 59,000 are communications lawyers. They have more appeals and petitions and reviews and everything else of that kind. So the work at the FCC is not necessarily the most prompt, or what we would wish to have, but it has to be understood. The committee itself is working. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I think the distinguished chairman has stated it extremely well. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Subcommittee Chairman and colleague, Senator Gregg, in presenting to the Senate S. 2260, the Fiscal Year 1999 Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and related agencies appropriations bill. Once again, I would like to commend Chairman Gregg for his outstanding efforts and bipartisan approach in bringing to the floor a bill that--given the number of priorities we have been asked to address within our limited 302(b) allocations--is good and balanced. 
In the Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill, we fund a wide variety of Federal programs. We fund the FBI, the DEA, the State Department and our embassies overseas, fisheries research, the National Weather Service and weather satellites, the Supreme Court, the Federal Communications Commission, and the list goes on and on. In total, this bill provides $33.2 billion in budget authority which is a little over a billion above last year's appropriated levels and a little over a billion below the President's request. The bill is right at our section 302(b) allocation. 
Chairman Gregg has touched on many of the funding specifics in this bill, so I will not repeat the details; however, I would like to point out to our colleagues some of the highlights of this bill:

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, what really occurs is we are back now--the leadership says after 10 years--really after 20 years. And much has occurred during that 20-year period. Practically all of the States have faced up--the State of Oklahoma, the State of South Carolina have all enacted product liability reform. It is not a particular problem. The small businesses, for example, are enjoying the best of investment, the best of new initiatives in small business. 
The small business folks, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, are really quoted as saying here that--and I quote an economist for the NFIB--`Far from worrying that the expansion has just about played itself out, more and more small-business owners feel that the best is yet to come.' So the small businesses really are not having any problem. 
The idea of the litigation explosion has been answered, that you could not get insurance to get insurance. Foreign competition--the foreign companies are flowing into America without any problem of product liability. So now they try to say it is the small business thing. And, of course, the small businesses say the best is yet to come and they are having one of the finest clips that they have ever had. So they are not having problems. 
We searched Lexis-Nexis to find where these egregious verdicts are that this particular measure would take care of. They are nonexistent. So we looked at the bill itself. And you find out really what is a politically rigged instrument to take care of the political needs, not the business needs, of America, whereby you take a poll and kill all the lawyers. And we have been into that. 
The lawyers have become unpopular until everybody needs one. And the best of the best lawyers, who have been bringing these cases and succeeding and everything else, are to be sidelined in this drive by big business, all under the cover of small business. 
The bill itself, Mr. President, is an atrocity. I say that because now the plea, in the preamble of the Rockefeller-Gorton measure, is uniformity. And they start off immediately saying, with punitive damages, those States who regulate the punitive damages or control them are not applied to by this particular measure; but those States that have it, this bill would apply. So there is no uniformity on the very face or attempt to get uniformity itself. It is not just for small businesses. That is for all businesses, large and small, relative to the matter of uniformity and relative, of course, to the matter of small businesses itself. 
But we come, Mr. President, with the phone ringing all during the weekend and last night with respect to the sellers being exempted under this bill. They know what they are doing. There are dozens and dozens of cases up in New York to the effect that the sellers--only one--the hospital, where they have incurred AIDS, hemophiliacs have incurred AIDS, through tainted blood transfusions or otherwise. And obviously they cannot find out the individual, but you know it is applied by the hospital. You want to get the safety practice by the hospital or the seller. Now, this vitiates dozens and dozens of cases over the country, and particularly in the New York area. 
Again, with respect to asbestos cases, they know exactly what they are writing. They are saying, with respect to toxic materials, that, of course, this does not apply to toxic materials, that the asbestos is exempted from the 18-year statute imposed because the reference is to the exclusion of toxic harm. But, of course, asbestos is not toxic in the eyes of the Owens Corning counsel. He announced asbestos is not toxic, so they get rid of that group of cases. 
Otherwise, they really come with the statute of repose, which is the most egregious thing I have ever seen. Here we are trying, in product liability, to protect consumers and individuals, and they say now that they would exempt an injured person from a defective product; but the purchaser or owner of that particular product for whom the injured person is working, he or she or it can sue that manufacturer. So the rights of businesses are protected to the detriment of injured consumers in America. The unmitigated gall of including that particular provision in this bill, talking about product liability is just unheard of. 
But in any event, the lower-income worker, the matter of the punitive damages of $250,000 or less--you can well see that lower-income worker from McDonald's who is making $15,000 or $17,000 a year--double the economic injury; namely, double that salary loss of $34,000 for a Dalkon Shield user, that we have the Dow Chemical implant on the front page, the settlement, this morning, $3.2 billion. But under the Dalkon Shield here, that particular individual----

Mr. President, what I was trying to emphasize was the particular so-called compromise. I know the plea is, wait a minute here, we have been trying and trying and trying and trying, and of course as long as Victor Schwartz and that crowd is paid, they will continue to try. 
But the fact of the matter is, there is no need. The States object to this particular mode. The Republican contract objects to this particular thing. They are trying to put and retain things back at the States when it comes to crime. They want the particular States to take care of it. When it comes to education, they want to do away with the Department, let the States handle it. They want to do everything else, except when you get with all the lawyers and, namely, the injured parties in America, which are bringing this magnificent safety record.

<TEXT>
Mr. HOLLINGS. Reading one line: 
The ABA believes that improvements in the tort liability system should continue to be implemented at the state level and not be preempted by broad federal law. 
So, they are talking about the compromise, and after all this give and take, and it is not quite an orderly bill, but those things that occur in time are compromises--not to mitigate against uniformity in the name of uniformity where they apply punitive damages to one group of States and not to the other group of States, not in the name of small business when they apply to big business where they were sneaked in--oh, no, we will have cloture; you can't offer any amendments. We are steamrolling this thing. Here we go. We are going to have a little handwritten amendment, by the majority leader, sneaked in at the last minute. 
We saw this occur with the tobacco bill where they sneaked in an amendment that had been before the Agriculture Committee, the Lugar bill, that never was reported out of the Agriculture Committee, but they sneaked that in. Now they want to sneak in an amendment not just to take care of small business but large business. I refer to this morning's headline of the New York Times: `Don't Amend This Bill, Lott Says,' and then proceeds to weigh in. 
So you have a little handwritten amendment here that the majority leader sneaked in--he can really take and amend his own bill, but this is a compromise worked out with the White House. This is a conspiracy in the U.S. Senate. I am not part of that conspiracy. I am for the consumers. I am for safety in America. I can tell you here and now, this is the most egregious conduct I have ever seen. 
Finally, with respect to the poor stay-at-home moms, because I see my distinguished colleague from Texas, who has got everyone sitting around the kitchen table time and, again, and stay-at-home moms. So the stay-at-home mom can get at the most, $250,000 or double, or less than that, whatever is less. I don't know what she gets when she stays at home and doesn't have any economic damage. 
Or take the employee at McDonald's, a young woman who gets $15,000 or $17,000 a year working away, just married, taking the Dalkon Shield, totally injured, can't reproduce, her life is ruined. Oh, we are going to be liberal here. We will protect the small business and not the injured party and go right to the heart of the matter and give her twice her economic damage, twice $17,000, or $34,000, and the companies will write that off in a flash. We know it. You know it and I know it. It will just be a cost of doing business. And safety in America is really downgraded. 
We have the most interesting safe operating businesses in the country as a result of this product liability. 
There is not an explosion, Mr. President. All the reports before the committee say, wait a minute, there has been an explosion in business suing business--Pennzoil suing Texaco in Texas for a verdict of $12 billion. But, no, that is the consummate verdicts of all the product liability cases put together. There are businesses suing businesses all over. That is fine business. But when the poor injured party comes, and on a contingent basis finds a lawyer willing to take her case, do the investigating, do the trial, appeal work, and win a percentage if successful, oh, that is terrible for the economy in America; it is terrible for international competition. 
Mr. President, in this global economy American firms contend at home and abroad against competitive foreign firms which operate in America. We have over 100 German plants, and over 50 Japanese plants. We have the BMWs, the Fuji Films, the Hoffman-Laroches--all these industries are coming to South Carolina, and not one is saying anything about product liability. They like what the States are doing, but we find a political problem because we have a representative downtown who is retained to get to the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the conference board, and now the National Federation of Independent Business, saying this is just a small business. Oh, boy, it is not for large injury, I can tell you that. It is not for large injury. It is not for the consumer, Mr. President. The whole setup here is ramroded through. I can personally, just in my handwriting, sneak a little amendment on at the desk, but the rest of us can't because we have cloture. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Indiana and the distinguished Senator from Texas raised the question of the sub-Sahara bill. I had heard the expression that `trade,' says the Senator from Texas, `makes people equal,' and then went on, of course, to say that the sub-Sahara bill should not be blocked by `greedy special interests'; they shouldn't prevent the passage of the bill; `special interests,' namely, of course, the textile industry. 
What happens, in all candor, is almost like the Community Chest and the United Fund, `giving at the office,' doing your fair share. 
This started way, way back in the 1950s. This particular Senator appeared as Governor back before the International Tariff Commission at the time that Tom Dewey represented the Japanese industry, and chased me around the hearing at that particular time whereby we were concerned that 10 percent of the consumption of textiles and apparels in America was represented by imports. And they had a provision in law under the national security section that you had to find before a President could take action, that there be a finding that the particular product was important to our national security. 
President Kennedy, when he took office, appointed his Secretaries of State, Labor, Commerce, Defense, and Treasury--Secretary Dillon, at that particular time, Secretary Goldberg, Secretary Dean Rusk, Secretary Hodges, and then, of course, Secretary Freeman from Labor. And we presented the witnesses. The findings were that next to steel textiles was the second most important to national security; that we couldn't send them to war in a Japanese uniform. 
Since that time, of course, there have been various initiatives whereby we have given more than `at the office.' We have given more than our `fair share,' so that in the limited time let me categorically state that two-thirds of the clothing in this Chamber this minute is imported. We gradually are going out of business, and more particularly, since NAFTA, have gone out of business. 
What happens in my State, so as to understand, is that we have lost 24,000 textile and apparel jobs since the enactment of NAFTA in the State of South Carolina. We actually had 1 million apparel workers over the country when President Clinton came in, and we are down now to 781,000 in 1998. We have lost 219,000. 
Rather than being `greedy,' Mr. President--that is what I really want to correct--the textile industry is geared up competitively. 
You ought to go into one. Incidentally, calling them `greedy,' I have been through, I think, 13 of the Milliken plants. There is no bigger Republican than Roger Milliken. So you don't want to go around saying `greedy' Republican interests. Let's get away from that connotation, because the truth of the matter is you will find no more competitive industry than Milliken Textiles. They have won the Baldrige Award. They have set the pace for modernization, computerization, mechanization, and otherwise, electronically controlled. You ought to visit those people. They have cut back and downsized, and are extremely competitive, with the industry itself investing over $2 billion a year each year for the past 10 years, and trying to stay competitive and exist as an industry--not `greedy' at all. 
But what really happens is that these jobs are extremely important to our economy. They average around $7 to $10. It is up to $10 now. 
I am showing you a headline of Thursday, July 9, on breaking news in South Carolina.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair. 
`South Carolina's factory workers lowest paid in SoutheastEconomic Grade.' 
So, on the one hand, we are `greedy,' because we are not giving our jobs to the Sub Sahara Africa bill. And, on the other hand, we are low paying and slovenly because we are not paying them enough as the industry and labor sees it. 
So the textile manufacturers are caught between a rock and a hard place. There is no question that they are just as competitive as all that get out. 
But Washington should sober up from this global competition singsong. Specifically, let's go to Oneita, a manufacturing plant in Andrews, SC, that made T-shirts. They had 487 workers. They closed down because they went to Mexico because anybody can make a T-shirt. 
What happens, as we politicians say, `Wait a minute.' Before you open Oneita, you have to have clean air, you have to have clean water, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wage, plant-closing notice, parental leave, safe workplace, safe working machinery. All of that goes into the cost of the product. You go down to 58 cents an hour in Mexico and have none of those requirements. So if your competition leaves, you have to leave. So you are losing the jobs. 
So the stance of the textile industry and the concern over the sub-Sahara bill is not `greed;' so-called `trade' makes people equal. Trade makes people unemployed. 
That is what has occurred. We are here to represent the industrial backbone, the manufacturing backbone of this Nation. As Akio Morita said some years back, talking about Third World countries, they have got to develop a strong manufacturing sector in order to become a nation state. And then, looking at me, he said, `Senator, that world power that ceases to have its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.' 
So we have the three-legged stool. On the first leg, the one of values, we are strong; the second leg, the one of military, we are strong; but the third leg over the past 50 years has been fractured economically. It has shortened. And that is the danger to the Nation's economy, and not just to the textile workers of South Carolina. It is a fundamental concern that these excellent jobs and excellent industries receive fair treatment. 
We have done more than our fair share to spread capitalism in the Pacific rim, into Korea and everywhere else, down to Mexico, over into Europe initially after the Marshall Plan, and now to Africa. But let's see that we contain that industry in America's economic self-interest. 
I yield the floor and thank the distinguished Chair.  
Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, in a phrase, we ought to `bail this buzzard.' This bill ought to be killed outright. It is nothing more than a political farce. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia says 10 years; it is 20 years, really. What sustains a 20-year drive is nothing more than political polling. I was elected some 50 years ago, and if I have watched a dismaying trend, it is the lack of really addressing the true needs of a State or the Nation, and instead addressing the needs of the individual politician, as reflected in the political poll. 
Now, Mr. President, right to the point. We all have heard Shakespeare's comment that Dick the butcher calls out in Henry VI, `First, we must kill all the lawyers.' That is in response to the intent of fomenting anarchy, imposing tyranny; and Dick the butcher, like Adolf Hitler himself, wanted to get rid of the lawyers first. Dick the butcher says, `First, we must kill all the lawyers,' because he knew that as long as you have lawyers standing for individual rights, you cannot have anarchy; you cannot have tyranny. But ask people about lawyers--until they need one; just like doctors, until they need one--and they will say get rid of all the lawyers. And over the 20-year period, I have kept my good friend Victor Schwartz in business. Maybe he will go out of business now with this jury-built nonsense called an amendment that we only got on yesterday, and I haven't had a chance--that is why I have been scurrying around here at the desk--to pick up the thrust of this latest assault. 
But back to the initial point--we have been taken over by the pollsters. 
Only the week before last, the House of Representatives, the most central organ of our representative government, the body that controls the purse strings, voted overwhelmingly to do away with tax revenues, some $970 billion--just gut the source to pay the bills--that we are going to spend and spend and spend. They use substitutes now of borrowing from yourself. We passed section 13301 of the Budget Act to forbid it. They disregard it regularly, borrowing so much from Social Security, the highway trust fund, the airport trust fund, the civil service pension fund, the military retirees pension fund, and the Federal Financing Bank--at this point over $111 billion--to bring about talks of surplus. 
In fact, this year we are spending over $111 billion more than we are taking in--a deficit, if you please. But with all of the jargon around and the news media coverage that is supposed to educate and illuminate and keep us to the truth, politicians have joined in the conspiracy. They babble `surplus, surplus'-- everywhere they call `surplus.' Well, there isn't any surplus. 
Of course, this bill here is intended strictly to get at the lawyers--not as the distinguished gentleman used the expression of `in the American tradition.' `In the American tradition,' Heavens above. The American tradition, Mr. President, has been for the States to regulate our torts. They have done so commendably. There isn't any question. All the farcical preambles--they try to really get away from the preambles and just some dribble about interstate commerce. I use the expression `dribble' and otherwise, because we know otherwise. 
The reality, heavens above, is that we have a great economy and booming small businesses. The National Federation of Independent Businesses says small businesses are having the best of times. My staff completed a Lexis-Nexis search for small businesses that couldn't operate on account of product liability. You know what--they couldn't find any large and serious cases against small businesses. But I presume during the debate this legislation's supporters will bring us some, and we will see how many they bring. 
The fact remains that there isn't a problem. But there is a political interest. There is a political problem. Oh, yes. We have to say we did something--we did something to get rid of the lawyers. We showed those lawyers. And, as a result, they not only voted away the tax system--now here on the Senate side for a nonproblem they come up and talk about the American tradition whereby they ask, and the gentleman says, `There goes that trial lawyer crowd.' You are right. They are the ones who have really been keeping the system honest. They haven't succeeded but in 27 percent of the product liability cases. But they still, when they have the clients who have been injured, try to keep the system honest. And what happens is that we have the States here--not only the trial lawyers but we have the States--and the American Bar Association. 
So I am very proud to stand here with the State legislature. Don't tell me about the Governors. I have been one of those, just like the Senator from West Virginia. And when we had Democratic Governors, then they voted against this thing right on down the line. Now the Republican Governors, the last time they got together and even bothered to take action was 6 or 7 years ago. They are not really bothered by it. But the State legislatures are bothered by it. 
We have an update here of June 18, less than a month ago. Here is what they really said when this was proposed, again on this particular bill, before with the amendment, which is to be introduced, I take it, later on. This is from the National Conference of State Legislatures:  
As you know, product liability legislation, in some form, may come to the Senate floor before Congress adjourns in November. I urge you, on behalf of the National Conference of State Legislatures, to vote against any such bill, for the simple reason that this is an issue best resolved by state legislatures. 
A good deal of lip service is given today to the advantages of our constitutional system of federalism and to the advantages of devolving authority to the states. But, from the point of view of state legislators, this rhetoric belies the reality of an accelerating trend toward concentration of power in Washington. Every year, Congress passes more laws and federal agencies adopt more rules that preempt state authority. Little consideration is given to the cumulative effect of preemption piled upon preemption. Little thought is given to the shrinking policy jurisdiction of state legislatures. 
Moreover, little consideration is given to whether state legislatures are responsibly exercising their authority. The threat to preempt state product liability law, for example, comes at a time when state legislatures have been particularly active in passing reform bills. As the attached article from the June issue of The States' Advocate shows, over the past ten years, thirty-three product liability reform bills have been enacted in the states. In addition, states have been reforming their tort law generally. As of December 1996, 34 states had revised their rules of joint and several liability and 31 had acted to curb punitive damages. 
Just as the preemption contemplated by a national products law is unprecedented, so the intrusion on the operation of state courts is both unprecedented and disturbing. National products standards would be grafted onto state law. In a sense, Congress would act as a state legislature to amend selected elements of state law, thus blurring the lines of political accountability in ways that raise several Tenth Amendment issues. Given the Supreme Court's recent interpretation of the Tenth Amendment in Printz v. United States, the legislation might even be unconstitutional. 
Our constitutional tradition of federalism deserves more than lip service. It's time to vote `no' on product liability and similar proposals to unjustifiably preempt state law. 
That is from the president of the conference and the president-elect of the National Conference of State Legislatures, which now has been updated in a letter to this Senator dated June 18, 1998. 
Dear Senator Hollings: I write on behalf of the National Conference of State Legislatures in opposition to S. 648, a bill that would supplant state liability laws with federal standards. 
For the National Conference of State Legislatures, this is a simple matter of federalism and states' rights. Tort reform is an issue for state legislatures, not Congress. There is no precedent for such a federal intrusion into such an important area of civil law. Moreover, we regard it as highly inappropriate and perhaps unconstitutional for the state courts to be commandeered as instruments of federal policy in the fashion contemplated by S. 648. 
The states have made considerable progress in reforming their state law, including product liability law, over the past decade. State legislatures are in a good position to balance the needs of the business community and those of consumers, not just in the abstract but in a way that reflects local values and local economic conditions. This is as the Founders intended it when they established a federal republic rather than a unitary state. 
The issue then is not finding the right compromise between consumer and business interests in crafting the language of S. 648. The issue is whether we will take a giant step toward nationalizing the civil law, to the detriment of our constitutional system of Federalism. Again, please oppose S. 648. 
That is from the Conference of State Legislatures, which, of course, is once again over this 20-year period bolstered by the American Bar Association in a letter dated July 1, 1998. 
Dear Senator: We understand that on July 7, broad federal product liability legislation will be the subject of a cloture vote on the Senate floor. I am writing to you to express the American Bar Association's opposition to S. 648, the bill reported by the Commerce Committee, and S. 2236, the compromise proposal introduced by Senators Gorton and Rockefeller. The ABA believes that improvements in the tort liability system should continue to be implemented at the state level and not be preempted by broad Federal law.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today, Senators Kerry, Snowe, Stevens, and I are introducing a bill which will address the future of the smallest of this Nation's seven uniformed services, the commissioned officer corps (Corps) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This bill will set a floor on Corps officers of 264 and a ceiling of 299, designate a flag officer as the Director of the Corps, and lift the hiring freeze on NOAA Corps officers. 
Let me be clear at the outset. Since 1995 when the Administration proposed the disestablishment of the NOAA Corps, I have thought it was a solution in search of a problem. The NOAA Corps is a dedicated and highly skilled group of men and women who have served this Nation consistently and ably for almost two centuries. This uniformed officer corps operates NOAA vessels and planes, provides important scientific and technical services, and carries out programmatic responsibilities throughout the agency.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I urge this body to confirm Michael J. Copps to be the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Trade Development. Mike Copps has been enormously effective as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Basic Industries; the sooner the Senate approves his nomination, the sooner he can go to work to further our nation's economic interests and develop new trade opportunities for American industry. 
It has been my privilege to know Mike Copps for over 25 years. He served on my staff for 15 years and was my administrative assistant for over a decade. In that time, I came to know and respect Mike; and today there is no one whose judgment I value more highly or in whose abilities I place greater confidence. In fact, Mr. Chairman, I can think of no one better suited to serve as the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Trade Development than Michael Copps. 
Mike is a man of measured judgment and extraordinary maturity, and he possesses a keen, analytical mind. I can state from personal experience that he is the consummate chief of staff--cool and collected, Mike Copps leads by example. In moments of crisis, he was calm. In times of indecision, he was resolute. And he always demonstrated high-minded principle and professionalism. 
I have been an elected servant of the people over the span of six decades, Mr. Chairman; and in this time, I have seen many people forget the purpose of public service. But Mike Copps never has forsaken his dedication to the public good. His moral compass has never wavered. I can pay no greater tribute to Mike Copps than to say he is a public servant without equal. Truly, this is the greatest accolade one can garner. 
Perhaps one way to underscore Mike Copps' unique temperament and keen intellect is to explain the origins of my relationship with him. Mike came to my staff in 1970, to help with writing and other tasks. From this humble beginning, he rose in less than five years to be my administrative assistant. Now, I pride myself on my staff, and for someone to rise from a newly hired assistant to chief of staff in the Senate in just five years is highly unusual. But Mike Copps has made a career out of making the unusual seem routine. 
Just look at what he has accomplished since taking over as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Basic Industries in 1993. His tenure has been one of the busiest and most purposeful in that office's history. DAS Copps has conceived, organized, and successfully achieved public sector-private sector partnerships in the belief that we can succeed in the world of global commerce only through close cooperation between industry and government. This has been the guiding light of his tenure at Commerce: fostering public sector-private sector cooperation to strengthen U.S. industry and benefit U.S. consumers. 
For example, under Mike Copps' leadership, the Commerce Department's Basic Industries division has administered seven highly innovative Market Development Cooperator Program Awards. This competitive matching grants program provides two private sector dollars for every federal dollar and builds public-private partnerships by providing assistance to non-profit export multipliers.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in over 30 years as a U.S. Senator, I have had the opportunity to work with hundreds of Federal employees. Among all of those hard-working public servants, there are a few individuals who stand out for their commitment to doing the best possible job for the American people and who have the skills to get that job done. Today, I would like to recognize one of those individuals on the occasion of his retirement--Dr. Elbert W. `Joe' Friday, Jr., former director of the Department of Commerce's National Weather Service. 
Dr. Friday has given 38 years of outstanding service to this country. Twenty of those years were as a U.S. Air Force Weather Detachment Commander in Saigon, Vietnam, and Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, and as the Director of Environmental and Life Sciences in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. The remaining eighteen years were served in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). During his tenure at NOAA, Joe served as associate administrator for both the National Weather Service and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research. 
As the head of the National Weather Service, Joe has guided the agency through the most significant changes in its 200-year history. Weather service modernization has required the implementation of powerful new observational technologies, updated information and forecast systems, and a streamlined organizational structure. When complete, it will yield revolutionary advancements in our national public weather warning and forecast system. In fact, in recent years we have already begun to document dramatic improvements in the accuracy and timeliness of the Service's forecasts of weather events. For example, the Weather Service has lengthened the warning time for tornadoes from 6 minutes back in 1994 to 10 minutes today. That may not seem like a huge accomplishment, but it can mean the difference between life and death for individuals who are caught in a tornado's deadly path. Under Dr. Friday's leadership, we have also seen substantial improvements in the accuracy of predicting hurricane landfall, allowing local managers to make better and less costly evacuation plans and emergency preparations. 
In 1989, an anxious nation watched as Hurricane Hugo moved relentlessly towards the Southeastern coast. As we waited, there was one person, Joe Friday, that I could count on to answer my questions and provide accurate information for tracking the storm. During weather service modernization when local communities in every region raised concerns about the closing of weather stations and the placement of radars, one person, Joe Friday, sorted through the rumors, listened, and gave us straight information. In recent years, budgetary difficulties have provided Joe with some of his greatest challenges. However, he succeeded in protecting the National Hurricane Center and other essential programs from sweeping cutbacks that would have hampered the ability of the Weather Service to do its job. 
Last year, Joe moved over to NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, where he is responsible for environmental research and technology programs like Sea Grant and Climate and Global Change. These programs are critical for addressing such diverse issues as global warming, climate prediction, El NinAE6o events, red tides, and Pfiesteria. I am sure that many at NOAA would echo my view when I say that I regret not being able to entice Dr. Friday to stay longer in his new position. 
Throughout his career, Joe Friday has shared credit for successes, but never blamed others for problems or difficulties. He is a rare mix of gifted scientist, decorated soldier, and eloquent speaker--a charismatic man who leads by example and has inspired a generation of men and women at the National Weather Service. His strong leadership, clear vision, loyalty, and concern for his colleagues were instrumental in creating an effective team of professionals. His simple but powerful philosophy has always been that, as a public servant, his responsibility is to provide the highest level of products and services to the people of the United States and the world. In all his endeavors, he has supplied endless energy, sound judgment, keen intelligence, and a sense of humor to the government he is so proud to serve. It was no surprise to anyone when he was awarded the 1993 Federal Executive of the Year, an outstanding and well deserved recognition for his contributions. 
I am confident that I speak for many of my colleagues when I express admiration and thanks to Joe for his invaluable contributions to the United States of America and to the global scientific community. He has our best wishes and deepest gratitude for his accomplishments in his 38 years of Federal Service.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in tribute to the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee. It is indeed fitting that we dedicate the 1999 Defense Authorization Bill in his honor. 
Senator Thurmond has a long and distinguished record of service both in the military and in the Congress. He was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in 1924 and has since served this nation, and the military, in positions of increasing responsibility. During World War II he served in both Europe and Pacific. Afterwards he rose to the rank of Major General in the Army Reserve. During his many years in the Senate he toiled to insure that our military maintained the readiness necessary to defend our great nation. 
In recent years he has served as Chairman of the Army Services Committee and rightfully earned a place in Senate history as one of the greatest Chairmen of this important Committee. During these years the Committee has faced many challenges in shaping a defense bill that met the needs of a military in a world in change. His great experience in military, national and international matters has made the difference in providing for the nation's defense. 
Senator Thurmond has been a personal inspiration during my years in the Senate. I have always appreciated his guidance. Together, we have worked in harmony for the good of the great state of South Carolina and the Nation. 
Again, I congratulate him!

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleagues, Senator Grassley, Senator Reid, and Senator D'Amato in introducing legislation which would repeal provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 pertaining to the establishment of annual caps of $1,500 on all outpatient rehabilitation services except those furnished in a hospital outpatient department. 
The `Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act of 1998' that we introduce today is made necessary because of the negative impact these provisions will have on Medicare beneficiaries who require therapy services. Senior citizens suffering from medical conditions common to the elderly such as stroke, hip fracture, and coronary artery disease will not be able to obtain the rehabilitative care they need to resume normal activities of daily living because of this arbitrarily imposed cap. This is especially true in South Carolina, which has a significant number of Medicare recipients who live in rural areas. A patient who has met the $1,500 cap will have no choice but to seek care in a hospital outpatient department, not only at a much greater distance but also at a substantially higher cost. 
The `Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act' would also repeal the provision combining speech-language pathology and physical therapy services under the same $1,500 cap. These are two very separate and distinct functions, and there is no rational basis for including them under one cap. As my constituent, Beth Fleming of Anderson, South Carolina, said recently, and I agree, `Patients should not have to choose between walking and talking.' 
I urge my distinguished colleagues to join Senator Grassley, Senator Reid, Senator D'Amato and me in supporting this legislation.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of South Carolina's most beloved citizens and one of the nation's most eminent jurists: U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Perry. 
Matthew Perry grew up under `Jim Crow,' yet he overcame every barrier to his betterment that society threw up. He relied on his loving and supportive family as well as his own inner strength, wholesome ambition, and unerring moral compass to persevere in the face of naked hatred and discrimination. As one South Carolina newspaper recently noted, he `had the benefits of good guidance and a good head, and the difficult challenge of growing up under a great adversity.' 
Matthew Perry put this adversity to good use. `Jim Crow' forged his character in steel, and his experience of unjust laws drove him to devote his life to justice. Against long odds, and with much greater effort than that required of more privileged students, he obtained his law degree and set to work to tear down the structure of segregation in South Carolina. 
As a lawyer in the 1960s, Matthew Perry was a leading figure in the Civil Rights Movement. He was instrumental in advancing black South Carolinians' rights and played a leading role in many important legal cases, particularly in defending civil rights activists who were prosecuted for their participation in non-violent demonstrations and sit-ins. 
Among the significant cases Matthew Perry helped prepare and argue were Edwards v South Carolina, in which the U.S. Supreme Court established important First Amendment protections for demonstrators; Peterson v City of Greenville, in which the Court enlarged the jurisdiction of federal constitutional protections over premises that had previously been considered outside federal anti-discrimination rules; and Newman v Piggie Pork Enterprises, one of the Court's earliest interpretations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Mr. President, today it is difficult to appreciate the courage of Matthew Perry's convictions and devotion to the cause of civil rights for black Americans. He worked long hours without pay, but money was the least of his concerns. In the 1950s and '60s, his advocacy of equal rights for all and an end to segregation earned him the visceral hatred of many, and his activism sometimes placed his life in danger. Yet the lessons of his childhood served him well, and he endured threats and taunts to triumph over a corrupt and fundamentally unjust system. In the end, Matthew Perry's idealism, intelligence, and integrity helped put an end forever to segregation and to firmly establish the universal principle of equality for all. 
Mr. President, it was my privilege to recommend to President Jimmy Carter that he nominate Matthew Perry to a seat on the U.S. District Court in South Carolina. In 1979, Matthew Perry was officially appointed to the Court. He was the first and to date only black judge on the Federal District Court in South Carolina. 
As always, Judge Perry is a pioneer. His example is an inspiration not just to black attorneys but to aspiring jurists of all classes and races. His life proves that with courage, conviction, and hard work, one can surmount even life's greatest challenges and contribute to society's lasting improvement.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I call this body's attention to Hugh M. McIntosh's special contribution to the performing arts in the nation's Capital. Hugh has worked long and hard to foster the growth and appreciation of the arts, particularly through his service as a Trustee of the Ford's Theatre Society. 
The Society is the not-for-profit organization that brings new musicals, American classics, and other live entertainment to that historic stage. After the assassination of President Lincoln, Ford's Theatre was used as an office and warehouse until an act of Congress initiated the Theatre's restoration, which was completed in 1968. This year's Gala for the President celebrated these 30 years of memorable performances illuminating the character and vibrancy of American life. 
As a partner in the law firm of Vinson & Elkins, L.L.P., Hugh McIntosh has guided Ford's governing board and staff through legal thickets, including contract negotiations with playwrights and agents, strategic planning, development of ethical guidelines, and day-to-day legal questions. Hugh has worked closely with Frankie Hewitt, the Ford Theatre Society's founder and producing artistic director, and with the National Park Service, which administers the Theatre as a public museum. 
Hugh is a discerning theater-goer, and his love of `a good show' has fueled his enthusiasm for contributing backstage at Ford's. He is a strong supporter of education and outreach programs that invites a diverse audience to Ford's and aim to foster a greater appreciation of the performing arts in the Washington area. 
But as valuable as Hugh's legal expertise has been to Ford's Theatre, his greatest contribution has been to bring wisdom, a sense of perspective, and quiet humor to the complex issues facing the Theatre's performing artists and playwrights. 
It is these special qualities, in fact, which will assure Hugh's success in the new direction his life is about to take. This fall, Hugh will begin studying theology at the Harvard School of Divinity. If Hugh is called to pastoral service, he may find many friends from Ford's Theatre in his pews.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, our country's relationship with the People's Republic of China is currently receiving a great deal of attention. One aspect of that relationship which is not getting enough attention is shipping. 
The United States has an open door to Chinese shipping. Chinese companies can call at any U.S. port. They do not need any government agency to approve their schedule, their ships, or changes to those deployments. They can open branch offices anywhere in the U.S. that they wish. They can provide vessel agency services to their own vessels. This U.S. policy has allowed Chinese shipping companies to be quite free and successful. COSCO, for example, which is owned by the People's Republic of China, is by far the largest ocean carrier in the U.S.-China trade and is a major carrier in other U.S. trades. The Chinese government wants the most favorable treatment for COSCO here in the U.S.; yet it continues to deny U.S. carriers operating in China the opportunities and privileges Chinese carriers receive here. 
Not only does Chinese shipping policy seek to control the trade rather than allow market forces to operate, but restrictions are becoming increasingly problematic. This lack of reciprocity is unfair. 
For example, access to ostensibly open ports in China is now solely at the discretion of the Chinese Ministry of Communications. While American carriers must endure long waits for an uncertain approval of whether and where they can operate, Chinese carriers are free to call at U.S. ports without having to face such conditions. Recent Chinese regulations make this process even more burdensome and contain the potential for huge penalties. 
U.S. carriers face restrictions on a host of normal commercial activities in China that Chinese carriers don't face here. For example, branch offices are restricted or prohibited. U.S. carriers cannot even provide normal vessel agency services to their own ships. This results in a considerably higher cost base for U.S. carriers versus their Chinese competitors. 
The Federal Maritime Commission and the Administration have been working on and encouraging a resolution of these problems, but insufficient progress has been made. Therefore, I have written to the FMC to encourage it to use the full range of its authority to investigate these matters. 
What is additionally very troubling to me--and what should be very troubling to the Chinese government if they value the government-to-government negotiation process as a way to resolve differences--is the recent turn of events in the maritime bilateral negotiations between our governments. In December of last year some progress was made. An agreement was reached on some of the outstanding issues. The U.S. government has fulfilled its promises by the FMC giving COSCO an exemption from some of the Controlled Carrier Act restrictions. But the Chinese government has not yet honored its commitments, even though it had agreed to act simultaneously with the U.S. government. The Administration recognizes this. The FMC recognizes this. The Congress recognizes this. 
China's relationship with the U.S. is undermined when it fails to fulfill its promises. Our willingness to treat China favorably is undermined if the Chinese government's promises are illusory. 
Not only do I urge the FMC to investigate and take appropriate action in these maritime issues, but I urge the State Department to convey to the Chinese government the damaging effect of its current maritime posture on improved trade relations. 
Both our countries' trade relations are benefited by a liberalized shipping environment. An unbalanced lack of reciprocity cannot be sustained.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me harken how we began June a year ago and explain my objection to the procedure. 
With respect to a year ago, what really occurred was that the tobacco companies were spending a goodly fortune defending class actions and individual causes of action due to tobacco smoking causing certain injury and death. 
These are very responsible companies. They have very responsible boards of directors. Right to the point, they had the urge to try to regain credibility for their overall operation. Philip Morris, for example, sells not only tobacco cigarettes but, of course, it is into Kraft foods and many other allied endeavors. R.J. Reynolds down in North Carolina is in the Ritz cracker business, plus other different businesses. They were getting pilloried, so to speak, in the courtrooms of America. They were successful. They weren't losing. They had won every case. There was not a jury verdict against a tobacco company. But looking at the bottom line, as good businessmen and operators, they were spending around $500 million to $600 million a year in legal fees. 
This crowd up here in Washington is worried about trial lawyers. If you really want to get taken to the cleaners, get one of these corporate lawyers. I suggest to the distinguished Chair that if he ever gets into trouble, for gosh sakes, don't get General Motors's lawyer or IBM's lawyer. You had better get a real lawyer who is used to getting in the courtrooms. 
This crowd sort of works with themselves on billable hours. That is the ailment that has taken over. The billable hours, the defenses, and all were costing them about $500 million to $600 million. More than anything else, it was depressing their stock. 
The lawyers themselves had not won any cases. They were moving with the States' attorneys general. So, with the States' attorneys general, they got together. They had been meeting on opposite sides of the table in courtrooms all over America. As I understand it, they got together on an agreed settlement. The agreed settlement would, No. 1, increase taxes. 
The reason I emphasize this, Mr. President, is if you go home and turn on your television or listen to the radio, the `scoundrel Congress' up here is the one that is trying to increase taxes on poor America, middle America, and whatever America. There is no suggestion that this idea came from the tobacco companies, the ones who are paying for the advertising, and in a luxurious amount. But this is the reality. The idea of increasing taxes originated with the tobacco companies themselves, in the so-called Global Tobacco Settlement. 
I worked with the defense appropriations bill. And that amounts to $250 billion. When I heard on TV and then later read in the newspaper $368 billion, I still thought it was a mistake--$368 billion. I said, `Where in the world would they get all of that money?' Well, if you reasoned out 25 years and so much per year as it goes up, yes, you can get to that amount, or get to $1.10, as the present Commerce Committee bill now envisions. You get around $500 billion. 
But the real initiative of raising taxes was by the companies themselves--not the squealing, crying, moaning, and groaning on national TV about, `This terrible Congress is going awry.' Not so. They came up and said, `All right, we will put this money up, and for you States and States' attorneys general, what we will do is, we will pay in a good 40 percent of it to the States to take care of the Medicaid costs, the health costs, and everything, as an incidence, a result, of tobacco smoking and ailments and death that was caused by tobacco smoking.' So that would take care of the States. The States' attorneys general got together and agreed on that. 
Another part of the agreement, of course, was to try to control tobacco smoking and discourage young people from smoking. The children, instead of getting Joe Camel, were getting the adverse ads, the warnings, not just on the pack of cigarettes but on national TV--how injurious to health it could be. We found out in the early 1970s that these negative-type ads worked. We tried it before. I don't know whether the price increase would work. They say in downtown London, where they have a pack of cigarettes at $4.30 and up, it has not worked with respect to deterring children from starting to smoke. 
But in any event, it was good intent, a good purpose, and a good provision that they would do it, and do it in all honesty and sincerity. In fact, to back up their pledge, they hit on the unique `look-back provision.' I had never heard of that before in all the years I have been up here. But they had a look-back provision whereby they said, `We will measure it each year with the diminution of tobacco smoking with respect to children,' and if they don't comply with a certain percentage decrease each year, they will pay more multimillion-dollar, almost billion dollars, or maybe over a billion dollars, in penalties, penalizing themselves. 
There was not any question about the sincerity of the purpose. They had it all worked out. The White House agreed to it. The health community was in conference from time to time on this particular agreement. And it was announced. The first thing that hit this Senator when it was announced was not only the $368 billion, an enormous amount, but what is in there for the man who is making a living-- 
namely, the tobacco farmer. When the Pilgrims landed here in the earliest of days, they found the Indians, who were smoking tobacco. Are we now going to really have prohibition? No. We tried that once before with alcoholic beverages, and it corrupted the entire society and crime went through the roof. So we learned the hard lesson and repealed that 18th amendment. 
Certainly with respect to tobacco smoking and everything else of that kind, we realize there are certain realistic considerations: One, that we are not going to have an embargo or prohibit the production itself; two, that when it comes to advertising, there is that First Amendment right and we are not going to be able to force-feed--the companies have to agree with respect to the limitation on advertising or the agreement to negatively advertise against smoking, those kinds of things, and then the allocation of the money to have to come about with respect to the matter of the States, and not only that, but with respect to the health community. Necessarily, we all want to increase the research out at the National Institutes of Health on the injurious effect of tobacco smoking. 
I have had hearings over 30-some years now with the doctors out there at the Cancer Institute, not only on how cancer is caused but how a pack-a-day smoker can rejuvenate the health of his lungs after 5 years and really recover from it if he stops. 
I might add, Mr. President, that more people have stopped smoking than are smoking today. I repeat: There are more people who have stopped smoking than are smoking today. So when they get to the victims and the matter of habit forming and addictiveness and everything else, that is a jury question that the jurors of America have never gone along with. They have never gone along with it until this recent verdict down here of a little six-man jury in Florida, and we don't know what will happen with that on appeal. But that is a pretty solid record. We have Senators running up and down knocking over the chairs and desks saying, `Why give this industry immunity?' 
Well, Mr. President, the jurors of America, far more savvy with respect to the actual facts before them, have given the tobacco companies immunity--not the distinguished Presiding Officer, not this Senator from South Carolina, but over the many, many years, the jurors, the people of America, have given them immunity because for 33 years we have had an advertisement that they are injurious to your health. 
Now, I looked in that global tobacco settlement, and I said wait a minute--something is wrong here. We don't have any provision in there for a large segment of the economy of South Carolina. We have over 2,000 tobacco farms in South Carolina involving some 40,000 jobs with the warehousemen, the equipment dealers and everything else of that kind, with a $1 billion impact on the communities, veritable tobacco towns. If you want to start Tobacco Road, which we have seen in the Depression, pass this title XV that the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Ford, wants to strike. I commend his leadership on this score because he has been in the forefront looking out for an important segment of our society and important communities in my State and his and in the several surrounding States. 
How they could get together on an agreement and not even consider tobacco farmers is beyond me. But we were told immediately, oh, no, no, no, no, don't worry about that; we will take care of the farmers. I wondered in October when the distinguished Senator from Indiana put in the Lugar, what he called transition bill, which is a bankruptcy act--an elimination bill is what it was because in just a 3-year period bam, bam, bam, the farmers would be gone. Nothing for the warehousemen, nothing for the fertilizer dealer, nothing for the community with respect to the bank making the loan or the automobile loan, nothing for various other parts of the society itself, the families to adjust and take care of themselves. 
Under the leadership of Senator Ford, the LEAF Act was developed when we saw this particular Indiana initiative. I remember recently seeing where the Attorney General of Indiana, who, incidentally, was in on the original agreement, said, `We had no idea of taking care of the farmer.' 
Well, that is not what they told us. Everybody said, on both sides of the aisle, in a bipartisan fashion, `Of course, we have got to take care of the farmer,' and the White House, along with the Congress itself, said, `Yes, we have got to take care of the farmer.' 
So the LEAF Act was developed in a studied fashion with respect not only to the holder of the particular quota but the actual farmer who farmed the crop. It took care of the warehousemen. It took care of the fertilizer and equipment dealer. It took care of the communities. And we put it out at the very beginning of the year as an amendment, the LEAF Act. 
Of course, when the distinguished Senator from Arizona, the chairman of our Commerce Committee, came to me, he said, `Now, the majority leader has suggested that our committee put out the tobacco agreement as a commerce bill. And I would like it to be bipartisan.' I told Senator McCain I would like it to be bipartisan also, but, of course, we had to take care of the farmer. Well, that is the first time I really began to doubt about this `take care of the farmer' because the distinguished chairman of the committee turned to me and he said, `No, we can't put that on.' I was wondering why. That was the first time I had ever heard that nobody wanted to take care of the farmer. 
When he told me that, I said, `Well, it's going to be very partisan, because I am not going to stand by and let this go through committee, without bringing up this important segment of the economy.' Yes, we are trying to stop little children from smoking. Yes, we are trying to take care of those who have been injured from smoking. Yes, we are trying to get research. And, yes, we are trying to control the advertising. But everybody, from the word go in June of last year, said, `We are going to take care of the farmer,' and the LEAF Act did. The Senator from Arizona said no, he didn't think he could do that. Several days later, he came back and said, `Yes, you are right, we ought to make it bipartisan, and we will take care of the farmer.' 
As a result, we spent a marathon session with the staffs of all the Senators involved on both sides of the aisle in the Commerce Committee, the White House, Dr. Koop, Dr. Kessler, and the various entities against children smoking, checking back and forth. There is no question that the distinguished Senator from Arizona did an outstanding job to get a bill that we could all agree upon by a vote of 19 to 1. We did agree on the tobacco bill, and it included the LEAF Act. 
As we were ready to bring this bill to the floor, we were given notice that what we ought to do in order to get this bill passed was not to spend too much time with respect to amendments; let's see what amendments are going to carry immediate and recognizable weight and see if we can't agree to put those on now, cut the time involved, because the leader wants to handle this in a couple of days, at the most 3 days, and we have to get together with the White House. We don't want to put in a bill without knowing that it will be approved. 
So we did. We had five sessions with the White House--Senator McCain and Senator Mack on that side of the aisle and Senator Kerrey and myself on our side of the aisle. We kept meeting with them, and I kept checking with them to guarantee the LEAF Act was intact. I kept asking everybody--not to worry, they told me. 
We had those five sessions, the last one being in my own office here in the Nation's Capital. At 4 o'clock it broke up, and about an hour or so later, about 6 o'clock, I heard a rumor about the Lugar bill. I said, `Come on, somebody is way off. They might want to put it on, but it can't be on our Commerce bill.' 
They said, `No; that's what the leader is going to do.' 
I said, `How does that occur?' 
The bill itself, which is title XV, had one hearing, according to the best check I have made on it. It had one hearing last fall and has not had any hearings since that time, has not had any markup, no committee report, no report out of the committee. It was just an individual Senator's bill--we all will agree, one of the most respected Senators and one of the most powerful in that he is the chairman of our Agriculture Committee. 
I knew if there was any real intent or force behind it or interest, that he long since would have had that bill reported out of his committee and we could have studied it, and if there had been any differences with the LEAF Act, they could have been reconciled. 
But, Mr. President, it was the most dastardly procedure I have ever seen when the majority leader stood up and said, `Oh, no, I'm putting the Lugar bill on your committee bill.' 
I said, `You can't do that without the committee.' 
He said, `Well, the committee is on here; we have a majority.' 
I said, `You can't have a majority without the distinguished Senator from Arizona.' 
The Senator from Arizona and I had traveled together to Florence, SC. We notified every quota holder, every equipment dealer, and we had around 2,500 or 3,000 who met in the hockey arena there. We both made our little pitches. The Congressmen made their talks. We answered questions for over an hour's time, and we met with the press for over a half-hour and reaffirmed again and again our support for the LEAF Act. We explained it, why it 
was there, how it was worded, the difference between burley tobacco and flue-cured tobacco and why we worded different things. Because of this effort, and the Senator's sincerity, I just couldn't believe anyone could make representations then changing the tobacco bill, putting the bill just summarily on another bill. 
I am not sure that the committee met, but you have to take the majority leader's word. He said they met and that they voted, 11 Senators; it was under the rules. That is the procedure that I object to. If for no other reason, this ought to be voted down. We ought not to sanction this kind of conduct on the working arrangements. Everybody is talking about the confrontational nature and how the club is breaking up and how we are just all politics. We have to trust each other, Mr. President, and we can't endanger that trust by having an understanding throughout 10 days of a heated markup, through five separate sessions with the White House, through a gathering of our tobacco farmers in our backyard, and being assured again and again in explaining the bill was it, and then to put this up and fix the vote on the other side of the aisle. That is what I understand has occurred. 
That is my first and foremost reason for opposing the Lugar amendment. My foremost reason was to take care of the farmers. My foremost reason now is to take care of the Senate. If that is the way we are going to conduct business, so be it. We can all play that game, with rule and ruin and trickery and everything else of that kind. 
Let me show you exactly where we are now and take stock with respect to this Lugar amendment. 
What we have done with this kind of handling of the bill is, we have added on the payments to the States of 40 percent. Of course, that is $5.76 billion. We have added on the marriage penalty of $3.1 billion and the Coverdell drug provision--that is $2 billion--for a total of $10.86 billion. The cost of the Lugar amendment, title XV--to be stricken, I hope--is $6.4 billion. That is a sum total of $17.26 billion the first year, whereas a total estimation for the first year in the bill we have before us--and I raise it for the Senators to see--this S. 1415 allocates $14.4 billion to the National Tobacco Trust Fund, but we have already spent $17.26 billion. 
Unless you strike--I wish this was a session of the Budget Committee, because we could have a budget point of order. This is totally without the budget, but it has gotten to be a habit where it is getting into all committees now. If you go along with title XV, you have then expended $2.86 billion--$2,860,000,000--more than what the bill will bring in. Yet, the tobacco companies are talking about how they are being devastated. They haven't seen anything yet. If they don't adopt this amendment and go forward with ideas on the House side, they will learn just exactly what has happened. 
But, of course, the tobacco companies said, `Let the Senator from South Carolina talk along, because here under Senator Lugar's proposal there's a real winner for us companies,' because in 1999 Senator Lugar's plan cuts the price support for tobacco by 25 percent, from $1.68 a pound to $1.22 a pound. `This equates to a savings for us tobacco companies'--now I am posturing myself so you will understand it. If I am a tobacco company, I love this title XV, because the first year I really make $987 million, just out a billion bucks. So I am a billion bucks to the good with this Lugar amendment. 
And then in 2000, this proposal cuts the price support by another 10 percent, from $1.22 a pound to $1.10 a pound. `This equates to a savings to us tobacco companies now. We are in business. And we know how to get amendments passed--sneak them on at the last minute. Don't ever debate them. Don't ever have a committee report it out one way or the other. Just forget about the bill last year, but get the majority leader to sneak the bill on'--$1.276 billion. 
And then in the year 2001--a 3-year program--what happens in that third year? This proposal cuts the price support by another 10 percent, from $1.10 to 99 cents a pound. This equates to a savings by the company of another $1,543,500,000. 
So the total savings--total savings, Mr. President--by the tobacco companies on this title XV, if it is not stricken over the next 3 years, is $3,804,500,000. I did not realize it was that much--$3,804,500,000. 
Of course, that leaves nothing for health care, not a thing for public health, nothing for health research or anything else of that kind. 
To come in with this at the last minute and take all this money is like when they used to organize the insurance companies when I was Governor down there in South Carolina. And they had one company--Capital Life was looking for a new slogan, and they finally came up with the winning slogan, after considering all their friends' suggestions. They said, `Capital Life will surely pay if the small print on the back doesn't take it away.' 
I know that is exactly what has happened. They said that we are going to have all this money to do the various programs--health care, research, and what-have-you, moneys for the attorneys general, and everything else like that--and the tobacco companies, with a last minute strike, come up with $3,804,500,000, and the farmers are left high and dry. 
If you want to see the Tobacco Road that we had during the days of the Depression, with the dust and the filth and the desperation and the despair, keep the Lugar amendment in here, and not Senator Ford's LEAF amendment, and we are goners--we are goners. There is no question in my mind. 
Now, there has been some confusion. The tobacco companies, like to put the spin that we in the Congress are raising taxes when it was their idea just a year ago--no Congressman was at the table; no Senator was at the table--it was the tobacco companies at the table that came out with this scheme, and now they are putting the twist on that we are raising taxes. They are the ones who raised the tax. 
Now they are trying to put on here the twist that the farmers are going to be taken care of, and at the last minute put on the Lugar amendment, fix the vote, and leave them high and dry. I do not like it. And you can tell by the tone of my voice it should not be liked. 
I have been around. I have worked with everybody throughout the years here and have had good bipartisan support. We handled the Telecommunications Act, got 95 votes for it. I handled Gramm-Rudman-Hollings on this side of the aisle on 14 votes up and down, and got a majority of the Democrats, over the objection of the leader at that time and the chairman of the Budget Committee. But we got the majority of Democrats to support that particular budget initiative. 
I have had success over the years working in a bipartisan 
fashion. This is in the most treacherous fashion I can possibly think of, to take a matter that had not completed the hearings--yet to be reported, yet to have a vote on, no committee report to read or study, no conversation on the contrary--all conversation, all representations: `Don't worry, the LEAF Act is fine.' We go down, even before the farmers, and tell them that, and everything else like that, and then go along at the last minute with this ambush. 
This is ambushing my farmers, Mr. President. And we will have more to say about it. But I think that the Record ought to show exactly what has occurred here. We have a studied bill. We have the tobacco farmers taken care of with respect through the payments that are made now on the average yield for those in flue-cured tobacco, for the quota holders, because the existing system is eliminated. What we have is a system of permits to do away with the quotas. And, incidentally, they wanted to argue--and you are going to hear this ad infinitum--that with all the other farm programs gone, why should we support this? This is the one crop that has had its production limited. And it is a very sensitive crop, and it was here when we landed over 200-some years ago. 
So we have been handling it over the years in a clean, responsible, productive fashion. And we have created the communities, we have created the fertilizer dealers, we have created the warehouses and the warehousing, as well as the farmers. 
So in order to be sure that we do not just turn them over to welfare and say that in 2 years they can come and get retraining, we must not abandon them. Incidentally, Mr. President, let me talk about that retraining just one moment. We had down in my backyard the Oneida knitting mills that made nothing but little T-shirts. Anybody could make them, but at one time they had 487 there. The age average was 47 years. They were a very productive company, complying, if you please, with all the requirements--clean air, clean water, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, minimum wage, safe working place, safe machinery, plant closing notice, parental leave, on and on and on --that Republicans and Democrats said before you open up you have to comply with. That goes into the cost of production. So the plant moved to Mexico, for 58 cents an hour and none of those requirements. 
So Washington is so keen on how to get things done, they say: `Retrain, global economy, global competition. We're moving into the age of technology, retrain, skills.' 
Well, don't tell this Senator about it. I am the author of the Advanced Technology Program. I am the author of the manufacturing extension centers known as Hollings Centers. I fought to keep those programs going. I instituted technical colleges and special schools back 38 years ago in my own home State. So I am appreciative of technology and its needs. 
But assume the 487 are immediately retrained the Washington way tomorrow morning, and you have 487 computer operators. Are you going to hire the 47-year-old computer operator or the 21-year-old computer operator? It is quite obvious, Mr. President, that their community of Andrews will be high and dry and out of luck. And that has happened all over the U.S. since NAFTA was passed. And we have lost a fell sum of 24,000 textile and apparel jobs in my State alone. So that next sum, while we have gotten in the BMWs, the Fujis, the Hoffmann-La Roches, and the Hondas--and we are proud of it--the net loss is this, that we have lost 12,400 jobs since NAFTA was passed. 
Now we are coming up with a very `wise,' as they would call it, `assault,' I call it, upon the tobacco farmer to put him out of business in a studied fashion over 3 years: take all the money and run with it, devastate the health program and the research program, and the several States are not going to get their money and everything else. And yet it is on there and it hasn't been discussed. 
I see now the distinguished Senator from Indiana is with us and I am delighted to hear from him. I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Wyoming is correct; we have a responsibility. 
In meetings and almost marathon sessions around the clock with all Senators, 20 of us--1 finally disagreed and voted against us in the Commerce Committee--the distinguished Senator from Arizona, our chairman, made sure that everyone was factored in: That we certainly considered the health groups; Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler were there. We considered the attorneys general. We seem to forget these agreements, and so forth, were made by the attorneys general in consultation with the White House, the health community, and the tobacco companies. We forget the fact, of course, that the tobacco companies--this thing has gotten all out of kilter--agreed to tax themselves. There was not a single Congressman and there was not a Senator at the table last June. They taxed themselves. Now we are running around, we are going to save victims, and everything else of that kind. 
But let me get back to the Senator from Wyoming, because he is right, we have a responsibility. The 20 of us on the committee complied with that responsibility with respect to lawyers' fees that we would be engaged in, and the money would come to the Federal Government. Yes; as U.S. Senators, we are definitely responsible. 
You will find that section, of course, on page 437 of the bill--`Attorneys' fees and expenses,' and the criteria used, and everything else, on arbitration. 
We have in a responsible fashion outlined the responsibility. There is none of this 25 percent--none of it. Absolutely, they are looking at settlements made by the several States--I think Florida, Texas, Mississippi, and now Minnesota I think is the last one. But we are not the Governor of Minnesota or Florida. We have not, as attorney general of Texas or Mississippi, anything to do with that. We could not legislate on it. 
We believe, as the Senator does on that side of the aisle, in the 10th amendment, those things not outlined in the Constitution as responsibilities of the Federal Government are reserved to the States. While we have one wayward former attorney general who didn't want to do anything, we have some outstanding attorneys general who have done more--we are going to prove it--to save people from cancer than Dr. Koop and Kessler combined. I will get to that. 
But I want the Senator from Wyoming to know that we have done just that. We have acted in a responsible fashion. It is arbitration. 
Incidentally, since I mentioned Florida, they ought to be ashamed of themselves and take down that sign. Our distinguished President, take down that sign that is absolutely false. Rodham, I don't know him--Hugh Rodham, Hillary Clinton's brother. They put that up because they want to project partisan politics into this and Hugh Rodham as a part of the litigation team--absolutely ludicrous. But they put a sign up there and then `drink with the Devil.' They have all kinds of expressions. They are running around on the floor of the U.S. Senate with all the pejorative terms of `corruption,' `greedy,' `predatory,' `raising taxes,' `slam dunk,' `outrage,' `sultans of smoke.' Oh, boy, they are having a heyday. 
Oh, boy, aren't they having a heyday. Aren't they having a heyday--a total smokescreen--with respect to what the actual fact is. 
Incidentally, you are looking at a lawyer who practiced for 20 years, and never by the hour. And let me identify myself as a defendant's lawyer as well as a plaintiff's lawyer. I represented the South Carolina Electric and Gas on their bus system, passenger bus. If you want to defend cases, defend the suits brought by passengers on a city transit system. And I can tell you here and now that about the middle of November, maybe even a little bit earlier, the Christmas club starts. Nobody who gets on a bus wants to catch their arm in the door, slip down in the aisle, fall down the steps. The bus is jerking off everywhere. And they got all of these little suits. 
The corporate lawyers, the regular defendant lawyers, are lazy. I said that to the chief counsel of the electric and gas company because I was suing them as a plaintiff and making money doing it. I said, `Well, tell them to come in and try the cases.' But they settle them all out because they are busy and they don't want to bring the cases. 
So I lined them all up and saved that particular corporation millions of dollars, and I am proud of that. I am proud to stand here when the Senator from Texas says they ought to be ashamed. We had this nonsense. We have already voted on it. Sixty percent of the Senators, according to the Senator from Texas, ought to be ashamed--making all this thing up here of what has been going on now for years. 
It has to do, Mr. President, with lawyers. We see it at every particular turn and the political opportunism that has come about as a result of an outstanding job done by lawyers. What really happened--and the Senator from Alabama said he was one who was approached and did nothing and is proud of it. Well, if every other attorney general had done that and waited for others to prove the new theory, as he said--and it was a new theory; nobody had ever won a jury verdict--nothing would ever have happened and we would not be here. 
If you look in the Congressional Record from January to June of last year, you will not see an expression of children smoking in the Congressional Record. Nobody was concerned about it. I have been here almost 32 years, and I have worked with the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society, won national awards and everything else of that kind. Other than putting up the notification asking for more research and everything else, we were not stopping smoking. This whole thing is going on here brought about by trial lawyers. It is going to eliminate a lot of cases, a lot of cancer deaths, as a result of smoking. 
But, yes, they had the ingenious approach of a class action, the trial lawyers did, over the past several years, culminating in the agreement last June. They said: We are going to continue to bring these class actions even though we have not won one, and we think we have some of the company's records here that the jury would take notice of and change their mind and give us a verdict. The attorneys general were approached by these particular trial lawyers, and they all joined in. 
I will cite later on, one attorney general had to defend his life, had to hide the witnesses, had to really withstand a lawsuit of hourly pay, hourly wages--hourly, hourly, hourly. Oh, my heavens. Twenty years I practiced law, and if I didn't do something for the client, I did not get paid. And if I brought a case on a contingent basis and lost, I lost it; the client paid nothing. That is a wonderful thing in America for middle America and the poor Americans. If you can think up a better system, think it up, because it has worked over the years. And, yes, our business leadership doesn't like it. They call it frivolous suits. What trial lawyer has time for a frivolous suit? He doesn't get anything if it is frivolous; it is going to get thrown out. 
So the proof of the pudding on frivolous suits is to try them and win, and the lawyers will quit bringing those kinds of cases if 
they are frivolous. We don't have time for frivolous suits, sham claims, and those kinds of things that they talk about. We bring good cases. We bring good cases, and we make a mark. 
That is exactly what has happened here with respect to this case. They went to the attorneys general, and the attorneys general finally got together with the companies. And the companies are saying: Well, we are winning these cases but it is costing us $500- to $600 million in lawyer's fees. 
Now we want to control lawyer's fees. They never have, over here, worried about really making money--this crowd over on the other side of the aisle. I have never seen a more sham performance than they are worried about anybody making money. Otherwise, I have been up here, and if there is an outrage, it is this billable hour crowd where `I don't know the law so I charge you as a client so much per hour to go up in the library on the weekend.' It is my call, and if I can stay ignorant long enough and go up more weekends, I get more money. 
That is the crowd that ought to be controlled. The Senators around here have been involved in various hearings now that owe all kinds of millions in billable hours to downtown lawyers to come and look at their records and everything else of that kind. That is the outrage that bothers this particular Senator, not the lawyers who really brought the case and did something. 
And none of it is 25 percent. The truth be out and the fact is--and charge me for this; it is going in the Congressional Record--8 percent is what is going in with respect to these cases in Florida, Mississippi, Texas, and Minnesota. But they throw around 25 percent and everything else of that kind, and all of it is subject to arbitration and agreement. 
In the Texas case, they already have been petitioned by the distinguished Governor of Texas, and they are in a hearing, and I do not know whether it will lead to arbitration; I haven't kept up with it. But the States know how to look out for themselves. To this States rights crowd on the other side of the aisle, now all of a sudden all the attorneys general are dumb, don't know what they are doing, and we have to protect the farmer, the filling station operator, and the repairman at the garage. 
Isn't it interesting, Mr. President. There is no plaintiff up here complaining, no plaintiff ever complaining about lawyer's fees. Who is complaining? The crowd that is crying is the one that is causing the injury. They posture themselves that they are looking out for the filling station operator and the working lady and the laundry woman and everybody else like that--poor America. 
The only way to get a lawyer is to go in and get good representation on a contingency basis. Isn't it interesting. You find me the plaintiff who has come up and said, `I get paid too much money.' They are tickled to death to get anything, because if you left it to the corporate crowd, they wouldn't get anything. I know. I have been in the game. I have watched it over the years. 
But be that as it may, they made that agreement and they said on a contingent basis, which now averages out to 8 percent --despite that sign of pejorative terms--just to excite people around here and throw poison about, drinking with the Devil and all. They have all the wonderful little expressions, but I wish they would come out in the Chamber and debate this thing, because I am ready to debate it and stand up when they end up with their peroration that we ought to be ashamed. 
Well, I am proud. I am proud of this particular initiative made by the lawyers and the States attorneys general, because they made that agreement and they went in never having won before. They put in their own money. And go to the distinguished Attorney General Mike Moore of Mississippi. Mr. President, you were an attorney general. Can you imagine bringing a case in the State of Washington and having the Governor of Washington sue you because you brought the case--not just say, `General Gorton, I think you might be mistaken.' Just sue you. Just sue you and make you hire a lawyer to defend yourself to do your job. 
That is Mike Moore, from Mississippi. He fought that. Had to get in his own pocket, and hire lawyers there the whole time. 
Otherwise, they had to hide witnesses that they got from the company. For 2 years they chased them around. They tried everything in the world to intimidate their witnesses. They really went on a struggle to come this far. And some of the lawyers they are talking about--I am not that intimate to the case--have yet to get a red cent. They have millions of dollars invested in time and effort--discovery, interrogatories, appeals, appearances, travel, on and on and on, on behalf of the public of America, and they are the ones who are doing the job and not these Senators with this particular amendment. 
Because if they were really interested in billable hours, I would refer to some of them here who are listed by none other than our friend, Steve Forbes. I worked closely with Steve Forbes. He was always asking me for more money. I was chairman of a subcommittee of State, Justice, Commerce, and he had Radio Free Europe, and Liberty. I really respect him. He is a wonderful fellow, a dedicated American. He did an outstanding job. But don't let him act like he never saw this town, because he has, and he has been asking the town and the Government for more money. 
But he listed here, since they brought in Intel--I just got this at the first thing--Andrew S. Grove, and he gets $164 million compensation a year, coming down to $77,000 an hour. Where is the bill about the predatory greed, corruption, `Sultan of Smoke,' outrage, predatory, right on down the line? They don't say that Grove is all of those nasty things. They say that is pretty good. Right on. And I agree with that. I admire him. 
I have been to the Intel plant in Dublin, Ireland. I have to tell that. I have to enjoy something this afternoon. Just to show how we do work with industry, I walked into the Intel plant, a billion-dollar plant outside of Dublin, and when I walked in the distinguished head of the plant named Frank McCabe--I know everything I say is going to be checked. In a campaign, they have nothing but lawyers and billable hours to check everything you say, so write that down--Frank McCabe is his name. And he said, `Governor, glad to see you.' 
Well, I don't remember him. But I remember him now, because he was with General Electric in Irmo, a plant we brought to Irmo, SC; GE. He was there for 10 years, managing that beautiful operation, and $1 billion invested. 
He said, `You know how I got it operating and up and in the black?' 
I said, `No, how is that, Frank?' 
He said, `I went back and sent teams to Columbia, SC, where you had Midlands Tech, and we copied your technical training for skills, and we have it over here in Ireland.' 
So, we do not speak casually or critically of Mr. Grove. I am proud of him. I wish I had the ability to make $77,000 an hour. 
The next fellow here is Mr. Eisner. Oh, I know him, and he is a wonderful operator. I have been out, talked to a board of young folks. I don't know the official name of that board, but I can tell you they were the smartest young gentlemen I ever met, and ladies. They cross-examined me and they knew more about what was going on in Washington than any group with whom I have met. They were really updated and had very thoughtful questions, and I learned from them. So I don't speak critically. 
But they got Michael D. Eisner here. Steve Forbes lists him down at $245 million, or $120,000 an hour. Where is the bill? Here is a fellow who has more than your $90-some thousand or $80-some thousand. The floor is cleared. They are not around. There is no amendment to grab Eisner at $120,000 an hour. 
Then, there is Stephen Hilbert. He gets $350 million, or $170,000 an hour. Man, this thing is going up, up, and away. I better start subscribing to this magazine and see where I can get out of this political rut, trying to defend the working people of America, those who cannot afford billable-hour lawyers--who cannot afford a lawyer, period--but can come in and if they have a claim or have a chance or whatever. 
One of the last cases I handled, I said, `I don't think too much of that case.' Well, the lady said, `Mr. Hollings, we have been to four other law firms and finally the sergeant out there at the police station, he said that you didn't mind trying the cases. And what I am telling you is right. I wasn't at fault.' 
Well, it looked to me the way she described the particular injury, and the case that had come about, they had to have a moving bridge. If someone is ever interested, I will go, because I took that case all the way up past the circuit court of appeals in Richmond, and we won it. I worked for a year and a half easily, almost 2 years, my partner and myself. We had a fortune tied up in that. I wish I had the time to go into it this afternoon, it was very interesting. The point is, we didn't know we were going to get anything for that 2-year period until the end when we finally prevailed. 
I could go down the list. Wait a minute--Sanford Weill, Travelers Group, $434 million--$200,000 an hour. Where are they? Man, come on. Don't give me about this $80,000 an hour or $1,000 an hour. We have people in America making $200,000 an hour. Yes. Yes. They are ashamed all right. They wouldn't come out here. They won't come out because they know what we are telling is the truth about this situation. 
What goes into an agreement is a lot of things listed here: the time and labor, that is the billable hour; then the novelty and difficulty of the question; the skill requisite; the preclusion of other employment--you can go down the list of these things, on and on, about the tests, the experience, reputation, ability, the attorneys involved, the undesirability. 
Can you imagine bringing a case more undesirable than to have your own Governor sue you for bringing the case and everybody else chasing you around and calling you predatory, and `Sultans of Smoke,' and everything else like that, when what you have done was agreed upon by the State? 
And no, no, no, Senator from Wyoming, we don't have a responsibility other than to leave that one alone; and the one in Florida alone; and the contract in Texas alone--because those were contracts made and cases disposed of without the Congress of the United States under formal agreement. 
We are all good enough Americans to realize we are not going to abrogate the agreement or contract or whatever it is. 
Even if we wanted to write it into this particular bill, we couldn't do it. Those are agreements made when we were sleeping at the switch and not doing anything about children smoking. Now, we are all in heat--`children smoking,' `we've got to look out for the children,' `they're victims, victims.' People are bringing in their relatives saying they are victims, smoking for years on end. For 30 years we have been telling them the best we could about the danger to your health on a package of cigarettes. 
There it is. There it is, Mr. President. They want to come in now with this assault, about how they are saving people, totally misrepresenting the record. There isn't any question about it, starting with the Hugh Rodham sign and going down to billable allowance and our duty and 25 percent and the outrageous--outrageous--words again and again and again. 
Now, what's afoot? Well, any and everything on this bill, unfortunately, because we have drugs, we have tax cuts for marriage penalties, we have all kinds of little provisions here and little provisions there. If you take the political polls, they say, as they said in Henry VI, `Kill all the lawyers.' That is what Dick the Butcher said. But it was the greatest compliment we ever had, I say to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my most distinguished friend, because they wanted to start anarchy and tyranny in that vast land. They knew as long as there was a living lawyer to protect individual rights, anarchy could not prevail. So Dick the Butcher shouts, `First, we must kill all the lawyers.' But, of course, this crowd over here could care less about Shakespeare, and they are the ones who should be ashamed of themselves, absolutely ashamed of themselves bringing on this onslaught, taking up this time on a matter we have already voted upon. 
Why? Because we have the billable hour crowd downtown. A lot of good friends I have, and I have gotten most every award you can find from the Chamber of Commerce. I love them, but they even have TV ads about trial lawyers, trial lawyers. If they ever get in trouble, tell them to get one, because they don't want to get a corporate billable hour lawyer sitting on his duff up on the 32nd floor looking at his oriental rugs, at his mahogany desk, blinking his eyes, waiting to go to the club and charging you for it. 
It reminds me of a Sam Ervin story, when he was a Senator here, about that poor doctor down there in North Carolina. He said the gentleman practiced medicine for 32 years and never had a vacation. He finally got his son out of med school and said, `Son, your mother and I are going to have to take off for a couple of weeks. You have to take over because we have never had a vacation.' 
He came back off vacation and was talking to his son. 
`Dad, you know Mrs. Hurleeha?" 
He said, `Yes, that's the lady with the bad back.' 
The son said, `She doesn't have a bad back.' 
`My God, son, did you settle that case? She paid your way through med school.' 
If you don't kill them, you can charge them, and if you don't bring the case to court and keep on studying it, you get into this billable hour thing. That is exactly what is going on. 
They have it with respect to the product liability, with the Coast Guard bill, the transportation bill. Anytime that corporate America can hammer on lawyers who really are bringing about safety, bringing about good health, bringing about the end of smoking in America, you have done something. 
Let's get to the point. The greatest call upon any profession, Mr. President, is to rid itself of the profession. Specifically, if the ministers can get rid of all sin, the doctors all disease, the greatest call upon the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee and me is to get rid of all injury cases. 
When I came up here 32 years ago, just about, one of the first things was Love Canal. We had all the toxic fumes and the people dying. What happened? We didn't sit around when it was brought to our attention, by whom? Trial lawyers. We put in the 
Environmental Protection Agency. And it bothers some people getting those EPA statements, environmental statements, but they have saved a lot of injury. It has saved a lot of lives. We have a much, much more healthy America. 
Similarly speaking, we found little children burning up with flammable blankets in the cribs. The trial lawyers said, `Look, there is no sense trying these and winning and getting money; let's stop burning up the children. Let's get a Consumer Product Safety Commission.' 
I have been in test labs where they test not only the toys, not only the cribs, but all the particular devices that go into the kitchen as to safety, and we have corporate America on a safety course. 
Ask Ford Motor Company. Just the week before last, they recalled 1,700,000 Ford pickup trucks. Why? Because of Mark Robinson out there with the Pinto case in San Diego. Mr. President, 20 years ago, he got a verdict of $3.5 million actual damages and $125 million punitive damages. He hasn't collected a dime on the punitive damages, but we in America have collected on it, because that is why they are calling in these things now. Time and again every week--Chrysler, just before that, called in hatchbacks. These automobile companies don't just get a CPA to factor in the cause of the injury--`We can afford that rather than pay the lawyers; we just settle the cases'--they are putting out safe products in America. And Europe is following our example. 
So what happens then? Along comes the trial lawyers with the attorneys general. They have come in now and not taxed anybody. When I heard this figure last June, I was almost in shock. I have worked on the defense budget for 28, 29 years on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. The actual amount is $250 billion, but when they came up with $368 billion, I said my newspaper has gone loco. They don't know how to print things. They have a mistake here. They came up with $368 billion and said just increased a modest amount, and they are saying, `Oh, Congress is up there, tax and spend.' And that is the companies' ads. They are the ones who agreed to it. It was their idea. 
Come on, we have gotten totally off track here with this political charade that has been going on with attorneys' fees. `We'll come back again, and if we can't get $1,000, we'll come back for another amount; we'll come back next year, and we shall return,' like MacArthur. Come on, they know better. We will not put in here to get the billable hours crowd downtown and limit them and or take these corporation fellows who `deserve' what they get. `They produce,' and don't tell me the trial lawyers don't produce. We are here. No Congressman brought us here. No Senator brought us here. The trial lawyers brought us here on this particular initiative. 
It is greed, trying to get even more, acting like we are the ones giving the fees. As the Senator from Wyoming says, the provisions are in here for responsibility of arbitration. You wouldn't have found 19 Senators who would have reported this bill out for a reckless 25 percent and billions and billions of dollars like they are talking about. It is less than what corporate America is doing, riding around smiling. I met with that crowd. I like the carpetbagger up in the Northeast and Boston and New York. 
When you are a young Governor, they will let you in the door. And we have the blue chips, corporate America, down there. Now we travel over to Europe and Latin America, and we have--and we are proud of it--the hundreds of Hondas, the Hoffmann La Rouches, the BMWs. 
But I can tell you here and now, let us not as a Congress bog down into this political thing on account of pollster politics and start limiting fees. Let us let them make their agreements. Let us, as a Federal program, have an arbitration like we have in everything else. They have subjected themselves, I know, in Mississippi and otherwise, to arbitration. The trial lawyers will agree with that. Let us get away from all of this onslaught of Hugh Rodham, Hillary's brother, everything else like that, that they might think is a good thing to put on national TV so they can get on C-SPAN and go again and again at the particular bill that we have before us. 
Mr. President, as a question, we had hearings on this. And there is a legal question. I am sure the chairman of the Judiciary Committee will get into it.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I wish to bring to the Senate's attention a milestone that has particular relevance to this body. Mrs. Frankie Welch, who is nationally recognized for her artistic and original scarf and tie designs, is celebrating 30 years of fashion design this month. Frankie was born in Georgia, but I am pleased to say she has strong ties to South Carolina, where she graduated with a degree from Furman University in Greenville. It was at Furman that she met her late husband, William Welch. One of their daughters chose to continue the family tradition and also received a Furman diploma. 
Frankie Welch has designed many memorable scarves and ties. In the 1980s, she designed a patriotic scarf for the United States Senate. She has designed ties for Presidents Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and Bill Clinton. Mrs. Welch also designed a gown for First Lady Betty Ford, which Mrs. Ford donated to the Smithsonian Institution's First Ladies Collection in 1976. Frankie and Mrs. Ford remained good friends; last month, on the occasion of Betty Ford's 80th birthday, Frankie was one of the speakers at the Ford Museum in Grand Rapids. 
Frankie Welch is no ordinary fashion designer. She often employs her talents to produce patriotic garments, and her designs demonstrate an exemplary love of our country. She has produced original and widely admired fabric designs for such revered institutions as the St. Paul's Cathedral in London, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the White House, and the U.S. Capital. Frankie is also a philanthropist: she recently began the Frankie Welch Scholarship for outstanding students of fashion design. 
Mr. President, I think it appropriate to honor a woman who has so often turned her talents to patriotic themes and who has attained national and international accolades. It is with great pride that I thank Frankie Welch for honoring our country and congratulate her on thirty years of success.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a fellow South Carolinian for outstanding service and dedication to this Nation. I take great pleasure in congratulating Yeoman First Class Stephen R. Dykema for his selection as the 1997 Enlisted Person of the Year for the U.S. Coast Guard. 
Each day more than 25,000 enlisted men and women put their lives and safety on the line to carry out the Coast Guard's diverse missions. The Coast Guard plays a critical role as an armed service in defending our Nation and maintaining national security. In addition, the Coast Guard annually conducts thousands of fisheries enforcement boardings; prevents tons of cocaine and marijuana from reaching the streets; gives safety instruction to more than one-half million recreational boaters; and saves about 5,000 lives. The American public has learned to depend on the Coast Guard's service, both close to home and in trouble spots around the world. 
That service is built on a tradition of dedication by Coast Guard enlisted personnel. Yeoman First Class Stephen R. Dykema is an individual who epitomizes that tradition. Petty Officer Dykema was selected as the 1997 Enlisted Person of the Year because of his exemplary military bearing, leadership ability and work performance. He currently is assigned to the Training Center in Cape May, New Jersey. However, he has spent much of his time assigned to the cutter Madrona, a buoy tender stationed in my hometown of Charleston. 
Throughout his nine-year Coast Guard career, Petty Officer Dykema has received numerous medals and commendations. But I'd like to highlight just one incident that really shows why he has earned the honor of being named as Enlisted Person of 1997. During one of the Madrona's longer deployments that year, a box of mail was lost. Among the box's content were bills, family letters, care packages, and Father's Day cards--all those routine types of correspondence upon which a sailor's morale depends. Petty Officer Dykema swung into action, launching a personal search for the missing box of mail. His documentation of the box's history was so thorough that the day after it was released, the unit that had received the mail called to make arrangements for getting the box to Charleston. 
Petty Officer Dykema also is one of those rare individuals who finds time to contribute to his shipmates and community. I'm told that he has used his personal time to help fellow crewmembers repay overpayments and helped people with their travel claims and housing problems. He also has been involved in helping those less fortunate with clothing and food and plays the keyboard and sings every Sunday at his church. 
In short, Yeoman First Class Stephen Dykema has earned the recognition he has received as Enlisted Person of 1997. This young man is a credit to the Coast Guard, to South Carolina, and to this Nation.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on April 18, 1998, this body mourned the passing of a distinguished and beloved former colleague, Terry Sanford of North Carolina. In the days following Terry's death, I heard many moving tributes to him on this floor. And at his funeral in North Carolina, I heard eloquent eulogies and heartfelt testimonials to his greatness. But I have heard no tribute to Terry Sanford more sincere or beautiful than that of Joel Fleishman, who was a good friend to Terry Sanford and whom I, too, am proud to claim as a friend. Mr. Fleishman's tribute evokes the qualities that made Terry Sanford a great statesman and educator, and it reminds us all of the importance of principled public servants to a republic such as ours.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate consideration of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act bill, the so-called ISTEA bill. 
This bill sets priorities and funds for surface transportation projects and programs for the next six years. It is the product of many months of negotiations between the House and the Senate and between Members on both sides of the aisle. We have managed to come together on this bill by compromise and a willingness to listen to all points of view for the good of the nation and the States. 
As ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee, I can tell you that the provisions in the Commerce Committee title of the bill were the product of intense negotiations for many weeks. But the way to judge our efforts is the result and I am proud of what has been achieved. 
We have provisions to strengthen the safety of motor vehicle air bags and to allow States to design programs to raise the percentage of their citizens who use seat belts. In addition, we have given the Secretary of Transportation the flexibility to design additional commercial motor vehicle safety programs. We have authorized a program to provide funds for the development of rail and intermodal projects. These programs will allow us to expand the nation's infrastructure. Most importantly, the bill contains funds to replace our crumbling bridges and roads. Together these programs will provide our citizens with safer bridges and roads and additional infrastructure will allow our citizens to compete in the world market. 
Commerce Committee provisions also address the needs of recreational boaters and anglers. The bill extends the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund and recovers a greater portion of the federal fuel taxes paid by boaters and anglers. In addition, Commerce Committee provisions ensure that funds are available to make boating safer, more accessible, and environmentally cleaner for the 76 million Americans--more than one-fourth of the nations's population--who go boating each year. Finally, the bill extends programs to restore and protect sportfish resources and strengthens efforts to introduce segments of the American public . . . especially our youth . . . to the healthy fun of fishing and boating. 
I take this opportunity to thank the staff of the Commerce Committee for their efforts on behalf of this bill, and indeed, on behalf of all of us. 
Mr. President, I urge passage of this important piece of legislation.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in response to my distinguished colleague from North Carolina, Senator Faircloth, as the saying goes around here--and it is genuine--I have the greatest respect and friendship for the distinguished Senator. He and I have known each other for a good 30, 40 years almost. 
I really am a little dismayed and disappointed to see this assault on attorneys' fees in the context of what is ethical on behalf of trial lawyers. When they put a billboard up with respect to ethical practices and making millions--we will get the board, I guess, and have it displayed. 
But let me say a word, Mr. President, about lawyers themselves. A lot has occurred over my few years of public service. In the early days, what we had in the State legislature was about 85 percent of the membership was practicing attorneys. Today, fewer than 15 percent are practicing attorneys. That has come about, in a sense, as a result of billable hours. 
When we came out of the war and set up our practices, what really occurred was we had to do services for the client, whether it was in the field of real estate, whether it was in the field of a criminal charge, or whatever. It was an agreed-to fee or, in many instances, a contingent fee on winning the case. That is how I grew up as an attorney, which characterizes me now as a `trial lawyer'--I hope not an unethical one. 
I was listening very closely to the Senator from North Carolina. The best I can tell is he used the expression `litigation explosion.' We can get into that. We have debated that, and we found through various studies made by the Rand Corporation for corporate America that there is no litigation explosion. 
`Corrupted our justice system.' The nearest thing I could find out was the fee itself, and it was too large, as the distinguished Senator surmised, and that in itself was unethical. 
We know that people make money. I understand that the fellow on Headline News today, William Gates, a very, very successful entrepreneur, never completed college, but he is a genius with a business worth some $39 billion. He makes, doing nothing, just $125,000. I know he has a modest salary, but it would only go to the tax folks. But he operates, and he operates very successfully. They have 21,000 employees there at that Microsoft entity. Every one of the 21,000 is a millionaire due to the leadership and accomplishment of Mr. Gates. 
Now, that is what is to be considered when we talk about trial lawyers taking on a noncase and developing a case. That really nettles my corporate friends. Incidentally, I should say this, that the corporate friends have been mine over the many, many years, as they well know from my votes here in the U.S. Senate. And we are very proud of the industrial development we have in South Carolina and the efforts of our Chamber of Commerce there. They are highly regarded, highly respected. But they had not gotten into this limbo, so to speak, of being unethical when you win a case. 
Specifically speaking, going to lawyers generally, it is the genius of America that fashioned this great Republic. Lawyers, if you please, you can go back, Mr. President, to the earliest days. `Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God. I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death!'--a lawyer, Patrick Henry. 
Or otherwise that 30-some-year-old, with quill in hand, seated at that table, `We hold these truths self-evident, that all men are created equal.'--Thomas Jefferson, the lawyer. 
The most applicable one, Mr. President, to this present day, `But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the greatest difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed and in the next place oblige it to control itself.'--that is our problem now--James Madison, a lawyer. 
Or the Emancipation Proclamation--Abraham Lincoln, a lawyer. Or in the darkest days of the Depression, bringing about not only economic revival, but equal justice under law, `All we have to fear is fear itself.'--Franklin Roosevelt, a lawyer. Or giving substance to equal justice under law-- Thurgood Marshall. 
I know the abhorrence some have for my friend, Morris Dees, down there with the Southern Poverty Law Center, or with Ralph Nader keeping the conscience clear with respect to consumer safety in America. But these are lawyers who are out leading the way. 
There is no question, Mr. President, that there is no higher calling for a profession than to eliminate itself. If the ministers could eliminate all sin and the doctors all disease, we lawyers are burdened with the challenge of trying to eliminate injury in cases. When I first came to the Senate that was really what was at hand, what you might call class actions. 
Up there in Buffalo, NY, Love Canal, toxic fumes, poisonous air. And as a result of the class actions there, the next thing you know what we had was the Environmental Protection Agency, which in and of itself, despite those who criticize the bureaucracy of it, has eliminated not only the injury and drinking their own sewage and breathing their own toxic fumes, but eliminated thousands and thousands of individual cases. 
Then next, of course, we had the matter of the asbestos cases. We had the cases with respect to the Dalkon Shield, breast implants; we had the cases of the little children burning up in flammable blankets in their cribs. And we got the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I just talked the other day to the chairman there who is doing the outstanding job that she is doing at the Consumer Product Safety Commission looking at all of these 
particular instrumentalities. 
And good corporate America does just that. The J.C. Penney Company--there is no more outstanding firm. I have visited their laboratories where they have instituted safety tests of all the articles to be sold, particularly in the field of children's toys, and what have you. So the trial lawyers brought that about. 
And, Mr. President, just this past week I noticed a little squib in the Times. They had down there that Ford Motor Company had recalled an engine. They took the initiative of recalling 1,700,000 pickup trucks because the link bolt on the wheel was loose. The wheel threatened to come off and cause an injury. 
Now, Ford Motor Company was not particularly enthused about safety, we know, because back in 1978 Mark Robinson had to bring that Pinto case. And they got a verdict of $3.5 million actual damages and a verdict of $125 million punitive damages. No, they never collected a dime, I don't believe, for those punitive damages. 
But I say to the Senator from North Carolina, I can tell you now, that saved a lot of injury and a lot of cases, because Chrysler has just had a recall that I saw in the news. And you can go right on down. That brought about attention to safety and people not burning up and having the wheels lock on them, and those kinds of things, and coming off and causing that injury. 
That brings us, Mr. President, to the present case at hand, which, in essence, was not a case at all. I never heard of bringing in, in a class action, the tobacco companies and getting them to agree not to sell their product, but rather to advertise adversely not to sell, not to attract; on the other hand, agreeing, if you please, to a look-back provision whereby they would be burdened with the beauty of diminishing business for themselves, tobacco consumption, particularly in the field for little children, and raising the price of their product whereby the moneys would go then to the attorneys general and the U.S. Government to help pay these expenses, and so forth. That was not a case that was just filed and tried a few weeks later, and they got a verdict. 
On the contrary, it was a long, hard, contingency struggle with a guarantee not only to get nothing had it not succeeded--and none have succeeded so far. I repeat, no one has sued a tobacco company and gotten a jury verdict as of this minute, period. But they said, we think we can do it if you let us try; and we will take it on a contingent basis. I do not know what the percentage is down in Florida or Texas or Mississippi where they have settled--somewhere around 10, 15 percent or whatever. 
The States, the health community, the U.S. Government had nothing to lose. The lawyers bringing this pioneering, if you please, health care for all of America, they had everything to lose. In fact, a fine attorney general down there, Mike Moore, had to really withstand being sued by his own Governor of his own State of Mississippi trying to prevent him from bringing the case. 
Don't give me this billable hours or $180,000 an hour or $5 an hour or whatever it is. This isn't any hourly thing. This is a no-case situation whereby you turn around and have to pay legal fees to defend yourself 
in order to bring the case, and he withstood that for a year in the courts with his reputation relatively ruined, but holding on. Then after they won that, they literally had to hide the witness and secure his safety because they had a whistleblower in one of the companies who was willing to bring forth the records and say here they are, here is the actual fact within the company records, here is what they stated, here is what their research found, here are their plans on advertising and here are the ingredients they also included in order to bring about addiction. They had to hide the witness. 
Don't give me billable hours. I don't know how much hog farmers make. I am waiting for my friend to come back, but I know the lawyers make nothing unless they succeed in bringing this case. Now, of course, having done that, and getting these other lawyers in, his friend, Dickey Scruggs, and Ron Motley from my State of South Carolina, they had an expert approach. If a painter paints a $10 million painting, I don't know how much he gets an hour for painting it, but you have to have expertise. 
The ingenuity of using the RICO provision of the distinguished Senator from Utah, that is what they did. They said we can use the RICO provision and really go after them. And that was a wonderful, ingenious approach to the actual trial of this particular class action. You have to understand all along nobody over the 3-year period is paying anybody a red cent when they talk about billable hours. So they brought their case, they struggled along, and they got right to the point where it was going to be exposed, that particular record of the unethical. 
My distinguished friend on the other side of the aisle has a sign up there about ethical; it is the unethical conduct of the corporate lawyers, not the trial lawyers. They have not mentioned one thing unethical other than they won the case and they will get a good fee. They deserve every dime of it and more. They ought to get some kind of award from the health community because this will save us billions and billions of dollars in cost, in health care, hundreds and thousands and perhaps millions of lives from cancer deaths. 
Not Dr. Kessler, not Dr. Koop, but Mike Moore, Dickey Scruggs, Ron Motley have done more to save people from cancer than Koop and Kessler combined, and Koop and Kessler have tried their best, but there is more than one way to skin a cat. No one in Congress was at that table. There wasn't any Senator--`I introduced the bill.' There wasn't any Congressman, `I sponsored, I cosponsored,' all of this `I' stuff. Now they have a lynch mob going on because the polls show that lawyers are unpopular, particularly trial lawyers. 
I have a friend in town here, sends me a thank-you note at Christmas, Victor Schwartz. We have been in this routine 20 years. Victor represents the business round table and the Chamber of Commerce, and he gets the conference board and he gets all these retainers so long as he doesn't win the case. It reminds me of Sam Ervin's famous story about the doctor who practiced there in Monroe, NC, for some 32 years all by himself. Finally, he had a young son who graduated from medical school and he turned to him and said, `Son, I haven't had a vacation in 32 years. I am taking off with your mother for a couple of weeks.' He comes back and the son walks up to him and he says, `You know Ms. Smith, Daddy?' `What about her?' He said, `There is really no arthritis in her back, I got that thing cured.' He said, `Oh, my heavens. That is the patient that sent you through med school. Why did you do that?' 
You can solve cases, but that is our problem with most lawyers now. As long as they can get a continuance, as long as they can make a motion, as long as they can delay, as long as they bureaucratize the judicial system--and that is the corporate defendant crowd. The plaintiff doesn't win until he concludes a case. He has no time; he has about five or six cases waiting, a lot of time out there, a lot of money, a lot of time investigating everything else. What happens is that he finally scores, but he 
not only scores for himself, he scores here in this particular case for all of America, because they met last June and they had the sensibility not to be greedy. The inference is that you have a greedy bunch that is unethical; they are getting too much. Not at all. 
The fact is, they had the sensibility to say, like Kansas City, there is only so far that we can go. There has to be balance. If we put them out of business, if we continue to pressure and take legitimate companies out of business, then what will happen is that newcomers without these records that are really bringing about the settlements for us, they won't have any records of any kind of additives. They won't have any records of any kind of lies to Members of Congress or anything of that kind. They won't have any records of agreeing not to advertise or agreeing to advertise adversely to children, or agreeing to a look-back provision. What we will do, like Samson, is pull down the temple walls and ruin us all and we will have gotten nowhere. 
Now, we understand here this week we can get nowhere. We can start with lawyer fees. We can start with $1.50, $2 a pack, up, up and away. We can have impossible look-back penalties and everything else of that kind, but this isn't the end of Congress. We will be back and we can always amend what we never have tried before, like look-back and nonadvertising agreements. 
But my counsel is let's move on with the provision of the commerce bill which says simply as to the agreements made within the States, we don't disturb them--all of them, as best I can tell, are under arbitration. But as to the new agreements made for lawyers, they are subject to arbitration for both sides and approved by the court itself. Now, there is nothing unethical or untoward or whatever it is. The beginning lawyers who made the case are deserving. The others who are piling on deserve a heck of a lot less. We all know that. 
So we are not just setting an example here of $185,000 for nothing but trial lawyers as the thing is depicted at the present time. 
I can see we have some others that would like to be heard at this particular time. I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if there was any real sincerity or concern about money--and, incidentally, I never have seen my Republican friends ever worry about people making money. You all really are worried about people making money? Come on. You know and I know they would come in here and say, here is the head of Philip Morris--and I got all these things, billable hours--$85,779,000 with stock options there. That is his pay, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
But I can play that game of so much an hour. Let's talk about the 5 years with nothing an hour. `He either fears his fate too much or his dessert is small,' we say in the practice, `to fail to put it to the touch and win or lose it all.' 
And the lawyers in Florida, in Texas, in Minnesota--nothing an hour as of now. Instead of a jackpot, they are hitting a hijacking on the floor of the Senate by a crowd that is trying to make TV shorts that Hollings is in the pocket of the trial lawyers. The truth of it is, I am trying to get into their pocket. I can tell you that right now. And I might succeed. I got some names here from the different Senators around that seem to know them better than I do. 
But in any event, the comeuppance is that blood, sweat, and tears. There isn't any question about it, by gosh, when you take the little lady who came in, and they decided to bring the case, and he got his friends in and they worked it. And I asked them. I said, `I saw one account they had $5 million invested in the Mississippi case.' They said, `Well, they got that from the asbestos cases and everything else.' Maybe that is what it is; the Chamber of Commerce just doesn't like class actions. But that is cleaning up bad medical devices, the implants, the asbestosis, and now cleaning up tobacco. 
This is not a billable hours thing. They haven't got billable hours. Zero hours, 1993; zero hours, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998. They haven't gotten a dime. And you all are trying to hijack them on what has been agreed to by the attorneys general, by the Governors, by the clients and everything else, preying around like vultures on agreements made. Ex post facto now, they want to come in and show how concerned they are. If you had been concerned, you would have done something about it. I have been up here 30 years, and they haven't done anything other than put the ad on a packet of cigarettes. 
Now we have somebody who has brought tobacco to the bar of justice, and they haven't gotten anything yet--zero hours. And yet you all want to come in here and play this game about you are all worried about who is getting the money. 
Mr. President, it is absolutely ludicrous for this group to 
come in. It is another design. It is just that you take a poll. They don't like lawyers in the poll, so they make the little TV short in the campaign this fall and they say so-and-so is in the pocket of the trial lawyers, yak, yak, yak, and everything else of that kind. But I will show where the attorneys general and the Governors and the parties all agreed and the work did it. And we didn't do it up here in Washington. Now is no time to come in here and start preying on people on an agreement that has already been made.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Texas reminds me of that youngster who went to the psychiatrist. The psychiatrist drew some circles on the blackboard and said, `Now what do you think of?' 
He said, `Sex.' 
He drew lines up and down. The youngster said, `Sex.' 
He drew some crosses. He said, `Sex.' 
The psychiatrist said, `Young man, you're the most oversexed person.' 
The youngster said, `Doc, you're the one drawing the dirty pictures.' 
The Senator from Texas is the one drawing the dirty pictures. I have never heard so many extreme nonsensicals in my life. We want to keep his dear mother here. No one is victimizing her. What we are going to try to do is help the doctors to counsel her to stop smoking. 
Let's get back to last June, almost a year ago, to show you how far out of kilter this thing has gotten. 
What happened was, to the surprise of many--I did not know, and I do not know of any Congressman or Senator who participated. I do not think there was a Congressman at the table. I do not think there was a Senator at the table. But the tobacco companies, together with the States attorneys general and the White House and the health community, announced a dramatic settlement of $368 billion. That is without a Congressman or Senator even thinking in these terms. 
I have been up here 30 years. And I have worked with the Cancer Institute, Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler and others. Thirty-some years ago, yes, we put notification on a pack of cigarettes. And we have admonished--I have seen demonstrations by the Cancer Institute that stopped me from smoking. But we have not done near what was announced last June. 
Last June, the communities got together on the basis of the companies stating, in essence, `Look, we're tired of winning these cases.' As we speak on the floor of the Congress today, no one has won a jury verdict against a tobacco company, period. I think it is in the main, on account of the publicity and the health and the notification of the assumption of risk, that smoking is dangerous to your health. The companies themselves are engaged in advertising Miller High Life Beer, Kraft Foods; different other things of that kind, Ritz Crackers, what have you. 
They are good businessmen. They are not a bunch of crooks, as they are trying to be depicted here once the politicians got this particular issue. They have run a touchdown in all the directions and in all extremes. But what happened was the companies said, `Look, rather than paying out all these costs to lawyers and winning every case after case, why don't we get together and continue in an orderly fashion.' 
We are not going to have prohibition. Even I heard Dr. Koop testify to that before our committee that no, he was not attesting to having prohibition. We are not going to have prohibition of tobacco. Tobacco was here. The Indians were smoking it when we arrived. 
Just the other day we had a celebration with our role model, the former distinguished majority leader, Mike Mansfield, whom when you go to the Mansfield Room, he is very proud of that portrait of himself smoking that pipe. And he is 95 years of age. 
So we live in the world of reality. Hopefully, this Congress will get back to reality and not the nonsense that we have just heard of about taxes and what the idea was and everything else of that kind. 
The idea was to get an arrangement whereby the companies who could win every advertising case about Joe Camel and everything else of that kind says, `We'll stop advertising in this manner. We'll stop spending that money on advertising. We'll stop spending this money on lawyers. And we'll make an agreement with you to pay in so much of our profits. Necessarily, you say that you want to raise the price because that is the best control of tobacco consumption, so we'll go along with raising the price.' 
We live in the real world. I think it is $4 or $5 or something in downtown London. I was visiting with a friend not long ago from Canada. He picked out of his pocket and lit up a cigarette. And I said, `How much, by the way, was that pack?' He said, `This one is $7, but in Canada it is $6 to $10.' You see, that shocks us who really have not paid that close attention. 
I never heard of any $360 billion, and I have been working on the defense budget for years on end. That is only $245 billion. Here we come with an amount that they agreed to pay themselves with an increase in the cost. The politicians coming around hollering, tax, tax, tax--tax and spend, tax and spend, and everything else, including the companies. Under the whole cloth, the tobacco companies are the ones who thought of the idea of taxing $368 billion. And this just carries it up to $500 billion. 
So they are the ones who gave us the idea that let us go ahead and see how much, if you please, Mr. President, you could charge on cigarettes, as much as possible, to try to stop the smoking, pay 
for the advertising, pay the States back for their Medicaid costs, start some children's programs. Yes, they talk about it--tax and spend. The spending is on children, on helping to get children to stop smoking. The distinguished Senator from Texas knows that. We are doing that, and we are going to use that money to try to stop children from smoking. 
And, you know, Mr. President, they went even further than I would have gone if I had been their lawyer or I had been the CEO, and that is take some kind of pledge and penalty for what they call `look back.' It took me a long time--they said, `We're going to be responsible for stopping smoking in America.' 
Now, whoever heard of that? We have been trying to do it with notification on the packages. The health community has been trying it. Every doctor now will counsel you. So there is nothing new. But the tobacco companies are supposed to advertise in an adverse fashion and pay a penalty that goes up, up and away if, as a company, they do not comply or accomplish it. 
Now, that was a pretty solid agreement that has been distorted in every fashion here which does not seem to get any understanding because the jackals have taken over now, cackling up here about tax and spend and everything else of that kind, going into $18,000 an acre, $100,000-an-hour lawyers' fees, and all these other things. 
Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from North Carolina has an amendment that he wants to put in--and I want to yield to him just as promptly as I can--relative to legal fees. And we will debate that and the contribution made by trial lawyers. 
Let me just state ahead of time, categorically--and I am looking over here at a chart that says `Minimal Ethics.' Not at all, absolutely not at all. I have to say something about that chart. I cannot resist the temptation. I have been at the trial bar, and if they think it is anything unethical, we could go to the company lawyers who are now being investigated for conspiring with the company executives on how to avoid these charges and everything else of that kind. 
Man, oh, man, talk about being unethical, after the abuse and the challenge they have been through. There is a little attorney general down there in Mississippi. I was just watching it the other night. I was not that familiar with him--Mike Moore. He literally was sued by his own Governor trying to bring tobacco to the bar of justice. But he stuck to his guns. Maybe they call that unethical bringing that case against the industry, or a contingent fee is unethical. But it goes for the `every mother's son' the best of counsel. And corporate America and the Chamber of Commerce does not like that. 
Billable hours, good Lord have mercy, we are going to get into a good debate on billable hours. And there are 60,000 of them registered to practice in the District of Columbia, 60,000--oh, they got all lawyers in Japan right here in the District--59,000 
will never see a courtroom or know anything about law. It's fixing me and fixing this one and that one. It's fixing the jury. Unethical? Unethical? I want to hear what is unethical about trial lawyers compared to the billable hour crowd. 
But back to the Senator from Texas, and he was talking about the amount of money, the billions here, to buy out the farmers. At least we are paying the farmers who have been making a good living to get out of that, not for those who didn't make a living, went broke, and we came and gave them food stamps to the tune of 431 billion bucks, Resolution Trust Company. Half of it was in the State of Texas. We bought every swimming pool, every tennis court, every golf course, every country club that you could possibly imagine. It was improperly financed. You and I know it. Over $200 billion to one State. But they want to talk about honest, hard-working tobacco farmers out there at the sweat of their brow being bought out of this particular business, coming up here with all these fanciful figures; $18,000 an acre--that takes care of the warehouse, that takes care of the bank on the loan, that takes care of the equipment, that takes care of the community, that takes care of his children. 
When he is out of the business, how do you send them to college? So you let them come in on Pell grants. Yes, it is a comprehensive approach. The LEAF Act is intended, because we saw last fall that the chairman of the Agriculture Committee wanted to just put them out of business, and not take care of the communities. 
I have I don't know how many farmers in South Carolina, I think about 2,000 tobacco farms, over $200 million, a big cash crop. So when we saw that, we moved. I want to say this categorically and just dispassionately, how shocked and dismayed I am to get into this particular situation. The record ought to reflect it. When we saw the chairman of the Agriculture Committee who said he had seen polls and everybody in tobacco farming wanted to get out of it, which is out of the whole cloth. I have been traveling to tobacco farmers, campaigning, crisscrossing all over the State. I never saw the tobacco farmers trying to get out of the business, but that is what he said. 
I said we are really in trouble. The distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, and I, we have the LEAF Act and, yes, we positioned it. We knew what we were doing because the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee came to me and said, `Evidently, they are going to have a tough time getting a bill out of any committee, and the majority leader asked if we can get one out of our committee. I would like to have it bipartisan,' the chairman said. I said, `I would like to have it bipartisan, too, but we have to take care of the farmers.' 
He hesitated a few days and came back and said, `All right, we will take care of the farmers.' And we went all the way down to Florence and said the LEAF Act was taken care of, taking care of the farmers. The President of the United States went out to Kentucky and said the LEAF Act is taking care of farmers. We had five conferences trying to get this bill finalized with the White House, with the Republican majority and with the Democratic minority to work out what we could, to get a comprehensive policy and get it over to the House side. Each time we checked, the LEAF Act was there, undisturbed. 
Now, last night, out of the clear blue--which is one of the reasons I wanted the floor--we get Senator Lugar's bill which had one hearing last fall, I think last September, according to the record, never a markup, and get this whining out here about equal treatment. Why we have to give him--the Agriculture Committee likes the bill, had been marked up and reported, like ours had been worked upon. No, we have been hedging against that nonsense of the Lugar approach since last fall and working around the clock, locking down everything, and they come and tell us that they couldn't avoid it. They had to get a majority of the Commerce Committee members. I am dismayed the chairman voted with that majority. After all our work trying to work together. That 
explains my statement yesterday about the bipartisanship. 
Now, back to just exactly what we have here with respect to being victimized and everything else of that kind. I think that agreement, having been worked out within the Commerce Committee and all of these conferences and everything else, was a pretty judicious instrument in that you cannot have tobacco farmers, Senator, unless there are tobacco companies. You can put the companies out of business. We have a mob scene here, a lynch mob coming forward; get rid of the company. 
Every time we agreed on something, Senator McCain and I heard from different groups, `more, more, more, they are liars,' they are this, they are that. Let's agree on all of that, you can put them out of business. Then McCain and Hollings can start their own tobacco company or maybe it would be Sessions and Hollings. It would be a pretty good business. All we have to do is get the tobacco from Turkey. We don't have any false records they can go and embarrass us with--juries and everything else of that kind. We can go back and get old Joe Camel and start advertising again. Ain't nothing wrong with that. They tried end on end before the courts to kick out their advertising, constitutional right, first amendment, and we can go make a living, and what has happened? Nothing for the children. 
So that is a pretty good political charade to come out on the floor of the Senate and say, now, is it tax or is it for the children, and analyze it in this tricky mind as being just a tax. It is an increase in price. You don't have to pay it. It is voluntary. I quit smoking. They say more than half of the people could quit smoking. Yes, it is addictive to some, just like alcohol. We could say get rid of Ronald McDonald, advertising fat for the children. Go after that. With that, I can agree with the Senator from Texas. 
When you come right down to it, it is a balancing act that we are engaged in, and nobody wants to acknowledge it. We can get rid of the tobacco companies, but that does nothing for us at all. It doesn't do anything for the health community. It doesn't do anything for the children. It doesn't do anything for the payments to be made. This is money going back to the States. It doesn't do anything for the programs. It doesn't do anything for the look back. It doesn't do anything to anything. 
So these people that run around and want $1.50 and more and more and more, don't even understand the problem, don't even understand what we are trying to do on the floor of the Senate with the tobacco bill. 
We are trying to go along with respectable companies--yes, they did stand up and falsely state that they didn't think it was addicting and everything, but those folks are gone. If you don't think they have exactly, just tell the truth. Go over to the Defense Department and get their civil and criminal docket and you will find true blue chip corporations of America trying to defraud the government at every turn. It is a sad thing. 
Then I have to look up here at minimal ethics in the business crowd. I talked to my friend, Tom Donohue, yesterday and I worked with him. I have every chamber of commerce award that you could possibly get. 
But to get up here and let this legalistic crowd take over and start controlling--here is the Republican movement that doesn't want to have price controls, wants to deregulate, wants to get rid of the Government, and now wants to fix prices, wants to fix fees. How can you tell when these lawyers have really made the case? It isn't an hourly thing. Until last June, there wasn't any case. Nobody has made any--they have gotten some settlements. I know the best of the best from my hometown tried one for ancillary smoke--what do you call it? Voluntary smoke? Involuntary smoke? Whatever it is--up in Indiana during the months of February and March, and even he lost that. 
We are saying that you are not going to have any more immunity, or have a limit on the immunity. They can still bring individuals. They can still bring class actions. Everything is still in the commerce bill. 
I would like to have given what they promised last June--the immunity. But we did put an $8 billion cap on it. But the reason for giving any immunity is that the juries of America have given them immunity, period. They know the assumption of risk and everything else of that kind. It has been out there 30 some years. By the time we get along with some petitions before the court and everything, it will be 40 to 50 years, and everybody will have known about it; you won't be able to get a verdict against the companies. 
So we who are responsible for public policy are also at a crossroads. There is a pool of opportunity draining out on us. We ought to be acting this year. We ought to be acting this week. We ought to get with this thing on a realistic basis and how we brought this bill out, and not engage in trickery and come back in and take a bill that never was reported out of the committee, never onto the floor, never in debate, and say, `Stick it in, because we can fix the majority on the Commerce Committee.' I am saddened to see that. I never have seen that happen before. I checked with the Parliamentarian. They said yes, it could happen. But I never have seen that and it was sad to see. 
I have a lot of other things here that we could touch upon, but the distinguished Senator from North Carolina has been waiting. I hope when he does present his amendment, that he amends the words `minimal ethics.' I don't know that any trial lawyer--they win some cases, but they lose a lot of cases. 
As between the billable hour crowd and those working for the client rather than for themselves, because the clock keeps running, that is the most vicious thing that ever happened to my profession--this billable hour group. That is the worst thing I have ever seen occur, because I practiced law--never with billable hours; I got results for that client. Then he understood that was the charge, because we won. When we lost, we assumed all the costs. Everybody knows just that. What has been unethical, according to the testimony made to that attorney general down there, is the companies have been unethically engaged and the Chamber of Commerce has been supporting them. 
I hope the Senator from North Carolina will amend the words there on `minimal ethics.' 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Mignon Clyburn, daughter of U.S. Representative James Clyburn, on her election to the South Carolina Public Service Commission. The PSC--which overseas electricity, gas, phone, water, and sewer rates--is crucial to safeguarding consumer rights for all the people of South Carolina. Its work will be especially important and complex now that the telecommunications and utilities industries have been deregulated. It is because the work of the Public Service Commission is so important that I am glad to see someone as capable and dedicated as Mignon Clyburn appointed to the Commission. 
Public service flows in Mignon's blood. Her father, the first black Representative elected from South Carolina since Reconstruction, served South Carolina for many years in various community and state positions before entering the House of Representatives. 
Mignon has worked for over a decade as the driving force behind The Coastal Times newspaper. Her tireless work writing, editing, and marketing the magazine has earned it well-deserved praise as one of the best community papers in the Southeast. Mignon also has served her community through extensive volunteer work with the United Way and other organizations. 
Mr. President, Mignon Clyburn will make an excellent Commissioner. She understands the importance of the Public Service Commission for the people of South Carolina. She said after accepting the position, `I think this is the most significant agency . . . in the state. What's more vital or fundamental than your utilities?' 
Mignon Clyburn will make a wonderful Public Service Commissioner. She is an intelligent, hard working, and committed to improving the life of every South Carolinian. I am confident she will be a dedicated and effective guardian of South Carolina consumers.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I do object. Mr. President, this has been a long, hard road, as you well know. Almost a year ago the White House, health community and the States, 
and the States' attorneys general all met and everyone was provided for except the person who really depended on his living--that is, the tobacco farmer. So I got together during the fall with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford, and he and I worked diligently over the fall period developing what we call the LEAF Act, which not only took care of the farmer but the farm community; namely, the warehousemen, the bank that is financing, the equipment dealer, and everything else of that kind. 
There is no question that if this so-called tobacco bill works, there can't be any tobacco farmer unless they are tobacco companies. This is going to diminish the tobacco companies to a great extent and limit the tobacco farmers, as they go down or out of business. We have included the LEAF Act as sort of a safety net. Now, we met in the Commerce Committee on that basis. I know the distinguished chairman, Senator McCain, came to me, and on the basis of him going along with the LEAF Act, we made it a bipartisan bill and voted it out 19-1. 
The distinguished chairman also went to South Carolina before thousands of farmers and represented: Don't worry about the LEAF Act. Mr. President, I have been in five conferences now--two actually in my own hideaway in the Capitol--with the White House, the majority leadership, Senator McCain, and others, on this pack of bills. It included Senators on both sides of the aisle, with staffs and everything else. In the five meetings, including the one at 4 o'clock this afternoon, I was always counseled: Don't worry, the LEAF Act is intact. 
Don't give me the double talk that it is still intact, not when you put in the Lugar bill by a majority vote. The Lugar bill, by a majority vote, puts that farmer out of business. That is the one thing that the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, and others, have worked and counseled against, and everything else of that kind. 
I question, respectfully, that the majority leader identified the majority of the Commerce Committee members. That is all your Republicans; is that what you say?

Mr. HOLLINGS. I am dismayed. About a half-hour ago, I had a chance to talk, of course, just a bit with the majority leader. Until now, nothing has been said, and this kind of conduct and course of conduct is just the worst I have seen in my 30-some years up here. There is nothing you can do if they want to change their votes. They all voted for the bill, and I know how they felt because I talked to various Members. I have been talking to them intermittently over the past several months, and over the past 1 month in conferences with the White House. And now, to come at the last minute and have the ground cut from under you with this particular request on the premise that you want to be fair and give everybody a fair vote, that isn't what I worked for. I worked to give this a particular priority that no one else has given it--and certainly not to tobacco companies. I think the tobacco companies have the pressure on at this point to go along with the Lugar amendment and save them billions of dollars. That could be the case. 
I yield to my distinguished friend from Kentucky.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. 
Mr. President, there is not any question about the majority leader's right to proceed as he does and make that request. But he only does that with the majority vote of the Commerce Committee. That is the dismaying thing to this particular Senator, because when you meet as the ranking member, you represent not only yourself but the committee members and other Senators interested, of course, in the tobacco farmer. And you are not just wanting to assure yourself. You are wanting to assure others you represent because they are constantly asking these questions. So everyone, the White House, the health community, everyone now has gotten in step as of 4 o'clock on the LEAF Act, and to come now with this procedure and say they have the majority, which would include the distinguished chairman of the committee, is a shocking surprise to me. I can tell you that right now because I have been with him. I got with him only on this understanding. And to come now and put the LEAF Act in jeopardy with this particular procedure, I just had to stand up here and register my objection. 
Now, I don't want to object in a silly fashion to the printing, so I will withhold it, but the bipartisanship is ended.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support passage of S. 1046, the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1998. University research continues to be a great American success story, and NSF can be proud of its role in helping to create and sustain this great research enterprise. We continue to ask much of NSF and our universities because we know what this system has contributed to the Nation in the past, and we know that greater contributions await us in the future. 
Mr. President, by themselves, universities cannot solve our national problems such as technological competitiveness, the environment, and social issues like crime, poverty, and education. However, the research and trained young people provided by our universities will continue to play a major role in addressing these pressing issues. S. 1046 authorizes the continuation of the vital programs of NSF that support these efforts, including EPSCoR which has helped strengthen science and technology in many of our smaller states. 
I would like to take a moment and thank Senator McCain, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Jeffords for their efforts in getting this bill passed. The managers' amendment before the Senate today reflects agreement by the Commerce Committee and the Labor Committee on many issues relating to NSF's programs and funding. The two committees worked well together within the guidelines set forth in the standing order of March 3, 1988. Because of this bipartisan effort to address issues that are within the jurisdiction of the two committees, this is a good bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support its passage.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation that is necessary to stem the tide of one of the most annoying anti-consumer practices, known as slamming. Slamming occurs when a preferred telecommunications service provider of the consumer is changed without the consent of the consumer. This legislation enhances the verification and other procedures that carriers must use to ensure that the consumer consents to the change in its service provider. It also enhances the enforcement authority of the FCC, the Department of Justice, and the State attorneys general and imposes greater penalties and fines to address the problem of slamming. 
Slamming is not a new problem. Many consumers have been victims of slamming, suddenly discovering that their phone service is no longer being provided by their carrier of choice. Instead, it is being provided by an unauthorized carrier. We've all had the sales calls interrupt us at the dinner table. Regardless of what the FCC does, the problem persists. 
In a recent USA TODAY article, the FCC said it received 12,000 consumer complaints about slamming during the first half of 1997. In 1996, it received more than 16,000 total slamming complaints. In its Fall 1996 Common Carrier Scorecard, the FCC stated that slamming was the top consumer complaint category handled by the Enforcement Division's Consumer Protection Branch. It also stated that slamming complaints were the fastest-growing category of complaints, increasing more than six-fold between 1993 and 1995. In its 1997 Common Carrier Scorecard, the FCC indicated that nine companies accused of slamming have entered into consent decrees and have agreed to make payments to the United States Treasury totaling $1,245,000. The FCC has also issued two Notices of Forfeitures with combined forfeiture penalties of $160,000. Nonetheless, slamming continues to be a significant problem. 
The provisions we introduce today will hopefully stop this practice of slamming once and for all. The legislation places new responsibilities on carriers for the benefit of consumers. For example, often times, a consumer is slammed and does not know it until the next telephone bill arrives. Sometimes, unscrupulous carriers provide service to slammed customers for a considerable time before the customer becomes aware of the unauthorized switch. To prevent this, the legislation requires that whenever there is a change in the subscriber's carrier, the carrier must notify the subscriber of the change within 15 days. A carrier has 120 days to resolve a slamming complaint. If the 
carrier is unable to resolve the complaint within the required timeframe, then the carrier must notify the consumer of his or her right to file a complaint with the FCC. The FCC is required to resolve a slamming complaint it receives within 150 days. 
The bill also requires a carrier to retain evidence of the consumer's authorization to switch carriers and to inform the consumer of their rights to pursue a resolution of the matter with the Federal Communications Commission and with State authorities. Requiring carriers to store information will make it easier to resolve slamming disputes that arise between the consumer and the carrier. Armed with information on how to resolve slamming disputes, we hope that consumers will pursue their available recourse and help us hold carriers accountable for their illegal actions. 
In addition, the bill creates a variety of causes of actions and imposes still penalties on carriers. If a carrier violates FCC rules, the FCC can award the greater of actual damages or $500 and has the discretion to award treble damages. If there are no mitigating circumstances, the FCC is required to impose on the carrier a forfeiture of $40,000 or more for the first offense and not less than $150,000 for each subsequent offense. If a company fails to pay a forfeiture, the FCC can limit, deny, or revoke the company's operating authority. Where the slammer's actions have been willful, the Department of Justice can bring an action to impose fines in accordance with Title 18, United States Code and imprison the person who submits or executes a change in willful violation of Section 258. In addition, State attorneys general can bring actions in federal court to: impose criminal sanctions and penalties under Title 18 U.S. Code; recover actual damages or $500 in damages; and recover fines of $40,000 or more for first offenses and not less than $150,000 for subsequent offenses unless there are mitigating circumstances. Finally, this bill gives the FCC authority to pursue billing agents when they place charges on a consumers bill that they know the consumer has not authorized. 
Slamming is a troublesome problem. Slamming eliminates a consumer's ability to chose his or her service provider. It distorts telecommunications markets by enabling companies engaged in misleading practices to increase their customer base, revenues, and profitability through illegal means. Today hundreds of long distance carriers compete for a consumer's business. If slamming is not addressed effectively today, it could become much more worrisome. The changes in the telecommunications industry will probably result in a future in which local and long distance phone services are provided by an even greater number of carriers. 
It is therefore important that we eliminate the practice of slamming. Consumers have the right to choose their own phone companies when they choose. A consumer's choice should not be curtailed by the illegal actions of bad industry actors and a consumer should not have to spend a significant amount of time addressing issues of slamming. I expect that requirements placed by this bill will help to eliminate slamming. My actions with respect to slamming reflect my continued efforts to protect consumers as I have in the past supported legislation which successfully addressed the problem of junk fax and ensure that companies engage in proper telemarketing practices. 
I welcome my colleagues in joining Senator McCain and I as we address the problem of slamming and ensure that no one is allowed to curtail a consumer's choice of phone service provider.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as a supporter of the Veterans' Equality for Treatment and Services Act of 1998, introduced last Friday by Senator Jeffords on behalf of myself, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Specter, and Senator Murkowski, I am committed to ensuring that our aging veterans have access to quality, affordable, reliable, and convenient health services. 
However, as budgets decrease so, unfortunately, do services provided. The demonstration project outlined in the VETS Act of 1998 will allow Medicare to reimburse the VA for its services without putting a strain on the Medicare trust, and will provide an additional funding source for the VA. The project authorized by this legislation will be conducted over a three-year period, at up to 12 sites across the nation, and annual Medicare spending will be capped. Safeguards will also be imposed to ensure the cap is not exceeded. This bill may even save Medicare dollars by imposing a mandatory five percent discount on its reimbursement for services provided to veterans. 
Those targeted by this legislation are lower- and middle-income veterans who are no longer eligible for treatment at the VA because of its constrained resources. People like Mr. John C. Elkins, of Columbia, South Carolina, who is in his late seventies and who served over 28 years in the military. Recently, Mr. Elkins wrote this in a letter to me: `Oh, I know some think we hang on to life and drain government resources that are being paid for by the younger workers. But I must ask you and those who question us: isn't three wars in a lifetime worth something?' 
The veterans of our nation have served honorably and faithfully, often under perilous conditions, and they have sacrificed both with the loss of their lives and with their livelihoods. Thousands of veterans have experienced any number of health care problems. These veterans should have the same access to health care as all other Americans and, quite frankly, Mr. President, they deserve more for the sacrifices they have made. 
Mr. President, you will remember what my good friend, the late President John F. Kennedy said in his inaugural address: `Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.' The men and women of the armed services, our veterans, did just that. They answered their country's call to duty, and in response they were often put in harm's way. They served 24 hours a day, seven days a week, all around the world. They continue to support and defend our nation's interests, and I believe it is time our nation supported their interests. 
I urge my distinguished colleagues to join Senators Jeffords, Rockefeller, Specter, Murkowski, and me in supporting the VETS Act of 1998. It is among the very least that we in Congress can do to continue our support for these veterans, like Mr. Elkins, who have given so much to this country, while at the same time helping to preserve the VA medical system and the Medicare trust.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is my great honor today to salute one of Greenville's most beloved business leaders on her retirement as head of Leadership Greenville: Mrs. Jean Brown. 
Mrs. Brown has dedicated the last twenty years of her life to fostering an entrepreneurial environment in the South Carolina Upstate. Since 1979, she has worked with the Greenville Chamber of Commerce to develop the Leadership Greenville program, which today is a model of its kind. 
Through Leadership Greenville, Jean Brown has had an influence on the life of her community few individuals can match. Graduates of her ten month program head countless civic associations, philanthropic boards, and volunteer organizations in the Upstate. These leaders possess an unselfish and admirable desire to serve their communities, which Jean Brown encouraged and channeled. 
Thanks to her enthusiasm and energy, Leadership Greenville has grown into a Greenville institution. Although Jean Brown is retiring, her legacy will live on for generations in the good works of the Leadership Greenville graduates she trained. 
Mrs. Brown defines a leader as `a person who has a passion for what they want to accomplish.' If that is true, Mr. President, Jean Brown is a peerless leader. Today I am honored to pay tribute to such a dedicated and unselfish public servant.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in homage to an extraordinary group of young people, the Garrett Academy of Technology Varsity Boys Basketball Team. On January 2, 1998, these young men made 32 3-point shots in one game--a new national record. South Carolina takes tremendous pride in their accomplishment, which they achieved with teamwork and individual excellence. 
In the last two years, this team has set many individual and personal records. The Falcons are the defending 7-AA Region Champions and their coach, Michael Bayne, has been named Coach of the Year more than fifteen times in various sports. These athletes set a standard of excellence for every field of endeavor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military Health Care Equality Act. Mr. President, it may come a surprise to many that the Department of Defenses has reneged on its promise to those who have honorably served in our military forces. That, Mr. President, is the promise of lifetime, quality healthcare for the military retiree and his family. I now introduce legislation that will offer all Senators the opportunity to join with me in righting this unconscionable wrong. 
Today our military retirees feel betrayed. Before joining, and while serving, they were promised quality, lifetime healthcare. However, that promise is being broken. Military health care facilities have closed because of the downsizing of our military forces. Those military health facilities that remain can treat fewer and fewer retirees. The TRICARE system has high overhead and its provider fees are so low that many health care providers will not participate. In addition, in some areas, retirees do not have access to provider networks. Finally, the TRICARE system will not treat Medicare eligible retirees. Mr. President, it is just not right that the military retiree is the only Federal retiree who is prevented from using his employer provided health care when reaching Medicare age. 
This legislation requires the DOD to provide all military retirees with health care that is comparable to the care provided by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, or failing that, to make the FEHBP available. In addition, this legislation would require that TRICARE be improved to the FEHBP level. This Legislation will not prevent a retiree from using a military health care facility. However, it will improve and increase the health care choices for our retirees. 
Our military men and women have given much to protect our country in time of peace and war. We must acknowledge this by providing them the available, affordable, quality health care that they were promised. No lesser measure will suffice. 
Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in immediately enacting this legislation so that we can now begin to care for military retirees, as promised, in a manner they so richly deserve for their service to our great Nation.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleague Senator Cochran in introducing legislation that helps define the rules of the game for health care providers and allows investigators to focus on ferreting out and prosecuting real fraud in Federal health programs. 
The Health Care Claims Guidance Act of 1998 that we introduce today is made necessary by conflicting, extremely complex regulations covering Medicare, Medicaid, CHAMPS and other Federally funded programs. Ironically, most of these exist as a result of Congressional efforts to reduce fraud and abuse--to establish a system for billing and claims processing that assures these programs are paying reasonable costs for medically necessary services actually provided to eligible individuals. Not achieving our goal of ending fraud, we just stack on more rules that require honest providers to take more and more time from patient care to do paperwork while the crooks ignore us or accept as a challenge getting around the rules. There is no end in sight. This is a classic example of the road to hell being paved with good intentions. We have created a nightmare, and we have a responsibility to begin straightening out some of the confusion so honest health care providers can take care of patients and we can concentrate on prosecuting those who willfully violate the law. 
It is absolutely imperative that we accept nothing less than zero tolerance for real fraud and that the Government use all the tools at its disposal to prosecute willful violations of the law. It is equally imperative that we play fair with our partners who provide the health care we pay for with Federal funds. When a participating hospital receives directions from its fiscal intermediary, the hospital should know it can follow those directions without fear of being accused of fraud. Using the False Claims Act, the Justice Department is notifying hospitals that they are under investigation for alleged billing fraud, offering minimal time to respond or face prosecution. Hospitals are capitulating to these demands even when they know no fraud has been committed simply because they cannot afford to pay the accountants and lawyers to take on the Department of Justice. Others believe diverting these funds from patient care would be an irresponsible waste of tax dollars and not in the best interests of Medicare beneficiaries. I certainly agree. 
Respected physicians in my State, some personal friends of forty years, have received letters recently from the `Medicare Fraud Unit' demanding that they pay up immediately or face prosecution. They are confused and annoyed about the complexity of Medicare rules and coding, but they are outraged that they are being accused of fraud with no basis whatsoever. I submit, Mr. President, that they deserve to be enraged. And it doesn't get any better once they enter negotiations and are virtually unable to practice medicine because of the auditors consume most of the work day and office space. Then they wait for months to see if the ax will fall. 
The Health Care Claims Guidance Act of 1998 would take a small but important step in the right direction. It would amend the False Claims Act to create special rules for claims in all Federally funded health care programs. No criminal provisions are amended. The bill's provisions apply only to health care claims limited to civil actions. 
First, no action can be brought if the provider has relied on and correctly applied information supplied by a Federal agency or an agent thereof. Second, no action may be brought unless the amount of damages is material. Third, it establishes a safe harbor for hospitals with an effective compliance plan under the General Hospital Compliance Guidelines. And, fourth, it raises the burden of proof from a `preponderance of the evidence' to a `clear and convincing evidence' standard. 
Mr. President, let me make it clear once again, this bill in no way limits the authority of the Government to recoup or otherwise recover damages with respect to claims under any other provisions of law and does not apply to criminal provisions. It allows us to begin restoring the partnership between the Federal Government and those who provide health care under Federal programs and encourages the Government to use its resources to prosecute those who violate that partnership. I urge my colleagues to assist us in its early passage.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today, as it has for the past three days, the South mourns the passing of one of its greatest leaders. Terry Sanford, former Governor of and United States Senator from North Carolina, passed away on Saturday, April 18, 1998. 
From 1961 to 1965, Governor Sanford forged a remarkable record as one of America's most progressive governors. His great passions were education, civil rights, and social justice. Perhaps his bravest act as Governor, and the one that posed the greatest political risk, was to encourage the people of North Carolina to accept the winds of change that swept the South during the 1960s. 
In a 1963 speech, for example, he implored the people of North Carolina to end job discrimination against blacks and announced the creation of a biracial panel, the North Carolina Good Neighbor Council, to work toward that end. He also appointed many black North Carolinians to important positions in his administration and publicly supported school integration. 
The other hallmark of Governor Sanford's administration was his commitment to education. He pushed state lawmakers to provide more money to schools and laid the foundation that has helped make the North Carolina higher education system one of the best in the world. As a true intellectual and lover of the humanities, Terry Sanford understood the importance of ideas for their own sake. But he also was a practical man, and he realized that a well-educated populace is crucial to attracting new corporations and creating good jobs. Thanks to his vision, North Carolina now is home to one of the best-educated populations in the nation, and it is a leader in creating high-paying, high-tech jobs. 
From 1969 to 1985, Senator Sanford was President of Duke University. He was one of that institution's most vigorous and successful presidents, inspiring loyalty and love among faculty and students and helping the University increase its endowment and improve its resources. As President of Duke, Terry Sanford did great things for not just the students, but all the people of North Carolina. Under his hand, Duke joined North Carolina State and the University of North Carolina as part of the vaunted Research Triangle, which has generated high-tech jobs for North Carolina and helped the state secure a reputation as one of the best locations in the country for companies and their workers. President Sanford dedicated himself completely to Duke; he was driven to serve the school by the same passion for education and material and intellectual progress which had guided his governorship. 
Discontent with the direction in which our nation was headed and the seemingly intractable problems that had beset the political process drove Senator Sanford to offer himself for the Democratic nomination for President in 1972 and 1976. Although both his candidacies were unsuccessful, Terry ran with conviction and courage. Above all, he ran to oppose those who offered no alternative to confusion other than darkness, who would have replaced idealism with cynicism, and who practiced the politics of division rather than unity. 
Terry Sanford achieved national office in 1986, when the people of North Carolina elected him to the United States Senate. During his term, Senator Sanford was one of the ablest and most conscientious legislators this body has ever seen. He maintained his well-deserved reputation for decency, integrity, and intelligence; continued to show great interest in education and social policies; and never flagged in his commitment to the public good. 
After being narrowly defeated for reelection in 1992, Senator Sanford returned to Duke University, where he taught courses on public policy and government. As an outstanding educator, he continued to enrich his students' lives and devote himself to the dissemination of knowledge. 
Mr. President, Terry Sanford's death is a loss for North Carolina, this nation, and this Senate. He embodied the best of public service and education. His tremendous accomplishments were recognized and appreciated for over 30 years by the people of North Carolina. Increasingly, they have been recognized throughout the nation as well. In 1981, for example, a Harvard University study named Terry Sanford one of the ten best governors in the nation in this century. This was high praise, but Terry surely deserved it. 
With his passing, our nation has lost one of its most tireless public servants. We in the Senate have lost a cherished colleague and loyal friend. Fortunately for us all, Terry Sanford's legacy will live on in the educational institutions of North Carolina to which he gave so much and in the example he set for those of us who aspire to public service.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Hutchison, Lott, and Breaux amendment to S. 414. This amendment reflects a fair and reasoned compromise among the various interests affected by the bill. While I am no great fan of deregulation, I do believe that it is necessary to balance the interests affected by the bill in order not to adversely impact or destroy any particular sector. I am particularly pleased that the amendment preserves the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) as an independent agency to oversee our waterborne foreign commerce. 
As introduced and reported out of Committee, S. 414 would have merged the FMC and Surface Transportation Board (STB) into a new entity to be known as the Intermodal Transportation Board (ITB), placed within the Department of Transportation (DOT). The Hutchison, Lott, and Breaux amendment alleviates several problems with this approach. 
In the first place, there are no overlaps in jurisdiction or functions between the FMC and the STB that in any way hamper effective regulation. There are simply no significant synergies between the FMC's mandate to protect U.S. international ocean commerce and the STB's responsibilities with respect to domestic railroad mergers, rate regulation, and the like. Moreover, given the two vastly different constituencies and the two entirely different systems of regulation, there would have been a continuing struggle to determine priorities and to allocate scarce resources within a merged agency. Lastly, even though there might be some marginal savings in administrative expenses from such a merger, these would be offset by the more substantial costs of combining and relocating the two agencies. I understand that when the FMC was required by the General Services Administration to relocate in 1992, the moving costs to the government were $1 million. 
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has determined that if the two agencies were merged, the `ongoing costs to carry out the new board's responsibilities would be about the same as those incurred by the FMC and the STB under current law.' Clearly then, the combining of these two agencies could not be justified by any cost savings that would accrue to the government. 
I would also note that during the ocean shipping reform process, the vast majority of the commenters have supported an independent, free-standing agency to oversee our waterborne foreign commerce. Those sentiments were initially expressed by the South Carolina State Ports Authority and have subsequently been endorsed by many others. This includes the three U.S. shipping companies who otherwise supported the bill but stated that `the Federal Maritime Commission has done a superb job,' and `[o]ur strong preference would be to preserve the agency's structure as an independent agency.' Others who joined in support of an independent FMC include: the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union; the Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO; the National Customs Brokers & Forwarders Association of America, Inc.; the NY/NJ Foreign Freight Forwarders and Brokers Association; the Council of European and Japanese National Shipowners' Association; and the American Association of Port Authorities, as well as many individual port authorities. Further, it is my understanding that the coalition supporting this amendment supports, in toto, the retention of the FMC in its present form. A change in the agency's structure could serve to fracture that fragile coalition of support for the amendment. 
Another reason I support the amendment is that merging the FMC into the STB would have sent the wrong message to our trading partners--i.e., that the new agency would be constrained from 
taking direct and immediate action against unfair foreign shipping practices. The FMC has been able to effectively combat unfair trading practices of foreign governments largely because of its status as an independent agency. The agency has an international reputation for aggressively and swiftly addressing restrictive shipping practices without the threat of diplomatic interference or retaliation in other sectors. In fact, I would hope that some of our other trade agencies could learn a thing or two from the FMC. Both the Department of State and DOT regularly cite the FMC's independence to persuade foreign governments that maritime issues must be addressed directly and expeditiously. In fact, Admiral Herberger, former Administrator of the Maritime Administration (MarAd), testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee that the FMC's independent status has been critical to MarAd's success in negotiations with foreign governments. Also, in his August 5, 1997, letter to the Japanese Ministry of Transport, Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater cited the FMC's authority to impose sanctions while urging Japan to reform its port practices. 
The agency's recent actions against Japanese port restrictions are a perfect example of its successful accomplishments. The agency took decisive action to address Japanese intransigence on easing restrictions which impede the operations of U.S. carriers. As an independent agency, the FMC did not have to overcome the hurdles or various pressures imposed by other Executive branch departments within the Administration that have competing interests. And this body, by a 100 to zero vote, in S. Res. 140, endorsed the action taken by the FMC to respond to the unfair practices of Japan. 
Supporting this amendment and the FMC ensures that the agency's effectiveness will not be impeded, and sends the right message to our trading partners: that the U.S. Congress endorses an aggressive stance against foreign-imposed restrictions on open competition in shipping. 
I would further note that by retaining the FMC as an independent agency, the amendment alleviates the concern of some that merging the FMC and STB into a new entity could violate the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, U.S. Const. Art. II, 2, cl. 2, to the extent that STB members would be accruing new responsibilities unrelated to those for which they were appointed and confirmed, and could accordingly subject the new agency to challenges that it is not legally constituted. 
The amendment offered by Senators Hutchison, Lott, and Breaux corrects a major and potentially disastrous flaw in S. 414. I support this amendment enthusiastically.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, elected upon a promise to eliminate `waste, fraud and abuse,' President Ronald Reagan appointed the Grace Commission to root through the government, eliminating obsolete programs and those whose costs exceeded their benefits. At the conclusion of its crusade the Grace Commission published a thick book entitled `War on Waste.' Ironically at that very moment the biggest waste of all was being created--a soaring debt and wasteful interest costs. Everyone with a credit card realizes there is no free lunch. The amount you borrow must be paid back--plus interest costs on the amount borrowed. Government is no different. As the national debt increases, interest costs compound and must be paid annually. Historically, interest costs have not been a burden. From the beginning of the Republic until 1981, borrowing of the United States for all government including the cost of all the wars from the Revolution through World War II, Korea and Vietnam was less than one trillion dollars. And interest cost was less than $100 million. But in the past 17 years without the cost of a war (Desert Storm paid for by the Kuwaitis and Saudis), the national debt has quintupled to $5.6 trillion; and interest costs on the debt have increased to $365 billion a year. Spending of a billion a day for interest is added to the debt, increasing the debt and increasing the spending for interest. With a gas tax, we obtain highways; with this interest `tax,' we get nothing. Waste! 
Tragically, this waste goes unnoticed. This is intended. The scam is known as the `unified budget.' The `unified budget' is not the actual income and spending of government. Rather it is the spending by government beyond its income while reporting a smaller deficit by borrowing from the special purposes funds. Of course, this doesn't reduce the deficit; it just moves the deficit out of sight from general government into these trust funds. For example, the actual deficit for FY 1998 as reported by the Congressional Budget Office is $153 billion. But the President and Congress report a `unified' deficit of $7.7 billion by borrowing $161 billion from various trust funds. Accordingly, we have created deficits in the following trust funds: Social Security--$732 billion; Medicare--$146 billion; Military Retirement--$133 billion; Civilian Retirement--$460 billion; Unemployment Compensation--$72 billion; Highways--$23 billion; Airports--$10 billion; Railroad Retirement--$20 billion; All Others--$55 billion. 
It should be emphasized that for Social Security this is against the law. In 1983, the Greenspan Commission called for a high payroll tax with the intent of not just balancing the Social Security budget but to build a surplus to pay for the retirement of the baby boomers in the next century. Section 21 of the Greenspan Commission report called for the Social Security Trust to be removed from the `unified budget' so that the fund could remain solvent to the year 2056. Accordingly, President Bush signed Section 13301 of the Budget Act prohibiting the President or Congress from reporting a budget using Social Security trust funds. But the President and the Congress continue to ignore the law. They do so with the sanction of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan and the financial world. Corporate America would rather government incur these horrendous deficits than come into the bond market with its sharp elbows, crowding out corporate finance and raising interest rates. 
There's a difference between the corporate economy and the country's economy. The corporate economy has as its goal higher profits. The country's economy has as its goal the good of society. For example, the corporate economy reaps higher profits by moving its manufacture offshore to a low wage country. But the country's economy suffers from a loss of manufacturing jobs. 
A nation's strength rests as if upon a three-legged stool. The one leg of values is unquestioned: the United States readily sacrifices to feed the hungry in Somalia and bring democracy to Haiti and Bosnia. The second leg of military strength is unquestioned. The third leg of economic strength has become fractured. For 50 years we sacrificed our economy in order to keep the alliance together in the Cold War. We willingly gave up markets and manufacture. While today's industry is competitive, valuable high-paying manufacturing jobs have become depleted. In the past 10 years, the United States has gone from 26% of its work force in manufacture to 13%. At a forum of Third World countries, the former head of Sony, Akio Morita stated that the emerging countries must develop a strong manufacturing sector in order to become a nation state. And then Morita admonished, `That world power which loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.' Perhaps Morita had in mind the materials of basic production or defense. But more importantly manufacture is the job of the middle class. As 
you lose your middle class, you lose the strength of democracy. Sure, employment is at an all-time high. But service and part-time jobs are replacing the high-paid manufacturing jobs. The corporate economy wins, the country economy loses. 
The North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico was an instrument of the corporate economy. Europe had long since abandoned the free trade approach for that of the common market. For a common market, there first must be developed entities of a free market such as property rights, labor rights, rights of appeal, a respected judiciary, etc. The Europeans taxed themselves some $5 billion over four years, building up these institutions of a free market in Greece and Portugal before joining in a trade treaty. Mexico has not developed these institutions. Ignoring experience, the corporate economy bulled its way for NAFTA approval and the results are well known. Promised an increase of 200,000 jobs, the United States has lost 400,000. Promised an increase in our balance of trade, the $5 billion plus balance has been replaced by a $17 billion negative balance. Promised an improvement in the drug problem, the drug problem has worsened. Promised a diminution in immigration from Mexico, it has increased. Even the Mexican worker has suffered a 20% loss in take-home pay. The $12 billion that the United States has paid out in bail-out--the monies that could have installed the institutions of a free market--have gone back to Wall Street. The corporate economy has benefitted with cheaper production in Mexico. But the country's economy is weakened. South Carolina, with all of its new industry, has suffered a net loss of 14,000 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. 
The `unified budget' that projects surpluses is a loser. When the country borrows from its trust funds, it really doesn't borrow; it just moves the deficit out of sight. Corporate America could care less. They don't have to pay the bills. They don't have to worry about the future of America. But we in public office do. A day of reckoning is at hand. Already the biggest spending item in our budget is interest costs on the national debt. Bigger than defense. Bigger than Social Security. All waste. Should interest costs return to their normal rate of 10 years ago, then by 2003, we will have to spend in excess of $500 billion on interest charges--an annual waste of $500 billion. At that time, we will owe Social Security and the pension funds over $2 trillion. Forced to raise money for these obligations, Congress will be scrambling to find enough money for entitlements and a limited defense much less obligations. There will be little money left for general government. At present, foreigners have been willing to buy the bonds, and lend the money to finance our deficits. In fact, they use their substantial holdings to leverage prevalence in trade negotiations by threatening from time to time to sell. Fearful that this will increase rates, our negotiators give in. Now with the Pacific Rim economy in shambles, it shouldn't surprise anyone if they don't show up at the next bond sales. Immediately, we would have higher interest rates. Today we have a foreign debt of $1.2 trillion. Already we have gone from the world's largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor. 
According to the CBO, the FY 1998 budget is in deficit $184.1 billion. Instead of surpluses, CBO projects deficits for the next five years for the sum total of $905 billion. But all across the land one hears shouts of `Balanced Budgets' and `Surpluses as far as the eye can see.' We are wasting with fiscal cancer, But the American people don't know. The media have put them to sleep with the `unified budget.'

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, President Clinton's visit to Africa is a historic visit, the first time a sitting American President has visited that continent. For a distinguished South Carolinian who is accompanying the President, the trip also marks the return to a land with which he is very familiar. 
Bishop Fred James, a retired Bishop of the AME Church, is one of South Carolina's most respected men of the cloth. For four years in the 1970s, he served in Capetown, South Africa, as the presiding bishop of the AME Church for five countries: South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland, and Mozambique. During Bishop James's tenure, the Church conducted not only traditional religious activities, but also unorthodox outreach programs to improve the lives of its congregants. Among other things, it built schools, operated a publishing house, and ran a cattle ranch. None of these was strictly religious in nature, but all helped to relieve the oppressive atmosphere of these countries and restore a sense of community among the AME Church's congregants. 
After returning from Africa, Bishop James continued to lead outreach programs and fight for civil rights at home. Before settling in South Carolina, he was active in the NAACP and lived in Arkansas and Oklahoma. He also lived in Baltimore, where his responsibilties as Bishop overseeing thousands of congregants and many churches were even greater than those he shouldered in Africa. As the people of South Carolina know so well, Bishop James has been a force for good in every community in which he has lived. 
Mr. President, I can think of no better ambassador of our nation's good will toward Africa than Bishop Fred James. He has spent the better part of his life serving God and his fellow men, without expecting recognition or reward. With his selection by President Clinton to be an informal, good will ambassador to Africa, he has at last received some of both. Let us all hope the United States can achieve the same, strong relationship with Africa as that of Bishop James.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, this goes right to the point of the requirement of a 60-vote supermajority in order to spend the Social Security funds or report a budget with respect to Social Security funds. It conforms to the sense of the Senate that the Members will find on page 37 and 38 of the concurrent resolution itself. We passed in the Budget Committee the sense of the Senate that the assumptions underlying the functional totals included in this resolution assume that Congress and the President should continue to rid our country of debt and work to balance the budget without counting Social Security trust fund surpluses. 
There was, of course, a unanimous vote in the Budget Committee. Incidentally, it was partly a response to the clarion call of the President of the United States, in his State of the Union address to the joint session of Congress, that we `save Social Security first.' And, incidentally, some 8 years ago, 98 Senators voted for the very same thing. 
The reason for the 98-Senator vote back in 1990 was to comply with the suggestions of the Greenspan Commission on Social Security. The Greenspan Commission in 1983 suggested a very high payroll tax, not just to balance Social Security's budget, but also to build up a surplus for the baby boomers in the next generation. For example, the Commission's report included projections to the year 2056. 
We have constantly heard on the floor of the Congress, in both Houses, `Oh, the baby boomers are going to cause a problem, the baby boomers are going to cause a problem in the next generation.' Not at all, not at all, Madam President. The fact is, if we quit looting the Social Security trust fund, we could get along well with just minor adjustments to the Social Security program. The problem is being caused not by the baby boomers, but by the adults on the floor of the Congress itself--in that we have this euphemism called the unified budget. 
Let me tell you about that unified budget. The unified budget is a device of the financial community, of corporate America, of the Federal Reserve Board, to keep interest rates low. They could care less about the burden of having to pay the bill. They are not Congressmen. They are not Senators. They don't have to face up to the present deficit of $631 billion we owe Social Security now, or the $1.2 trillion this government will owe Social Security by the end of the budget under consideration. 
We are going right up against the wall. We will owe this money and then someone will say, `Well, we can't raise taxes.' Someone is going to say, `Well, we have to raise the age.' Then someone will say, `We have to limit the benefits.' These are the remarks we can expect to hear in this Congress at the turn of the century. 
The President, to his credit, grabbed ahold of this particular 
issue, which we have been working on for years. He said, `Save Social Security first.' We passed, already, one sense of the Senate by a vote of 100 to nothing. We passed the one I now propose by 20 to nothing in the Budget Committee. I would like to remark on a comment made in the Commerce Committee's markup of the tobacco bill just a few moments ago, when the distinguished chairman turned to another Senator and said, `Now, wait a minute, is this a sense of the Senate?' 
And the Senator responded, `No, this is real. This counts.' 
I want, and I am sure every Senator here wants, the desire to save Social Security to count. One of the best ways to make sure it counts here is to require--for the first time on the parliamentary treatment of issues here, in the reading of bills and concurrent resolutions--at least a 60-vote supermajority margin in order to spend Social Security surpluses, or list them, or waive the requirement they not be expended. 
To return to the Greenspan Commission report for a moment, I believe that report was very judicious in its vision with respect to the baby boomers. The report said we know we have this high tax and we are going to have surpluses. But we want to make sure these surpluses are not expended by some tricky device called a unified budget, or a unified deficit. Section 21 of the Greenspan Commission report required just that, that Social Security be put off-budget. After the Commission made its report, we struggled within the Budget Committee for years to implement its suggestions. It wasn't until 1990 that we finally were able to require, by a vote of 20 to 1, that trust funds be taken off-budget. And then, on the floor of the Senate, by a vote of 98 to 2, we passed section 13301 of the statutory law of the Budget Act--which was then passed by the House and signed into law by President Bush on November 5, 1990. Section 13301, which I have a copy of now, prohibited Congress from including Social Security trust funds in the budget.

Mr. HOLLINGS. As you can see, we passed the law. But it has been ignored. And we are ignoring it again, Madam President, because if you look on page 67 of the committee's report, you will find at the bottom line: `on budget for 1998, minus $95.6 billion.' Then: `off budget, $103.4 billion.' The report then states a total surplus of `$7.8 billion.' 
That is not the actual deficit, Madam President--not at all. That is the so-called unified deficit, which its adherents arrive at by looting trust funds. But if you look on page 5 of the resolution itself, you will see the deficit is listed for fiscal year 1999 as $108.2 billion. This is a far cry from a surplus. That is in response to section 13301. That is the actual deficit. Just go down one step further to the section, on that same page 5, labeled `Public debt.' You will find that from 1998 to 1999, in the present budget under consideration, all you need to do to compute the actual deficit is to subtract the increase in the national debt. That is the actual spending that occurs that we do not pay for. That is the actual outlay that is not taken care of by revenues themselves. You only have to do simple arithmetic to find that for the year 1999, according to this present budget under consideration, the deficit will be $186.3 billion. 
Madam President, it is interesting, in this time of headlines that tout surpluses as far as the eye can see, to just look at the deficits for the next 5 years--the additions to the national debt. You will see that they add up each year to a total of $905 billion. In other words, under the budget currently being considered, the government will spend almost $1 trillion more than it receives in revenue. Yet, we have people claiming on the floor of the Congress, and in newspapers and editorials, `Look at what a wonderful job we have done.' 
The fact is, instead of balancing the budget, instead of continuing to lower deficits as we have done 6 years in a row--and I give the current administration credit for having done so --we are going to turn and change course and, for the first time now with this 1999 concurrent resolution for this particular budget for 1999, we will increase rather than lower the deficit. We will increase the deficit some $32 billion. We will go from $153 to $186 billion--$31 billion, not counting decimals here. That is $31 billion that we are increasing the deficit. 
Madam Chairman, I would like to return to the original point: some kind of parliamentary restriction to bring sobriety to this body, to prevent politicians from claiming, `I voted for a sense of the Senate; I voted not to spend Social Security.' That was just not real. That was just a sense of the Senate. This resolution would be binding at least for a 60-vote majority. It ought to really have 100 votes, because that is what we voted time and time again when actually voted on. 
I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico doesn't have to remind the Senator from South Carolina that we are doing better than we were 6 years ago, because this Senator voted for that particular plan, which included spending cuts and which included tax increases to get this economy turned around. It included a tax increase on Social Security, as well. And we didn't get a single Republican vote for that Budget Act--not one vote from that side of the aisle. 
Now the Senator from New Mexico says we are borrowing $10 billion. Turn, if you please, to the analysis of the President's budget proposal by the Congressional Budget Office put out the day before yesterday. On page 36, you will find the actual debt increases to $184 billion. So we are not borrowing $10 billion less. The actual facts, according to the Congressional Budget Office, are that we are borrowing $31 billion more. 
Tell me about the budgets and requirements of the Budget Committee supermajority. You have to get a supermajority to get the tobacco money. Why not a supermajority to protect Social Security? We have section 13301 of the Budget Act itself that is a firewall anyone disobeys when he spends that money.

As we all know, we have used the euphemism of a unified budget, a unified deficit, and we have been spending, looting, the Social Security trust fund. Some say that actuarially there is a surplus in there. That is on a sheet of paper. Actually, the money is gone.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this more or less puts into parliamentary procedure what we voted for time and again, what the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has voted for. It is in the law, section 13301, that we save Social Security and quit looting the fund. 
If you really want to put your money where your mouth is, as the expression goes, rather than just a sense of the Senate, then support this particular resolution now under consideration and put on some parliamentary controls, which is what this amendment does. If you want to save Social Security, vote for the amendment; waive the Budget Act, because that is what the Budget Act says to do in section 13301. If you don't want to, vote against the waiver.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Appropriations Supplemental contains a provision sponsored by myself, the Appropriations Committee Chairman, Senator Stevens, and the Commerce Committee Chairman, Senator McCain, requiring the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to submit a report to Congress by May 8, 1998. 
My provision requires the FCC to do several things. First, it directs the FCC to cure the defects found by the General Accounting Office (GAO) in the program's administrative structure. The GAO found that the FCC's implementation of schools/libraries program violated the Government Corporations Control Act (GCCA) in setting up independent corporations to administer the schools/libraries program. Mr. President, when the Congress wants to establish a separate corporation to administer a program it does so. That's why Congress set up the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The FCC does not have such unilateral authority to go creating a corporation because it wants to. 
The report also asks detailed questions about how much money will be needed to fund the program and how the FCC intends to collect the money. The goal is to administer the program without raising telephone rates. Therefore, the report asks detailed questions that are necessary to put the FCC on record to justify the cost of the program. The FCC made commitments to Congress that schools/libraries program would not raise rates and I intend to ensure that the agency keeps its word. If the FCC does not deliver on its commitments to protect consumers from rate increases, Congress will step in and make the FCC accountable. 
Finally, my amendment also directs the FCC to cap the salary of the program's administrator at a government salary--as opposed to the $250,000 salary the FCC set up. I support the program but the Congress must take measures such as these to ensure that the agency administers the law and policy that the Congress adopts. It is not the FCC's job to adopt policies which exceed the authority given to it by the Congress.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I would like to mourn the passing of a great woman and pay tribute to her legacy. On March 11, one of the leading lights of the Charleston theater community, Patricia Colbert Robinson, was extinguished. Mrs. Robinson was a well-known and beloved Charleston author, poet, playwright, and actress. Together with her husband, Emmett E. Robinson Jr., and fellow actress Dorothy D'Anna, she ran the Footlight Players, Charleston's community theater group, for almost three decades. In addition to acting in many of the Players' productions, Mrs. Robinson helped raise money and organized publicity for their events. 
Patricia Robinson was a woman of many talents, and her interests encompassed all the arts. She once won first place in the Poetry Society of South Carolina spring forum. In addition to her poems, she wrote or co-authored seven novels. She also wrote for the Charleston News and Courier and The Charleston Evening Post. 
Mrs. Robinson set many of her stories in Charleston and portrayed the city with a fine eye for detail and much love. Surprisingly, she was not a native Southerner. She was born and reared in Pittsburgh, but moved to Charleston in 1944. Nonetheless, she loved the city as ardently as its longest residents and always exhibited a great passion for its architecture, history, and people. Charlestonians reciprocated by embracing her as a neighbor and honorary native daughter. 
With the passing of Patricia Colbert Robinson, Charleston has lost one of its most beloved literary and artistic figures. The people of Charleston have lost a beloved friend who entertained them on the stage and on paper, and who reminded them in beautiful prose of the rich history and beauty of their city. She will be much missed.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am happy to cosponsor, along with Senators McCain, Inouye, Hutchison, Lott, and Ford, this bill to reauthorize appropriations for the Surface Transportation Board (Board). The Board is the independent agency which oversees the nation's rail transportation industry. The Board also has some authority over the interstate bus system, pipeline system, and rail labor-management disputes. It should be said that the Congress gave this small agency, with less than 150 people, the job that had been done by the old Interstate Commerce Commission with, at its peak, 1600 people. We demanded that the Board do more with less and we demanded that it be evenhanded, fair-minded, and tackle some very tough, contentious issues. I am happy to report that the Board has done all of that and more. 
Since its inception, the Board has had a pending caseload of between 400 and 500 adjudications related to all of its functions. The number of rail cases pending at the Board remains relatively constant because, even as cases are resolved, new cases are filed. Even with its relatively meager resources the Board has met every rulemaking deadline set by Congress in the Interstate Commerce Commission Termination Act. It has resolved close to 200 motor carrier undercharge cases. It has set and met deadlines and established simplified procedures for handling pending cases. It has also dealt with the important and difficult issue of rail carriers providing rates to shippers in the so-called `bottleneck' cases. While this issue is now before the courts, it is the Board that has tried to steer a course allowing the rail carriers to earn a decent return on their investment while providing shippers with needed transportation at reasonable rates. 
In the area of rail regulation, the Board has worked on several important rail restructuring cases, including several complex line construction cases, the Union Pacific/Southern Pacific merger, and the pending Conrail acquisition case (in which approximately 80 decisions have already been issued). It has tackled the rail service emergency in the West in many ways, including its issuance of an emergency service order on October 31, 1997, which has been extended and expanded upon twice and is in place through August 2, 1998. In addition, the Board is holding two days of hearings on the rail service emergency in the beginning of next month. We must applaud Linda Morgan, the Chairman of the Board, on her leadership and the men and women of the Board on their hard work and dedication and as we do so we must be mindful that more, much more, will be expected of them. Two additional rail mergers have been announced, both of critical importance to the nation. I have every confidence in Chairman Morgan and the STB to meet and surmount these latest challenges. 
This bill represents my commitment to seeing that the Board is reauthorized for a multi-year span and is given the resources it needs to continue its vital work. Absent the Board, neither shippers nor rail carriers would have an effective forum to adjudicate disputes and ensure a first rate nationwide rail transportation system.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we come again to the highway bill and the question of fairness. Seven years ago I voted against passage of the highway bill, called `ISTEA,' because it did not provide a fair share of funding to South Carolina. We were told we had a so-called `90% minimum allocation,' but hindsight now shows that we received only 71 cents on the dollar. 
I think we are on a better track today. The latest chart shows South Carolina getting 90 cents on the dollar for apportioned funds. I still do not believe that amount is fair, but it represents progress and I will keep working to improve on this amount. Also, `donor' states like South Carolina were told last week that the bill would provide a floor of 91 cents on the dollar, and we clearly do not have that guarantee in the bill yet. However, I appreciate the difficult job the managers of the bill have in balancing the many needs under this bill, and have tried to help them pass a fair bill in accords with the needs of my state. 
Particularly, I have strongly supported putting increased gas tax funds into the Highway Trust Fund, and spending those funds on highways rather than non-transportation purposes. This is the right thing to do, it is good budget policy, and of course, it helps the managers of this bill provide an increased share of funding for `donor' states like South Carolina. 
Again, I remain concerned that, while there was an indication last week that donor states would receive 91 cents back for each dollar contributed, donor states have not in reality been given this amount. And I stand by my support for legislation giving donor states a guarantee of 95 cents or higher. But I am pleased to see some progress on the issue of fairness and hope we can continue to work together to improve the bill.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today, I introduce duty suspension legislation designed to permit the import of certain textile weaving machinery into the United States duty free. 
The equipment to be imported is not manufactured in the United States and therefore its importation will not displace domestic sourcing. Moreover, because the product at issue is manufacturing equipment, it will assist in the creation of additional jobs in the textile industry. 
I believe that this is the most appropriate use of such legislation. I am therefore hopeful that this new capacity can be used to supply both domestic and foreign needs and will increase employment in the textile industry.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer along with Commerce Committee Chairman, Senator McCain, the Commerce Committee amendment to S. 1173, the International Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). 
Mr. President, the Commerce Committee has worked together, in a true showing of bipartisanship, to craft this amendment. In this amendment the Committee has developed proposals to improve travel safety on our nation's roads and waterways, promote the safe shipment of hazardous material, advance pipeline transportation safety, and ensure that our nation's commercial motor vehicle fleet is well maintained and operated. This is not to say that we have left all of our policy disagreements behind us with this amendment. There are several that remain to be resolved and we are still attempting to resolve those issues. But on balance we have an amendment with which we all may be proud. I will take a few minutes to outline the amendment's more important provisions. 
The amendment reauthorizes various grant programs administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), designed to improve road safety. The amendment reauthorizes grants to develop countermeasures to alcohol-impaired driving. Two new grant programs are also created. One encourages States to provide for the primary enforcement of seat belt laws. The second encourages states to improve the quality of their highway safety data. 
The amendment reauthorizes funding and strengthens the programs to ensure the safe transportation of hazardous materials. It expands hazardous materials training access by allowing states to use a portion of these grants to assist in training small businesses in complying with regulations. We also strengthen enforcement by giving the Secretary of Transportation the authority to issue emergency orders when it is determined that an unsafe condition poses an imminent hazard. 
The amendment also reauthorizes the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP) which provides funding to the states for commercial driver and vehicle safety inspections, traffic enforcement, compliance reviews, and safety data collection. Moreover, the amendment removes many of the program's prescriptive requirements in favor of a performance based approach. The Secretary will have the authority to order unsafe carriers to cease operations. We also authorize additional funds to ensure the timely and accurate exchange of important carrier and driver safety records. 
Perhaps most importantly, we provide the Secretary with the authority to establish pilot programs and grant waivers of regulations to motor carriers. If carriers can show that an alternative approach to regulation will aid safety and be less burdensome, the Secretary can authorize such an alternative. Regulation can be tailored to specific circumstances rather than `one-size-fits-all' regulation. 
In the area of rail and mass transportation safety as requested by the Administration we provide for criminal sanctions in cases of violent attacks against railroads, their employees, and passengers. The amendment also extends the basic Wallop-Breaux Aquatic Resources Trust Fund for boating safety and reauthorizes the Clean Vessel Act, allocating $10 million annually for state marine sanitation device projects and $10 million annually for state boating infrastructure projects. 
As I noted earlier, not all of our policy disagreements have been solved. I continue to be concerned about three provisions which seem to undermine our efforts to achieve safer highways. These provisions would allow exemptions from federal regulations for utility drivers and those engaged in agri-business. Specifically, the federal hours of service act which governs how long a driver may drive in any one day, the hazardous materials transportation requirement that ensures that emergency response teams have the necessary information to combat a hazard material incident, and the Commercial Driver's License (CDL) requirements are waived under these provisions. 
I think these exemption provisions `go the wrong way' on safety. Indeed, the provisions are also unnecessary given the other provision that allows DOT to develop safe pilot programs and waivers for individuals, companies, and industries. I would like these provisions modified and I remain hopeful that we can work out these issues. 
With that caveat I believe that the Commerce Committee has under the leadership of Senator McCain, given us an ISTEA amendment that we all can support and I commend it to the Senate.  
Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I address President Clinton's admonition: `save Social Security first.' I consider the President's plea essential; in fact, it is the most important business confronting this body. Saving Social Security is not a new crusade for me; for over two decades, I have dedicated myself to this cause. As a former Chairman and the senior member of the Budget Committee, I have worked to ensure that we are honest and responsible in our treatment of the trust funds and that Social Security will be viable for decades to come. 
The debate over Social Security is not a new one. I recall when we formed the Greenspan Commission in 1983 for just this purpose: to save Social Security. That commission recommended the higher Social Security payroll tax that took effect in the mid-1980s. This tax was intended to produce a large surplus in the Social Security trust fund, to be used to support the retirement of the Baby Boom generation in the next century. But because the surplus has been used to pay for general operations of the federal government, there is in fact an enormous deficit in Social Security. This government owes a great deal of money to current workers; under the current system, we will be unable to pay them their benefits when they retire. That is why it is crucial we reform Social Security. 
Consider President Clinton's Social Security proposal--as elaborated in his State of the Union address--in its entirety: `Tonight I propose we reserve 100 percent of the surplus. That's every penny of any surplus.' 
The President is right. Reserving any surplus is essential to ensuring that Social Security remains not only solvent, but fully capable of paying benefits to future retirees. If we are serious about saving Social Security--the most effective federal program since its enactment in 1935--we must protect the Social Security trust fund. 
To help achieve this, I am dropping in a resolution that would express the sense of the Senate that Congress must not use any Social Security surplus to increase spending or cut taxes. I will offer this as an amendment to the first appropriate piece of legislation. 
The first way to save Social Security is to stop spending the trust funds. One way to do this is to force an up-or-down vote on my resolution. Force Congress to promise not to use surpluses for irresponsible spending or tax cuts. If we can do this, we will have eliminated the immediate obstacle to saving Social Security. 
This sense of the Senate is the first step towards saving Social Security. The next step is to address the program's long-term solvency. But before we can remedy Social Security's fundamental problems and save it for future retirees, we must restore truth in budgeting and put the `trust' back in trust funds. That is why I have introduced this resolution, and that is why I strongly urge my colleagues to support it.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, South Carolina lost one of its greatest citizens when former Governor, former U.S. Senator, and Federal Judge Donald Russell passed away Sunday night. I am both greatly saddened and honored to pay tribute today to the exemplary life of this extraordinary man. 
In addition to his many years of public service as Governor, U.S. Senator, and Federal Judge, Donald Russell also served as president of the University of South Carolina from 1952 to 1957. During the Second World War, he served in the War Department and as a special assistant to James F. Byrnes until 1943. In 1943, he entered upon active duty in the U.S. Army; he was decommissioned as a major in 1944 after serving with Supreme Allied Headquarters. He was present at Yalta with James Byrnes and President Roosevelt. Following the War, he served for two years as Assistant Secretary of State for Administration. 
Some in this Chamber remember Donald Russell as an esteemed colleague who served with great distinction in the United States Senate in 1965 and 1966. During his time in the Senate, Senator Russell was known as a serious, conscientious, and particularly intelligent lawmaker, dedicated to his country and to his state. Both South Carolina and the United States benefitted from Senator Russell's wise and vigorous leadership. 
Before entering the Senate, Donald Russell served as Governor of South Carolina. His governorship was one of the most progressive, most active, and most important in my state's history. For example, he strongly supported and helped fund the statewide system of technical colleges that has been essential to South Carolina's dramatic economic growth for the past two decades. But the hallmark of Donald Russell's governorship was his commitment to racial reconciliation and fair treatment for all in South Carolina. 
Mr. President, the best way to illustrate Donald Russell's caring, generous, and just nature and his commitment to equitable and progressive policies is to relate a vignette. On his inauguration as Governor, Donald threw a barbecue for the people of South Carolina--all the people. This was unprecedented: never before in South Carolina had a governor thrown a party and invited all the state's people--white and black--to attend. For the first time, the Governor shook many black as well as white hands in his receiving line. Donald's act was as bold as it was wonderful, and it set the tone for his governorship, during which he worked to encourage the citizens of South Carolina to accept the end of the pernicious system of segregation. 
After leaving the Senate, Donald was appointed by President Lyndon Johnson to the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. In 1971, Judge Russell was appointed by President Richard Nixon to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. For over thirty years, Judge Russell served with great distinction and earned a reputation as one of America's most respected jurists. His intellect remained keen to the end and he never accepted senior status. His years on the bench set a standard for judicial integrity, wisdom, and fairmindedness that will endure for many years. In fact, it was as a jurist that Donald Russell found his true calling. I doubt that I ever have seen or will see another jurist to surpass him. 
For more than fifty years, Mr. President, I have known Donald Russell to be one of the most dedicated public servants in South Carolina's rich history. His dedication to improving the lives of everyday citizens has inspired me throughout my own career in public service. I am proud to have been his friend and colleague, and I send his family my sincere condolences.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I am proud to co-sponsor a bill which will be an essential component of the war on crime. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act, which was introduced today, will save the lives of law enforcement officers across the country by helping state and local law enforcement agencies provide their officers with body armor. 
Providing body armor to more law enforcement agencies will greatly reduce injuries and fatalities among officers. The FBI estimates that more than 40 percent of the 1,182 officers killed in the line of duty by a firearm since 1980 would have lived had they worn bullet-resistant vests. In fact, the FBI considers the risk of death to officers not wearing armor to be 14 times greater than that for officers wearing body armor. 
Mr. President, today 150,000 law officers in the United States do not have access to this essential equipment. This is unacceptable. These brave men and women risk their lives every day to enforce the law and protect and serve the public. The least we can do is afford them the greatest degree of protection possible as they fight crime in our communities. 
The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act of 1998 will provide state and local law enforcement officers with the critical equipment they need to protect their officers in the line of duty. This bipartisan bill will create a $25 million grant program in the Department of Justice to provide matching funds to state and local law enforcement agencies to purchase body armor. I would like to underscore the importance of the word `Partnership' in this bill. This grant program will continue the effective federal-state-local partnerships that have proved so successful in the war on crime. 
One of the greatest features of this bill, Mr. President, is that it prefers law enforcement agencies that cannot now provide body armor for their officers. This is especially helpful to small and rural jurisdictions. In fact, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act requires the Justice Department to provide at least 50% of the grant program's funds to small jurisdictions comprising fewer than 100,000 people. This provision is especially important in states like South Carolina, where the vast majority of jurisdictions fit this description. 
The Fraternal Order of Police, National Sheriff's Association, International Union of Police Associations, and Police Executive Research Forum all endorse this bill, Mr. President. These groups understand better than anyone the importance of this legislation. They know from firsthand experience that body armor often can mean the difference between life and death for an officer. 
If we are serious about fighting crime, we must ensure the safety of our law enforcement officers. The best way to do this is to provide state and local law enforcement agencies with the funds to purchase new equipment such as body armor for their officers. Though we cannot protect every law officer from danger, we can and must ensure that they have the best equipment available to protect themselves while in the line of duty. 
The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act will do all these things. I am proud to co-sponsor it, and I encourage all my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation. Let us do our part in the war on crime.

Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator is right on target with respect to giving the President credit. There is no question, we increased taxes, cut spending, and cut the number of Federal employees. And in increasing the taxes, I will never forget the colleague from Texas, when he stated on the floor--regarding increasing taxes on Social Security--that they were going to be hunting us Democrats down in the streets and shooting us like dogs. I will never forget that. They not only projected a recession and a depression, but that Social Security tax increase, which I don't see anybody putting into a bill or talking about today--but at that particular time, taking on that hard choice, as they talked about, without a single Republican vote, was very, very difficult. But we faced the fire, and to President Clinton's credit, now we have the economy headed in the right direction. My comments on the unified budget and deficit is to make sure we don't go in the other direction.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, last week in remarks on the floor I referred to the Congressional Budget Office's report, `Economic and Budget Outlook for the Fiscal Years 1999 to 2008.' And at that particular time, Madam President, I pointed out that even the Congressional Budget Office had projected deficits not only of $188 billion for the present year and $170 billion for 1998, but of $200 billion for 1999, the year in which everyone in this town has been screaming we will reap a budgetary surplus. 
Now we have the President's budget. Madam President, this morning we not only received that budget, we saw in this country's newspapers of record such headlines as `On Budget Eve, Congress Feels Surplus Fever.' This particular article reports that the distinguished Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, stated, `We are on the edge, if we will have discipline, of a generation of surpluses.' 
So we have the President talking about balanced budgets as far as the eye can see in his State of the Union Message. And we now have the distinguished Speaker talking about surpluses as far as the eye can see for the next generation. 
Would that it were so. Would that we did not have any increase in the national debt. Would that we had no increase in the deficit. Would that we had no increase in the interest costs of the carrying charges on our national debt, which are now projected, Madam President, to be $1 billion a day, or $365 billion a year. That is one thing that everyone can agree on: that the interest on the federal debt is going up, up, and away. 
Let me emphasize the matter of the debt before I home in on the matter of Social Security and the spending of surpluses. In 1981, we had a national debt of $995.5 billion. We had not reached a trillion-dollar debt. 
For the first 200 years of our history, including the costs of all the wars our nation fought during that time--the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam--we did not reach a trillion-dollar debt. But in the last 16 years, we have reached now a $5.5 trillion debt, with interest costs of a billion dollars a day. Interest on the debt used to stand at a mere $95 billion; it now stands at $365 billion. So we are spending $270 billion more on interest alone than when we supposedly were going to balance the budget back in 1981. 
I remember when our distinguished President Ronald Reagan ran on balancing the budget and was elected in 1980. He came into office in 1981 and said, `Whoops. This is way worse than I ever expected. Instead of balancing the budget in a year, it's going to take me 3 years.' 
Even after passage of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Bill, we ran into the highest deficits we ever had heard of. The deficits and debt went up, up, and away under Reaganomics. Of course, the whole idea of Reaganomics, which George Bush called voodoo economics, was that cutting tax revenues some 25 percent would spur people to spend more, thus leading to increased government revenues from sales taxes and income taxes. This in turn, proponents of so-called Reaganomics said, would enable us to grow out of the federal deficit and national debt. In contrast, of course, we have grown into them. 
As a result, we now spend a billion dollars a day on interest to service the federal debt. The first thing at 8 o'clock every morning that the Government does is go down to the bank and borrow 
a billion dollars--every Sunday morning, Christmas morning, every holiday, every day in the year. It borrows and spends this billion dollars to pay the carrying charges on the debt. This money doesn't go for anything constructive: no highways, no foreign aid, no defense money. It's just waste added to the debt. 
This is the dilemma we find ourselves in. This is really the bottom line. But it has never been emphasized in this body. And momentarily, seeing that I had an opportunity to emphasize this on the floor of the Senate, I said to myself: `Now's my chance to sober everyone up, because we are spending more and getting less.' And everybody wonders why they are not getting adequate Government services. The reason we are not is because we are spending $270 billion more on interest than we were spending in 1981. We are spending more for absolutely nothing--a total of $365 billion for nothing. 
And now we have the President's budget. And as is the usual custom, the Administration says one thing and does another. I will never forget Attorney General John Mitchell's admonition, `Watch what we do, not what we say.' That could be the mantra of Congress and the White House today: `Watch what we do, not what we say.' 
Of course, if you look in the very first part of the President's budget, you can see projected on page 10 of the budget for next year, 1999, a $9.5 billion surplus. Isn't that grand? Isn't that wonderful? There it is: a $9.5 billion surplus on page 10. 
But, Madam President, let us, if you please, go all the way back to page 367 of the President's budget. You have to go search through the whole budget. I don't know that anybody has done this, but I have learned how to search out the truth in these budgets. On page 367 you will find a chart similar to the one by the CBO titled `Projections of the Federal Debt by Fiscal Year.' You will find the Federal Government's financing and debt. And when you look in the very, very small print, you will see it under the title `Total Gross Federal Debt.' 
Of course, they have highlighted other elements of the budget, such as `Debt Outstanding End of the Year.' They have highlighted in bold, black letters the `Debt Subject to Statutory Limitations End of the Year.' But it is in very small letters that they provide the `Total Gross Federal Debt.' But if you squint your eyes, you can see that the debt goes from $5,543.6 billion in 1998 to $5,738.1 billion in 1999. 
So the President, in his own budget--although you have to be a detective to find this--projects a deficit that, if adopted, ipso facto will be $194.5 billion. 
This is the situation that confronts us. But today one has to read in all the papers and magazines about this `surplus fever and tax cuts'; and you have to listen to the debate on the floor. `No, I think we ought to spend more for this program or that program. No, I think we ought to have tax cuts. That's what we ought to do with the surplus.' 
Madam President, the only way that anyone can possibly project any kind of balanced budget or surplus for next year of $9.5 billion is to use the trust funds--not just those of Social Security, because there is another $113 billion of Social Security being used--but the $90 billion in other trust funds. 
The easiest way to figure whether or not you have a deficit is to see whether or not you make more money than you spend each year. This works for families; it works for everyone. We must look at whether the Federal Government receives more money than it spends. Of course, if it spends more than it receives, it has a deficit. And that is why you must look at the bottom line of the national debt, where you will see that we actually spend $194.5 billion more than we take in. 
But the greatest gimmick and the actual fraud, Madam President, is the so-called unified budget. Supporters of this sham argue that President Lyndon Johnson and the Congress balanced the budget this way in 1968-1969. This is absolutely false; absolutely false. President Lyndon Baines Johnson did not use any 
surpluses in order to balance the budget.

Mr. HOLLINGS. With this chart, we can see the borrowed trust funds and the unified deficit including the trust funds. But then we see the actual deficit without the trust funds, the real deficit, with a column for each President: Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton. This table shows the national debt under each President, as well as the annual increases in spending on interest costs on that debt. 
If we look at 1968-1969, we find that listed actual trust funds totalled $300 million. Since the unified deficit with trust funds was $3.2 billion, the actual deficit without Social Security trust funds was $2.9 billion. So trust funds were not used to balance the budget. This is a fallacious argument. 
In fact, let me clear that up. In those days the distinguished Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee was Congressman Wilbur Mills of Arkansas. He was the authority on the federal budget and our nation's fiscal state. If you ever wanted to find out about a tax or revenue, if you ever wanted to talk about fiscal policy or otherwise, you went to see Wilbur. He was a brilliant individual. In 1972, he entered the Presidential race. Of course, before he got into that Presidential race--I cannot remember the exact year he announced--he came out and said we had so much money in Social Security that we should give recipients a cost-of-living-increase of 10 percent. And President Nixon said, `Well, if Wilbur Mills will give you 10 percent, I will give you 15 percent,' and we started spending away the Social Security moneys. We never did have a difficulty with Social Security until those shenanigans commenced. 
By 1980, we determined that Social Security would be running into the red and we created the Greenspan Commission, under the distinguished head of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. The Greenspan Commission came out with a report adopted in 1983, which said that not only are we going to balance Social Security's budget, we are going to have an inordinately high tax, a graduated tax, to make sure that we build up a surplus to take care of the baby boomers. That was the intent of building up the surplus. They knew they were going to have extra money. It wasn't a mystery because it was an inordinately high tax. They built up this surplus intentionally. And Section 21 of the Greenspan Commission report states that in order to maintain the surplus for the baby boomers through the year 2056, we must take Social Security out of the unified budget. 
Now, that is what Greenspan recommended. And this Senator worked as a member of the Budget Committee to get that done. Finally, in 1990, we reported it out from the Budget Committee by a vote of 20-1 that we do just that, take Social Security off budget. And 98 Senators voted for that on the floor of the Senate. And President George Bush, on November 5, 1990, signed section 13-301 into the law. Section 13-301 of the budget law says that the Congress and the President you shall not submit a budget using Social Security trust funds. 
Of course, that was violated and it is being violated now in this particular budget. Right here, it is violated. There is no question it is being violated because that is what all the newspapers are reporting on--they are talking about page 10, not page 367. 
Here is what has been occurring. Let's go right to Social Security. Last year we owed the trust funds $631 billion; by the end of September 1998, the Congressional Budget Office estimates we will owe $732 billion; and under the President's budget plan, by the year 2002 we will owe $1.236 trillion. Everybody is saying, wait a minute, we have to do something because in 10 years Social Security is going to be broke. Come on, it is broke now. If we look to the end of this year, we will owe Social Security $732 billion. Now, who in the year 2002 is going to recommend a tax increase of $1.236 trillion to redeem the Social Security IOUs? He will not be able to stand on the floor and get one vote. They will run him out. That will not happen. 
That is why this particular Senator has been insistent from the very beginning that we look at all the trust funds and the condition of the Government--Medicare, military retirement, civilian retirement, unemployment, highway, airports--to evaluate the federal deficit and debt. 
For example, at the end of this fiscal year we will owe highway trust funds $23 billion. Now, why are the highways crumbling and the bridges falling? Because the vehicle-automobile, gasoline taxes are not being used on the roads and the bridges. They are being used for food stamps, for foreign aid, or for any and every other purpose except for highways. Why don't we have updated radar at all the major airports in the U.S. for passengers' safety? After all, who pays airline tax? But the airline tax is not going to the airports. It is going for any and every other purpose but the airports. We owe them $10 billion. And I don't want to get the military retirees or the Civil Service retirees upset, but as of the end of September we will owe $133 billion to make payments to them. We will owe $460 billion, almost half a trillion dollars, to civilian retirees. 
This charade, this fraud, has got to stop. It is outrageous that the President comes to the American people and says in one breath, `Tonight I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that is every penny of any surplus--until we have taken all the measures necessary to strengthen the Social Security system for the 21st century.' And then, after giving that message last week, today he comes and loots the Social Security trust fund to the tune of $113 billion in order to report a $9.5 billion surplus. Of course, all the editorial writers and news columnists are writing that we will enjoy balanced budgets as far as the eye can see. We will have surpluses as far as the eye can see, they say, when the actual deficit under the President's budget is $194.5 billion. Look on page 367 of his report and you will see nothing but deficits for as far as the eye can see--namely, the debt increasing; namely, a billion dollars a day being paid now with the lowest of interest rates that we have had in our history. That amount is going to soar when interest rates rise because spending for interest goes up, up and away under the President's budget proposal. We really are in a downward spiral of financial responsibility here in the National Government. 
Now, I delight in the President's budget with respect to child care. I delight in the provisions in there for 100,000 more Border Patrol agents; 100,000 more cops; higher pay for teachers; and smaller classroom size. But we are going to have to pass a tobacco tax settlement or some other measure to get extra moneys for these particular programs. This Senator is willing to vote to pay for those programs. I am trying to put Government on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
I know about fiscal responsibility. I achieved the first AAA credit rating for the State of South Carolina, the first Southern State to receive this bond rating. In 1959 I worked like the dickens to get it done. I voted for that federal balanced budget in 1968-69. The entire budget, with the costs of the war in Vietnam and the Great Society, was only $178 billion. Today, we suffer from a $1.7 trillion budget. But we balanced it then. 
I was a cosponsor of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings in order to try to cut the deficits, but of course the quickest way to anonymity in public office is to cosponsor a bill with Senator Gramm or Senator Rudman. I never heard since from it but that is how it works around here. But we did get the majority of Democratic votes, 14 votes up and down against the opposition of the majority leader, the chairman of the Budget Committee and the Democratic whip. They all opposed Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, but we had a majority of Democrats on this side of the aisle vote for Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. I even suggested at one time a value-added tax to get on top of this sea of red ink, allocated to the deficit and the debt so we wouldn't get into this waste of $1 billion a day. 
I am still working now, not just on the amount of the deficit and debt but for the principle of truth, truth in budgeting. How 
do you get the national media, the national press, who are co-conspirators in this charade, to report the truth. They are talking about conspiracy around this town with regard to special prosecutors, when in reality the conspiracy is right here, in the so-called unified budget. The budget the White House submitted today results without question in a $194.5 billion deficit if adopted as it is now submitted. It is time everyone realize this. It is time we practice truth in governing and reporting. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the thrust of President Clinton's State of the Union address was `save Social Security first.' The quickest way to save Social Security is to stop looting Social Security. Over the years, we have looted the Social Security trust fund with wild abandon; we owe it to the tune of some $631 billion right this minute. It should be a $631 billion surplus. But actually, since Congress has expended it on foreign aid, defense, food stamps, and other programs in order to appear fiscally responsible, there is a deficit in Social Security. 
I see now from the Congressional Budget Office, and I take it from the President's budget to be submitted next Monday, that the CBO, along with the Congress and the President, is prepared, again, to go forward with this nonsense of a unified budget. The unified budget is a fraud. It allows Congress to spend money but get credit for not spending money. Only here do fiscally irresponsible people get a good government award. 
Let's think back a minute on President Lyndon Johnson, because the consensus is, `President Johnson changed government accounting procedures and created the concept and introduced the use of a unified budget, and that is how he got a surplus.' This is false; false. I was present during that time; I was there with George Mahon, chairman of the Appropriations Committee. We asked if we could cut $5 billion to achieve a total budget of $178 billion for the Great Society and the Vietnam War. Can you imagine that? We funded the Great Society and the War with just $178 billion. And where are we today? Today the budget is $1.7 trillion. During LBJ's presidency, we balanced the budget with a surplus of $3.2 billion. The Social Security trust fund then only amounted to $300 million. So President Johnson balanced the budget without trust funds and without a unified deficit. 
What really happened was that Wilbur Mills of the Ways and Means Committee, who was running for President up in New Hampshire, said to the American people: `Oh, we have so much money in that Social Security fund; I will give you a 10-percent COLA.' Then along came President Nixon and he said, `If he will give you 10, I will give you 15 percent.' 
We started draining the fund during the seventies. By 1980-1981--when I was chairman of the Budget Committee--we could see we were going to have a horrendous deficit in Social Security. So we formed the Greenspan commission, and we issued a report that recommended not only to impose a higher tax for Social Security to balance the Social Security budget, but more particularly to build up a trust fund for the Presiding Officer.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I got that reported out of the Budget Committee, and President George Walker Herbert Bush signed it into law on November 5, 1990: `Thou shalt not use the Social Security trust fund.' But, Mr. President, Congress today totally ignores it. Here is the economic budget outlook for fiscal year 1999. I ask unanimous consent that this table 2 be printed in the Record.

<DOCNO>105-hollings-sc-4-19980129</DOCNO>

Mr. HOLLINGS. Table 2, instead of showing that trust funds are not used, shows that Congress uses over $165 billion of trust funds--$165 billion. That is $101 billion from Social Security and $64 billion from the military retirement trust fund, Civil Service retirement trust fund, highway trust fund, airport trust fund; and the surplus crowd is trying to report just a $5 billion deficit. Come on. 
You have to go all the way back, Mr. President, to page 42 of the CBO's report. If you look at page 42, you can find the real deficit, because down there they have the gross Federal debt. Of course, they don't put it in red. I wish I had a chart here so everybody could see it. 
This is not how a family budgets. Families ask themselves if they spend more than they take in? They don't employ this unified budget nonsense, or economic flows or the Wholesale Price Index or the Consumer Price Index or any of this economic gobbledygook. If you spend more than you take in, you have a deficit, and that adds to your debt. 
Page 42 of the Congressional Budget Office's report shows that we go from a $5.5 trillion debt in 10 years to over $7.5 trillion. In the next 5 years, according to this chart, we are going to spend $957 billion more than we take in--under this so-called balanced budget plan. Yet everyone is running around, patting each other on the back and complimenting each other on fiscal responsibility and discipline. `A balanced budget as far as the eye can see,' says the President. Dr. June O'Neill said the same thing yesterday before the Budget Committee. Mr. President, they are talking out of the whole cloth. 
Their claims are false. They continue to use these trust funds to obscure the debt and deceive the people. We already have used Social Security, military, civilian, unemployment, highway, airport, railroad of $1.5 trillion we owe now, and under the 1998 projected current policy, CBO reports it will be $1.652 trillion. So we are using all of these trust funds, and President Clinton said all trust funds. I read from that particular report where he said any trust funds. I want to make sure everybody gets that because I am not being technical at all. 
I quote President Clinton: `Tonight I propose we reserve 100 percent of the surplus. That's every penny of any surplus.'

Mr. HOLLINGS. This is a short, one-paragraph bill. It says that Congress cannot use any of these surpluses and trust funds for any tax cut or any spending increase where we have caps. 
Maybe, Mr. President, they will get the money from the tobacco settlement. I don't know where they will get the money from. 
You are looking at a Senator who voted against spending increases and against tax cuts last year in order to try to bring about fiscal responsibility. We enjoy a good economy, Mr. President. And we want to stay the course. But let us practice truth in budgeting, and let us mean it. I have provided all the facts and figures here. 
There is a chart that everybody in America ought to see: the gross Federal debt. In the past year, 1997, we ran a deficit not of $22 billion but of $188 billion. The Congressional Budget Office projects an actual deficit of $170 billion. And, Mr. President, in 1999, the deficit will increase from $170 billion to $200 billion. Why? Because rather than heading in the right direction, Congress and the President last year increased spending and cut out revenues. Under current policy, the deficit will continue to soar, right on up and away to $205 billion by the year 2000. 
So everybody ought to understand that Congress and the White House can make all the wonderful talks they like; and everyone can say, `Well, the President wants to use those funds for spending, and I want to use it for tax cuts.' That suits me, whatever you all want to do, but let us have truth in budgeting and let us not use any of the trust funds as an offset. 
The bills I introduce today will achieve both of these goals; they will ensure an honest budget and protect Social Security and other trust funds. 
I thank the distinguished Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the exemplary career and extraordinary life of one of South Carolina's most beloved citizens: Dr. Walter Gamewell `Curly" Watson. 
Dr. Watson, who will turn 88 in February, was born in Trenton, South Carolina, on the same farm he owns today. He graduated from The Citadel college during the height of the Great Depression. Although he earned the highest grade point average in his class, he was--like so many of us during that time--unable to find work. So in order to earn money for medical school, he taught math and coached football at high schools in Edgefield, South Carolina, and Bainbridge, Georgia, for the following seven years. 
Finally, in 1939, he was able to enter medical school; and in 1943, he graduated from the Medical College of Georgia. After interning and completing his residency at University Hospital in Augusta, Dr. Watson served two years as an Army physician in Korea and the Philippines. 
Before shipping out, Dr. Watson married Audrey Bazemore, a University Hospital nurse whom he met during his residency. Today, the two remain devoted to one another. 
In fact, it was only at Audrey's insistence that Walter agreed to allow University Hospital to bear his name. He is notorious for avoiding attention and eschewing praise. Indeed, Dr. Watson's life and career are marked by his humility. 
Dr. Watson began his private practice 50 years ago, joining the practice established by Senator Strom Thurmond's late brother J. W. While delivering over 50 babies a month for most of the past 50 years, Watson also found time to serve his hospital, church, and community. He led Grace Methodist Church's efforts to build two new sanctuaries, as well as its relief mission for the victims of Hurricane Hugo. And for over 40 years, Watson has served as the team physician for North Augusta High School. 
Walter Watson also has received numerous accolades from his peers in the medical profession. Among other honors, he was named Professor Emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology at the Medical College of Georgia. And the hundreds of letters he has received over the years from friends, colleagues, and patients are testament to his unsurpassed bedside manner and deft human touch. 
Perhaps greatest among Watson's accomplishments is his success as a family man. He raised five children, all of whom have grown up to be well-respected members of their community. All four of his daughters became nurses; they received their first training from their father. 
Today, Mr. President, the University of Georgia Hospital names its Women's Center in Dr. Watson's honor. I can think of no more fitting tribute to this man who has given much to his community while asking nothing in return. At a time when many speak of the need to foster volunteerism, Dr. Walter Watson's life serves as a lesson in humility, faith, commitment, professionalism, and service. Beloved teacher, healer, father, and husband: Walter Watson is an inspiration to us all.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of South Carolina's leading ladies, Betty Jo Rhea. Betty Jo retired as Mayor of Rock Hill, South Carolina on January 20. With her retirement, my state loses one of its most beloved politicians and progressive leaders. 
Betty Jo Rhea began her career of public service over 25 years ago, when she was appointed to the Rock Hill Parks and Recreation Commission. She was elected to the Rock Hill City Council in 1977, and has spent the last 20 years in the thick of her city's political fray. 
In 1986, Rhea became Rock Hill's first woman Mayor. When she retired in January after 12 years in the office, she also was one of the city's longest serving and most popular mayors. During her tenure, Betty Jo focused her prodigious energies on attracting jobs to the region and preventing economic collapse in the wake of the closing of the textile mills that had underpinned Rock Hill's economy. 
She has been incredibly successful. Not only did she help prevent a severe recession, she led Rock Hill in an economic rejuvenation. Under her leadership, the city built three business parks to attract large industries, began a downtown revitalization and preservation program, and started a successful recycling program in cooperation with Rock Hill Clean and Green. 
But Betty Jo didn't stop there. She also went abroad to promote Rock Hill, serving as the region's most successful ambassador. She was President of the Municipal Association of South Carolina, on the board of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and active in the National League of Cities. 
In recognition of her achievements and dedication to her community, the Municipal Association of South Carolina awarded Rhea the Allison Farlow Award, its highest honor. And in appreciation of her support for recycling, conservation, and greenery programs, Rock Hill Clean and Green created the Rock Hill Environmental Action (RHEA) award, named in her honor. For Rhea's contributions to the community, Winthrop University bestowed on her an honorary doctorate. 
As Betty Jo's friends and admirers know, her greatest attributes are her sunny disposition, charm, and complete devotion and loyalty to Rock Hill and its people. Of course, these qualities haven't hurt her in politics, either. They have won her many friends and allies; and no doubt her success as Mayor has been aided by her habit of baking homemade bread for City Council members at Christmas. 
Fortunately for South Carolina, Betty Jo Rhea's retirement from her duties as Mayor is not a retirement from public life and community service. She is set to begin her new career as head of a fund-raising campaign for the arts, and she plans to volunteer with the Salvation Army. Rhea's days of ribbon-cutting are over, but the people of Rock Hill can look forward to many more years of her wise counsel and progressive leadership. 
Mr. President, I salute Betty Jo Rhea. She exemplifies all the virtues of citizenship and political leadership. She has pursued politics not out of egotism, but rather from the sincere desire to help her neighbors and strengthen her community. Thanks to her leadership, Rock Hill has not only weathered economic hardship, it has ridden the storm to ever-rising economic heights. 
As one of her many fans remarked upon her retirement, Betty Jo Rhea truly was `a people's mayor.'

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 927, a bill to reauthorize the National Sea Grant College Program. First, I offer my thanks to Senator Snowe, the primary sponsor of the bill. 
Sea Grant is a results-oriented program that builds bridges among Government, academia, and industry, putting information and technology from research laboratories into the hands of the people who can really use it. The National Sea Grant Program serves as a successful model for multidisciplinary research directed at scientific advancement and economic development. Sea Grant has improved the competitiveness of the Nation's coastal and marine economy by increasing the pool of skilled manpower, fostering scientific achievement, facilitating technology transfer, and educating the public on critical resource and environmental issues. 
Mr. President, the 1966 Stratton Commission outlined a seminal vision for the benefits this Nation could derive from the oceans and coasts. The Sea Grant Program has played a vital part in realizing that vision. Today, Sea Grant researchers are examining important problems affecting our marine resources. This research is not just being put on a shelf. It is being used to improve aquaculture, market new technologies, develop pharmaceuticals, educate our young people, manage fisheries, and much more. This legislation, S. 927, will carry Sea Grant into its next 30 years by strengthening the Sea Grant Program, improving the procedures by which it operates, clarifying the respective roles of the Federal Government and the universities that participate in the program, and reducing administrative costs. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important program and the passage of the bill.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, when TWA flight 800 exploded over the coast of Long Island on July 17, 1997, 230 people perished. They left behind people who loved and cared about them. They left a void in many people's lives. When a USAirways jet crashed in Charlotte in July 1994, 37 people died, including many from my State. The pain and suffering those families suffered is heartbreaking. 
H.R. 1271, the FAA Research, Engineering, and Development Authorization Act of 1997, authorizes more than 4450 million to conduct basic aviation safety research, with one primary goal--to reduce the likelihood that another family will lose a loved one in an aviation accident. 
When we talk about safety, it all begins with two factors--leadership and research. The U.S. today is the world's leader in aviation safety. However, that is not enough. We must maintain that leadership and continue to pursue the best means to avoid aviation disasters. 
Over the last several years, we have stressed the need to improve security. New machines continue to be tested and improved. This bill furthers that process. We also must remain vigilant about other areas to improve safety, like controlled flight into terrain and human factors. All too often an accident is a function of a human error. The error can be the result of technology design or human judgment. Research remains the key to making adjustments so that our families do not have to experience what the families of TWA flight 800 or the USAirways Charlotte flight had to endure. 
The bill also recognizes that we must work with our colleges and technical schools to develop programs to meet challenges of the future. Our Nation's aircraft maintenance program will be changing. Our air traffic control workforce and maintenance workforce will be changing with the new equipment scheduled to be installed over the next 5 years. We must remain ahead of the technological curve--working with the schools will facilitate our preparation for change. The administration knows this and has worked with me to address that issue. 
We worked hard with the administration on this bill, and it is my understanding that they support the bill. In the area of security, for example, the fiscal year 1998 Transportation Appropriations Act provided $44.225 million. The authorization in H.R. 1271 is more than $11 million more, an amount which will give the FAA flexibility to move funds from one account to another, should it be necessary. 
I understand that the FAA may request additional funding for fiscal year 1999 to further its modernization efforts. In addition, more funding for security may be requested, and we will need to consider those requests, if made. 
I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate passage of S. 1213, the Oceans Act of 1997. The bill calls for an action plan for the twenty-first century to explore, protect, and make better use of our oceans and coasts. Its passage is, quite simply, the most important step we can take today to ensure the future of our oceans and coasts. 
I thank my colleagues for their support, in particular, the leadership of the Commerce Committee, Senators McCain and Snowe, for their cosponsorship and their efforts over the last several weeks to bring this bill to the floor. Following in the Commerce Committee tradition with respect to ocean issues, this has been a bipartisan process. I also thank the other cosponsors of the legislation, Senators Stevens, Kerry, Breaux, Inouye, Kennedy, Boxer, Biden, Lautenberg, Akaka, Murkowski, Thurmond, and Murray for their continued support. Finally, I want to express my appreciation to the numerous academic, environmental, and industry groups who agree that the time has come for this bill. 
The legislation that is before the Senate today is a substitute by Senator Snowe and myself, that reflects the comments received from the administration and concerns expressed by Senator Chafee and others. The essential elements of the bill remain the same as the committee-reported version and would establish two new entities. First is a 16-member Commission on Ocean Policy (Commission) to provide recommendations for a national ocean and coastal policy. Second is the National Ocean Council (Council), a high-level Federal interagency working group to advise the President and the Commission, assist in policy development and implementation, and coordinate Federal programs relating to ocean and coastal activities. 
The changes made by the Snowe-Hollings substitute focus primarily on addressing concerns expressed regarding the establishment of the Council. Over the past two weeks, the National Security Council and the Department of Commerce have worked under Secretary Daley's able leadership to pull together the views of the numerous Federal entities involved in ocean and coastal activities. The results of that effort are reflected in the amendment, and I am including a letter from Secretary Daley expressing the administration's support for S. 1213 following my statement. At Senator Chafee's request, we also have agreed to sunset the Council one year after the Commission completes its report. As we have discussed with both the administration and Senator Chafee, the purpose of the Council is to ensure coordinated input by Federal agencies and departments in the development and implementation of a national ocean and coastal policy. The Council is intended to provide an important forum for administration ocean policy discussions, not to supersede other ongoing coordination mechanisms like the interagency working group on international ocean policy, nor to interfere with ongoing Federal activities 
under existing law. The changes made by the substitute should clarify that intent, and if, based on experience and the Commission recommendations, the Council proves to be an effective long-term mechanism for coordinating Federal ocean activities, it could be extended either administratively or legislatively. 
In 1966, Congress enacted the Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act (1966 Act). This bill would update and replace that legislation. The 1966 Act established the Stratton Commission whose report, `Our Nation and the Sea,' defined national objectives and programs with respect to the oceans and in conjunction with the 1966 Act laid the foundation for U.S. ocean and coastal policy and programs, guiding their development for three decades. 
While the Stratton Commission displayed broad vision, the world has changed in numerous ways since 1966. The U.S. legal and bureaucratic framework related to the oceans has grown enormously in the past 30 years. In 1966, there was no NOAA, no Environmental Protection Agency, and no laws like the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, or the Oil Pollution Act. Today people who work and live on the water face a patchwork of confusing and sometimes contradictory federal and state regulations. Fishermen tell me they need a law degree to go fishing. This bill will allow us to reduce conflicts while maintaining environmental and health safeguards. 
Oceans and coasts face pressures today that the authors of the 1966 Act could not have foreseen. Today, over 50 percent of the U.S. population lives in coastal areas which account for less than 10 percent of our land area. By the year 2010, 127 million people, an estimated 60 percent of Americans, will live along the coast. Greater understanding of ocean and coastal ecosystems and improved management are essential to maintain healthy coasts and to prepare for and protect communities from natural hazards like hurricanes. 
We need to do a better job of managing and using marine resources as demonstrated by fish kills, oil spills, the invasion of zebra mussels, and the death of thousands of marine animals from marine plastic debris. We have fallen short in defending our shores and waters. In recent years, New England has struggled with the collapse of their traditional cod, haddock, and flounder. In other regions, overfished stocks include sharks, swordfish, bluefin tuna, salmon, red snapper, grouper, and weakfish. Restoring fisheries could add an estimated $2.9 billion to the economy each year. However, we are allowing about 20,000 acres of coastal wetlands, important fish habitat, to disappear each year. Louisiana alone has lost half a million acres of wetlands since the 
mid 1950's. 
Environmental threats to the oceans are growing increasingly complex. This past summer, local newspapers reported daily on Pfiesteria, the tiny killer cell wreaking havoc in the Chesapeake Bay and North Carolina. Thousands of fish were killed--literally eaten alive by this toxic organism--and some fishermen, swimmers, boaters, and scientists exposed to the cell experienced memory loss, skin lesions, and other troubling symptoms. Scientists suspect everything from inadequate city sewage plants to farm manure and fertilizer runoff. The technical, legal, and management tools to address Pfiesteria may exist collectively within a variety of federal and state agencies. However, we currently lack a structured and effective means to bring this expertise to bear on the problem. 
Another challenge is El NinAE6o, the cyclical warming of ocean waters off the western coast of South America. The warming results in significant shifts in weather patterns, including rainfall and temperatures in the United States and elsewhere. Experts estimate that an additional 150 Americans die in storms and flooding in El NinAE6o years. While El NinAE6o is a natural phenomenon, human effects on the oceans and atmosphere may increase its magnitude and frequency. Advanced forecasts could reduce by up to $1 billion the agricultural, economic, and social impacts resulting from El NinAE6o. In addition, action to reduce global warming and other changes to the oceans and atmosphere may reduce the severity of future El NinAE6o events. 
We have an opportunity to take economic and scientific advantage of recent technological advances related to the oceans. Today, we still have explored only a tiny fraction of the sea, but with the use of new technologies what we have found is truly incredible. For example, hydrothermal vents, hot water geysers on the deep ocean floor, were discovered just 20 years ago by oceanographers trying to understand the formation of the earth's crust. Now this discovery has led to the identification of nearly 300 new types of marine animals with untold pharmaceutical and biomedical potential. 
A re-examination of national policies is also essential to maintain U.S. leadership on international ocean issues. On November 16, 1994, the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea entered into force for most countries of the world. Although the United States has accepted most provisions of the treaty as customary international law and 120 other nations are party, U.S. ratification remains in question. At issue is whether changes made to the treaty in 1994 adequately correct the seabed mining provisions that the United States has opposed for twelve years. 
The last 31 years have brought great changes to our oceans and coast. Our nation needs to reexamine our policies and programs so that we can continue to explore, protect, and sustainably use ocean resources now and throughout the twenty-first century. The Oceans Act of 1997 will guide us through that process with the vision it demands. I urge the Senate to pass S. 1213.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to thank Congressman Underwood of Guam for pursuing H.R. 2476. The bill, virtually identical to a bill reported by the Commerce Committee, S. 1196, puts the same burden on foreign air carriers serving the United States as those now imposed on U.S. carriers when dealing with the families affected by aviation disasters. Under existing law, U.S. carriers must develop and submit plans to the Department of Transportation and the National Transportation Safety Board on how they will address the needs of the families of victims of disasters. The law today does not include foreign air carriers, and thus, H.R. 2476 is needed. 
The bill is supported by the Administration, and I support its adoption. What we are asking all of the carriers to do is treat people fairly. The U.S. carriers have already been asked to do it, and now we are asking the foreign air carriers to do it. All carriers, foreign or U.S., should be prepared to deal with the families and to provide them with the kinds of assistance they have every reason to expect. H.R. 2476 ensures that this will happen. I urge the Senate to pass this bill.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, last year, as part of the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act of 1996, we imposed a series of new requirements before an `air carrier' could hire a pilot. When the bill as originally crafted was being developed, we worked with the pilots' unions and with the Air Transport Association to develop a workable approach that is fair to pilots and airlines and advances aviation safety. 
H.R. 2626 clears up a number of technical problems, but continues the spirit of the original legislation--to make sure that pilots operating commercial aircraft are qualified. For many smaller carriers, such as on-demand carriers like Bankair in South Carolina, the new law created a number of logistical problems. I added a provision to the fiscal year 1998 Transportation Appropriations law to ensure that the FAA, as holder of some pilot records, is able to supply those records expeditiously. 
H.R. 2626 will allow air carriers to hire, but not use, a pilot until his or her records had been checked. Smaller carriers operating non-scheduled flights also are given additional flexibility. I support the changes, and urge the passage of H.R. 2626.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join our Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Gregg, in presenting this Fiscal Year 1998 Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Conference Agreement to the Senate. This is a good agreement that has been worked out in a bipartisan fashion. It has taken us over six weeks of negotiations with the House to reach consensus. I should note that the Senate passed our version of the bill back on July 29 by a vote of 99 to 0. 
In the Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill we fund programs ranging from the FBI to our State Department embassies overseas, to fisheries research and the National Weather Service, to the Supreme Court and the Federal Communications Commission. It requires a balancing act of the priorities of the Nation, of the sometimes shared and, as we have seen in this conference, more often competing interests of our colleagues here in the Congress, and the priorities of the Administration--all within the confines of our 302(b) allocation. I think Chairman Gregg and his able staff--Jim Morhard, Kevin Linskey, Paddy Link, Dana Quam, Carl Truscott and Vasiliki Alexopoulos--have done an outstanding job in balancing these interests in their work with our counterparts on the House Appropriations Committee. In the face of a very involved House Republican leadership and an administration that tried to give away the store in an effort to buy fast-track votes, we have held our own--and I fully support the agreement that we are considering today. 
In total, this bill provides $31.777 billion in budget authority, $158 million more than the Senate-passed bill. We have $1.881 billion more than was appropriated last year, and the bill is $275 million below the President's request. 
Once again, the CJS appropriations bill makes it clear that Congress is intent on funding Justice and law enforcement as a top priority. This bill provides appropriations totaling $17.5 billion for Justice--an increase of $1 billion above last year for the Justice Department. Including fees we provide the Department through appropriations action, the total Justice Department budget is $19.5 billion. 
Within the Justice Department, the FBI is provided $2.9 billion. Included in this is a large increase of $143 million for the FBI to enhance its counterterrorism activities. This amount includes $54 million to acquire counterterrorism readiness capabilities for responding to and managing incidents involving improvised explosive devices, chemical and biological agents, and cyber attacks. Also, $10 million is provided to stop child exploitation on the Internet, a new issue affecting our youth that this Committee held a special hearing on earlier this year. We have provided enhanced funding to reinvigorate our battle against organized crime and to combat the La Cosa Nostra's efforts to penetrate the securities industry. Finally, we have provided $44.5 million which will complete the new FBI laboratory at Quantico, Virginia. 
The Drug Enforcement Administration is funded at $1.1 billion. Included in this amount is $34 million for 60 new agents, $30 million for counter-drug efforts along the Southwest border, $11 million targeted for methamphetamine production and trafficking, and $10 million and 120 
positions for efforts to reduce heroin trafficking--all priorities of the Senate. 
Also in Justice, the bill enhances INS border control by recommending 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, restoring the integrity of the naturalization process, and expanding revocation, incarcerations, and deportation activities. The INS is funded at $3.8 billion. A program that most members have been hearing about from their constituents is the extension of 245(i). The conferees have adopted a `grandfathering' clause that would allow 245(i) processing for anyone who has filed with the Attorney General or for labor certification with the Department of Labor by January 14, 1998. 
The CJS bill also provides funds to accelerate and expand efforts by U.S. Attorneys to collect the estimated $34 billion in unpaid child support. I'm especially pleased to note that an increase of $8.3 million is provided to activate the new National Advocacy Center in my home state. This center will provide training in litigation and advocacy to our Assistant U.S. Attorneys and State and Local Prosecutors. It will be to the U.S. Attorneys what Quanitco is to the FBI and DEA. Finally, we have included $1 million for our U.S. Attorney Rene Josey to continue his outstanding violent crime task force efforts with our state and local law enforcement personnel. 
The conference agreement provides $1.4 billion for the Community Policy program and continues our commitment to put 100,000 cops on the beat. I'm especially pleased to note that we have included $100 million for an innovative program that addresses COPS retention issues in smaller communities with populations below 50,000. In these small rural communities the COPS program has been especially effective. I've seen it first hand in communities across South Carolina, and I'm pleased that the House and Senate conferees were willing to support my initiative. 
Additional programs to note with Justice include: $25 million for the Regional Information Sharing System [RISS]; $505 million for the Edward Byrne Memorial Formula Grant Program and $523 for the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program; $30 million for Drug Courts; $238.6 million for juvenile justice prevention programs including $25 million to combat underage drinking of alcoholic beverages. This last program was offered as an amendment to the bill by Senator Byrd, Senator Hatch and myself last summer. $271 million provided for Violence Against Women Programs. $556 million is provided for State Prison or `Truth in Sentencing' grants and $585 million is provided for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. 
Finally, let me point out that this agreement includes $250 million for a new Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant. I know that there is some controversy among my colleagues because we have provided this funding even though the House and Senate have not collectively completed action on an authorization bill. This program provides for such programs as: building, expanding or operating juvenile detention and corrections facilities; hiring additional juvenile judges, probation officers and court appointed defenders; drug courts; and hiring prosecutors. We have provided that these funds are available to states and local governments that consider the reforms provided for the House-passed bill. We have also provided that no state receive less than .5 percent. Everyone should be clear, that we are providing this as a stop-gap measure until the Senate is able to pass a juvenile justice bill. The bill language in this conference agreement makes it clear that these conditions are only for fiscal year 1998, and will cease upon 
enactment of a new Juvenile Justice authorization bill. 
In funding the Commerce Department, our bill provides $4.3 billion, an increase of $422 million over this year's enacted amounts. There are a number of accounts in Commerce that are worth noting. 
The International Trade Administration has been allocated $283 million this year, and it's four program activities are funded at the following levels: Trade Development is at $59 million; Market Access and Compliance has a total of $17.3 million, which is an increase from last year; the Import Administration ends up at $28.7 million; and the U.S. and Foreign Commercial Service is given $171 million, an increase of almost $8 million from last year. 
The Bureau of Export Administration is given $43.9 million this year. Our agreement on BXA has some components that should be of no surprise to those familiar with this program. We've funded BXA to continue their counterterrorism activities, to address their new export control responsibilities that were transferred to them from the Department of State, and to begin activities related to their responsibilities under the Chemical weapons Convention Treaty. 
The Economic Development Administration, a favorite of many of my colleagues, is at the higher house level of $340 million, including $178 million for Title I Public Works program, $30 million for Title IX Economic Adjustment Assistance, $9.1 million for technical assistance, and $9.5 million for trade adjustment assistance. 
The bill funded the largest account in the Department of Commerce, NOAA, at $2 billion, slightly below the higher Senate number. This includes $241 million for the National Ocean Service, $346 million for the National Marine Fisheries Service, $277 million for Oceanic and Atmospheric Research activities, and $520 million for the National Weather Service. One thing NOAA isn't lacking is in the number of programs it funds. To mention a few, it should be noted that we've provided NOAA with $3.5 million for pfiesteria and algal bloom research, a new problem that we became all to aware of over the last few months here on the East Coast. We also gave the National Ocean Service $44 million for mapping and charting so it can meet its long-term mission requirements to examine ocean activities. The popular Sea Grant program has been continued at $56 million, funds have been allocated to study that omnipresent El Nino, and continued support is given to our National Weather satellites. 
I am especially pleased that we have included $1 million for our new Ocean Policy Commission, the first serious look at our ocean policy and NOAA since the Stratton Commission in the late 1960's. I've talked with Dr. Baker at NOAA, Admiral Watkins, and Dr. Ballard--and we all believe that it is time to reinvigorate our ocean programs and put the `O back in NOAA.' You know, we all spend so much time looking to space and a little mechanical robot on Mars, Yet 75% of our planet is ocean, and our exploration of it is woefully lacking. 
The hot topic of the Commerce Department this year and the political issue that consumed our bill, the Census Bureau, is provided with $550 million, which is an increase of $326 million. But funding wasn't the issue of controversy. Rather, we had a sticky situation to work out regarding the fate of the 2000 Decennial Census in terms of whether statistical sampling could be 
used for the last 10 percent of the population. The Census language that was finally agreed upon over the last few days is a compromise agreement between the White House and GOP leadership in the House which allows the Commerce Department to move forward with its efforts to plan for and conduct the year 2000 decennial census. The agreement seeks to ensure that the Federal Courts will rule on the constitutionality of using statistical sampling prior to the next census by creating expedited judicial review proceedings, and it establishes a Census Monitoring Board that will observe and monitor all aspects of the preparation of the 2000 census, including dress rehearsals. 
Now for the remaining programs in Commerce--the Patent and Trademark Office was provided with $716 million, including fees; we have been hearing from the Inspector General of Commerce about poor management over there and we are going to take a close look at PTO programs next fiscal year. With respect to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, it is funded at $677 million, slightly lower than enacted levels; I'm pleased that Manufacturing Extension Centers are funded at $113 million and the Advanced Technology Program [ATP] is funded at $193 million. I'm pleased that we seem to finally be getting to a sane policy on our Commerce technology programs. They are out lead edge in the trade war. This year the rhetoric subsided, and we started to get back to normalcy and `adult supervision' around here, as Senator Dole would say. No one is seriously considering unilaterally disarming in the trade war and disestablishing the Department of Commerce and our technology programs. 
Now to discuss the Judiciary--the total Judiciary account is funded at $3.463 billion, $200 million above enacted levels. We have provided the Federal Judges with a cost of living adjustment. And, with respect to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, we have agreed on a Commission to study judicial organization. So we have avoided a veto issue and will look to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to pick qualified, fair experts to review the situation. 
In the State Department and international programs title, we have included $4 billion for the Department of State and have supported the consolidation of our international affairs agencies. Within this amount we've provided $91 million to State and USIA to accelerate the replacement of obsolete computers and communications gear, and $19.6 million to renovate projects worldwide such as our facilities in Beijing, China. $9.5 million is provided for architectural and engineering work necessary to move our Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of Israel. I can't think of any other nation where we refuse to recognize its capital. It is time for us to put our Embassy in the capital of Israel. 
The bill has funded Contributions to International Organizations at $955 million to pay the costs assessed to the United States for membership in international organizations. Within this amount, $54 million is for payment of United Nations arrerages. Additionally, Contributions of International Peacekeeping Activities is funded at $256 million, including $46 million for payment of arrerages. So we have met our commitments under the budget agreement. I only hope that Chairman Helms and Senator Biden can get a State Department Authorization bill through the Congress so we can make meaningful changes in New York, and we can reorganize our international affairs into a more rational structure. 
I'm especially pleased that the conference adopted language that I proposed that requests the State Department to send a reprogramming to ensure that the United States maintains its vote in international organizations. With respect to organizations like the International Rubber 
Organization [INRO] we are hurting U.S. business and prestige by maintaining shortfalls. We are letting other third world nations dominate and have put the creditworthiness of the United States in a position along with the Ivory Coast and Nigeria. We need to keep current and keep our seat at the table. 
Other programs to note within this Title of the bill include $1.1 billion for United States Information Administration [USIA]. Under the USIA account, the National Endowment for Democracy is funded at $30 million, the East-West Center is provided with $12 million, the North-South Center is $1.5 million, International Broadcasting is $364 million, and Educational and Cultural Exchange programs are $198 million without the Senate-passed overhead certification requirements. Additionally, $41.5 million is provided for Arms Control and Disarmament Agency [ACDA]. 
Finally, in the Related Agencies Title of our bill, it should be noted that the Maritime Administration was funded at $138 million, with a level of $35.5 million for the Maritime Security Program; the Small Business Administration is funded at $705 million and for its non-credit programs, the bill provides $500,000 minimum level for all Small Business Development Centers; the Federal Trade Commission is funded at $106.5 million; and Legal Services Corporation is at $283 million, including Senator Wellstone's floor amendment which ensure that income eligibility determinations in cases of domestic violence are made only on the basis of the assets and income of the individual. 
Finally, on a separate but related note, I would like to take a moment to address a matter of importance regarding the Federal Communications Commission, which is provided for this Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill. On July 1, the interstate access fees paid by long distance companies to connect their customers to the local telephone companies' networks were reduced by over $1.5 billion annually. AT&T and MCI responded to these reductions by announcing plans to pass these savings to their customers. 
AT&T committed to reduce its day and evening rates by 5 and 15 percent, respectively, on July 15. One of the news services reported that AT&T's residential customers would save $600 million and business customers would save $300 million annually. Similarly, MCI announced it will pass along these savings to customers as well. 
In the past, AT&T was regulated as a dominant carrier and regularly filed its tariffs with the Federal Communications Commission thereby providing the necessary verification of these types of savings for consumers. With AT&T now being a non-dominant carrier, it no longer has to file data with the Commission to justify its rates. There is some concern that the tariffs that AT&T and MCI have filed with the Commission do not contain a sufficient analysis to demonstrate the amount of the long distance price reductions have been passed on to consumers. At a minimum, the Commission should verify that amount of access charge reductions pledged by these carriers are passed on to consumers. 
The Commission should take whatever steps it deems necessary to ensure that these carriers furnish sufficient data to verify that consumers have indeed benefited from access charge reductions. The Commission should also monitor long distance rates to insure that the benefits of these reductions are not reversed by subsequent increases. 
Ensuring that the long distance carriers make good on their commitment to flow through access charge reductions to consumers in the form of lower long distance rates is an important issue that should not be overlooked by the Commission. 
Mr. President, this is a good bill and I support it. We have had to make some tough decisions, but under the able leadership of Chairman Gregg and his able staff, I think we have made the right decisions. Senator Gregg has really taken hold of this bill this year. And, of course, I want to thank my good friends in the other body, Chairman Hal Rogers and Mr. Alan Mollohan of West Virginia. They are true professionals. They have outstanding staff, first rate professional staff in Jim Kulikowski, Therese McAuliffe, Jennifer Miller, Mike Ringler, Jane Wiseman, Pat Schleuter, Mark Murray, David Reich, Sally Gaines and Liz White. 
I encourage my colleagues to support the FY 1998 Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today we are passing important legislation which I strongly oppose by voice vote. The normal Senate procedure would be to vote on such an important bill, and I do not like to see Senators avoid a recorded vote on a bill with such dire implications for public education. However, the President has committed to veto the full bill, and I am confident from repeated past votes that if we did not have this commitment, the Senate would block the bill. Also, without this commitment, I would be glad not only to force a vote, but also to discuss the bill at length. 
In fact, there is a healthy sign that even supporters of the ill-advised idea of starting a taxpayer-funded private school voucher program are re-thinking their support. Five days ago, the House defeated a private school voucher plan. Thirty-five House Republicans voted against creation of a voucher program on the basis that the legislation did not include basic civil rights protections that also are absent in the bill before us. 
The United States Catholic Conference opposed that bill. I quote here from their letter: 
An additional reason why the USCC is unable to support H.R. 2746 is the `Not School Aid' provision in the new section 6405(a). . . . Section 6405(a) can readily be construed to negate the application of longstanding civil rights statutes, in particular, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title X of the Education Amendments of 1972 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, that would normally apply to a scholarship program. 
In other words, by saying that the federal aid going to private schools under a voucher program is `not school aid' the bill proponents excuse them from full compliance with federal protections that currently apply to public schools. 
Mr. President, that is not just my interpretation or that of the Catholic Conference. That is the reading of proponents of the bill. 
Specifically, Mr. Clint Bolick, who has a group named `Institute for Justice,' has been agitating to start taxpayer funding for private school tuitions. Here is what Mr. Bolick said about the Catholic Conference and civil rights in a memo that leaked out last month: 
Dick Komer and I met with representatives of the Catholic Conference, who urged that the bill contain the full panoply of federal civil rights regulations, including Title IX (gender) and disability provisions. We argued strongly against those regulations. We are pleased to report that the final bill contains only a general anti-discrimination requirement and expressly provides that schools are not `recipients of federal funds.' 
So Mr. Bolick `argued strongly' against civil rights for girls and disabled children, but he is pleased to report that schools receiving vouchers would not be `recipients of federal funds.' 
This is absurd. The federal government today spends about $12 billion on elementary and secondary education. That is about $250 per child in a public school. But the proponents of this bill want from the outset to give private schools $3,200 per child in federal funds. If we do that, just three voucher children would provide a private school with more federal assistance than we provide to a whole public school classroom. If that is `Not School Aid,' I don't know what is. There are a lot of public school classrooms that would like to have $3,200 per child in federal assistance, and they would not be crowing about how basic civil rights protections were rolled back. 
I say this to criticize this proposed legislation, not the private schools. I believe that we have a duty as public servants to fund the public schools, and we have a duty to the private schools to leave them alone. I support private schools. About nine out of ten are religious, and I particularly support their freedom to stay that way without federal intervention. Make no mistake. If we go down this road of putting $3,200 per child of federal taxpayers' money into private school classrooms, federal regulation will follow and that will be a tragedy. 
This is not conjecture, the Bush Administration studied it. In a report titled `Choice of Schools in Six Nations,' here is what they found:  
For those who believe strongly in religious schooling and fear that government influence will come with public funding, reason exists for their concern. Catholic or Protestant schools in each of the nations studied have increasingly been assimilated to the assumptions and guiding values of public schooling. This process does not even seem to be the result of deliberate efforts . . . but rather of the difficulty for a private school playing by public rules, to maintain its distance from the common assumptions and habits of the predominant system. 
World Bank economist Estelle James did a similar survey and found that `. . . heavy controls invariably accompany subsidies, particularly over teacher salaries and qualifications, price, and other entrance criteria.' She looked particularly closely at Australia, and found `. . . increasing regulation and centralization of decisions and the loss of private school autonomy . . .' 
I raise all of these points to appeal to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I do not talk to hear myself talk, but to urge serious consideration. We have House colleagues reconsidering. We have the Catholic Conference urging civil rights protections. We have Bush Administration and World Bank studies indicating heavy regulation. We have a proposal that clearly disadvantages public schools on the matter of federal funding. Who will really be happy if we pass this? 
Mr. President, we must finally remember our duty to public education. I go back to Horace Mann, the great champion of public schools. He said that 
The idea of an educational system that was at once both universal, free and available to all the people, rich and poor alike, was revolutionary. This is the great thing about America. No other nation ever had such an institution. . . . The free public school system . . . has been in large measure the secret of America's success. 
The proposal before us erodes public education. It disadvantages public schools in federal funding and under federal regulation. Instead, it offers more funds to private schools which should exist as an independent alternative, but which are not `universal, free' or `available to all the people.' I urge my colleagues who have supported this private voucher idea to reconsider over the holidays, and I thank the President in advance for his veto.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to bring to my colleagues' attention the games being played by the majority regarding needed reforms at the IRS. 
On one hand, the people want IRS reform, and only the Senate stands in the way. The House overwhelmingly passed an IRS reform bill, 426 to 4, and the President is waiting to sign it into law. But the Senate leadership says `no way, we can't begin fixing the IRS we have to get home for the holidays.' So the taxpayer will have to wait for needed reforms making the IRS more user friendly. This means changes aimed at helping the American taxpayer deal with the IRS will be unnecessarily delayed and taxpayers will see little change in the IRS. Instead of a new IRS oversight board bringing new and more taxpayer friendly services, Americans who are dutifully paying their taxes will see the same old IRS--business as usual. Instead of permitting taxpayers to recover up to $100,000 for negligent collection actions, the taxpayers will continue to fight an uphill and seemingly impossible battle when challenging an IRS ruling. 
We all were appalled by some of the IRS practices recently highlighted in Congressional hearings and we all agree there is no place in government for these abuses, yet when given the chance to begin to remedy them, the Senate Leadership refuses to act. 
As a cosponsor and supporter of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights and the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II that provided for increased taxpayer protection, I urge the Senate to take the next much needed step and pass the Internal Revenue Service Improvement Act. 
In my mind it is outrageous that at the same time we have the Senate refusing to act on the IRS Improvement Act, the majority is attempting to spend $100 million of taxpayer's money to conduct a poll to find if U.S. taxpayers like the IRS. I can't imagine what new information this will provide. We all know that most Americans don't like the IRS. We all know it is government's most disliked agency. Spending $100 million to determine whether people like it seems a huge waste of money. This is nothing more than the Republican Majority using hard earned taxpayer dollars for their self-serving political theatrics. Why not make taxpayers give the Majority $100 million dollars worth of stamps and copying machines to run their 1998 election campaign. Does the Leadership really need to spend an extra $100 million to find out that most Americans don't like paying taxes. 
This is the most outrageous and hypocritical use of taxpayer funds that I have seen in my forty years in politics. Yes, there have been other abuses and scams defrauding the American taxpayer, but none more blatantly political and painfully obvious. 
If we want to add $100 million in federal spending why use it for partisan political purposes to prove what we all already know. Instead let us use this $100 million for real government such as constructing 1,325 additional federal prison beds or incarcerating 4000 more federal prisoners. Or maybe we could add 725 new border patrol agents or enroll 20,000 more children in headstart. We could also add 55,300 new summer jobs or train 27,600 low income adults. I am sure most of my colleagues hear a constant cry back home for more spending to improve roads and highways, certainly South Carolina could use $100 million for roads. As I understand, $100 million would resurface 670 miles of highway. At a time of mounting transportation needs, spending federal funds for an IRS poll seems ridiculous. 
Mr President, let me conclude by stating the obvious. Spending $100 million of taxpayer money on an IRS poll does not help a single taxpayer. In short, it is a huge waste of money. If we want to assist taxpayers, if we want real reform, we should pass the IRS Reform bill now. I urge the Majority Leader to free the IRS Reform bill, let the Senate vote and begin providing relief to the American taxpayer.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I really appreciate the distinguished Senator bringing the issue into sharp, sharp focus. It so happens that I had been looking at the Investor's Business Daily. Just reading a sentence: 
The surge in imports prompted economists to revise down their first-quarter growth statistics. 
And, again, just here in Business Week, dated November 3, on page 32: 
Because of the widening in the August trade deficit for goods and services to $10.4 billion, from $10 billion in July, trade is likely to have subtracted a full percentage point from overall demand growth. 
The distinguished Senator has chaired the Joint Economic Committee for years and understands this. That is why we are losing our own growth. We are trying to invest, trying to bring about economic growth, but not looking at the import side, as the distinguished Senator has so clearly brought to the attention of all the colleagues here, that we actually should be growing much faster, and saving, excepting these cancerous deficits in the balance of trade. 
I really appreciate the Senator from Maryland, and I apologize for interrupting, but I hope he will continue.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank our distinguished colleague for continuing along with the very thought that the Senator from Maryland provokes here which is so important to this particular debate, the fact that we should realize the arithmetic of import jobs as well as export jobs. The cumulative sum total, that 1975, 22 years, is right at $1.90 trillion. 
Now, they like to use 20,000 jobs created for every $1 billion in exports. The Department of Commerce changed that to 14,000 some 2 years ago and that has been their figure. Using the same figure--because I want to refer specifically here to the special study the Presidential Commission on the United States Pacific Trade and Investment Policy recently released its final report and it stated `from 1979 to 1994, twice as many high-paying jobs in the United 
States economy were lost to imports as were gained from exports.' 
Now, using the arithmetic of $1 billion equals 20,000 jobs, that would be some 38 million jobs that were lost over that time period, or using the lower figure of 14,000, it would be some 27 million lost jobs. 
Yes, we can talk that the economy is up and going but you get right to the point of understanding why we have 2.8 percent unemployment in Greenville County but 14 percent unemployment in Williamsburg County, and the people back home understand this trade problem better than many on the floor of the national Congress. They continue to see 6,375 jobs leave. Levi Strauss fired one-third of their employees, 11 plants in 5 States making jeans. Where have they gone? They are going offshore. They have been transferring them offshore, and after they let them go, they have to announce, as they do under the plants closing notice--they never announce it during the middle of the debate on the House side, but the lawyers had to comply with the plant closing notice. That is what is happening. We are getting Honda, I am getting BMW in South Carolina, I have Hoffmann-La Roche. I appreciate it and I am working hard, but I am looking at the basic jobs here paying $7 an hour. As I was pointing out with the Oneida plant they are closing in Andrews, and they have some 487 workers, the average age is 47 years old. Washington tells them, `Retrain, retrain, retrain.' Well, tomorrow morning, say we have 487 skilled computer operators. Are you going to hire the 47-year-old skilled computer operator or the 21-year-old? You are not taking on the health costs and the retirement costs for the 47-year-old, so this little rural town is high and dry. 
They understand at home that we are losing out. We are making great gains, but all this downsizing and everything else like that has stagnated wages in our economy. In that sense, we are going out of business. We have been giving away the store. We have Senators running around here, `If we are going to continue to lead'--we are not leading, my dear Senator. We are not leading in this thing. 
I wish they would have adopted Adam Smith and free markets but they have adopted Friedrich List, that the strength of a nation is measured not by what it can consume but by what it can produce. We have to have the economic strength if we are to be a world leader. That is what we are losing. That is what is at stake. That is what is in the conversation here. 
These colleagues that come and say the President can't get at the table--come on. He has been at the table in 200 agreements.

Mr. HOLLINGS. And that is not leading. That is not leadership. You and I as Senators are concerned with the economic strength of the United States, with the work force and otherwise. We want to get back where we are leading. 
The people should understand global competition, `You ignorant Senators, you protectionists.' They better understand when China orders $3 billion they order one-half for themselves and from countries like Japan that make the electronics. That Boeing 777, they make the tail section--they don't give you the order unless you put the manufacturing facility in country. I know, I had a GE turbine plant when I was Governor. Brazil told them they would not order those turbines unless, they put the plants down in Brazil. So the GE plant at Gadsden, SC, has closed down and gone to Brazil. We are speaking from actual experience. 
It is not any fanciful conjuncture here about leading and not being at the table. Yesterday, Senator, right in the Committee of Commerce, we passed the shipbuilding agreement, the OECD shipbuilding agreement that has been negotiated with some 13 countries in Europe and in the Pacific, and we did that without fast track. We had an international telecommunications treaty earlier this year, with 123 countries, without fast track. 
What we are trying to do is get them to have a chance to stop, look, listen, debate the things like we did with the most important arms treaty, SALT I, and the intermediate missile treaty. All of those were without fast track but they act as if our poor President is not allowed to come to the table. He is at the table. We want him at the table. But we just want to have a chance to look and see before we vote.

In Shanghai, General Motors agreed not only to build a plant there in order to produce and sell cars in the People's Republic of China, but more particularly, to design the most modern computer equipment that is going to Shanghai, as we speak, to design the automobiles. They have taken it out of Detroit and are putting it into downtown Shanghai so all our brain power and our wonderful technology is being exported like gangbusters, and they talk about us leading and the President can't get at the table. 
Come on, they have to get with the program here and understand that as Senators and Congressmen we have a responsibility with respect to this economy, 
and the work force that is the highest, most productive in the entire world. You can go over to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, economic section of the United Nations, and No. 1 for the last 20 years has been the United States, not Japan. Japan is down there at No. 6 or 7 now. So our workers have been the most productive. Who hasn't produced, Senator, is you and I up here. That is what I am trying to get over to our fellow Senators so they will understand the problem we are confronting.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I will never forget the second inauguration of Ronald Wilson Reagan. It was in the rotunda, and you and I were there, Senator. President Reagan said, `I solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States and will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.' 
We have the armies who protect us from enemies from without, and the FBI protects us from enemies within. We have Social Security to protect us from the ravages of old age. We have Medicare to protect us from ill health. We have clean air and clean water to protect our environment. We have safe working places and safe machinery. 
Our fundamental duties here are to protect. Be invited, if you please, to the Council of Foreign Relations, run for President of the trilateral commission. They asked, `Are you a protectionist, Senator?' I had to say, `Yes, the truth of it is, I believe that is my fundamental responsibility here.' They say, `If you are a protectionist, you are not enlightened, you can't see the world and understand competition.' When you are losing your shirt, as the Senator from Maryland said--through 22 years of negative trade balances--all they want to talk about is the exports and not the negative side of the equation. 
I cited on yesterday our experience with President Kennedy and the extreme action that he took when 10 percent of domestic consumption of textiles, clothing, was represented in imports, and he thought it was a crisis, and he put in his seven-point practice. Now two-thirds of the clothing within the sight of my debate here this afternoon is imported, 83 percent of the shoes, 53 percent of the ferroalloys, 59 percent of the cooking and kitchenware, 64 percent of the mineral processing machinery, 61.4 percent of the machine tools for metal forming, and 44.1 percent of nonmetal working machine tools--you can go right on down the list. There is the majority of automatic data processing machines, diodes, electrical capacitors and resistors. That is at 70 percent right now. I remember having the capacitor plant of GE, and I have lost it now. It has gone overseas. You have 100 percent of tape recorders, tape players, VCR's, and CD players. You can go right on down. I remember that we could not engage in Desert Storm, the gulf war, unless we got the displays from Japan. That is why I had to put the `buy America first' provision for ball bearings in the defense bill. We are fighting a rear guard action so that we would be able to defend the country, much less be economically strong. 
The NAFTA tent is being pitched on the front lawn of the White House, and the corporate jets are descending on National Airport offloading the Nation's top-paid CEO's to lobby for the administration's effort to renew fast-track trade authority. Of course it is no longer referred to as fast track. Instead the administration has offered a clumsy euphemism--normal trade authority--to obscure the fact that the sole purpose of fast-track is to stifle debate by subverting the Congress' constitutional obligation to regulate foreign commerce. Yet there is nothing normal about a $100 billion plus trade deficit, nothing normal about Congress abandoning its constitutional responsibilities, nothing normal about stagnant wages and an erosion of our manufacturing base. 
The administration argues that they need fast-track authority because no one will negotiate with the United States unless they have fast track. A more likely scenario is that the administration would prefer that Congress not review a legacy of poor trade deals; eroding manufacturing strength and a trade policy that puts the interests of the multinational corporation before working-class Americans. While the administration embraces the Fortune 500's agenda, it has turned a cold shoulder to those who have been left behind by globalization, the working men and women of this country. 
The end of the cold war has created a seismic shift in the global economy. The American worker has now been thrown into bare knuckle competition against the new entrants to the global economy: countries whose productive and motivated work force will accept much less than our workers. As globalization has increased world trade, the American worker has faced an all out assault on their wages, benefits, and overall standard of living. 
Instead of engaging in a debate on the impact of this changed world, our trade policy remains a prisoner to a cold war mentality, treating trade as a stepchild to foreign policy, continuing to serve up unilateral concession after unilateral concession in the hope that our trading partners will be converted by the persuasiveness of our elegant economic models and focusing exclusively on export statistics, failing to consider the impact of imports or even the nature of the exports themselves. 
Rather than facing this new era of fierce economic competition with the hard edge realism that places the national interest in our own hands, we will be relying on multilateral institutions like the WTO to protect our national interest. Now we will be asked to embark upon a course which is bound to produce asymmetrical market openings and in which the people, through their elected representatives, will be shut out. 
The sad truth, however, is that it is impossible to have an honest debate about trade policy, the trade deficit, or the erosion of our manufacturing sector. Instead of focusing on the present and future, pictures of Smoot and Hawley will be dusted off and put on display. The proponents of fast track will unleash a barrage of hyperbolic rhetoric declaring an end to civilization as we know it if we fail to pass fast track.  
NAFTA 
If the proponents of fast track insist on engaging in a debate about the past, then let us examine how the rhetoric and the agreement has stood the test of time. During the NAFTA debate we were told that a failure to pass NAFTA would have a devastating consequences for the United States and Mexico. If NAFTA failed, Mexico's economy would collapse, drugs would flood across the border, immigration would increase, and dangerous leftists, who were denied the presidency thanks to massive electoral fraud, would replace Carlos Salinas, a man virtually canonized both by United States officials and by a synchophatic press blind to the endemic corruption that permeated his regime. 
Three years later what has NAFTA wrought? The Mexican economy collapsed, wages fell by 40 percent, two million Mexicans sank further into poverty, and America's trade surplus with Mexico disappeared, replaced by a $15 billion annual deficit. United States factories accelerated a move to Mexico, not to supply a Mexican consumer market, which even the American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico concedes does not exist, but to ship products into the United States. Of our $54 billion in exports to Mexico in 1996, more than 50 percent were components sent to the mequiladora region alone. Those exports will never see the Mexican consumer market. Rather, the overwhelming majority, over 98 percent according to the Mexico Department of Commerce--[SECOFI] will return to the United States as finished products. Moreover, according to Cornell professor Kate Bromfenbremmer, United States employers continue to use the possibility of movement to Mexico as leverage to limit wage gains. 
Meanwhile, the Asians and Europeans, the ones that were supposed to be the losers as a result of NAFTA, have maintained trade surpluses with Mexico. They poured money into building new factories in Mexico taking advantage of Mexico's cheap labor force and duty-free access to the United States market. 
As for the political situation in Mexico, since NAFTA was passed Mexico has suffered a peasant rebellion, a wave of assassinations and kidnappings, and an explosion in drug trafficking and money laundering. Carlos Salinas, the American Enterprise Institute's Man of the Year, is living in exile while the popular leftist opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is elected mayor of Mexico City and an anti-NAFTA opposition coalition took control of Mexico's Congress. Just Friday, Salinas' brother confessed to widespread corruption in the New York Times.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, right to the point, with respect to how you make your agreements and the charge now that this is not a referendum on NAFTA and Mexico, at the time NAFTA came up with respect to Mexico--I had voted for the free-trade agreement, the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada, because we had similar economies: individual rights, appeal processes, open markets, those kinds of things, and a revered judiciary. 
I will never forget that my colleague from New York, the distinguished senior Senator, Senator Moynihan, said, `How can you have free trade when you don't even have free elections?' Well, we look to the European experience. The Europeans found out that the free-trade approach did not work. They taxed themselves $5 billion to build up the entities of a free market in Greece and Portugal before they admitted Greece and Portugal into the Common Market, and they did just exactly that. 
Instead, we were told, no, Mexico was a prototype, said the Secretary of the Treasury and the Vice President of the United States. We went pell-mell headlong, and everything they contended has gone awry the other way. They said that Mexican wages would be up. They have gone from $1 an hour down to 70 cents an hour. The American Chamber of Commerce in Mexico City says that 60 million Mexicans are living in poverty, and 25 Mexicans make as much as 25 million Mexicans. They said that we would have a plus balance of trade. Instead we went from the plus balance to a negative balance. They said immigration would be better. It is worse now. They said drugs would be better. It has gotten worse. Just look at the morning Washington Post. 
You could go right on down. Everything they said happened the other way. As a result, we never have really built up the entities of a free market like, for example, we have in Chile. I said 4 years ago I would be glad to vote for a free-trade agreement with Chile. They have a revered judiciary, they do have free-market rights. They have labor rights, they have rights of appeal. So there it is. When they say NAFTA referendum, yes, it is. There is no education in the second kick of a mule, Mr. President. 
We understand when they gave us that fast track on it that we were getting in trouble. But they wouldn't listen. Now is the time to stop, look, and listen, and deliberate and consider the agreement itself and not fall for this parliamentary booby trap of the White House just opening up the bazaar and selling off line-item vetoes over on the House side as fast as they can trying to change that CBI vote they got on last evening over in the House of Representatives. So the bazaar is open. They are trying to buy off the votes. They are amending while we are talking about having hopefully the right to amend. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in the trial of a case, when you present a witness such as a doctor or an engineer, you qualify the witness by providing his background and experience. I am in the same position of having to qualify myself--not that I am expert on any particular thing--because only yesterday in a discussion on the floor, one of my esteemed colleagues said, `I know how you are going to vote with respect to fast track because you are against trade.' Mr. President, nothing could be further from the truth. 
Let me say at the very beginning that I was raised and still live in a port city. I worked in that port two summers, paying my way through college with a coastal geodetic survey before World War II, when we were laying submarine nets in the harbor. 
I also was a lawyer later on in life, practicing before the U.S. Customs Court with the Honorable Judge Paul Rayall of New York. As an attorney, I also represented the South Carolina Port Authority. So I am familiar with the field of trade law. 
Later, as Governor of South Carolina, I had the privilege of putting in all the expanded facilities for our State ports, such as grain elevators for our farmers so that they could compete, but more particularly. During my tenure as Governor, I also was one of the first elected representatives to take trips abroad to promote trade and to encourage foreign companies to open plants in the United States. 
I was just thinking the other day, when the President was going for the first time to Latin America, that I took that trip to Buenos Aires, Argentina, back in 1960. I have been there a half dozen times since then. And I have been not just to Sao Paulo but to the port of Santos in Brazil and to Caracas, where we buy now a majority of our oil. 
I learned early on in looking for trade opportunities that my hometown of Charleston is 350 miles closer to Caracas, Venezuela, and the Latin American markets than New Orleans. Look at it sometimes--the offset of the South American continent--and you will see that my hometown of Charleston is about on the same latitude as the Panama Canal. 
So I went after trade and have been working on trade for at least 40 years, as an attorney and as Governor. Today, my office in Charleston is in the Customs House. 
I have participated in the various trade debates in my 30 years in the U.S. Senate. I have heard the same things come up time and time again without any understanding of the fact that we do not have a trade policy. We have a foreign policy. 
A friend who says you are against trade and he is for foreign aid is not for trade. We were fat, rich, and happy after World War II, and, yes, we taxed ourselves to the tune of what would be equal to some $80 billion in today's amounts. We couldn't even get taxes to pay our own bills, much less the vanquished enemy in Europe and in the Pacific, but we taxed ourselves and we sent over not just the best expertise to tell them how to develop industrially, but more particularly, Mr. President, the best machinery. 
I have always heard people talk about textile fellows. According to critics, we want subsidies and protectionism. Now, we have asked for enforcement of and protection under U.S. international trade agreements, but we never have asked for subsidies like the airline manufacturers receive, for example. 
And of course, much of our technology comes from Defense. Then we make sure that it is financed under the Export-Import Bank. And incidentally, the $3 billion contract with China, you might as well count on only a percentage of that--China is in part trading with itself, because it has Boeing China where they make the tail assemblies, and they make the electronic parts in Japan, and everything else of that kind, so we can look at really where the contract is being sourced. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, we are exporting our most precious technology. General Motors, for example, has agreed not only to produce cars in the People's Republic of China, but also China has required, Mr. President, that they design the automobiles. So the new cars that we in America will be buying here at the turn of the century will be designed in downtown Shanghai with the finest computerization and machinery being installed there now by American companies. 
So we watch this particular trend. And we understand that the administration and those championing fast track are totally off-base with respect to the welfare of the United States of America, with respect to the security of the United States of America. 
Mr. President, the Nation's security rests on a three-legged stool. The three legs comprise our defense, values, and economy. And we have the one leg that is military power, which is unquestioned. Our troops and our military technologies are without equal in the world today. This leg is sound. 
The second leg is that of our Nation's values. This leg, too, is sound, our values unquestioned. We commit ourselves to freedom, democracy, and individual rights the world around--from Haiti and Bosnia. We work hard in all the councils of the world to promote the health and welfare of the free world. Our commitment to democracy and human rights is unwavering and our democratic values still are strong, as was noted here just last week on the visitation of Jiang Zemin. 
But, Mr. President, the third leg of our Nation's security--and this must be emphasized--is the economic leg. Unfortunately, the economic leg has been fractured over the last 50 years, somewhat in an intentional manner. 
I mentioned the Marshall plan. I mentioned the expertise we supplied to our vanquished foes. I mentioned the attempt to build up freedom and capitalism around the world, continuing today with the fall of the wall in Europe and the capitalistic trends even in People's Republic of China. And we have succeeded in this policy, so we do not regret it. But too often over the last 50 years we have given in to our competitors. 
When 10 percent of U.S. textile consumption was provided by imports, President John F. Kennedy declared an emergency, and under the law he appointed a cabinet commission. And he had the Secretaries of Treasury, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor and State meet. In May, 1961, complying with national security provisions, they determined that before President Kennedy could move, he was required to find that the particular commodity was important to our national security. 
At the Department of Defense, this particular commission found that next to steel, textiles were the commodity most important to our national security. After all, our Government could not send our soldiers to war in a Japanese-made uniform. So President Kennedy took action and formulated a 7-point program with respect to textiles. But this program has never been enforced. 
I continue to say that if we were to go back to our dumping laws and enforce them, we wouldn't have to have a debate of this kind on the floor of the U.S. Senate. But they are not enforced, Mr. President, and now two-thirds of the clothing worn here on the floor of the U.S. Senate is imported. And 86 percent of the shoes are imported. 
While I am on this subject, Mr. President, we have gradually gone out of the role of a productive United States of America to a become a consuming people.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my time is limited. It is unfortunate we have forced cloture. We have had no debate. This is an arrogant procedure: on a Friday afternoon, late on Friday when everyone was gone, they put in the so-called bill with the cloture motion, and now the world's most deliberative body is not going to have a chance in the world to deliberate. We had no debate on Monday, and now after forcing a vote on Tuesday they say, `All right. You've got an hour.' Oh, isn't that fine. Isn't that polite? Isn't that courteous? Isn't it Senatorial? Not at all. Not at all. 
What we really need is an extended debate on the most important item that faces this country--our economic security. 
Today we practically are out of business in manufacturing. People talk about the manufacturing jobs that have been created, but 10 years ago we had 26 percent of our work force in manufacturing. We are down to 13 percent of jobs now in manufacturing. 
I go right to one of our adversaries, who is one of the finest industrialists in the history of man, Akio Morita of Sony Corp. And on a seminar in the early 1980's, in Chicago, we were talking about the developing Third World countries. And he said, `Oh, no. They cannot become a nation state until they develop a strong manufacturing capacity.' And later on in that seminar he pointed to me and said, `By the way, Senator, that world power that loses its capacity of manufacturing will cease to be a world power.' 
We are going to have Veterans Day here very shortly. And I think back to my the 3-year jaunt overseas in World War II and the invasion of North Africa, and Corsica, and Southern France. And I remember well how valiant our fighting men were. And I take pride in average citizens from the main streets and farms of America volunteering to fight and die for our Nation. 
In those days, when we looked up at the skies we saw our wonderful Air Force. And we saw them bombing the adversary into smithereens, to the point where they had no productive industrial manufacturing capacity. We, in contrast, were turning out five B-29's a day at the Marietta plant just outside of Atlanta. They were not turning out any planes at all. Their plants had been destroyed. And so we had a superiority of equipment and everything else as we moved forward through Alsace and across the Rhine. 
And as much as congratulating all the veterans on Veterans Day, I will be making talks like other politicians. I want to emulate Rosy the Riveter who, back home, kept things going. It was the wonderful productive capacity of the United States of America that kept this world free. Let us never forget it. So when we talk of trade, we are talking of something of historic proportions here. 
I will go to the history here in the unlimited time because in a few hours--in an hour and a half, to be exact--the Commerce Committee, with the Capitol Historical Society, will celebrate the 181st anniversary of the Committee of Commerce, Space, Science, and Transportation. 
That brings us back to our earliest days and the mistaken idea that there is somewhere, somehow, other than here in the United States, free trade, free trade, free trade, free trade. There is absolutely no free trade in the world. Trade is reciprocal and competitive. The word `trade' itself means something for something. If it is something for nothing, it is a gift. 
I know some people talk about different subsidies and different nontariff trade barriers, and that is what they mean. But what has come about, as we have been setting the example by just that, with free trade with Chile, our average tariff was 2 percent. The average tariff in Chile is 11 percent. So the people in Chile now almost have free trade. We have almost nothing left to swap in order to bring them to terms to open their markets. 
As long as we cry and moan and grown, `free trade, free trade,' like the arrogant nonsense that somehow our way is the only way, we are going to wake up in America like the United Kingdom. They told Great Britain at the end of World War II, `Don't worry, instead of a nation of brawn, you're going to be a nation of brains. And instead of producing products, you're going to provide services. And instead of creating wealth, you're going to handle it and be a financial center.' And England has gone to hell in an economic handbasket; downtown London is an amusement park. Poor Great Britain: it is not great any longer. And that is the road that we are on here in the United States. 
I want to get off that road and sober these folks up and let them stop, look, and listen to what they are talking about. I would like, Mr. President, to emphasize what the global competition is. Some act as if it's something new, and we have just come into it. No. We started 220-some years ago, in the earliest days of our republic. 
Thinking today about this particular celebration we are going to have this evening, I realized that in 1816, when the Commerce Committee was first started, it was started as the Committee of Commerce and Manufacturing. Commerce and Manufacturing was the name of it. 
That was foremost in the minds of the Founding Fathers when they thought about our relations with Great Britain, the mother country, once we had won our freedom and were a fledgling colony. The British wanted to trade with us under the doctrine of competitive advantage. They said at that particular time that what you ought to do back in the colony is trade with what you can produce best and we will trade back with the little fledgling colony from the United Kingdom what we produce best--free trade, free trade, Adam Smith, Adam Smith, free trade, consumption. 
Well, Alexander Hamilton wrote `Report on Manufactures,' and there is one copy left that I know of over at the Library of Congress under lock and key. I won't read it--I would if we had extended time where we can debate this and begin to understand the Founding Members. In a line in that booklet, Alexander Hamilton told Great Britain essentially, bug off, we are not going to remain your colony. The second act ever enacted by Congress--which had a mindset of competition and building, rather than buying votes with consumption and tax cuts and free trade and all that kind of nonsense--passed a tariff of 50 percent on some 60 articles, which included textiles, iron, and just about everything else. 
What we said was `no, thank you.' We are going to follow Friedrich List, who said that the strength of a nation is measured not by what it can consume but rather by what it can produce. And the Founders said that they we going to produce our own industrial backbone, beginning with tariffs and instituting a Committee of Commerce and Manufactures. 
This mindset continued through President Lincoln. His advisors told the President during the construction of the transcontinental railroad, `Mr. President, we ought to get that steel cheap from England.' And he said `No, we are going to build the steel mill, and when we get through we not only will we have the transcontinental railroad but we will have a steel capacity to make the weapons of war and the tools of agriculture.' 
And in the darkest days of the Depression we passed price supports for America's agriculture which this Senate supports. It is not like we are against the farmer. I have had the pleasure of being elected six times, and each time the farm vote has either put me over the top or saved me. I have been elected six times. I have the greatest respect and we had not only the price supports but protective quotas, import quotas. 
Eisenhower, in 1955, put in oil import quotas so we could build up our own capacity of oil production. So we have been practicing that until we have been overcome, so to speak, with the multinational singsong. 
You see the policy of building up capitalism the world around has worked. I was with the manufacturers in the early 1950's. They hated to fly all the way to the Far East and come back. But after a while they found out they could produce cheaper by producing overseas. 
We had this testimony and we had the hearing before the Finance Committee which is a procedure of parliamentary fix. We had hearings that proved that 30 percent of the cost of manufacturing is in labor and you can save as much as 20 percent of your labor costs by moving offshore to a low-wage country. In other words, if you have a volume or sales of $500 million, you can keep your headquarters and sales force here but move your production overseas and save tens of millions of pretax dollars; or you can continue to stay home and work your own work force and go bankrupt. 
That is the jobs policy of this Congress. That is the jobs policy of this fast track. That is the jobs policy of President Clinton and his administration. That is why I am so strongly opposed to this kind of nonsense. 
They come around here with talking about consulting and retraining and everything else of that kind but the truth of the matter is, I will take them down to Andrews or some other towns in my State of South Carolina. We have lost, since NAFTA, some 23,500 jobs when counted last May and over 25,000 jobs easily since then. 
Go to where they make simple T-shirts, in Andrews, SC, where they had 487 workers. The age average is 47 years. And let's do it Washington's way, let's retrain the 487 workers so tomorrow morning they are all computer operators. Are you going to hire the 47-year-old computer operator or the 21-year-old computer operator? You are not going to take on the health care costs, the retirement costs of the 47-year-old. Andrews is drying up. They are gone with all this retraining. We don't need retraining. I have the best training facilities. That is how I get Hoffmann-La Roche, BMW and all the sophisticated plants, Honda and otherwise, that are coming into my State. 
So we say with knowledge that we are not against trade; we have experience in this field. In South Carolina, we have the best industries on the one hand, 2.8 percent unemployment in Greenville County. But go down to Williamsburg County and you have 14 percent unemployment. 
On October 28, one week ago, the Washington Post published an editorial by James Glassman. Obviously, Mr. Glassman does not understanding exactly what is at issue here.

Mr. HOLLINGS. The article reads in part: 
Clinton aides blame the problem on organized labor which has led the fight against fast track just as it did against NAFTA. `This is the most blatant example of the corrupting effect of campaign finances on Washington policy-making I know,' one high administration official said. 
Boy, oh boy, is it. Is it one of the most scandalous, corrupting effects of campaign finances. Why? Mr. President, 250 of these multinational corporations are responsible for 80 percent of the exports. That is the moneyed crowd that came with the white tent on the lawn for NAFTA. That is the moneyed crowd and the Business Advisory Council that sent around a month ago, `We are allocating $50,000 for this debate.' Each of your corporate entities, send the money in so we can buy the TV to bamboozle those silly Senators in Congress. 
It is one of the most corrupting--not labor. God bless labor. At least they are fighting for what Henry Ford said: `I want to make sure that the man that produces the car can buy the car.' And he brought in good, responsible wages. That is what labor is trying to get--a responsible wage and working conditions and no child labor and no environmental degradations. 
Since I'm talking, I want everyone to know I'm just not reading things. I have been there and I have seen, as Martin Luther King, Jr. said, the other side. So at Tijuana, Mr. President, you go there and you think you are in Korea. Go across from San Diego into Tijuana--beautiful industries, mostly Korean, and what happens? Then you go out to the living conditions, some 150,000 to 200,000 people in that dust bowl. The mayor comes up and he says, `Senator, I want you to meet with 12 people if you don't mind.' I said I would be glad to. `I would like you to listen to what they are talking about.' 
It so happens that in that area, the mills have the flag, whether American or Korean, they have a beautiful lawn, a nice, clean factory on the outside and the living conditions are squalid--literally, five garage doors put together as a hovel to live in, no running water, the electric power is one little electric line where I was visiting and the fellow had a car battery to turn on his TV because if he turned on the light and TV everything blew up. 
There wasn't any sewage, there weren't any roads or streets. When they had a heavy rain and when the rains came at the turn of the year, it washed down all that mud, dust and what have you, and their homes were literally being washed away. Trying to save them, they missed a day's work, these 12 workers. Later in February, one of the workers in a plastic coat hanger factory--a factory that had moved down from Los Angeles, CA, to Mexico, a low-wage thing, maquiladora is the word for it--had lost his eyesight from the dust flicked up in his eyes by the coat hangers. That caused real concern because they had been docked having missed 1 day's work. They were docked under the work rules. They lost 4 days' pay. And now they were losing one of their companion workers and his eyesight, and around the first of May the most popular supervisor was expecting childbirth and she went to the front office and said, `I'm feeling badly and I have to go home this afternoon,' and the plant managers said, `Oh, no, you are not, you are working out there,' and she stayed that afternoon and miscarried. 
So these 12 that the mayor had me meet said they were going to get a union and they went up to Los Angeles. You know what they found, Mr. President? These are labor rights they have down in Mexico. They found they already had a union. When the plants had moved down there 3 years before they had signed a legal document back there in Los Angeles between lawyers for the so-called union that they never saw, never saw. The union master or anything else of that kind never visited the plant, and under Mexican law, since they had a union, these workers were fired because you are not allowed to try to organize a union when you have one. That is labor rights in Mexico. So they lost their jobs. And the mayor was pointing them out to me. 
Labor is there working so that the United States can go out and spread its values. I talked about our values as a Nation, the strength of them, and it isn't to get a cheap T-shirt or cheap production. It is to extend those rights. We had the highest standard of living here in the United States, and we are trying to extend that standard of living so that others can buy and purchase. If we had the time, Mr. President, I would go into overcapacity. I remember when Bill Greider published his book a couple of years ago, `One World, Ready or Not.' He talked about overcapacity; at the time, commentators ridiculed Greider, but now they find that we in the United States have the capacity to produce 500,000 more cars than we can sell; in the European sector, they have the capacity to produce 4 to 5 million more cars than they can sell, and with the yen down, you can watch automobiles coming in here like gangbusters. 
Now, what are we saying? They don't know what they are talking about. We are trying to produce consumers to go and buy those cars. And what did we get out of NAFTA? Instead of $1 an hour workers' wages have gone down. Read the American Chamber of Commerce report in Mexico earlier this year. Instead of $1 an hour they now make 70 cents an hour. They can't buy the car. There are no consumers there; that is why there is the overcapacity. They act like we have equals; they say in a naive fashion that 96 percent of the consumers are outside the United States, when all that they are doing is looking at population figures. 
They don't know what they are talking about. They are not consuming. They are not able. I wish I had the Boston Globe article about the shoe manufacturer. I don't want to mention the name because I want to be accurate. But the tennis shoes were being made by three young women who slept on the floor, without a window, in a shack down in Malaysia, and their monthly salary was less than the cost of one pair of the shoes they were making. Now, come on. These are facts we must bring out in this debate. Wait a minute here, we know how to compete, how to open up markets. Via Friedrich List, we have been trying for 50 years to get into Japan and we have had little success. 
If you want to sell textile products, you have to go to the textile industry of Korea and get permission or you don't get it. In Europe, the VCR's shipped there--there are nontariff trade barriers. They put VCR's up in Dijon, France. It took a year to get up there and clear all the redtape, get them released from the warehouse. Automobiles stayed on the dock in Europe--Toyota--and are still there. If you want to buy a 1998 model, you are going to have to wait until October 1, 1998, not October 1, 1997, because the '98 models that just came out, they have a year to inspect. 
The competition, Mr. President, out there in this global economy is the Friedrich List model, not the Adam Smith model. We just need to get that through the hard heads of the State Department and the White House and the leadership in this Congress. Labor is being derided because they are trying to bring the benefits to all so they can become consumers, so, yes, as a result all will be able to purchase these products. But we are roaring blindly into an overcapacity problem the world around and the global economy, and we are headed for deflation. Remember that we said it first here in the beginning of November in 1997. 
Mr. President, I have the article I was mentioning earlier. It was Reebok. My staff has just given that to me. 
We have learned the hard way. We know our responsibility. That is what really boils me. Here comes this crowd from the White House: `Give the President the authority, give him the authority.' He has had the authority to negotiate since 1934 under the Reciprocal Trade Act. We delegated that negotiating authority on behalf of the Congress. I am reminded of my friend Congressman Mendel Rivers, who used to be chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He had a seal in front of his desk that said `Congress of the United States.' When Secretary McNamara would come up, Chairman Rivers would lean over and say to Robert McNamara, `Not the President, not the Supreme Court, but the Congress of the United States shall raise and support armies,' article I, section 8. Also in article I, section 8 it says `the Congress of the United States shall regulate foreign commerce,' not the President, not the Supreme Court, but the Congress of the United States. That is not only our authority, it is our responsibility. But they say: Fast track, fast track, fast track. Forget your responsibility constitutionally. Take it or leave it. 
How do they get NAFTA passed? The White House amends the treaty. Mr. President, in that particular debate, we remembered there were some 16 amendments. One Congressman down in Texas got 2 additional C-17's and he gave in his vote. Another distinguished Congressman, my good friend Jake Pickle, got a trade center. Another group down in Florida got a citrus amendment to take care of their concerns, and the Louisiana vote was taken care of with sugar, and for the Midwest, up by the border, it was a Durum wheat amendment. I could go down the list of the 16 amendments. What I am saying to this body is that we, the Congress, can't amend the treaties, but the White House can. It is the most arrogant, unconstitutional assault and usurpation. Said George Washington in his farewell address, if in the opinion of the people the distribution of powers under the Constitution be in any particular wrong, `then let it be amendable in the way that the Congress designates, for in the usurpation may in the one instance be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free 
governments are destroyed.' And so we are in the hands of the Philistines, the multinationals. 
As I started out saying, the program of spreading capitalism has worked. That is what defeated the Soviet Union and brought about the fall of the wall. We all glory in it. But in the meantime, those who had gone abroad spreading that subsidized initiative learned that they could produce cheaper overseas, that they could save one-third of their sales of volume cost. So they began moving overseas their offshore production. And then the banks financing this movement--Chase Manhattan and Citicorp, as of the year 1973--I remember that debate--made a majority of their profits outside of the United States. IBM is no longer an American company. They have a majority of workers outside of the United States. We could go down the list. But they had the banks and then the nationals were becoming multinationals. Then they had all the consultants and the think tanks that they financed to grind out all these papers. They come around babbling, `free trade, free trade.' So you have the multinationals, the banks, the consultants, the think tanks, the college campuses--oh, yes, and the retailers. 
Every time we debated the textile bill--five times we passed it--I would go down to Herman's and find a catcher's mitt, one made in Michigan and one made in Korea, both for $43, the same price. We went down to Bloomingdale's and got a ladies' blouse made in Taiwan and one made in New Jersey, both for $27. 
My point was that they get their imports, bring it in for the large profit, and only give a little bit of the overrun of the particular sales to Grand Rapids in New Jersey. They are not lowering their price as a result of competition. The retailers put out all of this nonsense about Smoot-Hawley. Paul Krugman said the best of the best--we had some quotes from him. We had that debate.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the crash occurred October 29, and Smoot-Hawley passed June 19, 8 months later. It didn't cause any crash. It didn't have any affect on the economy. Neither President Hoover nor President Roosevelt had any particular concern with it, because it was less than 2 percent, a little over 1 percent of GNP. Trade now is 18 percent of the GDP. But it was less than 2 percent at that particular time, and two-thirds of the trade was duty free. The two-thirds duty free was affected the same as the Smoot-Hawley tariff type trade. While in the year 1933, under reciprocal free trade, reciprocity, we came back with a plus balance of trade. So we have to listen to these things about we are going to start a domino effect with Smoot-Hawley again coming in. 
I can tell you that right now, I would be glad to debate Smoot-Hawley at any particular time. 
Well I just read the book called `Agents of Influence.' This takes place 7 or 8 years ago. The gentlemen was a Vice President of TRW and he lost his job because he wrote the truth. He said one country, Japan, had over 100 law firms, consultant firms in Washington representing itself, at the cost of $113 million. The consummate salary of the 100 Senators and 435 House Members is only $73 million. The people of Japan, by way of pay, are better represented in Washington than the people of America. 
When are we going to wake up? I have been sitting on the Commerce Committee for 30 years and I see the front office fill up on every kind of trade matter that comes about. Why? Because the multinationals. Now, by gosh, not just 41 percent, but the majority, let's say over 50 percent of what they are producing has been manufactured offshore and brought back in. So if they are going to lead the cheer `free trade, free trade, Japan, Korea, People's Republic of China, right on, brother, you lead the way, we will follow you.' 
Do you blame the People's Republic of China for not agreeing to anything? I have to note one agreement. Oh, boy, it turned everybody upside down in this town 2 weeks ago. We had an agreement with Japan relative to our maritime services, and our ships would go into the ports of Tokyo and the other ports in Japan. And they had finally came around agreeing to the same privileges that we grant them, the stevedores. They actually handle the goods and so forth. The Japanese ship that comes into Charleston can have its own stevedore, but the American ships going in to Japan could not, up until this time. And we have been trying for years--and they have all kinds of controls over us in shipping that are absolutely burdensome. They agreed--Japan and the United States--in April. At that particular time in April, when they agreed, we sat down and said, fine, let's go with it. They passed four deadlines, in June, July, August and September. Every time we added a drop-dead date, when are you going to do it? Oh, we are going to do it. So we stopped the ships coming in. You know what happened? My phone rang off. The 100 lawyers, the ports authority lawyers, the lobbyists--Christmas wasn't going to happen, children weren't going to get any toys, the world was going to end, but we had one distinguished gentlemen with his maritime commission, Hal Creel, the chairman, who I want to praise this afternoon. He held his guns. The State Department later came in, and I will credit Stuart Eizenstat with sticking up for the United States. But it was many times that they came before we got them finally to agree. 
So, we stuck to the guns, and who was on our side? The shipping industry of Japan, because organized crime had taken over, in many instances, in these ports. And they, the shipping industry in Japan, had been trying to do something, too. It wasn't until we stopped veritably the Japanese ship from coming into the American harbor that they finally sat down and got to the table. The White House was calling: Give in, give in. Oh, this is going to be a hard incident. This is going to be terrible. Chicken Little, the sky is falling, we are going to start a trade war and everything else of that kind. 
Mr. Creel stuck to his guns. That is what I am talking about on trade. That is the global competition. 
The other day former Majority Leader Dole wrote an op-ed regarding fast track. Don't give me Bob Dole writing the thing is a fact. The distinguished gentleman should put under there that he represents the Chilean salmon industry. Don't give me our good friend, Jay Berman. Everyone knows he lost out for the recording industry on the last two agreements. He said, I'm not going to lose out, I am going to be the President's handler, I am going to handle the Congress for the White House. 
We are in the hands of the Philistines. The country is going down the tubes and all they are doing is the rich folks are hollering, give the President authority. He has the authority, but give me my constitutional duty of doing just exactly what we did. 
Come on, we have had, as the Senator from North Dakota said, in 221 years hundreds of trade agreements. We had one this morning in committee. It was an OECD shipbuilding trade agreement that we approved between 16 nations at the Commerce Committee just today, without fast track. We negotiated the telecommunications agreement, an international agreement with 123 countries, without fast track. 
I better stop. I don't know that I have any time left. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished body for yielding me this time. I hope I have some time left here, because we have plenty more to debate to wake up this country and start competing. 
There is nothing wrong with the industrial worker of the United States. He is the most competitive, the most productive in the world. Look at any of the figures. What is not producing and not competitive is the Government here in Washington. It has to stop. 
I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1231 as reported by the Commerce Committee. This bill would reauthorize the programs of the U.S. Fire Administration [USFA]. 
As I stated when we introduced this bill, it is a tragic statistic that the United States currently has one of the worst fire records of any country in the industrial world with more than 2 million fires reported in the United States every year. Even more tragic is the fact that these fires result in over 4,500 deaths, 30,000 civilian injuries, and billions property losses. 
The USFA has done a tremendous job since its creation in 1974, pursuant to the recommendation of the National Commission on Fire and Control, in reducing deaths and damage caused by fires. This bill before the Senate today will allow the USFA to continue assisting our Nation's 1.2 million member fire service in doing their job, efficiently and safely, with the best technology available. 
Mr. President, the fire service is one of the most hazardous professions in the country. Firefighters not only confront daily the dangers of fire; they also are required to respond to other natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, medical emergencies, and hazardous materials spills. 
Finally, we are all well aware of the recent rise in arson activities in this country. Arsonists are responsible for over 500,000 fires every year. Arson is the No. 1 cause of all fires, and is the second leading cause of fire deaths in residences. 
The USFA has initiated several measures to combat this weapon of hatred, including: community grants in high risk areas to hire part-time law enforcement officers, and to pay for law enforcement overtime and other church arson prevention activities; National Fire Academy training courses; additional training and education for arson investigators with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; arson prevention information for the general public; and juvenile arson prevention workshops. This bill allows these efforts to continue. 
Mr. President, we owe our support to this Nation's 1.2 million firefighters who risk their lives every day to save the lives and property of others. By passing this bill, the USFA can continue providing the education, data analysis, training, and technology needed to enable these brave individuals to do their job as efficiently and safely as possible. This bill ensures that both firefighters and the USFA get the financial resources they need to serve the public. I encourage my colleagues to support passage of S. 1231.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a man who exemplifies the American dream. Dr. Robert McNamara, an assistant professor of sociology at Furman University, rose from a childhood of Dickensian poverty and violence to become a successful writer, prodigious researcher, and beloved teacher. In addition to devoting much time to instructing and advising his students, he has published nine books; his most recent, `Beating the Odds: Crime, Poverty, and Life in the Inner City,' has just been released. 
In `Beating the Odds,' Dr. McNamara addresses some of our society's fundamental problems while relating them to the trials of his own impoverished childhood. Though it is unusual for an academic to intertwine memoir with analysis, Dr. McNamara's style makes his book all the more compelling. 
Bob McNamara was born in New Haven, CT, in 1960, the youngest of four boys. He and his family--`dirty, unkempt, and unruly'--lived a tenuous existence in a squalid section of the city. His abusive and alcoholic father was a compulsive gambler. McNamara's parents divorced when he was 10 years old. Neither wanted to raise him; after a time, they began paying other people to care for him. 
As an adolescent, Bob McNamara was sent to live with 19 different families. His abuse and exploitation at the hands of these so-called foster parents convinced him that `being a foster child is one of the most frightening things that could ever happen to a young person.' It was not until one of his high school football coaches realized his potential and decided to become his foster parent that McNamara gained a stable and nurturing home. 
With the help of supportive teachers and his new foster family, Bob McNamara turned his life around. He worked two jobs to pay for classes at the local community college. After succeeding there, he enrolled in the State university and commuted 60 miles each way to attend classes. He made outstanding grades and won a scholarship to Yale University, where he obtained his doctorate. While at Yale, he met another graduate student, Kristie Maher, whom he would later marry and who also teaches sociology at Furman University. 
Dr. Robert McNamara is a living example of the promise of American life. He was born into an abysmally poor and dysfunctional family, with no role models or guidance. He spent much of his childhood stealing for food and running with gangs. But he found purpose in the pursuit of knowledge and nurturing from his teachers, and went on to excell at one of America's elite universities. Today, he is an admired teacher and respected scholar. 
Mr. President, `Beating the Odds' is not just the title of Prof. Robert McNamara's latest and most inspiring book; it is the story of his life. In fact, beating the odds is what the American dream is all about.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chair. 
Mr. President, I am privileged to support the confirmation of Bill Kennard's nomination to be Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. You will find no one more qualified than William Kennard. 
Mr. President, today, the Senate will consider the nomination of William Kennard for Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission [FCC]. 
Mr. Kennard has spent his career in the communications field--as a first amendment attorney with the National Association of Broadcasters; as a communications lawyer in private practice; and the last 3 years as general counsel of the FCC. Mr. Kennard brings a tremendous amount of experience to the job at a critical time in the communications industry. A great deal of work remains to be done to fully implement the 1996 act. He is eminently qualified for the task at hand. 
The overarching goals of the 1996 act are to preserve Universal Service, and to provide a transition from monopoly to open competition. Mr. Kennard understands that neither of these objectives will happen on their own accord. It will be the responsibility of Mr. Kennard, the three new commissioners confirmed last night, along with Commissioner Ness, to fulfill these objectives by balancing the competing interests of industry with the public interest. 
For the past 20 months, the FCC has been doing its best to implement the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The rules adopted by the FCC have generated a great deal of controversy and subsequent litigation. Most of those issues are either pending in the courts or before the FCC on reconsideration. So it goes without saying that Mr. Kennard will have a very important, and sometimes difficult, job ahead of him. 
First, and foremost, the new Commission must understand that the Universal Service System we have today is a mechanism designed to maintain low-cost affordable phone service in rural and high-cost areas. These areas of the country would not have had telephone service, much less any economic development, were it not for the Federal support and Government mandate of Universal Service. The Commission should be vigilant to maintain Universal Service and its attendant benefits. 
The second issue is the promotion of competition across the various industries. Much of the deregulation of the act was premised on the commitments made by industry to compete with each other. Now some segments of the industry are having second thoughts about competition. The grand plans pledged to the Congress over 2 years ago no longer seem so grand. Competition does not come with a money-back guarantee. The Congress did not guarantee any incumbent continued marketshare. Nor did the Congress guarantee that competitors would gain marketshare. What the Congress attempted to guarantee was the right to compete under certain conditons. It will be the FCC's job to enforce those conditions to bring the benefits of competition to consumers. More importantly, though, its job will be to protect consumers where competition and the marketplace fail. 
As the FCC decides each of these issues, the most important aspect of its responsibility is to safeguard the public interest. The FCC's job is to protect consumers by promoting competition and removing barriers to entry or, in the alternative, enforcing regulation where competition does not exist. 
Mr. President, you will find the frustration of those addressing this particular subject comes about from a failure of implementation by the private industry itself. We worked for 4 years on the Telecommunications Act that passed last year. It is noted that we had 95 votes. A strong bipartisan support was worked out to the satisfaction of all the entities. Now we find some of those entities coming in and petitioning and enjoining and appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. There are some 73 local carriers that now have enjoined their local commissions. 
You will find one particular RBOC that has petitioned the Court on the constitutionality of what we enacted after they sent a wonderful letter in support of what we enacted. 
What you are seeing on behalf of the industry overall is a freezing of the board by the majority. And there has been very little movement of cable into telephone, telephone into cable and RBOC into long distance. They have not met the so-called checklist, and have held up on it. That is what is really in force. 
So some of these mergers could well break it loose in the telecommunications wall--again, the wall of competition. 
Mr. Kennard, I am convinced, understands what is going on. He would have to at the Commission level as the general counsel. I hope under the law and the requirements of public interest and in balancing all of the interests of the various carriers with that public interest in mind that we can move forward. 
So I appreciate the situation and would be delighted to yield to others. 
Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my good friend and former colleague Wyche Fowler on his confirmation as United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. This is a great and well-deserved honor for the former Senator from Georgia. Even more important, it is a blessing for America. 
Because his was a recess appointment, Wyche Fowler already has served with great distinction and success for over 1 year in Saudi Arabia. President Clinton appointed him to this post just days before the June 25, 1996, terrorist bombing of the United States military residence in Dahran. Although he took the ambassadorship at one of the most tenuous moments in United States-Saudi diplomatic relations, Wyche embraced the challenge and helped cement the United States relationship with Saudi Arabia, one of our most important allies. 
Wyche was sworn in as Ambassador on August 16, 1996. His appointment came at an important moment in the relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Despite the difficulties that have surrounded the bombing investigation, he has served his country well and protected American interests in the region with tenacity and skill. 
Of course, Mr. President, this is no surprise to those of us who have followed Wyche Fowler's career of public service or worked closely with him during his 16 years in Congress. Elected to the Senate in 1986, Wyche served on the Appropriations, Budget, Energy, and Agriculture Committees. As assistant floor leader, he helped fashion a bipartisan consensus on major public policy issues. Many of us remember Wyche Fowler as an unusually reflective Member of this body, who talked often of conserving our natural resources and energy sources. I can remember listening with humor and fascination as he used electric toothbrushes to point out the danger of decadent applications of technology. 
Before becoming the first Atlantan elected to the Senate, Wyche Fowler represented Atlanta's First District in the House of Representatives. First elected in 1977, he served on the Ways and Means and Foreign Relations Committees, as well as the Select Committee on Intelligence and the Congressional Arts Caucus. 
Wyche's legislative record is long and distinguished: he tried to stop oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and protect national wetlands; recodified and strengthened the national historic preservation law; established joint public/private ventures in alternative energy; and ensured interest-free relief for farmers in the Farm Credit System overhaul. 
The consensus-building skills Wyche learned in Congress have stood him in good stead in Riyadh. Just as valuable, Mr. President, is his affable personality. All his colleagues in the House and Senate remember Wyche Fowler as a genial and charismatic fellow, not to mention a great singer of hymns and a superb storyteller. In fact, Wyche used to entertain us with the same country songs he performed as a teenager on an Atlanta talent show. Though the Saudis may not appreciate country ballads, I am sure that they will find Wyche Fowler every bit as hard-working, engaging, and honest as the people of Georgia and his colleagues have. 
And, Mr. President, Wyche is genuinely fascinated by Saudi Arabia's people and culture. He has begun to learn Arabic, and already has indulged his enthusiasm for Arabian history and archaeology by trekking on camel through the deserts of Saudi Arabia's Empty Quarter. 
America is fortunate to have Wyche Fowler as its Ambassador to Saudi Arabia. His diplomatic skills will see us successfully through a delicate and vital period in our relations with that nation. In this instance, Mr. President, Georgia's loss was the Nation's gain.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission [FMC], Mr. Harold Creel, and the other Federal Maritime Commissioners, Mrs. Ming Hsu, Mr. Joe Scroggins, and Mr. Delmond Won for their resolve in pursuing trade liberalization of Japan's restrictive port practices. 
The problem of unfair, restrictive port practices in Japan is a long standing one. The United States carriers and United States Government have asked the Japanese to reform their system for over a decade. The Japanese had refused even to acknowledge that this was a problem, much less to resolve it. 
Two years ago, the carriers, weary of the futility of diplomatic and commercial pressure, asked the FMC to address this. This was not a matter of the FMC grandstanding or attempting to justify its existence. In fact, I would note that the same Japanese restrictive port practices were challenged at the World Trade Organization [WTO] by European carriers. To date, the WTO has not acted on the European carrier petition. However, the FMC acted vigorously at the request of United States industry interests to address a long-standing, Japanese-created situation that could not be resolved through more amicable means. In September 1995, the FMC issued orders to gather information on the subject. 
In November 1996, the FMC issued a proposed rule, with monetary sanctions to go into effect April 1997. 
In April 1997, an agreement between the United States and Japanese Governments resulted in Japanese commitments to achieve certain steps toward reform by July 1997. Accordingly, the FMC postponed the effective date of the sanctions until September 1997. 
But then the Japanese failed to meet their April commitments. In September, the Japanese again asked for a postponement of the FMC rule. The FMC refused, and beginning in September, fees of $100,000 per voyage began accruing. The fees for the month of September, which totaled $4 million, were due and payable October 15, 1997. 
Despite frequent assurances by the Japanese carriers that they would pay the fees, when the October deadline was reached, they refused to do so. Accordingly, the FMC took the next step, which is authorized by statute and specifically spelled out in the final rule: to request that Customs deny clearance of Japanese vessels at United States ports, and to request the Coast Guard to detain the vessels. This action is entirely avoidable upon payment by the Japanese carriers of their now overdue debts to the United States. 
The Japanese port practices at issue result in costly, arbitrary, and unnecessary expenditures by United States carriers and prevent them from making their own decisions on whom to hire for stevedoring services, from being licensed to operate their own terminals, and from operating efficiently. These practices are injurious not only to U.S. carriers, but to all U.S. importers and exporters who rely on ocean shipping, and to the American consumer. Japanese port costs are the highest in the world, and American consumers of Japanese goods ultimately foot the bill. Moreover, Japanese carriers are not subject to such restrictions in their operations in the United States. 
None of these achievements of the FMC would have been possible were the FMC not an independent agency, separate from the executive branch departments. Only an independent agency, free from political pressure and the host of other concerns which frequently paralyze larger executive branch agencies, could have acted so swiftly and effectively. We must ensure that the FMC continue to retain its independent status. 
It is my understanding that United States and Japanese negotiators are coming close to an agreement that would resolve this issue. This issue would not be resolved, but for the actions of the FMC. Bravo, keep up the good work, and ensure that whatever issues the Japanese Government agrees to are enforced for the benefit of the shipping public.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to thank Dave Wright for his many years of service to the listeners of Columbia, South Carolina's `Sunny 100' radio and to congratulate him on a job well done. His tenure of nearly 40 years is a tribute to his tenacity, acumen, and energy. His dedication to his craft is an inspiration to aspiring broadcasters everywhere. 
Dave Wright's friends and colleagues will agree with me that his retirement is a bittersweet occasion. We wish him the best as he embarks on a new chapter in his life, yet we do not want to see him leave the airwaves. I always have considered Dave Wright to be the voice of Columbia and shall miss hearing him during my travels through the city. With Gene McKay and Bill Benton, he combined local news reporting with humor, music, and listener interaction to make the `Good Morning Columbia' radio show one of the best in the Southeast. 
Over the span of five decades, Dave Wright has provided the people of Columbia with humorous commentary on community news. It is no secret why they look forward to tuning in to Sunny 100 in the morning. Of course, his long record of service extends beyond Columbia; we all are proud of his service in the Air Force during the Korean war. 
Fortunately for us, Dave Wright is not completely retiring from the news business. South Carolinians look forward to his future coverage of golf tournaments around the country, as they have since 1962. And we all are hoping to see him devote more time to one of his greatest loves: stand-up comedy. 
Today I join the people of Columbia in thanking Dave Wright for brightening our lives and our airwaves for almost 40 years.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Bill Spong and I go back a long way. We were the only Democrats elected to the Senate in 1966. Back then, new Senators were expected to be seen and not heard. Bill and I were dutiful--we took the last two seats on the back row of the Democratic side of the Senate floor and swapped afternoons and evenings presiding as Speaker Pro Tempore. In those days they gave Golden Gavels to members who presided over the Senate for more than 100 hours; Bill and I each received one. 
Bill Spong was one of the quietest and most thoughtful men ever to serve in the Senate. He brought his considerable experience in law and banking to bear on every issue before the Senate and carefully analyzed each piece of legislation on which he voted. He set an example of what a Senator in a deliberative democracy should be. 
The Senate was a different place then. Republicans and Democrats worked closely together in a collegial atmosphere. Though they differed on many issues, a majority of Senators from both parties came together to produce legislation for the good of the Nation. Now the Members of the two parties meet only to ambush one another. In today's climate of partisan warfare, it is hard to find anyone who can match Bill Spong's civility. 
Senator Spong made many friends for Virginia in his 6 years of service. He was an outstanding and committed representative of the people of his state. His election loss in 1972 deprived Virginia and the United States of an able and promising Senator. Undoubtedly, Senator Spong would have won reelection and served for many more years had the public confusion and division caused by Vietnam and his seat on the Foreign Relations Committee not placed him in an untenable position. 
After leaving the Senate, he served with great distinction as a noted mediator and as Dean of the School of Law at William and Mary. In these capacities, he continued to serve his community. 
Bill Spong's death yesterday shocked and saddened us all. It deprives us of a much-needed model of dedication, service, and leadership. Let us all hope that his great qualities will find their incarnation in future servants of the public good.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, occasionally there comes along an individual who inspires everyone with his compassion, dedication, and devotion. Alex English is such a person. 
Mr. English was born in Columbia, S.C., amid great poverty. As a child, he faced overt racism from many of the city's white residents; in his neighborhood, there were few role models he could emulate. It would have been easy for Alex English to capitulate to the odds, to become a victim of the oppressive poverty and violence that surrounded him. But he did not. 
Instead, Alex English became a basketball player. Not just any basketball player, but one of the greatest in the world. On Monday, September 29, 1997, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The hall of fame recognized him for his 15-year National Basketball Association career, during which he made the All-Star Team eight times and the All-NBA second team three times. Mr. English led the NBA in scoring in the 1985-86 season. Today, Alex English is No. 9 on the NBA's all-time scoring list. 
But Alex English's greatest attributes are not his feather-soft jump shot or his patented, smooth-as-silk drive to the basket. They are his qualities as a warm and generous person. Alex English was first and foremost a team player, in life and in basketball. At his induction on Monday, he said, `Team play was the most important thing for me. I had players around me who knew their roles; there was no selfishness.' This unselfish attitude and self-effacing manner is rare among today's famous athletes. 
On and off the court, Alex English's grace and poise always have stood out. Lou Carnesecca, former St. John's coach and 1992 Hall of Fame inductee, noted that Alex `always comported himself so well--with class.' Dr. Jack Ramsay, another Hall of Fame coach, seconded Carnesecca's praise. These great coaches are telling us what we in South Carolina already know: as a player and person, Alex English is in a league of his own. 
We in South Carolina are proud to call Alex English our own. He has been inducted into the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame and the University of South Carolina Hall of Fame, as well as the Colorado Hall of Fame. Fortunately for us, Alex also has been quick to acknowledge his South Carolina roots. `I carry all of you with me,' he said to the people of Columbia after his induction on Monday. `Columbia has been a very important part of my career; the people there have always treated me very kindly.' 
Alex English continues to reside in Columbia, preferring to live quietly among old friends rather than ostentatiously. He has not forgotten his old teammates at Dreher High School and the University of South Carolina. He is known to his neighbors and friends as a humanitarian, philanthropist, businessman, and ambassador of goodwill. He gives generously of his time and money. As George Glymph, Alex English's high school coach said, `When the good Lord wanted a role model for the ultimate professional, family man, warrior, he made Alex.' Because of Alex English's contributions, his community--our community--is a better place. 
At his induction, Alex English told the press, `I love the people of Columbia dearly.' Alex, the feeling is mutual.

Mr. HOLLINGS. In his book `Breaking the News,' Jim Fallows writes: `If the public is confused, alienated, pessimistic or hostile to government, that is only partly the public's fault. . . .' And he goes on to say, `Journalism should lead the public by pointing out realities.' 
So I briefly point out a reality, Mr. President, to the Congress here this afternoon. In `The Economic and Budget Outlook' of the Congressional Budget Office--the authority with respect to budgetary figures such as the balanced budget, deficits and surpluses--we find on page 34, Mr. President, the reality that while, yes, a unified deficit is listed as $34 billion, the actual deficit for the year 1997 that ends at midnight tonight is $177 billion. That is the deficit. The media should report this, the reality, and not the fraudulent unified deficit. We are spending $177 billion more than we are taking in. 
The unified deficit is $34 billion because they count the surpluses from the airports, the highway trust funds, Social Security, and the military and civil service pension funds--billions of dollars moved over. But that does not obscure the fact, nor it should not obscure the fact, that as of this fiscal year, when we are all talking about wonderful reductions in deficits, we are running a real deficit of $177 billion. 
Now, Mr. President, 5 years out when we all say, `Oh, we have a balanced budget for the first time since Lyndon Johnson,' and everyone is running around shouting `balance!' there will be no balance, according to the Congressional Budget Office. In the year 2002, the deficit, rather than being in balance, will be $161 billion. And that assumes optimistically that 95 percent of the domestic cuts occur in the last 2 years. 
I can assure the distinguished Senator from North Carolina that the deficit will be bigger 5 years out than it is today, at the end of this fiscal year. Looking at the figures across the board for the next 5 years, I see that the CBO forecasts next year's deficit to be $210 billion; the year following that, 1999, the deficit will be $226 billion. Go across the board and you will find out the so-called balanced budget actually increases the national debt by $1 trillion. 
Now why is that dangerous? That is dangerous because you cannot avoid the interest costs on the national debt. The national debt is now in excess of $5.3 trillion, and going up to over $7 trillion in the next 10 years. 
Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that even with low-interest rates we will spend $358 billion in the next year just servicing the national debt. This amounts to almost $1 billion a day. This is $1 billion a day we cannot spend on new roads or schools. The first thing the Government does every day is borrow another $1 billion to pay interest on the national debt. 
Now, if you managed your family finances or your business this way, you would not last long; but we are doing it. 
All this reminds me of Denny McLain. He was convicted earlier this year of using his company's pension fund to pay off his company's debt. You see, we passed the Pension Reform Act of 1994, and when Denny violated that act, he was sentenced to 8 years in prison. If you can find what prison he is in, tell Denny he made a mistake. He should have run for the Senate: instead of getting a prison sentence, he would have gotten the Good Government award. That is what we are doing around here--stealing from the American people's pension funds. And we are patting each other on the back. This is a sweetheart deal. Both parties are agreeing to lie to the American people so that we can proclaim the budget is balanced. 
The truth of the matter is, we have a deficit now, and we will still have one in 2002. This year's much-ballyhooed budget deal increases spending $52 billion and cuts revenues $95 billion. Now, how can you balance anything by increasing your spending and cutting your revenues? You can't. But that is what we are claiming. It is Rome all over again, and we are trying to make the people happy with bread and circuses. Only today, the Congress' circuses are spending increases and tax cuts and shouts of `balance, balance, balance.' 
I yield the floor, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer and my colleague from North Carolina. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Highway and Surface Transportation Safety Act of 1997. This legislation is designed to reauthorize federal highway safety and surface transportation programs that are under the jurisdiction of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. 
As the Members of this body know, the Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over Federal agencies that oversee highway safety and surface transportation policies. These agencies include the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA], which administers automobile safety regulations and Federal safety grant programs, such as anti-drunk-driving and seatbelt use grants; the Research and Special Projects Administration [RSPA], which assists States in responding to hazardous materials spills; the Federal Highway Administration [FHWA], which administers the truck safety programs; and the Federal Railroad Administration [FRA], which regulates rail safety. Each of these agencies, as well as the policies under their authority, is vital to ensuring that Americans are provided with the safest and most efficient transportation, including safe automobiles, highways, and public transportation systems. 
In addition to preserving the security of our roadways, the measures administered by these agencies are critical to the health of our Nation's economy. The availability of the goods we consume and that are essential to our everyday lives depend on efficiently functioning transportation systems. 
The participation of the Federal Government in assuring that our automobiles and roadways are safe has been affirmed overwhelmingly by the American public. A recent Lou Harris poll shows that 91 percent of Americans believe the Federal Government has a role in assuring safe highways and 94 percent believe it is important to have motor vehicle safety standards. 
Our transportation and highway safety policies deserve as much attention as campaign finance reform, the popular measure of today. Yes, we must clean up the election system, but we also must clean up our roadways. NHTSA reports that every year over 41,000 Americans are killed on our Nation's highways--that is an average of 114 lives every day. In just the past 5 years alone, over 160,000 Americans have lost their lives, and more than 12 million have suffered serious injuries due to traffic accidents and road hazards--at a cost over $700 billion dollars. 
Astoundingly, almost 25 percent of these traffic fatalities involve children. In 1995, over 9,000 kids were killed in auto 
accidents. Of course, no poll, and no economic gauge, can measure the value of losing a precious young life. 
Studies, however, show that many of these accidents and fatalities are preventable. Most accidents are due to reckless behavior, such as drunk driving. According to NHTSA, alcohol-related accidents are responsible for over 40 percent of traffic fatalities. That means almost half of the tens of thousands of Americans that die every year because of traffic accidents can be saved if we can just prevent people from driving drunk. That is why I have supported measures in the past, and included provisions in this legislation, to encourage the enactment of stringent anti-drunk-driving laws. 
In addition to deterring the reckless behavior of those that cause accidents, there are steps every vehicle occupant can take to enhance safety. All safety experts agree that the most simple, and most effective, way to protect ourselves from accidental injuries is to buckle up--wear a seatbelt. During the early 1980's an active campaign was initiated by NHTSA and public safety groups to encourage the use of seat-belts. The campaign had many positive results--helping to increase seatbelt use from 11 percent in 1980 to a current use rate of 68 percent. But 68 percent is still not sufficient. To continue to save lives, we must boost the use rate, at the very least, to the 90 percent range. This is why I joined Senator McCain earlier this year in sending letters to all State Governors encouraging the enactment of tougher seatbelt laws nationwide.  
LEGISLATION 
The legislation I am introducing is designed to address these important safety issues. The following is a summary of many of the major provisions: 
Drunk driving--The bill reauthorizes NHTSA's safety grant programs, which include incentive grants to States to encourage the adoption of stringent drunk driving laws. 
Seatbelt Grant Program--The bill establishes for the first time ever a formal Federal seatbelt grant program to encourage states to adopt primary seatbelt laws. Primary seatbelt laws permit police to stop persons solely for not wearing a seatbelt. The new grant program has been included in lieu of the administration's proposal which attempted to force States to adopt primary seatbelt laws by reducing their highway construction funds. 
Required warnings--Vans to transport children--A provision has been included to require NHTSA to notify car 
dealers each year about Federal regulations that prohibit the sale of vans to schools for the transportation of students. This policy has been adopted to prevent the transport of children in less safe vehicles. 
Hazardous materials transportation Reauthorization--The bill reauthorizes appropriations for assisting States in responding to hazardous materials spills. 
Sanitary food transportation--The bill authorizes the transfer from the Department of Transportation to the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] the responsibility of ensuring that trucks and rail cars that transport the Nation's food supply are sanitary. This change is needed in order to take advantage of FDA's expertise in determining the cleanliness of these transports. 
Rail and mass transportation anti-terrorism--The legislation increases the penalties for anyone convicted of a terrorist attack on railroads or mass transport systems and gives the Federal Bureau of Investigation [FBI] the lead role in investigating such incidents. 
Rail and mass transportation safety--This legislation requires that DOT's Federal Transit Administration consult with the Federal Railroad Administration on relevant rail safety issues in making any grant or loan under its commuter railroad authority. 
Boating safety--The bill extends funding for the Clean Vessel Act, and authorizes spending for State grants for recreational boating safety, vessel pump-outs, facilities for large recreational vessels, and sport fishing outreach and communications. 
CONCLUSION 
This legislation has been drafted from the framework of the administration's proposed highway safety bill. However, a number of changes have been made as a result of consultation with highway safety and consumer groups, such as the Advocates for Highway Safety and Public Citizens, as well as the National Association of Governors' Highway Safety Representatives, in an effort to craft the best safety bill possible. I look forward to working with Chairman McCain and other committee members, in addition to the highway safety organizations, as we begin our work on the legislation.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator Frist, in introducing legislation to reauthorize the programs of the U.S. Fire Administration [USFA]. 
The United States currently has one of the worst fire records of any country in the industrial world. More than 2 million fires are reported in the United States every year. Annually, these fires result in approximately 4,500 deaths, 30,000 civilian injuries, more than $8 billion in direct property losses, and more than $50 billion in costs to taxpayers. In my State of South Carolina, in 1995, the most recent year in which data are available, 12,776 fires were reported resulting in 12 deaths, 103 injuries, and over $40 million in property losses. Even more disheartening is the fact that over 80 percent of the annual deaths and injuries from fires occur in residential fires. In South Carolina, while only 3,196 of the fires were residential, those fires claimed 8 lives and caused 74 injuries. 
As terrible as these statistics are, they would reflect a far more tragic picture were it not for the USFA. The USFA was created under the 1974 act, pursuant to the recommendation of the National Commission on Fire and Control. The USFA is a part of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and its responsibilities are to administer programs, research, and applied engineering projects to assist State and local governments in fire prevention and control. The USFA works with State and local governments specifically to educate the public in fire safety and prevention, control arson, collect and analyze data related to fire, conduct research and development in fire suppression, promote firefighter health and safety, and conduct fire service training. 
The USFA assists our Nation's fire service which comprises of approximately 1.2 million members, 80 percent of whom are volunteers. The fire service is one of the most hazardous professions in the country. Firefighters not only confront daily the dangers of fire; they also are required to respond to other natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, medical emergencies, and hazardous materials spills. The USFA administers the National Fire Academy, which sponsors off-campus and on-campus training and management programs for members of the fire and rescue services, and allied professionals. 
The effort of the USFA is focused in four areas: First, public education and awareness and arson control; second, data collection and analysis; third, fire service training; and fourth, technology and research and firefighter health and safety. 
Through public education and awareness the USFA seeks to identify and educate the groups for whom fire presents the greatest menace. Efforts are focused to increase safety and reduce losses. For example, whether by accident or on purpose, children start over 100,000 fires per years. About 25 percent of the fires that kill young children are started by children playing with fire. The USFA through public-private partnerships had educated children with initiatives such as the `Sesame Street Fire Safety Activity Book for Preschoolers,' National Safe Kids, and various guides for parents and teachers. 
Senior citizens are at the highest risk of being killed in a fire. The USFA has targeted this group through public service announcements with added focus on the importance of buying and maintaining residential smoke detectors. 
Arsonists are responsible for over 500,000 fires every year. Arson is the No. 1 cause of all fires. Even though it is the leading cause of fire, only 15 percent of arson cases result in arrests with juveniles accounting for 55 percent of arrests, and only 2 percent result in convictions. It is the second leading cause of fire deaths in residences and the leading cause of dollar loss due to fire. In 1994, the most recent year for which comprehensive data is available, the total number of arson fires in the United States was estimated at 548,500--accounting for an estimated 560 fire deaths, 3,440 fire injuries, and $3.6 billion in property damage. 
Of greater concern are investigators reports that more people are choosing to use fire as a weapon. According to the USFA's `Arson in the United States' report, `Investigators are becoming more aware of Molotov cocktails and pipe bombs being used as incendiary devices. Fires caused by explosives or motivated by spite and revenge tend to be more deadly because they often target residential structures, in keeping with the desire to inflict personal harm.' In my own State of South Carolina, we suffer from the worst record for church burnings--over 30 since 1991. I visited with Rev. Lester Grant of Shiloh Baptist Church in Townville, SC, last month, and we discussed the recent trend of targeting churches with this new weapon of hatred and violence. I was impressed with how our church communities are rallying and growing stronger in the rubble of fires. Church burnings, whether acts of hatred or vandalism, have to stop. 
We must do more to assist our church communities in stopping these vile efforts. The USFA has initiated several measures to combat this crime, including: community grants in high risk areas to hire part-time law enforcement officers, and to pay for law enforcement overtime and other church arson prevention activities; National Fire Academy training courses; additional training and education for arson investigators with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; arson prevention information for the general public; and juvenile arson prevention workshops. Although the President's budget request for fiscal year 1997 for arson-fighting activities was reduced, this bill restores that funding at last year's level. 
USFA's emphasis on data collection and analysis provides it with the necessary tools for identifying problems and forecasting trends. USFA use this data to focus efforts in the areas that will most significantly reduce casualties and property losses caused by fire. National Fire data are published through USFA's National Fire Incident Reporting System, the only centralized and uniform collection of fire data in the United States. 
Regarding fire service training, Mr. President, and the National Fire Academy provides national leadership for fire and emergency medical services personnel through education and training. The Academy offers training and educational programs at the Emmitsburg campus and at other sites throughout the country. The Academy trained 83,000 students in 1996 and plans to increase this number to 300,000 per year in the future. There now are four applicants for each available slot for many of the Academy's courses. 
Finally, the USFA conducts research on technology to improve the occupational health and safety of firefighters including improvements to protective clothing and equipment, lifesaving operational technologies and equipment like liquid fire extinguishing agents, and equipment used in vehicle extrication and complex rescues. 
Mr. President, the efforts of our Nation's 1.2 million firefighters are invaluable; they risk their lives every day to save the lives and property of others. The USFA provides the necessary education, data analysis, training, and technology needed to ensure that these brave individuals do their job as efficiently and safely as possible. We in Congress need to do our job: We need to enact this legislation to ensure that both firefighters and the USFA get the financial resources they need to serve the public. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Oceans Act of 1997. I am pleased to be joined in this endeavor by Senators Stevens, Kerry, Snowe, Breaux, McCain, Inouye, Kennedy, Boxer, Biden, Lautenberg, Akaka, and Murkowski. Mr. President, plainly and simply, this bill calls for a plan of action for the 21st century to explore, protect, and use our oceans and coasts. 
This is not the first time we have faced the need for a national ocean policy. Three decades ago, our Nation roared into space, investing tens of billions of dollars to investigate the Moon and the Sea of Tranquility. During that golden era of science, some of us also recognized the importance of exploring the seas on our own planet. In 1966, Congress enacted the Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act in order to define national objectives and programs with respect to the oceans. That legislation laid the foundation for U.S. ocean and coastal policy and programs and has guided their development for three decades. I was elected to the Senate just 3 months after the 1966 act was enacted into law, but I am pleased that both Senators Inouye and Kennedy, the two cosponsors of the 1966 act still serving in the Senate, have agreed to join me today in introducing the Oceans Act. 
One of the central elements of the 1966 act was establishment of a Presidential commission to develop a plan for national action in the oceans and atmosphere. Dr. Julius A. Stratton, a former president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then-chairman of the Ford Foundation, led the Commission on an unprecedented, and since unrepeated, investigation of this Nation's relationship with the oceans and the atmosphere. The Stratton Commission and its congressional advisers--including Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Norris Cotton--worked together in a bipartisan fashion. In fact, the Commission was established and carried out its mandate in the Democratic administration of Lyndon Johnson and saw its findings implemented by the Republicans under President Richard Nixon. With a staff of 35 people, the commissioners heard and consulted over 1,000 people, visited every coastal area of this country, and submitted some 126 recommendations in a 1969 report to Congress entitled `Our Nation and the Sea.' Those recommendations led directly to the creation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 1970, laid the groundwork for enactment of the Coastal Zone Management Act [CZMA] in 1972, and established priorities for Federal ocean activities that have guided this Nation for almost 30 years. 
While the Stratton Commission performed its job with vision and integrity, the world has changed since 1966. Today, half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of our shores and more than 30 percent of the gross domestic product is generated in the coastal zone. Ocean and coastal resources once considered inexhaustible are severely depleted, and wetlands and other marine habitats are threatened by pollution and human activities. In addition, the U.S. regulatory and legal framework has developed over the years with the passage of a number of statutes in addition to CZMA. These include the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, and the Oil Pollution Act. Finally, the United Nations has declared 1998 to be the International Year of the Ocean, focusing global attention on the state of the world's oceans. In short, it is time to reexamine our Nation's relationship to the sea. 
The Oceans Act is vital to the continued health of the oceans and prosperity of our coasts. It is patterned after and would replace the 1966 act. Like that act, it is comprised of three major elements: 
First, the bill calls for development and implementation of a coherent national ocean and coastal policy to conserve and sustainably use fisheries and other ocean and coastal resources, protect the marine environment and human safety, explore ocean frontiers, create marine technologies and economic opportunities, and preserve U.S. leadership on ocean and coastal issues. 
Second, the bill establishes a 15-member Commission, similar to the Stratton Commission, to examine ocean and coastal activities and report within 18 months on recommendations for a national policy. Commission members would be appointed by the President and the Congress. In developing its recommendations, the Commission would assess Federal programs and funding priorities, ocean-related infrastructure requirements, conflicts among marine users, and technological opportunities. The bill authorizes appropriations of $6 million over 2 years to support Commission activities. 
Third, the bill creates a high-level Federal interagency Council that is chaired by the Secretary of Commerce and includes the heads of the Departments of Navy, State, Transportation, and the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the National Economic Council. This new Council will advise the President and serve as a forum for developing and implementing an ocean and coastal policy, will provide for coordination of Federal budgets and programs, and will work with non-Federal and international organizations. 
By establishing an action plan for ocean and coastal activities, the Oceans Act should contribute substantially to national goals and objectives in the areas of education and research, economic development, and public safety. With respect to education and research, our view of the oceans 30 years ago was based on a remarkably small amount of information. When Jack Kennedy was in the White House, we were just beginning to develop the capability for exploring the oceans, and the driving factor was the military need to hide our submarines from the Soviets during the cold war. What we knew of the oceans at that 
time was based as much on what fishermen brought up in their nets as it was on reliable scientific investigation. 
Today, we still have explored only a tiny fraction of the sea, but with the use of new technologies what we have found is truly incredible. For example, hydrothermal vents, hot water geysers on the deep ocean floor, were discovered just 20 years ago by oceanographers trying to understand the formation of the earth's crust. Now this discovery has led to the identification of nearly 300 new types of marine animals with untold pharmaceutical and biomedical potential. 
Many of our marine research efforts could have profound impacts on our economic well-being. For example, research on coastal ocean currents and other processes that affect shoreline erosion is critical to effective management of the shoreline. Oceanographers are working with Federal, State, and local managers to use this new understanding in protecting beachfront property and the lives of those who reside and work in coastal communities. 
Development of underwater cameras and sonar, begun in the 1940's for the U.S. Navy, has led to major strides not only for military uses, but for marine archaeologists and scientists exploring unknown stretches of sea floor. Consumers have benefited from the technology now used in video cameras. Sonar has broad applications in both the military and commercial sector. 
Finally, marine biotechnology research is thought to be one of the greatest remaining technological and industrial frontiers. Among the opportunities which it may offer are to: restore and protect marine ecosystems; monitor human health and treat disease; increase food supplies through aquaculture; enhance seafood safety and quality; provide new types and sources of industrial materials and processes; and understand biological and geochemical processes in the world ocean. 
In addition to the economic opportunities offered by our marine research investment, traditional marine activities play an important role in our national economic outlook. Ninety-five percent of our international trade is shipped on the ocean and each year products valued at more than $220 billion are shipped within the United States via the water. In 1996, commercial fishermen in the United States landed almost 10 billion pounds of fish with a value of $3.5 billion. Their fishing-related activities contributed over $42 billion to the U.S. economy. During the same period, marine anglers contributed another $20 billion. Travel and tourism also contribute over $700 billion to our economy, much of which is generated in coastal areas. Last year, in South Carolina alone, the total impact of tourism in coastal areas was almost $6 billion. With a sound national ocean and coastal policy and effective marine resource management, these numbers have nowhere to go but up. 
With respect to public safety, it is particularly important to develop ocean and coastal priorities that reflect the changes we have seen in recent years. Before World War II, most of the U.S. shoreline was sparsely populated. There were long, wild stretches of coast, dotted with an occasional port city, fishing village, or sleepy resort. Most barrier islands had few residents or were uninhabited. After the war, people began pouring in, and coastal development began a period of explosive growth. In my State of South Carolina, our beaches attract millions of visitors every year, and more and more people are choosing to move to the coast--making the coastal counties the fastest growing ones in the State. Seventeen of the 20 fastest growing states in the Nation are coastal states--which compounds the situation that the most densely populated regions already border the ocean. With population growth comes the demand for highways, shopping centers, schools, and sewers that permanently alter the landscape. If people are to continue to live and work on the coast, we must do a better job of planning how we impact the very regions in which we all want to live. 
There is no better example of how our ocean and coastal policies affect public safety, than to look at the effects of hurricanes. Throughout the 1920's, hurricanes killed 2,122 Americans while causing about $1.8 billion in property damages. By contrast, in the first 5 years of the 1990's, hurricanes killed 111 Americans, and resulted in damages of about $35 billion. While we have made notable advances in early warning and evacuation systems to protect human lives, the risk of property loss continues to escalate and coastal inhabitants are more vulnerable to major storms than they ever have been. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo came ashore in South Carolina, leaving more than $6 billion in damages. Of that total from Hugo, the Federal Government paid out more than $2.8 billion in disaster assistance and more than $400 million from the National Flood Insurance Program. The payments from private insurance companies were equally staggering. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew struck southern Florida and slammed into low-lying areas of Louisiana, forever changing the lives of more than a quarter of a million people and causing an estimated $25 to $30 billion in damage. Hurricanes demonstrate that the human desire to live near the oceans and along the coast comes with both a responsibility and a cost. 
The oceans are part of our culture, part of our heritage, part of our economy, and part of our future. Therefore, we need to be smart about ocean policy--we need the best minds to come together and take a look at what the real challenges are. It is not enough to sit back and assume the role of caretakers. We must be proactive and develop a plan for the future. 
Mr. President, Members who doubt the need for this legislation need only pick up a newspaper and they will be face to face with pressing ocean and coastal issues: fish covered with lesions in the Chesapeake Bay and North Carolina; a powerful El Nino brewing in the Pacific; condemnation of vacation homes as the beaches beneath them erode; U.S. ships held hostage over fishing disputes; and the list could go on. Deciding how to manage these problems and use the seas is one of the most complicated tasks we can tackle. There are no boundaries at sea, no national borders with fences and checkpoints. The resources of the sea are a common heritage, shared by all. While our coastal waters are governed by the United States for all of us, there are few rules on the high seas and progress relies primarily on international cooperation. 
The United Nations has declared 1998 to the be the Year of the Ocean. One reason for launching the International Year of the Ocean is to wake up the governments and the public so we pay adequate attention to the need to protect the marine environment and to ensure a healthy ocean. This is an unprecedented opportunity to celebrate and enhance what has been accomplished in understanding and managing the ocean. 
The Stratton Commission stated in 1969: `How fully and wisely the United States uses the sea in the decades ahead will affect profoundly its security, its economy, its ability to meet increasing demands for food and raw materials, its position and influence in the world community, and the quality of the environment in which its people live.' Those words are as true today as they were 30 years ago.

Mr. HOLLINGS. 
Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that will grant permanent residency in the United States to Olga Gorgiladze. 
I serve as the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee that has jurisdiction and oversight over both the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Executive Office for Immigration Review. I can tell you that with respect to Mrs. Gorgiladze's case--they have missed the mark. They have done this woman an injustice. It is a wrong that this Senate and this Congress should make right. 
Olga Gorgiladze's case is a special situation that involves the turmoil and changes that came with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union. In September 1991, Mrs. Gorgiladze came to the United States to stay with her lifelong friend, Merilyn Hodgson. Three months later the Soviet Union was dissolved and civil and ethnic war broke out in Georgia, the Soviet Republic where Mrs. Gorgiladze's husband was from. She applied for asylum in this country in March 1992. INS and the Executive Office of Immigration Review finally got to her case in late 1995 and turned down her request. They instructed Mrs. Gorgiladze to obtain Georgian citizenship and to leave for that country. The irony, of course, is that Olga Gorgiladze is not now and never has been a Georgian citizen. In fact, quite the contrary she fears for her safety should she be forced to go to that nation. She loves the United States. She loves our democratic society that protects freedom of speech and religion. Most importantly, she feels safe in a nation that has racial and ethnic diversity. The reality is that Olga Gorgiladze wants to become an American, not a Georgian citizen. 
Olga Gorgiladze is not even ethnically Georgian. She is half Chinese and half Russian. She was born in China in 1940 to a Russian father and a Chinese mother. Her father was a naval officer in the Tsarist navy and fought against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. Her mother met Mrs. Gorgiladze's father in Shanghai where he had fled after the war. Olga grew up in China, speaking Chinese. But, once again in 1954, her family had to flee another violent Communist takeover--and her father moved the family back to the Soviet Union. They were sent to work on the undeveloped desert lands of Kazakhstan. In 1959, after her father died of cancer she was given permission by the Soviet authorities to move to Sukhami, Georgia, near the Russian border. 
In 1971, Olga graduated from the Teachers College of Foreign Languages where she majored in English. However, she was denied a teaching position because preference was given to Georgians. She finally got a job as a part-time teacher at the college from which she graduated, but was later fired when all classes for Russian speaking groups were terminated. Despite her advanced education--equivalent to a masters degree in this country--she has continually been forced to take low-paying clerk positions because of discrimination against her as a non-Georgian. Other discriminations displayed against her included housing which is controlled by the state and purchasing of food and supplies. 
Since 1991, the Caucasus nations have been plagued by ethnic strife and warfare. We have all watched the violence and bloodshed in the Abkhaszia region of Georgia, between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the war in Chechneya. Less well televised is the hostility and persecution of outsiders and ethnic minorities. In Georgia, there is hostility to anything or anyone affiliated with Russia. As a woman who looks Chinese, speaks only Russian and English, Olga Gorgiladze has been subject to countless incidents of verbal, physical, and mental abuse. Mrs. Gorgiladze does not and cannot blend into the Georgian population. She has been beaten, spit on, verbally and physically abused. Her safety and livelihood have always felt threatened every minute of every day while living in Georgia. For example, while riding the bus, Mrs. Gorgiladze has been beaten and threatened with knifes, chains, and various other weapons. 
Her husband of 25 years, Malkhaz Gorgiladze, stayed in Georgia and warned Olga of the dangers posed to her if she returned to that country. He encouraged her to seek asylum in the United States and collected evidence for her hearing. He especially worked to document police inactivity and the Georgian officials' complicity in attacks on non-Georgians by violent nationalist groups. The police warned him to stop his efforts. Malkhaz Gorgiladze began to receive anonymous phone calls and threats and warnings to stop criticizing the police. In 1996, while returning home from a New Year's Eve gathering, his car was rammed by a Georgian police car and Olga's husband was killed. 
When asked by the immigration judges at Justice, our State Department reported that Georgia is in a state of cease-fire and everybody is getting along with each other. Further, the Justice Department conjectured that if the Georgian police wanted Olga's husband killed, the would have used means other than an auto accident involving a police car. The INS and immigration judges down there at the Justice Department have used this information and conclusions to deny Mrs. Gorgiladze's request for asylum. Yet, there were numerous letters and affidavits by witnesses regarding Malkhaz Gorgiladze's murder. And, in Georgia, the ultranationalists blame non-Georgians, and in particular blame Russians, for all their misfortunes and lack of economic development. Friends and relatives of Olga Gorgiladze have warned her that she should not return. They tell her that she will never be able to get a job and always will be an outcast. They say she will be considered a traitor. And, Malkhaz will not be there to try and defend her as in the past. In short, they fear for her safety, as do I. 
Mrs. Gorgiladze's case is truly heart-wrenching. And, here is a woman I might add--that has worked for the last 5 years at MCI Customer Service Representative International Department and turned around and paid her taxes to the State of Virginia and the U.S. Government. In my view, she has been an outstanding resident in our Nation who serves as an example of the American dream. She has never broken any law and has never been on welfare or asked the Government for handouts. She has followed the immigration rules every step of the way. She is what America is all about. What astonishes me is why the Justice Department would want to deport this 57-year-old woman. 
Mr. President, I have served in the U.S. Senate over 30 years. Every now and then we get an opportunity to stand up for someone who the Federal bureaucracy has mistreated. This is one of those times. Olga Gorgiladze's situation has touched me. Since her friend brought the case to my attention, I can't stop thinking about how unfair it seems. I've sat in Senate hearing after hearing on the Immigration and Naturalization Service asking why action is not taken to deport illegal aliens who got into this country through deception. I have listened to this administration try to explain how in 1996 they naturalized thousands of aliens with criminal backgrounds. And, I find it astonishing, these very same Justice immigration judges have ruled in separate cases that homosexuality per se does constitute a legitimate claim for asylum. But, in this case we have a woman who came to the United States legally, who is not and never has been a citizen of Georgia, who had her husband killed by Georgian authorities, who legitimately fears for her safety if sent there, who has complied with all the United States immigration laws, and who has paid her own way and has not been a burden to taxpayers in this country--and this is who the Justice Department wants to deny asylum and deport? Maybe I should forgo this bill and simply tell Olga to pretend that she is homosexual. This is injustice. This is just simply wrong. 
Mr. President, I am introducing this bill today because the system is not working. I believe that Olga Gorgiladze has legitimate reasons to fear being deported to Georgia. She is not Georgian and does not belong in that country. It is ludicrous for the United States Government to be ordering her to apply for Georgian citizenship. What she has demonstrated is that she does belong in this country. In her case the system has failed and I think it is incumbent upon the United States Senate to put things right. I am pleased to sponsor this bill. I intend to work with the Judiciary Committee, with Senators Abraham, Kennedy, Hatch, and Leahy, to ensure that Mrs. Olga Gorgiladze is permitted to remain in the United States.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I am proud to support the nomination of Ms. Sheila F. Anthony to serve as a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission [FTC]. The FTC is now functioning with only four Commissioners. Because of the Commission's myriad of responsibilities, it is imperative the agency operates with maximum participation of its designated Commissioners to ensure its efficiency. 
The primary duties of the Federal Trade Commission are: First, to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices, and second to ensure the operation of an efficient and competitive market-place. As part of its administrative responsibilities, the Commission administers a number of Federal statutes, including the Federal Trade Commission Act, which provides the Commission its consumer protection authority, and the Sherman, Clayton & Robinson-Patman antitrust statutes, as well as the Fair Credit Reporting, Fair Debt Collection Practices, and Truth in Lending Acts. A few of the Commission's specific duties include safeguarding the public from false advertisement of goods and services, telemarketing fraud, unfair pricing of products, unfair mergers and acquisitions, illegal boycotts, and other unfair methods of competition. 
Ms. Anthony's record reveals she is well qualified to serve as a Commissioner on the FTC. Her past experience includes serving as an Assistant Attorney General with the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as working as a private practice attorney on matters such as copyright, trademark, and antitrust. 
Ms. Anthony has stated she is ready to take on the many present challenges of the FTC. I look forward to working with her and urge my colleagues to support her nomination.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Harry Bell, a man well known to the people of South Carolina. We salute him as he retires in December as president of the South Carolina Farm Bureau Federation. 
Harry Bell is known throughout the State as a successful farmer. With his son, William, he operates a productive, 1,450 acre farm in Saluda County, on which he raises cattle and plants soybeans, cotton, small grains, and strawberries. But Harry Bell's activities extend far beyond farming. He also is a savvy and successful businessman, with a long career in banking and insurance. 
In fact, he began his business career as a bank clerk, currently serves on the local board of First Citizens' Bank, and has been president of the Palmetto Casualty Insurance Co. and director of the Ridge Banking Co. 
But it is for his work with South Carolina farmers that Harry Bell is best known. He has served as president of the South Carolina Farm Bureau since 1971; in that time, he helped South Carolina farmers weather droughts, high interest rates, and the increasingly overwhelming competition of large-scale commercial farms. During his tenure as president, Harry helped preserve the State's heritage of family-owned farms, while at the same time assisting farmers to mechanize and modernize their operations. It is partly as a result of his efforts that agriculture remains a key component of South Carolina's economy. 
Harry Bell's involvement with agriculture has not been confined to the South Carolina Farm Bureau Federation. He also was president of the Saluda County Farm Bureau Federation for 4 years, and was vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation from 1986-94. From 1967-85, he was the farm representative on the South Carolina Water Resources Commission. 
Fortunately for us, Harry Bell has employed his prodigious talents and energies not just in the service of the farming community, but of the whole community. He must have filled his every waking moment with public service of one kind or another. 
He is active in his church, Johnston Presbyterian, having served as an elder and former deacon. He responded to another kind of call when his country summoned him to fight, serving on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1945-47 and from 1951-53. Additionally, he served in the Air Force Reserves until 1974, when he retired with the rank of lieutenant colonel. 
Harry Bell exemplifies the ideal of public service. His career has combined devotion to God, country, and community. Thanks to his stewardship, South Carolina farmers can look forward to many future harvests. It has been my good fortune to work with Harry Bell for over 20 years on important issues affecting the farmers and economy of our State. We in South Carolina are proud to call him our own, and I am honored to salute him today.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished leader, the Senator from West Virginia. He has really brought us a sobering reminder of the constitutional function of the National Congress. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution doesn't say the Supreme Court nor the Executive, but rather the Congress shall regulate foreign commerce. 
As Senator Byrd mentions protectionists, I remember the second inauguration of President Reagan in the Rotunda due to inclement weather. The distinguished President, taking that oath, pledged with hand raised and the other hand on the Bible, to preserve, protect and defend. Then we came back down and somehow got into a debate relative to trade and well, we were all protectionists. 
We have the Army to protect us from enemies without; the FBI to protect us from enemies within; we have Social Security to protect us from old age; Medicare to protect us from ill health. The very function of Government is to protect. 
What is really at issue here, not just fast track on Mercosur or Chile, but really the fact is that we as politicians, Republican and Democrat both, come in and say, before you open up Gregg manufacturing, you first must have clean air, clean water, minimum wage, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, plant closing notice, parental leave, safe machinery, safe working place. Oh, we all go around jumping up and down to make sure that we have safe and healthy remunerative employment in America. Then we come around, and when the industry in my backyard moves down to Mexico because labor costs just 58 cents an hour and industry has none of those requirements, they say, `Free trade, free trade, free, free, free.' There is nothing free. 
Cordell Hull said reciprocal free trade, competitive free trade. That has to be understood. We have to understand more particularly that the security and success of this Republic stands like on a three-legged stool. We have the one leg of the values we have as a Nation. That is unquestioned. For instance, we commit ourselves to try and bring about peace in the Mideast. Our Secretary of State continued to try just this past week. 
We commit our troops in Bosnia for peacekeeping. We have an ongoing ambassador there in Northern Ireland. Our values for freedom and the individual rights are unquestioned, and our second leg of military strength and power is unquestioned. 
That third leg, though, the economic leg, is somewhat fractured, intentionally --for the simple reason that we sacrificed our economy to keep the alliance together in the cold war. 
I was here in those days when we just sort of gave away unfettered access to American markets back in the 1950's, 1960's, right on up here until now. Today, however, there is a sobering of the American people. An overwhelming majority of the American people, according to the Business Week that has just come out, oppose fast track because they have had enough of this nonsense going on and on and on. Ten years ago we had 26 percent of our work force in manufacturing and we are down to 13 percent. We are not making things. 
Look at the business page of the Wall Street Journal, this morning. There is an article entitled--`Remember When Companies Actually Created Products.' Now they don't make things. 
I can see Akio Morita, the former chairman of the board of Sony at a seminar in Chicago, IL, in the early 1980's, talking of Third World emerging nations, how they could become nation-states. He counseled, in order to become a nation-state, they had to have a strong manufacturing capacity. He finally pointed over toward me, and he said: `And that world power that loses its manufacturing power will cease to be a world power.' 
That is the global competition that this Congress has to wake up and listen to. It is competitive free trade. It is not just the environment. It is not just the labor rights. It is the overall picture of making agreements for the public good. 
Let me get right to just one point, one comment made by my distinguished leader from West Virginia reminds me now of the arrogance of power. 
As a young Governor back in 1961, I had negotiated a sort of policy with respect to textiles. In order to permit the President to promulgate a sort of textile trade policy, the law required that you had to find the item in question important to our national security. 
We coordinated five Secretaries--Labor, Commerce, State, Defense, and Agriculture. And after hearings, we found that textiles was, next to steel, the second most important. You could not send the troops to war in a Japanese uniform. 
I came over to the White House. There had been leaders in the Congress advocating the same kind of policy. For the first time I got an inkling of the White House staff. They do not look upon Congress as a friend. They look upon Congress as the adversary. They are always planning daily for their President to get around Congress or forget about Congress or thwart Congress. It is just a mindset. 
This was confirmed later. As a freshman Senator I was allowed to be on the policy committee. I was listening to the distinguished senior Senator from Arkansas, Senator Fulbright, then chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, talking about the arrogance of power, not just that we were trying to impose the American way the world around, but how we became involved in the war in Vietnam. 
Our wonderful friend, my hero of long time, Senator Dick Russell of Georgia, spoke up and said, `Well, these Presidents and Vice Presidents travel the world around and make all kinds of commitments, and then come back here and give us the bill, and Congress is not even in on it, and we don't even know what it is, and we have to put the money up for it.' 
He said, `The Vice President has just gone around and promised a camel driver something.' I remember it was when President Johnson was the President. Senator Mansfield, the majority leader, 
turned to Senator Russell and said, `Write that up as a resolution, sort of a commitments resolution.' And Senator Russell had emphysema, and he said, `No. That's really for Senator Fulbright.' Senator Fulbright did it. It did not get far because the stance taken by Senator Fulbright in those days was not popular. Later it was taken up by Senator Javits. We passed it. The President vetoed the commitments resolution, and we overrode the veto. The arrogance of power over at the White House. 
Now comes trade. We know you need not have any kind of fast track for complicated treaties and agreements. The Salt I treaty--I was here in that particular debate. We did not have fast track for that. The intermediate missile debate, more recently the Chemical Warfare Treaty, nobody said, fast track. But the business community is superimposed. They are the multinational policy of money, money, money. They do not have the responsibility of the economy. They have the responsibility of making money. They do not have to look out for that third leg that I spoke of. 
So having been up here with NAFTA, with an undemocratic agreement, that certainly has not worked. They said, `We're going to add jobs.' We have minus jobs. They said, `We're going to have a surplus in the balance of trade,' We went from plus $5 billion balance to minus $16 billion balance. 
They said NAFTA would solve other problems. Immigration has gotten worse. I can talk at length on these things. It was going to solve the drug problem. The drug problem got worse. 
But they are still trying, they put up the white tent and they got the country's rich to lobby. I have heard from constituents that the Business Roundtable has now written their members and said: $100,000 is your pledge to come up with. We have already got 60 percent performance. We are getting up a multimillion dollar kitty to bamboozle that Congress. Put up the white tent and go ahead and make another agreement. 
What really nettles the Senator from South Carolina is that while we cannot amend, they do. I will never forget, when I was first in the State legislature back in the 1940s, they had a Representative Keenan from Aiken County who kept running around: `Big you and little me; big you and little me.' Well, here I am almost 50 years later--`Big you and little me'--and what we have is just that, the President coming along and saying, `Here is the agreement. Take it or leave it. And by the way, I will amend it in order to get sufficient votes.' 
In NAFTA, let us have a little quick rollcall here. We had the orange juice commitment to get the Florida vote. I was talking to that crowd and had some votes, I thought, at one time because Castro was selling his citrus to Mexico and Mexico was selling their citrus to us. I was going to use that, but they made a commitment that it would not occur, in order to get the Florida vote. 
Textiles and apparel. I will never forget, I was amazed at one in my delegation--a few textile Senators were voting for it for the simple reason they promised more customs agents to cut out the over $5 billion of transshipments illegally coming into this country. Thousands of jobs; $1 billion is for 20,000 jobs; $5 billion is 100,000 jobs. So they gave in. 
The Canadian transportation subsidy of durum wheat. That got the Northwest and some fellows up there. And then the administration, the executive branch, worked on high fructose sugar. They picked up the Louisiana vote on that one. Then the snap back for winter vegetables. That was a California vote. Peanut butter for Georgia and wine for more Californians. 
Oh, they just went around. By the time I went around and tried to talk sense, the Congressman or the Senator was put in a position, `Well, I'm against this fast track and I'm against this agreement, and ordinarily I would vote against the agreement, but I got this, and this happens to particularly pertain to my State, so I've got to go along.' 
There were stricter rules of origin for beef imports, domestic appliances for Iowa. 
Mr. President, if you did not get in on this, I am giving a rollcall here so you can hurry up and get in on the deal. 
Additional purchases of C-17 military cargo. That was down in Texas. We had that vote that said, `Oh, no, we're going to get more C-17's.' So we lost that Congressman. And the Cross Border Development Bank--there was a Congressman from California that got the Cross Border Development Bank. Worker retraining, urban development, a bridge in Houston, the Center for the Study of Trade. My friend Jake Pickle, he was gone. He got the Center for Trade. That was gone. They gathered some votes by scaling back a proposal regarding grazing fees on public lands. 
They even considered lowering the proposed increase in cigarette taxes to pick up some North Carolina votes. Flat glass for Michigan, helium, asparagus, pipe. 
Well, what you have, Mr. President, is just that, the use of patience in article I, section 8, of the Constitution. I will never forget George Washington's Farewell Address. He said: If in the opinion of the people, the distribution or modification of the powers under the Constitution be in any particular wrong, let it be changed in the way that the Constitution designates. For while you are so patient you may in the one instance be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. 
What we are finding is the Executive with the arrogance of power coming in and superimposing the Business Roundtable, the white tent and the minions running around swapping off, wheeling and dealing, so that the people generally cannot be heard. It is a disgrace. It is the use of patience. And it is an endangerment to our country. 
Fast track. Chile. I said at the time of NAFTA I would agree with a free trade agreement with Chile. Chile had the entities of a free market--labor rights, due process, property rights. They had a concern for the environment, a respected judiciary. They had convicted the murderers of Letelier. Mexico had none of that. 
Our distinguished colleague from New York was saying, just bringing it into focus, saying `how can you have free trade when you do not even have a free election?' That is the difference between Chile and Mexico. Chile is the one country they have in mind, not the other members of the WTO. They do not need fast track to negotiate with Chile. 
But this is just their way of doing business so that they will not have to fool with the Congress. They make it a take it or leave it deal. And giving out the amendments--yes, the Executive can amend, but the Congress cannot. 
I say, bring on the treaty and let us vote it up or down. There could be an amendment on Chile for wine. We have to take care of that industry out on the west coast, some other things of that kind. But that isn't the way now of doing business here. 
What we come to do, which is outrageous in and of itself, is actually start back from the lowering of the deficits. Fiscal responsibility is gone. I will go over that because that is even more important--We passed the so-called spending increases and revenue decreases, spending increases and tax cuts, and running around all over the Halls of Congress calling `Balance, balance, balance.' 
In less than 2 weeks' time, on September 30, this particular fiscal year will terminate and the Congressional Budget Office, on page 35 of their recent report, says we will have a deficit not of $36 or $37 billion as they are trying to write about in the media but a deficit of $177 billion. 
Five years out, my distinguished friend, 5 years out, instead of a balanced budget agreement and a balanced budget law or reconciliation bill, we will have a deficit of $161 billion. During that 5-year period, add it up, those deficits, and the Government of the United States will spend an additional $1 trillion more than we take in. And all the time we are talking about balance. How can you spend $1 trillion more than you take in, and get to balance? Or how can you increase your spending and cut your revenues, at the same time, and say `We are going to reduce the deficit and have balance?' Obviously, you cannot. 
It is time we talk sense to the American people. As Adlai Stevenson used to say, `Let's get the facts on top of the table.' 
This fast track is a disgrace. It is in total disregard of the needs of the American people. They are out there competing. The productivity of the industrial work of the United States is at its highest. What is not competing is the Government here in Washington. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senators McCain, Gorton, and Ford in introducing the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act, which will assign to foreign air carriers the statutory duty to provide support to the families of victims of aircraft accidents. 
Last month, 228 people died in the crash of Korean Air flight 801 in Guam. The United States, as a policy matter, has decided that our air carriers must be prepared to work with the families of victims. In fact, we require our carriers to file plans covering items like toll-free phone lines, notification of families of the accident, consultation on the disposition of the remains, and the return of family possessions. 
These changes came about following the crash of TWA flight 800 last July. It was clear, following the crash, that the families of the victims needed assistance, and in a coordinated way. The National Transportation Safety Board representatives worked night and day to let the families know what was going on, but the carriers, too, have a responsibility and those responsibilities, for U.S. carriers, were statutorily imposed. The bill today will make sure that foreign carriers like Korean Air will have similar responsibilities for crashes that occur in the United States. 
I urge my colleagues to support the bill.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the greatest difficulty I had during the August break was convincing the various newpaper editors I visited while traveling the State, that the budget was not balanced. Everywhere I went, they said that Congress had done its job, producing the first balanced budget since Lyndon Johnson's back in 1968-69. And I said that it was totally out of the whole cloth. 
Mr. President, I think of Mark Twain's famous observation. He said, `The truth is such a precious thing, it should be used very sparingly.' Unfortunately, our media friends have been caught up in the politics and with the consultants in the polls and the truth goes unreported. 
I stated this on the floor when we debated the conference report to the budget resolution. I referred at that particular time to the report of Mr. Kasich from the committee of conference, submitted on June 4, 1997. 
On page 4, I showed where, listed under `Deficits,' that under fiscal year 2002 a deficit of $108,300,000,000 was listed. It was listed with the exclusion of the Social Security surplus as required under section 13:301 of the Budget Act. 
Under that particular act that we passed in 1990, 98 Senators voted for it and President George Bush signed it into law. It said that you cannot report in the Congress nor shall the President submit a budget that includes the Social Security trust funds in the calculation of the budget deficit. We got this enacted into law, and today it is totally disregarded. 
I wish I could put in a criminal penalty. We could lock up the Congress. But the fact of the matter is, a criminal penalty for this already exists, the 1994 Pension Reform Act. This law was enacted to make sure that workers, with all this merger mania, could be sure that their pension funds would remain fiscally intact and safe from defraying company debt. Denny McLain, the famous Detroit pitcher, which the distinguished Chair should be very familiar with--is in jail today because he violated this law. Our great pitcher, McLain, was elected the chairman of a certain corporation where he used the pension fund to pay the debts. Earlier this year, Denny McLain was sentenced to 8 years in prison. Now, if you can find Denny, and what cell he is in, tell him he made a mistake. He should have run for the U.S. Senate instead of going into business, because instead of a prison term, what you get is a good Government award. The constant babble over the land in by all the talking heads, on the TV and the radio, is balance, balance, balance. 
Well, heavens above, this is exactly what is occurring today in the U.S. Senate. Even Mr. Kasich said that his submission was not a balanced budget. All you have to do is read and you will see the increase in the debt between the years 2001 and 2002. In 2002, instead of a balanced budget--you have a $173.9 billion deficit. 
So, I went to all the different newspaper editors, and I said, Wait until the Congressional Budget Office makes their estimate. It usually comes out in August but because of reconcilliation, it will come out in September this year. They finally submitted `The Economic and Budget Outlook,' in September 1997.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Let us cite that table. 
Here they have what they all like to call under the euphemism, a `unified deficit.' Here they just use the word `deficit.' They are very clever because they do not want to get in controversy with that particular section, 13:301. So CBO says: `Deficit for 1997, $34 billion.' This is what everybody is crowing about. But--but--Mr. President, trust fund surpluses. You see under the moneys there, and other changes, other short-falls there, that there is veritably $143 billion used, spent, in order to make the deficit appear to be only $34 billion. The truth is, and actually listed in this document now by CBO, is a deficit of $177 billion for fiscal 1997. And extrapolating it out for 1998, the actual deficit is $210 billion; 1999, $226 billion; the year 2000, $228 billion; the year 2001, $199 billion; and the year 2002, $161 billion. 
There you are, Mr. President. The Congressional Budget Office has not estimated a balanced budget. And no one else in his right mind has estimated a balanced budget except for the political dissembling over the land, in the editorial columns, and in the news reports, `balance, balance, balance,' because what they've got up here this consultant thing to get our `message, message, message' out. If you say it enough, they will believe anything. 
The truth is--the truth is--that we are going to expand the debt by over $1 trillion in the next 5 years, Mr. President. 
Now, let me say something about a soaring debt. When debt increases, interest increase. Everybody around here is saying, `I'm cutting taxes, cutting taxes,' when in essence they are increasing taxes. There are two kinds of taxes. One tax, of course, is like a school tax, where in my home State, South Carolina, all the sales tax goes to the public school system, or gasoline taxes which go to highway construction. Those are what you call win taxes--you win something for paying those taxes.

Mr. HOLLINGS. When is this crowd going to wake up around here? The interest cost was less than $75 billion when Mr. Reagan came to town and promised to balance the budget in 1 year. We had less than $1 trillion debt. Now we have a $5.3 trillion debt--quadruple the debt since that time. We are spending about $283 billion more a year today in interest costs than that particular day 17 years ago. 
Now, if I had that $283 billion, I would get all the highways built, I would get all the research at NIH, I would put in all the money at Head Start. With all of these amendments, we are spending the money but not getting the government. We are proving with this cut taxes, cut taxes, cut taxes that we are incompetent up here. 
Now, Mr. President, I had hoped at that particular time, since the economy was going well and we have had lower deficits each year for the last 5 years under President Clinton, that we would stay the course, not have any tax cuts, not have any spending increases. But this hope was defeated. 
Instead, Mr. President, we passed what? We passed a $52 billion increase in spending and cut the revenues $95 billion and call it balanced. How can you increase spending, lower your revenues, and get to a balanced budget? Of course, it is obvious--you cannot. That is why you have the $177 billion deficit this particular fiscal year and instead of a balanced budget in the year 2002, we have a $161 billion deficit. 
Interestingly, this assumes that by the year 2000--you will have a deficit of $228 billion, an almost $70 billion decrease in a 2-year period. The cuts are back-loaded. That is the smoke and mirrors. 
Everyone is talking about balance, talking about baby boomers, talking about Social Security, which is in the black and balanced. But we are not paying for defense, we are not paying for education, we are not paying for Senators' pay, we are not paying for Head Start, we are not paying for foreign aid, we are not paying for the general Government expenses, and we come around here and we say, `Now what we need is tax cuts to buy the election next year.' 
Mr. President, they have a big hearing going on about campaign financing. The biggest campaign finance violation is the Federal budget scam of a balanced budget and cutting taxes. We are using this budget scam to reelect ourselves. This is what ought to be investigated. This is a public hearing. I hope C-SPAN is covering it. I hope everyone is listening right now, because this is how we buy the votes. I am not worried whether I get from a PAC contribution of $1,000 or $2,000 The country of Japan has over 100 lawyers here, paid over $113 million to lobby us, the Congress. I need not tell you that this is significantly more than the pay of the 535 Members of Congress. I am not worried about those things. What I am worried about is the campaign financing fraud scam that is going on on the floor of the national Congress. We're all running around here hollering, `balance,' and our good friends, the Concord Coalition, is yelling `entitlements, entitlements.' They have not yet faced the reality. 
My friend, David Broder, says I have gotten to be a nuisance on this subject. I wonder why the truth has become a nuisance in Washington?

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Spencer Abraham of Michigan, I am pleased to submit a resolution opposing a proposal by the Federal Trade Commission to allow the `Made in the USA' label to be applied by products that are not made in the United States. If the FTC's proposal were to take effect, it would result in misleading and inaccurate claims and could ultimately cause widespread deception and consumer confusion. Moreover, the FTC's proposal would encourage manufacturers to send U.S. jobs abroad. 
The FTC's recent proposal would reverse 50 years of precedent by the use of the `Made in USA' label even for products with as much as 25 percent or more, foreign labor or materials if they were substantially transformed in the United States. In some instances this could result in a product being labeled as `Made in the USA', even if all of the product's materials or components were made abroad. 
Under current rules, products can only be labeled as made in the USA. If all or virtually all of the products is made in the United States. This strict rule ensures that American consumers can rely on the assertions made by manufacturers, on U.S. made products. American consumers have come to rely on this label, as insurance that the components, materials, and labor used to make the product are from the United States. To change the standard would invite confusion and undermine the value of the made in the USA label. 
The FTC's proposal is opposed by many of the country's leading consumer groups, including the National Consumer's League, the National Council of Senior Citizens, and Citizen Action. Moreover, many leading manufacturers, agriculture groups, and labor unions oppose changes to the current standard. In my State of South Carolina one of our pre-eminent manufactures, Nucor Steel Corp., is among the corporations opposed to the FTC changes. 
In addition, by permitting manufacturers to mislabel their products, the FTC is encouraging American employers to transfer manufacturing of components or materials abroad. Because consumers prefer products made in the United States, the `Made in USA' label is strong incentive for manufacturers to keep jobs in the United States. By permitting manufacturers to shift manufacturing abroad where they can pay lower wages and still maintain the benefits of labeling products as made in the USA, the FTC is explicitly encouraging the transfer of jobs abroad.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Dr. Joab Lesesne, a great educator and South Carolinian. 
Dr. Lesesne recently celebrated his 25th year as president of Wofford College, a small Methodist-affiliated school, which has become one of the finest small liberal arts schools in the Nation. Its successful evolution is largely due to Dr. Lesesne who first arrived at Wofford 33 years ago as an assistant professor of history. Prior to his post at Wofford, he taught history at Coastal Carolina, part of the University of South Carolina system. 
Three years after his arrival at the college, Dr. Lesesne was appointed assistant dean. While in this position, he implemented a visionary interim program during the 1967-68 academic year which continues today. Through this program, students are able to devote themselves to one particular subject for several hours a day for an entire month. The projects range from the study of modern Irish poetry to kayaking down the Rio Grande. The program has contributed to the school's success in turning out well-rounded students with broad interests. 
In 1969, Dr. Lesesne was appointed director of development, a position he held for a year before being named dean of the college. After serving as dean from 1970-1972, Dr. Lesesne continued his ascension and was elected president of the college. Today, under his guidance, Wofford continues to break new ground, both locally and nationally. 
In 1975, the Wofford Board of Trustees approved full co-education, and the college began admitting women as resident students for the first time in its history. They now comprise approximately 45 percent of the student body. Throughout the Lesesne presidency, Wofford has grown exponentially in its endowments and its campus facilities. Additions include the Campus Life Building, which marked the college's 125th anniversary in 1979, a new residence hall, and the Franklin Olin Building, one of the largest gifts ever made by the prestigious F.W. Olin Foundation. The campus's hospitable setting led the Carolina Panthers to choose Wofford as their summer training camp. 
Wofford consistently receives national recognition for its leadership in liberal arts education. It is consistently ranked as one of the `best buys' in liberal arts education and recently,a survey showed it to be the national leader in the percentage of students earning academic credits outside the United States through travel or study abroad programs. Furthermore, its academic excellence is complemented by fiscal responsibility. The Lesesne presidency has an enviable record of balanced budgets, tuition well below the national average for Phi Beta Kappa independent colleges, and overall good management. 
Dr. Lesesne's record of distinction does not end with Wofford. In 1991, he was chosen as the Citizen of the Year by the Spartanburg Kiwanis Club and, in subsequent years, has received numerous awards from the local and statewide Chambers of Commerce. Additionally, he serves on many boards representing industry, banking, commerce, and education. He is past Chairman of the Board of Directors of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the first southerner ever to hold the post, and is a former president of the Southern University Conference, and former President of the National Association of Schools and Colleges of the United Methodist Church. Additionally, Dr. Lesesne is a retired major general in the South Carolina Army National Guard. 
Dr. Lesesne's tenure at Wofford, the longest of any college president in the State, exemplifies the virtues of fortitude and loyalty. Under his steady hand, the school sails forward, faithfully serving its pupils and the community. Joe, in the roles of educator and administrator, is a public servant of the highest order. All of us in South Carolina are proud to call him our own.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I submit the following views in dissent to the provisions contained in title III, Communications and Spectrum Allocation Provisions of the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1997. As a subconferee on title III, I stand in opposition to the provisions adopted by the subconference, and ultimately, the Congress. These provisions are a classic example of the charade that is being perpetuated on the American public under the guise of balancing the budget. The administration and the congressional leadership have devised a plan that turns sound communications policy on its head. 
The final product actually represents the first time the Administration and Budget Committees admit that their original assessments on spectrum auctions were unrealistic. Their admission is reflected in the fact that, also for the first time, universal service funds will be used to make up the shortfall in the auctions in order to balance the budget. Unfortunately, the price that we will pay for their recognizing the error of their ways, will result in higher phone rates for rural America. 
Title III contains dramatic changes to long-standing communications policy. There were many policy changes made that I do not support and deserve greater discussion. But for purposes of this statement, I will only discuss the following three issues: 
First, for the first time, the U.S. budget will be balanced by raiding the universal service fund. This is one of the most blatant budget gimmicks to plug a shortfall as I have ever seen. The bill language as provided to the Budget Committee actually had a blank line for the dollar amount to be filled in at some later point. In the end, the universal service plug was $3 billion. It is not quite clear how the language will actually work--if it works at all. It clearly imposes a financial burden on the telephone companies in an effort to float an interest free loan to the Government. In essence, we are asking small telephone companies to make do without the financial support they rely on every month and may force these companies to raise rates. 
Second, the deal struck by the administration and the congressional leadership requires the Federal Communications Commission [FCC] to auction broadcast licenses. This is a fundamental change to our long-held policy that broadcasters are licensed to serve the public interest. The Congress and the FCC impose special public interest obligations on broadcasters and that is why broadcasters were exempted from auctions under the original auction authority. But now we need money to pay the bills and so the conference has selectively targeted a group of pending broadcast licenses to be assigned by competitive bidding, not by comparative hearings. These applicants had no notice and no opportunity to challenge this change in policy. All of the pending applicants sought these licenses with the expectancy of comparative hearings. Now we have budget folks coming in here and telling us that budget policy is more important than communications policy. 
Along these same lines, the deal eliminates the FCC's ability to use lotteries as an assignment process, except in the case of assigning public broadcast licenses. Here, we preserved the FCC's authority to use comparative hearings to assign these licenses. I urge the FCC to develop appropriate criteria to assign these licenses. The local communities deserve the right to have qualified public broadcast licensees. Public broadcasting is too important to leave to random chance. 
Third, the last point I want to make relates to the change made to the local ownership rules under the guise of increasing the pool of bidders for the analog auction. The deal waives the FCC's rules on duopoly and newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership for the purpose of allowing these parties to bid on the analog return spectrum in 2001. Subsection 3003(D) of the reconciliation conference report violates Section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Budget Act, also known as the `Byrd Rule.' 
These provisions are in violation of the Byrd Rule because: First, the inclusion of these provisions has no revenue impact as indicated by CBO letter dated July 14, 1997; Second these provisions fail to qualify as a necessary term and condition for the purposes of conducting the auction; third these provisions selectively benefit one competitor over another by maintaining other ownership limitations; and fourth these provisions represent substantive policy changes to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and can be achieved by the free-standing pieces of legislation already introduced in the House and Senate. 
Here, subsection 3003(D) is applicable only in cities with populations greater than 400,000 as measured by the 1990 decennial census. For purposes of determining cities with populations in excess of 400,000, the FCC should refer to the April 1, 1990 Decennial Census, as referenced in PPL-27 Table 3, Resident Population for Cities with Population Greater than 100,000 Sorted by Population Rank. The FCC should take note that this is the first time the Congress has directed the FCC to issue a blanket waiver of these two rules and established a statutory threshold that relief is only permissible in these specified markets; and furthermore, the relief is only justified when there is an increase in the number of broadcast outlets in the large markets. 
The legislative history supports this position. The House provision established a blanket waiver of these provisions for all markets. The final provision provides for relief only in cities with populations greater than 400,000. In contrast to the general review of the duopoly rule required under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Congress here has spoken clearly that media concentration is not warranted at this time, particularly in cities with populations less than 400,000, and should only be allowed when there is a possible increase in the number of broadcast outlets. Here that increase in the number of broadcast outlets is anticipated at the end of the digital TV transition when the FCC will auction off the returned analog spectrum. 
It is important to note that repeal of these two rules represents a drastic change in policy. For years, the policy has been to preserve diversity and sources of information. In particular, a merger between a daily newspaper and a broadcast station will reduce the independent sources of news in the community. The budget deal's elimination of the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule exacerbates the growing recent problem of media concentration because even in large metropolitan areas there is often only one major daily newspaper. In such a community, that newspaper may be the only major source of non-broadcast local news and information. With a city's only newspaper aligned with major broadcast stations, a great deal of power and influence is held by a few individuals at the expense of the needs of the community. 
For example, the October 23, 1995, edition of Electronic Media reports examples of newspaper/broadcast cross ownership situations where critical information for the community was stifled because of the lack of independence by the news outlets. For example, during a particularly contentious strike at the major newspaper in Detroit, the cross-owned tv and radio stations were forbidden to air stories about the strike. In addition, a broadcast story about cheating by automotive repair shops was canceled because of potential loss of advertising revenues at the cross-owned newspaper. A company that owns a broadcast station and a newspaper would likely combine its news departments in order to achieve economies of scale. The problem though is not an economic one, but one of information and diversity of views. Such combinations reduce the diversity of sources of local news and public affairs in that community.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the President's nomination of a new Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA], Ms. Jane Garvey. We have waited several months for this nomination, and I want to thank my distinguished colleague and Chairman, Senator McCain, for bringing Ms. Garvey's nomination up for a vote so expeditiously. 
I want to point out Ms. Garvey's impressive public service record. She has held several important positions with both State and Federal Governments. I find it encouraging to find someone with Ms. Garvey's leadership capabilities dedicating her career to public service. All too often society's best and brightest leave public service for more lucrative pursuits. But with Ms. Garvey, we have one of the best making a significant contribution for the good of the public. I applaud Ms. Garvey for that. 
Ms. Garvey comes to us after receiving high marks for her work as Deputy Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration. During her tenure, Ms. Garvey has demonstrated that she is an impressive leader. This nation deserves a nominee like Ms. Garvey to lead the FAA. 
The FAA's job is to safely operate the national air system. When it comes to safety, there is always room for improvement. Improving the system is a monumental task, and Ms. Garvey certainly has her work cut out for her. 
The FAA also plays an important role in developing and promoting airport development. Airport development is a critical component in promoting the growth of aviation. In my home state of South Carolina, the economic impact of aviation statewide is more than $3 billion. The travel and tourism industry is the State's second largest employer. Without modern airports, the economy in South Carolina--and in every other state--suffers. Infrastructure development fuels travel and tourism and enables communities to attract new business to all of South Carolina. 
Because of Ms. Garvey's extensive background at the highway department, I expect she will bring creativity and ingenuity to the Airport Improvement Program. The program is a critical component of our nation's transportation infrastructure, and I am enthusiastic about Ms. Garvey's ability to manage this program well. 
I want to conclude by commending the people at the FAA. All day, every day, they ensure that millions of Americans reach their destinations safely. But the system needs to be modernized, and it needs to be done well. I look forward to working with Ms. Garvey and Secretary of Transportation Slater over the next several years, as we move toward improving the safety of our entire transportation network. 
I urge my colleagues to approve Ms. Garvey as Administrator for the Federal Aviation Administration.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr President, I rise today in support of passage of S. 910, a bill to reauthorize appropriations for the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act. Catastrophic earthquakes are inevitable in the United States. Scientists consider California to be the most likely location for major earthquakes; however, all or parts of 39 states--populated by more than 70 million people--have been classified as having major or moderate seismic risk. Earthquakes are not uncommon in Alaska, Idaho, Utah, and Nevada. Major earthquakes east of the Rockies are infrequent but can prove devastating. In 1811-12, three huge earthquakes rocked the New Madrid area of Missouri, near St. Louis and Memphis. These earthquakes were so powerful that they changed the course of the Mississippi River and rang bells in Boston. In 1886, an earthquake leveled my hometown of Charleston. Estimates of the strength of the Charleston quake range from 7.0 to 7.6 on the Richter Scale. Of particular interest and concern about the east coast quakes is that there is no known geological origin for them. This fact underscores the possibility of unpredictable seismic activity in the United States. 
What we do know, though, is that the loss of life and property from earthquakes can be considerable. For example, the January 17, 1994, earthquake at Northridge, CA, was classified as only `moderate' in magnitude. Nonetheless, 57 people died, and injuries totaled over 6,500. In addition, insurance payments for this moderate event were over $6 billion, and the Federal supplemental appropriation totaled another $9 billion. The Northridge has become the second most expensive natural disaster in American history, exceeded only by Hurricane Andrew. Reducing damage from earthquakes would not only save lives but also save both private insurers and the Federal Government considerable amounts of money. 
That is what NEHRP, National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, established by the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977, is designed to do. It is a Federal interagency program designed to help minimize the loss of life and property caused by earthquakes. It supports scientific research on the origins of earthquakes, and funds engineering research to make buildings and other structures more seismically resistant. NEHRP also disseminates this technical information to the states, and helps states and localities prepare for earthquakes. NEHRP focuses on helping states prepare for earthquakes, in contrast to Federal disaster response programs that help states after a major event. 
The Northridge earthquake illustrates both NEHRP's accomplishments and what some observers believe are continuing problems. 
The most important accomplishment was the survival of most of the buildings and highway overpasses which were built to meet new seismic codes or retrofitted to meet those codes. For example, highway bridges designed using standards developed after the late 1970s performed very well. The most dramatic story concerns the retrofit of older highway overpasses. After the Loma Prieta earthquake in Northern California in 1989, university researchers and Federal engineers, using NEHRP funds, undertook a crash program to develop new ways to retrofit older highway bridges and began applying those retrofit techniques to overpasses in Southern California. At Northridge, six major highway bridges collapsed. While further study is needed, it appears that the older overpasses that were retrofitted survived, while those that did not often failed. 
Northridge also illustrated some continuing problems such as the strength of `lifelines'--water line, natural gas pipelines, electrical lines, and so forth. Little research has been done to date on how to make these facilities more earthquake-resistant. Dramatic film from Northridge showed flooded streets with shooting jets of burning natural gas and illustrated how easily these lines are broken. 
Mr. President, S. 910 will authorize the funding needed to continue the good work that has been done by the four participating agencies in NEHRP--the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology--and will allow them to address problems like ruptured lifelines that continue to plague disaster response teams. 
This bill also will require new assessments of our seismic hazard warning systems, and our earthquake emergency training facilities to ensure that the warning systems and training facilities are up to date, properly operating, and responsive. In assessing the current conditions of the seismic monitoring networks, the agencies are expected to pay greater attention to understudied areas like the eastern seaboard where catastrophic seismic events have occurred in the past, and are predicted to occur in the future--yet are more difficult to understand. 
This is a good bill. I commend the Senator from Tennessee for his diligence in this area, and I encourage my colleagues to support passage of this measure today.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill aimed at correcting a mistake in the Coastal Barrier Resource System. Without this correction, a portion of Colleton County, SC, will remain in the Coastal Barrier Resources System even though the county never had an opportunity to voice their objection to their inclusion. 
In 1980 Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to study and propose a Coastal Barrier Resources System. The aim was to create a system made up of relatively undeveloped low-lying coastal lands which, because of their susceptibility to flooding, would not be eligible for Federal flood insurance. Practically speaking, to be included in the CBRS means you face serious obstacles when selling or developing your property. 
Soon after the passage of the 1980 act, the Department of the Interior created a study group charged which promulgating an inventory of coastal properties--properties to be included in the CBRS. By the end of 1988, the study group had completed its work and the Department of the Interior submitted the CBRS proposal to Congress. 
This proposed inventory was the culmination of 8 years work and included suggestions made during two public comment periods. The first public comments were made following the release of an initial draft inventory in 1985. Additional comments were made following the release of a second draft in the spring of 1987. The Department of the Interior received numerous comments on these draft inventories and incorporated many in their final report to Congress. This final report was the basis for the Coastal Barrier Resources System adopted in 1990. 
I recite this history because without an understanding of it, Mr. President, one can't understand the intent of my legislation. 
While the Department of the Interior was drafting this proposed system, a strip of coastal South Carolina was being annexed by Colleton County from Charleston County. Unfortunately, this annexation occurred in 1987 in the midst of the 1987 CBRA comment period. Unfortunately, the notice of this second draft inventory was not received by Colleton County. The county never received any notice. It appears the draft inventory was provided to Charleston County, not Colleton County. In fact, the maps currently on file at the Department of the Interior, still, incorrectly show this tract in Charleston County--not Colleton County. Thus, the citizens of Colleton County, never having had an opportunity to comment on these proposed changes, now find this tract included in the CBRS. 
I proposed legislation in 1995 to correct this mistake, but it was never reported out of committee. It failed to win the Environment and Public Works Committee's support because the Fish and Wildlife Service, at the time, felt that the area in question had been mapped properly. 
Mr. President, since the end of the 104th Congress, I have been working with the Fish and Wildlife Service to address this problem. They have now reevaluated this area and have come to the conclusion, `that the unprecedented procedural circumstances in this situation raise concerns of equity and fairness that warrant remapping.' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a letter from John Rogers, Acting Director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, dated May 1, 1997, that says just that. 
In short, this bill corrects a mistake made 10 years ago. It rights a wrong. It does not drastically redraft the Coastal Barrier Resources System nor does it withdraw any lands which were included in the 1982 draft. It is narrowly drafted to address Colleton County's unique situation. My staff, working with the Fish and Wildlife Service, has not identified another area in the system which is similarly situated. That is, there are no other areas which changed jurisdictions at the time the Coastal Barrier Resources System boundaries were being developed and which never received notice of these changes, thus this bill would not prove a precedent for those seeking wholesale changes in the Coastal Barrier Resources System. 
In conclusion, the bill simply returns a small portion of Edisto Island, SC to its 1982 status. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, included in the fiscal year 1998 Transportation appropriations bill is an amendment that directs the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] to work with one segment of the aviation industry to develop an expeditious way to comply with the pilot record sharing legislation, enacted last year. 
When we passed the pilot record sharing legislation as part of the FAA Reauthorization Act, `air carriers' were required to obtain certain records, including FAA records, on pilots. The term air carrier includes more than just airlines. It also includes, for example, on-demand non-scheduled carriers. These carriers tend to hire pilots on an as-needed basis, and need the information from the FAA in a more timely manner than airlines. 
The FAA is aware that these carriers need to be able to respond quickly to information requests from the on-demand segment of the industry, and are striving to get the required information to them within 15 days. Ultimately, the information should be available on a real time basis through desk top computers. The amendment recognizes that the FAA must work with industry to figure out a means to comply with the law, and then implement those changes. 
There are many ways for the FAA to facilitate the passing of the information, and discussions should commence with the industry. Compliance is critical, but we cannot ask the impossible of the industry or the FAA. I also want to note that the directive in the Appropriations bill does not authorize any new program, but merely directs the FAA to work with the industry to implement last year's legislation. As a result, I do not believe that we are legislating on an Appropriations bill. 
I want to thank the chairman, Senator Shelby, and the ranking member, Senator Lautenberg, for their acceptance of the amendment.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from West Virginia, and the distinguished chairman from the Appropriations Committee, the Senator from Alaska, as to the point being made relative to the universal service fund. 
In the 4-year tour of work of trying to reconcile and bring up into the modern technological age communications law, there was one thing that was sacrosanct and generally agreed upon by everyone--and there really are no exceptions to it, because it was sort of a private endeavor. I know the distinguished occupant of the chair believes very strongly in the private market and the forces of private industry vis-a-vis those within the Government. But those within the telecommunications industry, years back, by way of the entities in which they belong, determined the volume of business, and with that volume of business and the costs, they then factored in each month through this private universal service fund the amount to be contributed thereto. 
And it is operated that way. From time to time the FCC has rules and regulations about it, but, generally speaking, it is a well-administered fund, not participated in, really, by Government law. The Government does not say or the 1996 Telecommunications Act does not require this. 
So it came with some amazement that, in all the machinations in trying to work for the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we were hearing that they were going into the universal service fund. We raised the point in discussions. We had resolutions about it. We put amendments up. And we thought we had gotten the clear, crystal word through to the negotiators and conferees. Now it appears that that has been disregarded. 
For one, we can see what was really bringing it about. They came in with the spectrum auctions, which this Senator and the Senator from Alaska joined in in the original instance, tried to raise money and factor in the market forces. But we have found in the more recent auctions that we sort of are scraping the cupboard dry or bare, as the expression is, whereby on an auction of last year, agreed upon in October to bring in $3.9 billion, only factored in or received $13.1 million instead of billions up there--few millions. So when they came with the factored-in $26.1 billion in spectrum auctions, they realized that the Congressional Budget Office, and anyone else estimating it, was going to have to downgrade it, so they put in a catchall, the universal service fund with a blank amount, until now, I guess. It is marked at the desk. 
I understand from the debate it is $3 billion. This cannot happen. You do not want to take what is really working and turn it into a slush fund for budgeteers or for conferees or for any other kind of nonsense that is going on along here--smoke and mirrors, as they call it. 
So I am glad the point is being made here in a most eloquent fashion by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, Senator Rockefeller of West Virginia, and now Senator Stevens, who was the ranking member on our Commerce and Communications Subcommittee for many, many years. We worked in this field. We fashioned out some funds that would be available for the schools, for the libraries, the hospitals, and otherwise. 
We really have, I would say, one of the finest elements of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, passed by a vote of 95 Senators here in this body, that the outstanding innovative feature was the agreed-upon embellishment of the universal service fund in order to bring in the libraries and schools and hospitals and otherwise of America, to bring to all of America communications services in the Internet and otherwise. 
Now, we just passed that early on, and we turned our backs, and, heavens above, budgeteers have turned it into a slush fund. I hope that does not occur. I hope the point is made. I do appreciate the leadership of our colleagues who pointed it out this afternoon. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I have spoken with the distinguished chairman of our Budget Committee. He has allocated 20 minutes. I think I will take far less. 
Madam President, when Alice in Wonderland asked the cat where they were headed, the cat replied, `before you decide where you are going, you must first decide where you are.' 
And as we look at this so-called Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we should look to see, before anything is enacted, exactly where we are. At this very minute, we have a pretty good estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. 
We know, Madam President, that as of May 19, CBO estimated the deficit for this year, 1997, to be $180 billion. We also know that both the CBO and the Office of Management and Budget have agreed that this year's revenues are now exceeding their original estimates by as much as $40 billion. 
So, the August estimate for 1997 will be revised to show a deficit of about $140 billion. 
The idea is to balance the budget and remove the deficit. If you are going to remove your deficit, you have to do it one of two ways--or both ways; namely, you have to cut back on your spending and you have to increase your revenues or do both. The present Balanced Budget Act of 1997 proposed increases in spending, rather than cuts in spending. And, instead of increasing the revenues, it reduces revenues by some $90 billion. 
So, Madam President, I have studied this document, and I have to stand here as a matter of conscience, because I have been the chairman of the Budget Committee. I have been in the committee itself since its institution in 1974. I cannot mislead the people with a vote that would approve what this budget resolution is all about. I could go at length as to the various smoke and mirrors, backloading, excessive spectrum auctions and other deceptions contained in this bill, but let me go to one that is not just a simple smoke or a simple mirror. The fact of the matter is, it is an illegal smoke and an illegal mirror. Why do I say that? We had some struggle during the original enactment of the Greenspan Commission report in 1983. Social Security was about to go broke, but its bankruptcy was avoided by the National Commission on Social Security Reform. I hold a section of the report, dated January 1983, in my hand. 
Section 21 of the Greenspan Commission report recommended taking Social Security off budget. That is the core of the misunderstanding--or the understanding. We stated categorically, in accordance with the Greenspan Commission, that when we were calculating deficits, whether or not we were in the red or in the black, that we would not include Social Security trust funds.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Fortunately--and we are all enthused about it--the deficit is going to come down to about $140 billion this year. It may come down to $135 billion, but I doubt that. I have talked to the authorities. But we know we are spending over $100 billion more than we are taking in. We cannot, under the law, use Social Security trust fund surpluses to mask this deficit. The Senate voted on October 18, 1990, by a vote of 98-2, to take Social Security off budget. It took us quite a while in the Budget Committee, but we finally got it done. That is a law, section 13301, signed by President Bush, to take Social Security off budget. 
So, this was a very deliberate act. I am not just trying to impassion senior citizens or any of that nonsense. I am trying to inflame the intellects and the consciences of the Senators. Because every Senator present here today who was here in 1990, voted and said, I believe in that particular policy. No Senator since 1990 has tried to change that; there has been no amendment or bill or otherwise. We had the policy itself reaffirmed in the Retirement Protection Act of 1994 which barred businesses from using the pension moneys to pay the debt. 
Then, the Senate passed an amendment in the budget bill, barring corporations from pension misuse, known as the Pension Reform Act of 1994. 
Madam President, when I look at this particular budget, I say how in the world, if you are spending over $100 billion more than you are taking in, can you remove the deficit by increasing spending and decreasing revenues? It is quite obvious it cannot be done, except under subterfuge, misuse, misappropriation or other fraudulent acts. Because the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 --and we have examined the document now--uses $465 billion of Social Security trust funds to make it appear balanced. 
There is no gimmickry here about Government moneys and buying bonds. When you spend the money out of the fund--and that is what we are doing because we don't have it--then it has to be replaced. Under the chart I included earlier, you can see that over $600 billion from the Social Security trust fund has already been expended, and now they will spend an additional $465 billion in this bill. This means that by the year 2002 we will owe Social Security over $1 trillion. 
They say, `Oh, it's the baby boomers in the next generation that are going to bankrupt Social Security.' No, not at all, my colleagues. It is the senior citizens, the adults on the floor of the U.S. Congress that are decimating Social Security. It is going on. It continues to go on. It is absolutely fraudulent. It is absolutely illegal.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, on line 1 it says, `fiscal year 2002'; line 2, subsection 4, it says `deficit.' 
Then you look down on line 8 at `fiscal year 2002,' and you will not see a balance, but a deficit of $108,300,000,000. 
The reason it shows this deficit is because of section 13301, which says you cannot include Social Security trust fund surpluses. 
But, if you go down to line 15 and see that the fiscal year debt, from year 2001 to 2002, goes up, not into balance. The debt doesn't go into balance from the year 2001 to 2002. Instead, the debt increases $173.9 billion. This is not a balanced budget.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the manager's amendment before us today is the product of many hours of work on the part of a number of my colleagues. I would like to express my personal appreciation to my friend, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and the chair of the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries, Senator Snowe, for their personal efforts and willingness to delay consideration of this legislation until interested parties could work out an agreement. 
In addition, I particularly would like to acknowledge the effort of the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Senator Kerry for his commitment to reaching a compromise. The Senator from Massachusetts made the mistake at our hearing on this legislation of volunteering to find a middle ground between the proponents and opponents of S. 39. Since that time, he has spent hours listening to and trying to accommodate the concerns of all sides in this contentious issue. Without his tireless effort, we would not be standing here today. 
My own interest in this legislation has always been: to ensure sound conservation of marine mammals; to provide consumers with the information they need when purchasing tuna; and to ensure U.S. tuna fishermen a level playing field on which to compete. 
The bill before us now is a far better bill. It addresses many of the concerns of Senators Boxer and Biden as well as others. These two Senators have been leaders in the area of dolphin protection--they wrote the dolphin-safe labeling law and have legitimate concerns about changing the dolphin-safe label without the scientific research to ensure that the tuna fishing methods allowed by S. 39 are safe for dolpins. The compromise before us today ensures that there will be a study of the effect of chasing and encircling dolpins and bases a change in the meaning of `dolphin safe' on the results of that study. 
Furthermore, the compromise addresses the concerns of Senator Inouye. It allows alternative labels on tuna but makes sure that the claims on those labels are true and can be verified. 
Again, I thank the primary sponsors of the bill, Senators Stevens and Breaux, and all of the parties who worked on the manager's amendment for their efforts to improve this legislation.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in supporting appropriations for the completion of the dolphin study. The manager's amendment to S. 39 developed by the Commerce Committee is written so that most of the operative provisions of bill will become effective only if funding for the fist year of the study has been provided. The White House has expressed support for the appropriation mentioned by Senator Gregg for fiscal year 1998, and has indicated that funding will be requested to complete the study in fiscal year 1999, 2000, and 2001. Together with Senators Stevens, Byrd, and Gregg, I support the fiscal year 1998 appropriation for the first year of the study, and will support funds in years to come to complete the study.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like the attention of my colleagues to point out what I see as an unintentional omission. Last year's Commerce, Justice, State appropriations' conference report contained language which provided $1.0 million for the National Crime, Prevention Council's Teens, Crime and the Community Program otherwise known as TCC. The Senate supported this provision last year and it was my intention that it be included in this year's bill. Unfortunately, it was inadvertently left out of the committee report. For my part, I believe it should be the Senate's intent that funding for The Teens, Crime, and the Community Program be included when the bill reaches conference.

There could be a couple of amendments that have a couple minutes a side to explain prior to the vote. So pending the approval there, I would ask unanimous consent for just a couple of minutes for comments to be connected with the earlier comments I made on the budget. Is that all right?

Mr. HOLLINGS. I wanted to comment with respect to the usual smoke and mirrors of this year's budget. I wish, of course, our distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the distinguished Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], was still in the Chamber because he initiated the actual spectrum auctions discussion for the simple reason that we have pretty well drained the pot there. 
On our last auctions, billions were expected, but we only received millions. Some of those bidding have now been put into receivership and have not responded to their particular bid. So we know now that under this particular agreement, when it calls for some $26.3 billion to come from spectrum actions, we will be lucky to get half of that amount. There again is more smoke and another mirror. 
Specifically, they who designed it agreed that it was smoke and it was a mirror in that they then backed it up with the universal service fund provision. This, of course, is a private fund, gotten together by the particular entities in communications where they measure each month the amount of traffic that they have had and the amount necessary to go into the universal service fund. It is a private fund, and there is a question legally whether you can even account for it. I don't know how CBO would score it, but we know that the agreement between the President and the leadership last evening leaves this space blank. Because, whatever is needed and is not allowed by the Congressional Budget Office in its measurement with respect to spectrum auctions, they then put into that particular blank space, whether it is $3 billion, $4 billion, $5 billion or otherwise. 
The entitlement cuts, of course, are back loaded with 75 percent of the entitlement cuts to occur the last 2 years. And, of course, the most smoke and the biggest mirror of all is using, if you please, pension funds to make the budget appear balanced. Actually, we spend the money out of the pension funds. We spend the money out of Social Security; we spend the money out of the military retirees' fund; we spend the money out of the civil service retirees' fund; we spend money out of the airport and airways trust fund; we spend money out of the highway trust fund, and allocate that in the accounting to what they call a unified budget to make it look or appear balanced. 
That is the most smoke, that is the biggest mirror, that is the biggest shibboleth that is accepted by the free press. I don't know whether those in journalism ever had an arithmetic course, but the question is whether are you spending more than you are getting in each year in Government. At the State level, we measured it more specifically. We had to not only to balance the budget but also have reserves before Moody's and Standard & Poor's and other groups would give us our AAA credit rating. We have that in my particular State, but no such approach is used here at the Federal level. 
They use, continually, the smoke, the mirrors, and the biggest one of all which is to include, by the year 2000, over $100 in trust fund surpluses to make the budget appear balanced. 
So I think this completes my comments on the reality of this particular budget agreement that is called balanced when the very authors themselves know there is no chance of it being balanced. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to thank again the distinguished chairman, Senator Gregg, from New Hampshire. He has worked these issues very hard and studied these programs with great deliberation. He has done a really, really superb job on this State, Justice, and Commerce bill. He has put this bill together in a bipartisan fashion, considering Members' interests from both sides of the aisle. 
You know that is the way appropriations bills have worked in the past. Mr. President, that is the way they are supposed to work. It has enabled us to pass this bill through committee with overwhelming support. It has enabled us to quickly complete action in just a little more than 1 day. And, I believe that this spirit of bipartisanship will be reflected shortly in the vote on final passage. 
Of course, I would also like to recognize the support and guidance from our new Committee Chairman Ted Stevens and his right hand man, our committee staff director Steve Cortese. They are getting the trains to run on time. In fact, we are way ahead of the House, which hasn't even taken up the State, Justice, and Commerce bill. Steve Cortese has taken on the job of running our full Appropriations Committee as well as continuing to serve as staff director of the Defense Subcommittee. That is incredible. And, we, of course, very much appreciate the support of our leader, Senator Byrd and his staff director, Jim English. Senator Byrd and Jim English know these 13 appropriations bills thoroughly. They work tirelessly and continue to watch out for our committee and for our Senate as an institution. 
Mr. President, I would like to take a minute to recognize the subcommittee staff. On the majority side they are led by Jim Morhard. Jim is level headed and experienced. He knows appropriations and how to put together legislation and build consensus. I can tell you that Chairman Stevens and Senator Gregg know they can rely on Jim's counsel. His staff includes Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, Dana Quam, Vasiliki Alexopoulos, and Carl Truscott, who is on detail from the U.S. Secret Service. These individuals have been working night and day putting together this bill. They are all new this year to the subcommittee. Jim Morhard moved over from military construction appropriations; Paddy Link joined us from the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee; and Kevin Linskey worked for the distinguished former leader, Senator Dole. They each bring unique backgrounds and perspectives to their positions. And, they have each had to learn about the agencies and programs in this very diverse and important State, Justice, and Commerce appropriations bill. They have had to be quick studies. They have done a truly outstanding job, and they have done a real service for the committee and the Senate. 
I especially want to recognize Paddy Link for her dedication. I have known Paddy for years. She was, of course, Larry Pressler's chief of staff on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee. She has experience over in the House Science Committee and during the Reagan and Bush administrations Paddy was at Commerce and served as director of legislative affairs at NOAA. During the same week that this bill went before the subcommittee, Paddy's father suffered a severe stroke and tragically passed away. Paddy continued to lend a hand even under such trying circumstances. I think she knows that all the Members' hearts go out to her and her family in their loss. She went far beyond the call of duty to help out in the production of this bill. It is a tribute to her sense of public service and professionalism. 
Finally, I want to recognize the staff on our side. Scott Gudes, our subcommittee staff director, has been with me now for almost 7 years after 4 1/2 years on Defense appropriations. He has been with me so long that I've got him automatically thinking of USC as meaning the University of South Carolina instead of another institution in his native southern California. Karen Swanson Wolf, who is on detail to us from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has been doing a great job for the subcommittee. She has been dealing with justice and judiciary issues, and has been working on patent and trademark issues. And, finally, Emelie East who helps out this subcommittee as well as the Defense, Military Construction and Foreign Operations Subcommittees. Senator Byrd has picked a winner there. Every subcommittee, even the majority staff, keep putting in requests for Emelie to help out in markup, on the floor, and in conference. She is our utility player on the Appropriations Committee going from one bill to another. And, with this bill she will be seeing her fourth get through the Senate and be sent to the House of Representatives. Ms. East is as professional as they get and we all appreciate the outstanding work she does day in and day out. 
So Mr. President, I just wanted to recognize these fine public servants. We don't do that enough around here. I, for one, appreciate their hard work. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, pending the approach to this Chamber of our distinguished chairman and the original sponsors of some amendments, including the Senator from Minnesota, let me note the environment of Santa Claus in July. 
It seems a lot of us are not here this morning. Instead, they are out selling their homes so they can make that $500,000 and go back home and live comfortably. We have the so-called agreement for a balanced budget. What a wonderful instrument. Everyone with a home can make up to $500,000 from this agreement. Couples in the $110,000 bracket and below would get $600. And, of course, the rich will all get richer with the capital gains tax reduction.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it was projected on May 19 by the Congressional Budget Office that the actual deficit for this fiscal year would be $180 billion. Now, I hasten to add that the picture has improved. We find that the revenues are coming in even better than what was originally anticipated. So the actual deficit, if it stays on course, would be down to $140 billion and, if it continues, let's say it would be right at $100 billion next year. That is what I was told this morning by those at the Congressional Budget Office. 
Now, the unified deficit that everyone refers to is down to under $40 billion and could be balanced next year. The term `unified' is, of course, just a shibboleth for, `don't bother, we are just running around spending all the pension funds, which we made illegal in 1990.' We are spending the pension funds to allocate against the deficit itself. 
So what is really happening is that we are on the course, under the unified deficit, toward getting into the black. But it is not on account of passing anything here this week in the midst of this wonderful jubilation atmosphere that everybody won this morning with the agreement last night. The truth of the matter is that we are on course as a result of the 1993 budget plan, whereby we on this side of the aisle, without a single vote on the other side of the aisle, voted for real deficit reduction that worked. I emphasize the fact that it was this side of the aisle, because we were told that if we increased the Social Security tax, they would be hunting us down like dogs in the street and shooting us. I am one of the dogs to be shot in the street. They said that we were going to have a catastrophe and a depression, not just a recession, and all sorts of other things, which were totally off-base. 
Without a single vote on the other side, we cut some $255 billion in spending, increased taxes $241 billion. We increased taxes on the highest income tax bracket. We increased gasoline taxes. We increased Social Security taxes. We eliminated over 250,000 Federal jobs and reduced the size of the Government itself, and it is working. I guess, by way of emphasis, the point is that the thrust here today and last night is to stop the bickering and to show that we can get together. This Senator would say, in the extreme, of course, let's continue the bickering because, with the bickering, we are bound to get, under a unified budget, the Government back into the black. Stay the course. 
In fact, I offered an amendment earlier this year to not cut any taxes and not increase any spending. Now, what has been done in this particular agreement? Well everybody admits we are spending more than $100 billion more than we are taking in. If that's the case, what you want to do is cut spending and increase your revenues. Instead, we increased spending some $52 billion, under this agreement last night, and we cut the revenues--instead of $85 billion, we cut the revenues some $90 billion. 
So, as a result of the 1993 budget agreement and enactment, we are momentarily on course, having reduced the deficit each year for 5 years. Yet you are hearing shouts in the halls that, `this is the first tax cut since 1981.' We ought to say we got the first tax cut since the disaster of 1981, because the result of 1981, of Reaganomics, is that we are still spending over $100 billion more than we are taking in. So we are still in the red. The debt increases, the interest costs increase. So, under this so-called balanced budget agreement, the debt continues to grow, and our Government continues to borrow more and more money. 
We are talking now about how we helped families with the child credit and by cutting taxes, but, in actuality, we have increased the taxes for children because we, the senior citizens, are going to move right along and leave them with the bill. 
My distinguished chairman is here. I will be able to elaborate, Mr. President, in a more appropriate fashion at an appropriate time. I think there ought to be a note of sobriety with the `Santa Claus in July' that we are now experiencing here this morning that everybody won. The truth of the matter is that we have changed course, once again, to cutting taxes and increasing spending. Under a budget of that kind, there is no way for us to get really into the black and start reducing that debt and the carrying charges that are some $285 billion more than back in 1981. We are spending $285 billion more in interest costs than we were in 1981 for absolutely nothing. 
As the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the distinguished Presiding Officer, would realize, if we had that $285 billion, we could satisfy every subcommittee chairman on the 602(b) allocation, we could build many bridges, we could do all the research at NIH we need, we could double the President's request on education; we could have better housing, highways, and everything else of that kind. So that is not the case. I think what we ought to do is look at the reality. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it shows the public debt for the fiscal year 2001 at $6,307,300,000,000, and it shows for fiscal year 2002 the public debt has increased to $6,481,200,000,000, an increase of $173.9 billion. It does not show a balanced budget. It does not show, I emphasize, a balanced budget in the fiscal year 2002. We all know from the agreement last evening that rather than cutting taxes only $85 billion, it was a net tax cut of $90 billion. So we have increased the loss of revenue some $5 billion. We also know that the spending under the particular 1998 budget agreed to last evening increased some $52 billion. 
So what we have done since we made that agreement--and the conference report was adopted last month--is to actually increase spending more, and reduce the revenues more. So we know that come the year 2002, we will not have the first balanced budget in 33 years. The document itself shows it is in deficit because the debt increases that last year. Why will the debt increase if we had a balanced budget? 
It is quite obvious that we have not taken significant steps for the middle class or the working Americans as has been described here. If we really wanted to help working Americans, we could have cut payroll taxes. But the truth of the matter is that we cut capital gains taxes for the rich. We cut the inheritance tax for the rich. So we didn't do it for working Americans. We kept that high payroll tax up. We left out the working Americans, and we agreed on both sides to call it balance, which is a total fraud. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to clarify report language on page 65 concerning the committee's willingness to permit the technology administration to undertake certain international economic development initiatives, particularly as it affects the United States/Israel Science and Technology Commission. I have long been a supporter of the work of the Commission, a binational program that promotes economic and technological collaboration between the United States and Israel that has already provided numerous benefits to both countries. It was not our intention to affect in any way the current or future activities and operations of the Commission, and I would like to clarify with the chairman of the subcommittee that it was not his intention either.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished chairman. 
Mr. President, this Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill is probably the most complicated of the 13 appropriations bills. In it we fund programs ranging from the FBI to our embassies overseas, to fisheries research to the Small Business Administration. It requires a balancing act--considering the priorities of our President, our colleagues here in the Senate, and our Nation, in equitably distributing our subcommittee 602(b) allocation to the many programs in this bill. I think Chairman Gregg has done a masterful job in putting it together, and I support him in bringing this very solid bill before the Senate. 
I would especially like to recognize the majority staff who are all new to this bill--Jim Morhard, Paddy Link, Kevin Linskey, Carl Truscott, and Dana Quam, and our Democratic staff--Scott Gudes, Emelie East, and Karen Swanson-Wolf. They have been working night and day to put together this bill. They have done a truly outstanding job, and have ensured a bipartisan spirit was maintained throughout this entire process. 
In total, this bill provides $31.623 billion in budget authority. That is about half-a-billion dollars below the President's budget request * * * and it is right at our section 602(b) allocation. The bill is $1.4 billion above this year's appropriated levels. 
JUSTICE 
Once again, our bill makes it clear we're not fooling around with Justice and law enforcement priorities. The bill provides appropriations totaling $17.3 billion--an increase of $862 million above last year. Including fees we provide the Department, the total Justice budget comes to $19.3 billion. 
It might be well to note historically that some 10 years ago the bill was right at $4 billion. We in the Congress run around everywhere, `Cut spending, cut spending, cut spending.' If you want to know where the increases in spending occur, you can look at the space program. I followed the thought, of course, of the distinguished Senator from Arkansas--who has been up in space. They say the interest is trying to get Senator John Glenn back in space. My interest is trying to get the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, out of space. He has been up there for 2 days. But he has been doing a masterful job, trying to save moneys there. 
Now, with respect to the Justice Department, the DEA, hundreds of more FBI agents, a new laboratory there, Cops on the Beat, 1,000 more Border Patrol, half a billion more in prisons--we are building prisons. If you haven't gotten a prison in your State, call us; we will be glad to build you one. Because we are not building schools in America, we are building prisons everywhere. So, everybody ought to understand, in the 10-year period under the leadership here of this Congress, trying to cut spending, we have veritably quintupled the Justice Department. 
Of this amount, our Federal Bureau of Investigations, the FBI, is provided $3.1 billion, and we have funded completion of its new laboratory at Quantico as well as $10 million to enhance efforts to combat child pornography on the Internet. 
As, I said, we've made sure the INS will keep our borders secure, by providing an additional, 1,000 Border Patrol agents in the Immigration and Naturalization service. Furthermore, the bill extends section 2451 of the Immigration Act. These fees allow adjustment of status for legal immigrants in the United States and result in the Immigration Service getting almost $200 million per year for border enforcement and combating illegal immigration. This is important to both INS which needs the funding, and the State Department which no longer has the consular officers overseas to provide for adjustment of status in embassies. 
Within the Justice Department, we also provide $1,033 billion for our prosecutors, the U.S. attorneys. That is an increase of $55 million. I'm pleased to note that it provides for activation of the National Advocacy Center to train our Federal and State prosecutors, and it continues State and local violent crime task forces which report to our U.S. attorneys. 
So, looking at the Justice grant programs: the COPS Program is provided $1.4 billion; the local law enforcement block grant is $503 million; $590 million is recommended for State prison grants; $264 million for violence against women grants; $580 million is provided in Byrne grants and; $380 million is provided for juvenile justice programs which is over twice the amount as this year.  
COMMERCE 
On the Commerce Department, the bill provides $4.169 billion for the Commerce Department. That is an increase of $368 million over this year. Within this Department, the bill provides $659 million for the Census, which is an increase of $314 million. This bill does not prohibit statistical sampling, though we will continue to monitor this issue closely. 
We have provided $25 million for the Public Broadcasting facilities grants and have rejected the administration's proposal to terminate this program which assists public television and radio. 
The recommendation includes $200 million for the NIST Advanced Technology Program and $111 million for the Manufacturing Extension Program. So this bill supports the bipartisan budget agreement which specifically made these technology programs a priority. Another program of interest, the International Trade Administration, has been provided with $280.7 million. 
The biggest account in the Department of Commerce, NOAA, has been provided with $2.1 billion. We have included $473 million for Weather Service operations, an increase of $23 million above the request. This ensures that we won't have a repeat of all the problems we have seen this year. LIke cutting the National Hurriance Center. And this bill continues support for the NOAA oceans programs and the NOAA fleet. 
I just attended the commissioning of the most modern research vessel in the fleet, the Ronald H. Brown. I am pleased to report that, rather than the interest up here--310 million miles away whether or not some little instrument ran into a rock--in contrast, the NOAA fleet is out researching seven-tenths of the Earth's surface, the oceans and atmosphere, mapping the ocean floor and harbors and conducting surveys of living marine resources so that the NOAA fleet is alive and well. And we are not going to scuttle it as has been proposed here previously. 
STATE 
In our title for the State Department and international programs, we have included some $4 billion for the Department of State, and have supported the consolidation of our international affairs agencies. We have assigned, again, a priority to the operations and facilities of the State Department, for example we included $105 million to modernize computer and telecommunications systems. 
We have included $100 million for United Nations and peacekeeping arrearages as part of the agreement that was reached with the Administration on the Foreign Relations authorization bill. The recommendation also includes $20 million for renovating housing and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. 
I have just had a conversation with the Ambassador Designate to the Court of Saint James, which has a magnificent residence there. It was done over by Walter Annenberg. It looks like a beauty to me. It doesn't look like it's falling down. But they are going to close it and get into a multimillion-dollar renovation program over 2 years, while they are in squalor in Beijing. 
I can tell you here and now, we have to do something about the Property Division over in that Department of State, so that we can at least have decent housing for those who are willing to sacrifice and lead this Nation's foreign policy, particularly now in the most important nation with respect to foreign affairs, the People's Republic of China. 
There is almost $400 million in the bill for international broadcasting, $200 million for international exchanges. That is the first time, of course, Mr. President, that the Fulbright and other exchanges have gotten an increase. It should be noted that no funds are included for the National Endowments for Democracy, and the distinguished chairman and I are well able to defend that particular initiative now. I imagine we will be hearing from our colleagues with an amendment. But if they want to bring this up and talk about pork, I never heard of worse ones--although we have had it. This Senator at one time opposed it; at one time supported it at the request--at the fall of the wall. We didn't have an entity that could really bring newspapers and printing presses and election fliers for democratic elections where in countries they had never held a democratic election. It looked to me it might be an exception. 
The Department of State, we ought not to be embarrassed, the Department of State ought to be, really, about its front-line position, now, with the fall of the wall, in promoting democracy, individual rights, and the American way the world around. And we need not fund the chairman of the Democratic Party, the chairman of the Republican Party, the Chamber of Commerce and the AFL. I think that here we can make a savings of several million dollars. 
Mr. President, this is a good bill. I support it. We have had to make some tough decisions, but under the leadership of Senator Gregg, I think we have made the proper decisions. It is nice to have worked on this State, Justice, Commerce bill, and I urge my colleagues to join in its passage. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am reminded of a little ditty they used to have on the radio each Saturday morning for my children: `All the way through life, make this your goal; keep your eye on the donut and not the hole.' 
The distinguished Senator from Kansas is really, with this amendment, trying to reduce it to a corporate welfare program. The goal, and the eye ought to be on it, was commercialization of our technology, not research. In fact, the research arm of the Defense Department, DARPA as we call it, which has billions of dollars that come over--Greg Fields, working with the National Institutes of Standards and Technology--this is now back in the late seventies because I authored this particular program--in the late seventies in talking with Mr. Fields and the authorities at the National Bureau of Standards, at the time we called it, found that we had all kinds of technology backed up in research at the National Bureau of Standards on the civilian side that was not being commercialized. In fact, what they call the rapid acquisition of manufacturing parts--it is a wonderful type program--was developed and came really out of the Bureau of Standards. A ship broke down in the Persian Gulf that was 25 years of age, and they weren't making the parts anymore, so the ship couldn't function. 
It took several months or a year to get the part back out to get the ship moving again and everything else. 
The computerization and manufacturing at the defense level of all parts are immediately on the board. Within days, they knew how to punch the computer, get the particular manufacturer, get the part back and going again. That came out of the Department of Commerce that my distinguished colleague has been bent on trying to abolish. 
Back to the commercialization. In the late 1970s, down in Houston, TX, they developed the superconductor, and right to the point, with the research initiative, these particular scientists won the Nobel Prize. But the actual commercialization was caused by our Japanese friends who correlated some 22 entities and immediately started developing and commercializing it. Oh, yes, the American scientists won the Nobel Prize; the Japanese entrepreneurs won the profits. 
We are going out of business in this country. This has nothing to do with small companies or large companies. The staff, of course, has provided me--but I do not want to get into that because I support DARPA very much. But if we had this particular amendment and it took, then we could put it to DARPA and all other research over in the Defense Department, and then we could grind research to a halt. Because the reality is that the larger companies do have the better research entities. And the larger research companies also have the stock-market-turnaround, get-in-the-black, get-your-stock-increase kind of pressure. 
Talk to the CEO of AT&T, a multibillion dollar company. One of the largest corporations ever in the world is in trouble because the chairman that they had momentarily, barely a year, could not turn it around and get it into the black and get it going. He is gone. 
Now, Senator Danforth and I, working on this commercialization, said now we are not going to have welfare and we are not going to have pork. So we put in unusual safeguards which this Senator from South Carolina has had to fight personally to maintain. 
One safeguard coming with the particular research endeavor was that we had to have this particular request approved, bucked right over to the National Academy of Engineering, and saying, `Wait a minute. Does this really contribute to the Nation's particular research?' We did not just want company research to increase the profits of a particular company; we wanted a research endeavor that meant something to the basic research technology advancement of the United States of America. This is a national program; it is not a welfare program; it is not a corporate-profit program. 
So this is No. 1. The corporation has to come with at least 50 percent of its money. They have to have upfront money they are willing to put in, then bucked over to the National Academy of Engineering for its approval on a national basis, then going back for a third particular test of competition of which were the most deserving because this has been very, very, very limited. 
Look at our agricultural boards. They have multimillions in there for California raisins and `Don't drink the wine before its time,' Gallo, and all of those other things. The farm boys around here know how to get things done, but the technology boys are out researching and making money and continuing to research. Then, like GE coming through my office and saying, `We don't have time to turn this particular around,' so go sell it to the Saudis because they have the money and they can develop it. 
Mr. President, 15 years ago, I put in a bill to cut out the quarterly reporting. That is one of the real bad devices--all this quarterly reporting. The market is going up; the market is going down. Greenspan says something, it goes up billions, it goes down billions, costs or whatever it is. We have to understand the global competition has to steady the boat in this land financially. One of the great initiatives to have it steadied is to do away with quarterly reports. 
We all fault the American entrepreneur and corporate leader in 
saying, oh, he won't invest in the long range. Our Japanese competition, they know how. In Korea, Japan, the competition in the Pacific rim, they get long-range planning. The American corporate head cannot do it under this structure. He has to get in and somehow take the best profits, the bigger profits, go for it. You might have a technology, but if it takes over 3 years, forget it, `We don't have time. We don't have the money. Sell it to somebody else, get a joint venture with the Germans or the Brits or whatever it is.' 
We are exporting our technology. And the security of the United States of America depends on our superiority of technology. We do not have as many Americans as they do Chinese. Someday we are going to find that out, Mr. President. 
Running around with a little boat in the Taiwan Straits, I was on one of those aircraft carriers up in the Gulf of Tonkin 30 years ago. We did not stop 30 or 40 million little North Vietnamese coming down the Ho Chi Minh trail. I do not know how, with a couple of these boats in the Straits of Taiwan, that we are going to stop 1.2 billion Chinese. So we better sober up in this land, emphasize our technology, get it developed. That is the thrust of the Advanced Technology Program. 
So we had all the tests. Like I had commented, I had personally taken it on over on the House side. We had a distinguished colleague over on the House side that every time we got to the State, Justice conference, he wanted to write up one of these particular programs for himself. I said, `This is not corporate welfare. This is not pork. We're going to stand by.' We held this bill up in conference for weeks on this one particular point, that it was not corporate welfare, it was not pork. It was a studied program to commercialize, develop, and commercialize the technology that we could get financed. It is a solid program with strong bipartisan support. 
Mr. President, I remember when we had the particular--if you can remember. I can hardly remember when the Republicans were in a minority, but there was a day. It was just about 4 years ago. They had a Republican task force in the U.S. Senate at that time chaired by the distinguished majority leader, Senator Dole. They had over a dozen Senators endorse this program as it is, which includes, of course, our distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott; the former Secretary of the Navy, Senator Warner; the chairman now of our Appropriations Committee, Senator Ted Stevens; the chairman of our Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch--you can go right on down the list--the chairman of our Budget Committee, Senator Domenici; and others. 
I just want the distinguished colleague and friend that I have here from Kansas to understand coming over from the House side with that Walker disease--we had a fellow over there named Bob Walker from Pennsylvania who just took on a personal kind of vendetta against doing anything about commercialization or development of technology or research except in his district. He held up the authorization for this particular measure for several years. Now it has been passed over on the House side. I thank the distinguished Republican leadership for passing that authorization bill and do not want to stultify it now by resolving it into big-little, 2 1/2 billion or whatever it is. 
I can tell you here how they move on these large entities here. They move on and do not put the money to it. They sell it. I can give you example after example where I have worked with them in this particular field, and they come by the office and say, `I am headed to so and so just for a joint venture. I will just take it to Japan and get a 49-51 deal. At least I can get my money back out to do some more research.' But this has been draining, veritably, the security--not just the technology, but the security--of the United States of America. 
It is a well-conceived program, well-administered, just updated by our distinguished Secretary of Commerce. He has come along. I do not have the exact breakdown. I wish I had the Fortune 500 approach. We know about half of it goes to small 
companies. I have no objection to it going to small companies. I just have a distaste and would have to vote against that kind of division because if this kind of thing sells, then we are going to begin the big-little and it is really going to miss out on some very, very valued technological programs. 
I have example after example that we could get in. I see other Senators wanting to speak. But the point here is, big, little, small, or otherwise, you have to first put up some money, at least half of it. You have to have it reviewed nationally. Some of the smaller companies, they are engaged in research, but they are not engaged in basic research. The smaller companies, by their very nature, only have the moneys for their particular endeavor, their particular profits. Therefore, they do not come. We tried to get the small companies going because that is where jobs are created, trying to get small business. We have a specific program for that. We have in here the Small Business Administration program in Senator Gregg's bill right here and now. So we take care of that when it comes to small business. 
I know the administration, under Secretary Daley and his particular study here that we could put in the Record, says let us give even again more emphasis to it and require more than the 50 percent from the larger corporations. That particular guideline would be good. I would have hoped that the gentleman would have come with a sense of the Senate to confirm that guideline. But to actually put in law this initiative begins to develop in the minds of everyone that this is a welfare program and what we are trying to do is finance research. 
We are not trying to finance research at all. We are trying to finance the development and commercialization of already established research. That really comes for the more affluent larger corporations. They come in with the great innovations because they have basic research. The small company--incidentally, I do not know that I have any--of course, down in my home State it is not welfare. I do know this. 
In the debate, it ought to be understood that I had my textile folks come to me and they said that they had a technology program and they knew that I had been the father of the Advanced Technology Program, the ATP, and the manufacturing extension centers. So they said, `We need your help over at Commerce to get this particular'--it had a computerization of the supplies coming in and going out so they would not end up with a warehouse full of bluejeans that they could not sell, whatever it was. Mind you me, I said, No. 1, `I'll not call over there.' I never have called over there to talk to a Secretary about it. `This is not pork. It's not corporate welfare.' I told that to my own textile leaders. 
Mr. President, you know what they did? They went out to Livermore Labs, through the Energy Department, and got started a $350 million program in textile research. You see, with the closedown, fall of the wall and the closedown of some of the defense research and what have you, to keep Energy's budget livable and alive, they said, `Sooey, pig. You all come. We've got money. Anybody that can do it, we are ready to go.' 
That is what happened. They did not qualify at the National Academy of Engineering for this computerization. It was an advancement. It would have helped out my home industry and that kind of thing, but it had nothing to do with the overall commercialization of a national kind of research unique to the security of the United States itself. So it was turned down. 
So we ought to be looking now and do not start this particular kind of initiative for defense, because we have the large companies here that do all--we put this under research in the Defense Department. United Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Texas Instruments, IBM, MIT, Hughes Aircraft, Carnegie Mellon, Northrop Grumman, Loral, Honeywell, GE. I can go down the list of millions and millions and millions. If this particular applied, I can tell you you would not get any defense research, you would not be getting the F-22, the advanced plane, and others of that kind that have come on now to maintain the national defense of the United States. 
So I hope that colleagues will understand the genesis of ATP, the practical reality of financing and developing and commercializing the research. The large corporations who developed the unique research in this land of ours can make more money elsewhere, and they have been doing it like gangbusters by exporting it right and left everywhere, and we have been losing out. And we are wondering why we still have a deficit in the balance of trade. 
We have gone and manufactured the actual production and commercialization. We have gone from 26 percent of our work force, 10 years ago, and manufactured down to 13 percent. Oh, yes, we are getting the software, we are getting the wonderful jobs at McDonald's and the other hamburger places and the laundries. But the actual production and high-paying jobs are going elsewhere. We are exporting them as fast as we can. We ought not to toy around with the solid nature of the Advanced Technology Program. It is not pork. It is not corporate welfare. The distinguished Senator has come up with an arithmetic formula, and if we begin to apply that to research in America, we are gone goslings. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, once again, we tried to go to the fundamental that a $2.5 billion company does not have the ability to develop it or to pursue it or to commercialize it. 
Now, why doesn't it have that ability? I emphasize, of course, the way the market and the financing of projects works. You have to have a quick turnaround. A lot of good, fundamental research technology is not developed and not commercialized in the United States for the simple reason that the market financing infrastructure does not allow it. 
If you were chairman of the board, then we would see how long you last unless you turn around and get your stock up. And that is the name of the game in America. And they all have to play it. When they get a choice of anything beyond 2 or 3 years, then obviously the board members, everybody wants to look like good guys and making money and everything else for the stockholders. The pressure is there to go ahead and export it, get an arrangement, a split arrangement with any of the other countries that would want to try to develop it. That is our global competition. 
Specifically, right here, in Business Week: 
To stay in the game, Singapore is stepping up its industrial subsidies. 
In September, the Government announced it will pump $2.85 billion over the next 5 years into science and technology development including research and development grants for multinationals. 
No small business. I am trying to get my friend from Kansas to understand we have got the Small Business Administration. We take care of small business. We favor small business. But what we are looking at, to keep the eye on the target, is the development and commercialization of technology. And small business, if they went with good research that could really be proven to the SBA, they would get total financing right now. They would get it underwritten under the SBA technology grants. We worked that program far more than the little $200 million in this particular endeavor. They have over $800 million in grant authorization for small business. 
Please, my gracious, let us go with it. Global competition is such that the smallest of the small competitor, Singapore, recently helped fund a $51 million research development facility for whom? For Sony, a $2.5 billion corporation: 
Last month Lucent Technologies received a grant for a new communications research and development endeavor. 
I could go on down reading these articles. I wish everybody in the National Government would be given a book by Eamonn Fingleton entitled `Blind Side.' We have all been running around and talking about the bank problems in Japan and, oh, Japan has all kinds of problems, and they really have their back up against the wall; they are not any competition any longer. 
The fact is, Mr. President, last year while we had a 2.5 percent growth with the market booming. A rebirth in America, we have the strongest economy, Greenspan says he's never seen such a thing, 2.5-percent growth, Japan had 3.6 percent growth. 
The name of the game is market share, market share. They are copying it off right and left. And at this moment, this very moment, for example, the great big automaker, United States of America, exports less cars than Mexico. Mark it down. You are 
down there in that area, Mr. President. Mexico exports more automobiles than the United States of America. 
I just helped break ground for Honda in Timmonsville, SC. Who exports more cars than any other entity in America? Honda; the Japanese. Not General Motors, not Ford, not Chrysler. Honda. 
When are we going to wake up to what's going on? Market share. If you read Fingleton's book, you go to the Ministry of Finance. Don't worry about MITI, go to the Ministry of Finance and you get your financing, your large corporations. 
Now, please, my gracious, I am for the little man. I am a Democrat. Heavens above. We know the large corporate welfare crowd. But we have been for the little man against hunger. I just voted to take $5 million off administration in the Department of Agricultural budget to get more lunchroom programs. So don't talk about corporate welfare and try to identify. We are talking about global competition, which, frankly, the White House doesn't even understand. 
You know why I say that. We had a course on Tuesday on NAFTA, North American Free-Trade Agreement, where we brought in Mexico in 1994, and we were going to have a sort of update on how it was doing, whether it was a success or not. They wouldn't even send an administration witness to the senatorial committee, and that's why they called off the particular hearing. They are embarrassed that they said we would create 200,000 jobs. We have lost 300,000. I will show you the Department of Labor statistics. We have lost in textiles and apparel 231,000 alone. So instead of increasing it in one direction, we have decreased it in the other direction; we have been exporting fine, good-paying jobs in the particular industry that predominates my own State. They said, well, we are going to increase trade. We had a plus balance of trade of $5 billion and we have gone to a $16 billion minus balance. 
And they say exports, exports. Well, exports are up. We are sending parts down there to be assembled into automobiles and the good automobile manufacturer is moving to Mexico. You would, too. I do not blame them. I blame us, you and me. This is the policy. In manufacturing, a third of your operating costs goes into labor, to payroll, and you can save as much as 20 percent by moving to an offshore, or down in Mexico, low wages and little or no worker or environmental protections. 
When I say no particular protections, colleagues are running around on this Senate floor saying you have to have a minimum wage, you have to have clean air and clean water and plant closing and parental leave, Social Security, Medicare, occupational safety from hazard, and up and down the list. Whoopee, yea, we are great. And then we put in a policy that says you don't have to do any of that. You can go offshore for 58 cents an hour. Did you see the program on Mexico just last night on public television? 
Come on. We are losing the jobs right and left. We are losing our technology right and left. Eamonn Fingleton in his book--and I called him just the other day because he has updated it now with a paperback--projected by 2000 we would be blind-sided. Today, Japan, a country as big as the State of California, manufactures more than the great United States of America. It has a greater manufacturing output. And otherwise by the year 2000 it will have a greater gross domestic product, a larger economy, and I will bet you on it. And I want them to come here and take the bets because I believe he is right. You can just see how the market share goes. You see how the GDP goes and everything else of that kind. 
We are going out of business the way of Great Britain. They told the Brits at the end of World War II, the empire was breaking up, they said don't worry about it. Instead of a nation of brawn, we will be a nation of brains; instead of producing products, provide services, a service economy. Instead of creating wealth with manufacturing we are going to become a financial center. 
And England today, Mr. President--I have the distinguished President's attention--England, the United Kingdom has less of an economy than little irrelevant Ireland. Mark it down. Read the 
Economist just a month ago. Yes, Ireland, now bigger, economically than the United Kingdom. All they have is a debating society. London is a downtown amusement park. 
Come on. Are we going to head that way as we go out of business, continue to appropriate again more and more moneys and finance our campaigns with these false promises of `I am going to cut taxes.' Oh, the Post is running around: `Are you for cutting taxes? Yes, I'm for cutting taxes.' You cannot cut your and my taxes today without increasing our children's taxes tomorrow. We have deficit financing. 
We will get into that debate again when they bring the reconciliation bill over. It is not the Chinese trying to get into our elections. If they want to get into our elections, do as the Japanese do. Pat Choate wrote the book, `The Agents of Influence,' 7 years ago. One hundred Japanese law firms, consultants here in Washington paid over $113 million. Add up the pay of the Senators and Congressmen, the 535 Members of Congress, and boy, oh, boy, you get, about $71.3 million. The Japanese in Washington by way of pay are better represented than the people of America. 
When are we going to wake up? Tell the Chinese, `For Heaven's sake, to do the same thing as the Japanese. Give it to a lawyer. Tell them to come around and find some lawyers. 
But, no, we want to turn this into corporate welfare, show that we fought against corporate welfare. Absolute folly. There is no corporate welfare at all in this. It is, by gosh, trying to commercialize technology and we will not face up to the reality. We are going out of business and now we want to say to those who do the general research, the unique research, that there is no reason to try and get into anything marginal that is going to take over 3 years to develop. Sell it, move on to the next thing. Let us continue the outflow of business, the outflow of jobs, the outflow of technology, and the outflow of our security. And everybody comes around and says that's a good idea. 
I think, to the President's credit, it ought to be emphasized that he put this program down as a quid pro quo in the leadership agreement. Now, the agreement has been on both sides of the aisle, the Democratic and Republican agreement, the White House and the congressional agreement that the Advanced Technology Program would be funded at this particular level and in the manner in which it is currently funded. What we are being asked for in this particular amendment is to violate that agreement. We are running right into a veto situation on a small matter while trying to make it appear as corporate welfare. The opponents of this program don't tell you about the National Academy of Engineering. You show me another grant program that has to be reviewed that way. 
I wish we still had Senator Danforth here because he and I worked on this thing over the years to develop the bill's credibility, but now we are going to start tearing down its credibility, by changing it into a small business program for those small companies that can't afford to really commercialize their technology. They can't afford to engage in general research, or in unique research to begin with, on account of its small nature. They just don't have the labs and facilities that the large companies do. But we want to act as political animals up here, pollster politicians and so we are for tax cuts, when we go up and continue to increase the debt. 
We have been reducing the deficit each year for 5 years. 
Now we are going to use the public till to run around and say we are going to cut revenues while we increase, and we are going to have to go out and borrow the money to do it, because we are in the red. We are not in the black. So we will take that multitrillion-dollar debt and interest costs of $1 billion a day and increase that for nothing. 
In the last 16 years we have increased the debt from less than $1 trillion to $5.4 trillion without the cost of a single war. Mr. President, in 200 years of history with the cost of all the wars we have not even reached a trillion. Now we jump to $5.4 trillion and instead of $75 billion--$74.8 billion, to be exact, we are going to up to $365 billion, $1 billion a day. That extra $285 billion, we are spending it for nothing. And there are all these fellows talking about pork and welfare and getting rid of the waste, and using that rhetoric for their reelection next year. 
`I am against taxes, I am against the Government, get rid of the Government.' That's the big hoopla they have going on, on the other side of the Hill. They are now tasking the leadership of the contract to get rid of the Department of Commerce, to get rid of the Advanced Technology Program, to get rid of all the Government that pays for itself and keeps us secure and keeps us superior as a nation. So now they are going against jobs, against the security of the land, and for corporate welfare, based on this amendment. They say, just on account of the $2.5 billion measure, that `the corporation has the ability to pursue it,' their exact words. Yet, everyone knows that the CEO's do not have the ability if they are going to be a good corporate head. They are going to put their moneys elsewhere because where the turnaround is, there also is the competition, and they also know that the other governments are financing not only the research but development and taking over the market share. 
We are going to holler, `let market forces, let market forces'--well, let's look at the market that we developed here in the National Government, through measures such as minimum wage, plant closings, clean air, clean water--which we all vote for, Republican and Democrat. But the companies say, `You don't have any of that in global competition.' In addition, they are financing it like we finance research for the aircraft industry. 
They have learned from the United States. We finance Boeing, we are proud of them. They produce and ship planes globally. Thank God we still have one industry. Now, however, we have shipped the technology on the FSX to Japan, and Boeing has had to move the parts manufacturing into the People's Republic of China. We are beginning to lose that segment of manufacturing. We are losing the automobile industry. Now we are going to lose the aerospace industry. 
They told me years ago, `Hollings, what's the matter with you? Let the developing nations, the Third World, make the textiles and the shoes and we will make the airplanes and the computers.' Now our competition in the global competition is making the airplanes and the computers and the textiles and the shoes and we are running around here jabbering about, `free trade, free trade, free trade, let market forces, let market forces, let market forces,' and don't have any realization of the actual market forces that we, as politicians, created. 
I hope this amendment will be defeated in consonance with the overall agreement of the leadership in the Congress and the White House on the one hand--and defeated based on common sense and competition on the other hand. 
I know my distinguished colleague on the other side of the aisle, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Senator Frist, has been leading now, in our committee. He has been holding hearings, and has been providing leadership on addressing the issues relating to the Advanced Technology Program. I know the others that are interested in this program, including those that I have listed--trying to emphasize, by the way, that this effort is bipartisan. Senator Danforth and I worked this out 10 years ago, and the program is working. It is working well. We need more money. 
Thousands and thousands of qualified grants still don't receive funding. 
I asked, I say, does the Senator from Kansas have the documentation where small business really applied but the big companies got the award? If that occurred we would have it here. He said these little businesses are being denied. I know the Commerce Department, Secretary Daley. I know the administration of this particular program and they look for the small business in order to sustain the credibility and support of the program because since its beginnings, critics have been watching the Advanced Technology Program closely for the simple reason they don't understand. They think, `Well, get rid of the Government. Find out where the pork is. Find out where the welfare is. Characterize it as welfare. Say you have these big Fortune 500 companies, they have $2.5 billion so they can do it.' And they don't understand what they are talking about. 
It is a sad day when we even propose an amendment of this kind, because it shows that we really don't understand competition, although we keep running around like parrots, `Competition, competition, competition.' We are the ones with these kind of amendments that destroy competition. 
We are against welfare but we are the ones with these kind of amendments that create welfare. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you know now why, in my opening statement on this particular measure, I said I was so enthused about working with the distinguished chairman, the Senator from New Hampshire--he laid it on the line. Last December we had a NATO conference in Paris whereby we elected the distinguished Senator from Delaware the president of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council. Senator Roth is now the president. 
Pamela Harriman, the distinguished Ambassador, was there, and she knew that I was ranking member and had been the chairman. The word had gotten around of our attempt to try to bring the State Department from the Third World into the first world. I am aghast here that those who chaired foreign relations would put in such an amendment, to tell you the truth. I feel just as strongly as the Senator from New Hampshire. Because Pamela Harriman came to me and said, `Can I meet you in the morning?' Then we met for the entire morning. We spent the morning together. 
Exactly what the Senator from New Hampshire said was pointed out. Although the Embassy in Paris was nice, their equipment was outdated. Their computers were totally obsolete. They couldn't even get replacement parts for it. Their communications had broken down. They had a premier facility, an embassy, with hundreds of Americans coming in daily--I don't know how you handle a post of that size--but I wouldn't even volunteer for it. It wouldn't be an honor; it would really be a drag, because trying to keep up with national policy while dealing with the visiting firemen and repairmen and all the other problems, the problems that ensue in a wonderful city like Paris. It is really hard work--she was doing an outstanding job. I said to her--the Assistant Secretary, Dick Moose, who used to head up our Foreign Relations Committee, and I have been trying to increase funding for the capital account to modernize telecommunications, to modernize computerization and other equipment in hopes of doing all the good things that the distinguished Senator from Kentucky says that NED does. 
Let's assume it is true, and I can tell you, I opposed this in the very beginning and then finally said, `I'm wasting my breath.' The one time I actually supported it was when the current Secretary of State, the distinguished Secretary Albright, came to me and said, 
We've got an election in Budapest, Hungary, and we can buy some old printing presses out in Indiana and print up voting bills to be handed out and ballots to help conduct an election. 
Now everyone is bothered about foreign governments trying to influence our elections? Heavens above, the other day we had, I think, 99 votes commending Mexico on its elections because it was the first time the United States stayed out. 
We have been funding activities through Wall Street or otherwise down there with the PRI. That is a big financial fix. Paying off the Mexican debt was just a refinancing. Nothing went to the Mexican people. It all went back up to the banks on Wall Street. It is time we sober up and understand. My colleagues should get the American Chamber of Commerce report in Mexico City 60 days ago and see what it says: Unemployment is down, the economy is down and the forecast is no recovery for several years to come. NAFTA hasn't worked. It has worked for the financial crowd, and it has worked for those who want to export the industrial backbone of America. 
I reviewed, as a member of the Hoover Commission in the fifties, the Central Intelligence Agency. That was our primary function. I can see Sonny Purfoy in the Guatemala election. I can see him in the Greek election. His job was to run elections the world around. 
So the Chinese learned to do a little bit of that, and now we are going to have a big Federal program and spend millions of dollars, all to get on national TV to express our horror and surprise. Mature individuals ought to quit acting like children, and let's move on and let's get the work of the Government done. Now that is what I want to speak about, the work of the Government, namely the State Department. 
Assume everything said by the distinguished Senator from Indiana, everything said by the distinguished Senator from Kentucky is absolutely true and ought to be done without apology by the Department of State. What is wrong with that? What is wrong is under communism, we said, `Well, we couldn't do that.' We always apologized because of our democracy and our freedom and our individual rights. 
The Department of State ought to be around as the foremost lead organization, not the Department of Defense, now with the fall of the wall. We ought to be selling democracy. To Secretary Christopher's credit, he finally got them doing business. 
I started back 37 years ago as Governor of South Carolina. I went down in Rio de Janeiro and, like the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Chairman Helms, I thought of them in that same vein. Why? Because the United States Ambassador, standing up with the Governor of Guana Bera, in the Embassy in Rio in Brazil, reached over into my glass and pulled the ice out of it and threw it on the floor and said, `Don't drink that, Governor, the ice is dirty in this country.' How do you think I felt? I said, `That fellow doesn't have any manners.' But a lot has happened in 37 years. 
Our Department of State has outstanding personnel the world around, and they are trying to work in the business field to help spread capitalism. In my opinion that is what really prevailed with the fall of the wall. It wasn't the CIA or anything else. It was capitalism. I served on the Intelligence Committee, and they never briefed us that the wall was about to fall. 
So be that as it may, let's bring our Department of State in and put in a billion more. They gave a billion more in foreign aid and less to the Department of State. The distinguished chairman, the Senator from New Hampshire, comes around and finds some money here, and we put it in the infrastructure to try to build up the Department of State. We come around and we have a crowd that says, `No, the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, the AFL-CIO, the chamber of commerce'--now, by gosh, they have their minions all 
over this Capital City, and so they can fix the vote and tell what wonderful work it does. Well, if it is wonderful work, let's let the Department of State, without embarrassment or apology, perform it. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to convey my strong support for the Stamp Out Breast Cancer Act, H.R. 1585. I may have created confusion on this point by voting last week against an amendment offered by my friend Senator Feinstein of California when the Senate was considering the Treasury-Postal Service-general Government appropriations bill. I was concerned about initial reports that the Postal Service would have technical problems raising the projected funds. However, passage of today's legislation both solves those problems and properly authorizes the program. As a supporter of the war on cancer 26 years ago and the author of the pilot program which grew into the Centers for Disease Control's breast and cervical cancer screening program, I am very pleased to see this legislation enacted. The bottom line is that we need public awareness and research funds, and this legislation provides both. Again, I commend my friend Senator Feinstein for her energetic efforts on this front and am pleased to support this bill.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in the bill before us, we have in there something called the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 1997. It is hidden in the back of the bill within the general provisions, but boy, does it have great import. This language asks us to split the ninth circuit court into two circuits--the ninth circuit would include California, Guam, Nevada, and the Northern Mariana Islands while the twelfth circuit would include Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington. Needless to say, I am certain my friends from these States will have something to say about this matter. 
While there will be Senators here to talk about the pros and cons of splitting this ninth circuit court, I would like to say to my colleagues that this is neither the time nor place to be talking about this issue at all. As far as I can tell, this is a matter that belongs in the most able hands of our Judiciary Committee. This is not a money matter. This is true and true new authorization language that has no place being on our appropriations bill. 
In our full committee mark of the bill, Senators Reid and Boxer asked the committee to create a commission to study the state of all the circuits and make recommendations according to the big picture. The rationale behind this is to let the experts who know and understand our circuit courts tell us what they think before we do anything drastic. Expanding Federal caseloads is a nationwide problem requiring a nationwide solution. We can't sit here on our appropriations bill and pretend to be experts as to what's best for the ninth circuit or all the circuit courts, especially without ever having any hearings on the topic, and especially not knowing how much our decision will cost us. Believe me, splitting the ninth circuit court will without a doubt incur upon us additional costs that we haven't even begun to predict. 
So I urge my chairman and my colleagues to listen when I say that this issue must go. We need to give this to the Judiciary Committee where I have confidence they will make an informed and thorough decision in a field that is theirs and theirs alone.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator will yield. The Senator from Rhode Island has done a valuable service to the Senate in bringing this to our attention. The FCC has just promulgated a rule relative to slamming just this past week. This sense-of-the-Senate resolution is consistent with it, in the sense that it would require the mandating of the evidence itself, civil fines, and a civil right of action. I think it really emphasizes the concern that all of us have had in the communications field of this particular malpractice. I hope we can help, with this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, emphasize the need to expedite the rulemaking on the part of the FCC. I thank the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island and I join in his resolution.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, NECA is the National Exchange Carriers Association. Mr. President, this association was formed at the breakup of AT&T back in 1984, and it is a private entity, whereby the different carriers, through their trade associations, self-impose, in an intermittent fashion, the amounts due and owing in order to constitute what we call the universal service fund. It is a private entity. There is no Federal law that says you can be a member or shall be a member or you cannot be a member. It is not under the Federal law; it is under this particular entity that it was associated with and together at that particular time of the breakup. 
It depends on the volume of business, obviously. If you get a greater volume and more burdens and so forth--for high-cost areas is really what it was for, initially. It is now being extended to rural, being extended for the schools and the hospitals. But the high-cost areas are being taken care of under this universal service fund. 
Mr. President, what we are seeing here--and I hope the conferees on reconciliation get the message--this is the epitome of the national loot. In 1994, this Congress passed, President Clinton signed into law the Pension Reform Act. Under that Pension Reform Act, it provided certain penalties, whereby you can't loot the pension funds of the particular corporate America. They wanted to make sure that a person in this particular corporation who had worked over the years and everything else, didn't have a newcomer in a merger or buyout or whatever it is, abscond with all the moneys and all of a sudden your pension was gone. 
Now, it so happens that in the news here, about 6 weeks ago, now 8 weeks ago, that a famous American, Denny McLain, the all-time all-star pitcher, I think it was, for the Detroit Tigers, became a president of the corporation and he used the corporate pension fund in violation of law to pay the company's debt, and he was promptly sentenced to an 8-year jail sentence. We do it at the Federal level and get the good Government award. 
We loot the Social Security pension fund, the Medicare trust fund, the civil service pension trust fund, the military retirees' trust fund. They even had in the reconciliation bill --and I put in an amendment--the looting of the airport and airways improvement fund, whereby the moneys that are supposed to go to the improvement of the airways instead is going to the deficit. 
Now the cabal, the conspiracy that they call a conference committee has the unmitigated gall to provide as follows, and I read: 
The Senate recedes to the House with modifications. 
3006 of this title provides that expenditures from the universal service fund under part 54 of the Commission's rules for the fiscal year 2002 shall not exceed the amount of revenue to be collected for that fiscal year, less [blank] billion dollars. 
Section 3006(B) further provides that any outlays not made from the universal service fund in fiscal year 2002 under subsection (A) are immediately available commencing October 1, 2002. 
The conferees note that this subsection shall not be construed to require the amount of revenues collected under part 54 of the Commission's rules to be increased. 
What in the world, how else is it going to be done? If you take the amount of the funds necessary to keep universal service constant, less X billion dollars or million dollars, whatever, that they want to fit in here for a budget fix, then the companies and the associations through their companies that make the contributions are going to have to immediately either cut out the service under the service fund and the rules and regulations of the entity that controls it or raise the rates, and then the politicians will all run around saying, `I'm against taxes, I'm against rate increases,' when they are causing it in a shameful, shameless way in this particular provision and not even put in the amount. They have a blank here, and they are going to fill in the amount, and it is another smoke and another mirror and another loot. 
Oh, yes, wonderful. We pass overwhelmingly the Pension Reform Act to make sure that it is a trust and it can be depended upon, and here, in the very same Congress, we come around and we loot all the particular funds, and now we find a private one. Maybe they will get the Brownback fund before they get through, if they can find it, and add that to it, too. They can get anybody's fund and put something down in black and white and they say, `Oh, what good boys we are. We put in our thumb and pulled out a plum, and we balance the budget.' 
Turn to page 4 on the conference report on a so-called balance budget agreement and report for the 5-year period terminating fiscal year 2002, and on page 4, line 15, the word is not `balance,' the word is `deficit,' $173.9 billion deficit. 
Yet, the print media--I am glad this is on C-SPAN so the people within the sound of my voice can at least hear it, because they are not going to print it--the media goes along with the loot, and then they wonder why the budget is not balanced. If we only level with the American people, they would understand you can't cut taxes without increasing taxes. 
We have increased the debt with that particular shenanigan to the tune now of $5.4 trillion with interest costs on the national debt of $1 billion a day. So when you cut down more revenues to pay, you increase the debt, you increase the interest costs, so you get reelected next year, because I stood for tax cuts, but they won't tell them that with the child tax cut that they have actually increased the tax for the child. Now that is at least in the Congressional Record in black and white. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute Mr. Hanley Norment, a great civil rights leader and dedicated family man who died Thursday, July 10, 1997. 
In 1966, Hanley James Norment came to Washington and a year later, he became a civil rights officer with the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. About that time, he started volunteering on the local level, rising from director of media relations to president of the Montgomery County branch of the NAACP. Mr. Norment's political and professional successes were a direct measure of his character. He was an unselfish man, one who put aside the personal for the common good. As his son, Julian, commented, Regardless of philosophical differences, he got along with you, he respected your opinions. 
Throughout the course of his career as a civil rights leader, Hanley Norment relentlessly championed educational causes, pushing for higher standards and equal opportunities for all children, regardless of race. He knew firsthand the value of a good education. Born in Marianna, AR on January 16, 1932, to Ruby and Samuel Norment, Hanley received his early education in the Arkansas public school system in the Jim Crow era. Undaunted by the circumstances of time and place, Norment earned two B.A. degrees and nearly finished a doctoral degree in political science at the University of Michigan. He used his talents and knowledge generously. For more than 20 years, he tutored individual students through various organizations such as the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and the NAACP. 
Mr. Norment was extremely proud of the contributions of his wife, Christa, former principal of Montgomery Knolls Elementary School in Silver Spring, MD, to the field of education. Their children, Camille and Julian, continue the family tradition of academic achievement and public service. Camille is pursuing her second master's degree at New York University and I am proud to have Julian working on my Washington staff. The fruit does not fall far from the tree. 
Mr. Norment retired in September as director of the Office of Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Transportation. At the time of his tragic death, he was president of the Maryland State Conference NAACP branches. Hanley James Norment fought the good fight, finished the course, and kept the faith. We all feel his loss.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I support S. 961, the administration's bill to reauthorize appropriations for the National Rail Passenger Corporation, better known as Amtrak. Amtrak is a necessary part of a national transportation system. It has demonstrated its popularity with the traveling public and, more importantly, its ability to provide safe, efficient transportation at reasonable prices. 
My South Carolina constituents have made it quite clear that they want Amtrak to prosper, and wish it expanded, not terminated or forced to operate under unreasonable restrictions or reduced to the status of a regional railroad. The citizens of South Carolina and the Nation demand a first class rail passenger transportation service. This is Amtrak's mission, and its promise.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, one year ago today, I spent the morning in a hearing on aviation safety arguing with the head of the Federal Aviation Administration that we needed higher safety standards and better safety inspections. We finished with the hearing at about the same time 230 people began to prepare for a flight to Paris. 
As with most flights, I am sure that some people were a little nervous, while others were delighted to be on board and away from the heat and congestion in New York. Shortly after 8:30 p.m., the lives of the 230 people and their families changed forever. 
Terrorism was the first focus of the National Transportation Safety Board, FBI, and others. It was, and remains, incredible that a perfectly able aircraft, with an experienced crew, would just explode. Yet it happened. 
To the family of Matt Alexander, July 17 will always remain a tragic memory. Matt was from Florence, South Carolina. He was a student at Wake Forest, going to spend a semester in France. 
I want to make sure that the families of the victims realize that their losses have not been, and will not be, forgotten. Aviation safety changes will occur that are the direct result of the crash. While new safety measures cannot bring back loved ones, they can help prevent future losses. 
We already have put in place new procedures to assist the families following aviation disasters. A Federal task force created as part of the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 continues to examine ways to make sure that families get needed information, assistance, and privacy following a disaster. None of this will bring back people like Matt, but we can make the process a more humane one.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, let me first thank my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska. He has been very, very participatory over the years. It actually took us about 4 years to get the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to a vote. On both sides of the Capitol and both sides of the aisle we had a very, very deliberate discussion and treatment of the particular issues involved. No one understood better the thrust of trying to deregulate and bring about competition than Senator Kerrey of Nebraska. I praise him publicly, once again, for his leadership and the inclusions that he had contained in the final act itself. 
Referring to that final act, Senator Kerrey tells exactly what is at stake here--this institution. The U.S. Senate seemingly has no historical memory. What we really had on course during the 1960's, 1970's and early 1980's was a terrible monopolistic control of American Telephone & Telegraph. The fact of the matter was that they had some 12 particular rulings by the Federal Communications Commission. But the smart lawyers for the AT&T group would always put those on appeal, seek further delay, further consideration. While there were 12 orders on course at the Federal Communications Commission, mind you me, none of them could get enforced. We were in an outrageous standoff in the courts and at the Commission and, yes, an outrageous standoff in the Congress itself. We could not get a bill passed. They have that much political power. There isn't any question about it. 
So, a very brilliant and dedicated jurist, Harold Greene of the circuit court here in Washington, DC, took this matter over on a petition from the Justice Department for the AT&T breakup. In 1984, the modified final judgment was handed down and the Bell companies were spun off on their own to begin competition, 
and AT&T itself was opened up for competition. That wasn't easy. I wish my friend, Bill McGowan of MCI was here because it was 30 years ago, practically, that he, with a little two-floor apartment down in Georgetown, with a little aerial on top and three assistants, started to try to get into long distance. Very interestingly, the Farmer's Home finally gave him a loan. Can you imagine that? Competition started with a Farmer's Home loan. With that little bank, so to speak, he worked and brought some cases, he began nibbling away at the magnificent monopoly of AT&T in long distance. 
Since that time, of course, the long distance market has opened up. You've got MCI, Sprint, GTE, and the Brits are coming in, and the Germans, and all are participating--the Canadians, and otherwise. And so you have a very dynamic long distance market. 
However, the monopolies at the local level persisted, and those monopolies were intended for the `public convenience and necessity'--that is a phrase hardly heard in the halls of our National Government--in order for the advantages, the services, the opportunity, the advancements to be brought onto the market and enjoyed by the public, we instituted the Federal Communications Commission. We had the old rulings coming out with respect to getting licenses to carry, and otherwise, at the State level, at `public convenience and necessity.' And we intentionally gave these seven Bell operating companies a monopoly. We said: You provide the services and we will protect you so that you are not bothered with the competition. On the contrary, if you get those services to the people, we will give you a profit that averages around 12 percent. Sometimes, in hearings, it went above that. You find them now to have made one heck of a lot of money. But my crowd is down in Buenos Aires, and I just read this past week that Bell South is investing in Brazil, which has some 20 million people. That is way more than the 3.6 million that we have in my little State of South Carolina. So more power to them. They have been well-operated. They have that monopoly. That was a big headache that we had in trying to bring about deregulation, deregulation, deregulation. 
This crowd up here in the House and Senate have no idea of the struggle that we had and the expertise that went into the drafting of this particular Telecommunications Act of 1996, to make sure that that monopolistic control, that checkpoint, that bottleneck, that choke-point was broken up, so that competition really could ensue. And we had what we call the `checklist.' And I can see that being worked on late nights around the clock, over Thanksgiving holidays, working, of course, with the Bell operating companies, we would meet--I forgot my days now-- there was one on Friday and long distance on Monday. The long distance may have been on Friday and the Bell operating companies on Monday. But I set up a system, those years back, as the chairman of the Committee of Commerce, Science, and Transportation, whereby everything would be operated on top of the table. We would bring all sides in. They would all be considered and they would be told where we were and what we were negotiating and why. 
I deemed that nothing was going to be done, because there were all kinds of attempts during the 1970's and 1980's--and I had learned from hard experience that you had to have a bipartisan bill and you had to have all the parties in, and no last minute surprises, or anything of that kind. So credit must be given to the various staffs on the Republican and Democratic sides, working around the clock, to fathom the particular provisions that are in issue in this particular appointment. 
I know that some don't want to hear, and others don't care and they don't listen to this particular background. But it is a very interesting thing because it was worked out and finally voted upon by 95 Republican and Democratic Senators when it passed. There was a strong majority over on the House side. 
It was a bill that, interestingly, when we finally agreed in December of 1995, our distinguished friend, the Vice President of 
the United States, heard that we in conference had gotten an agreement, and he came on the NBC Evening News program right in the middle of the news program. I happened to be listening when I had gotten back to the office. What occurred was that Tom Brokaw said, `Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen, we have a newsbreak from the Vice President of the United States.' I was worried that something may have occurred to the President, but it was not that at all. He came on and said, `We finally got my information superhighway agreed upon and I got everything I wanted. Well, this was December 1995, right after that 1994 election. Speaker Gingrich on the House side said, `If he got everything he wanted, that bill is deader than Elvis.' The leader on the Senate side, Senator Robert Dole, said, `I am not going to call it.' 
Of course, I had the duty, during the ensuing weeks through into Christmas and Christmas week, and all through the month of January, of holding the line. 
I describe that to my colleagues because I want them to know that every little thing in that bill was worked out with everyone and to their satisfaction and, finally, of course, to the Speaker and the Majority Leader Dole, because the bills were called in February of last year and passed both Houses and were signed by the President. 
Now, in coming about the breakup of the monopolies, to make sure--because you can't get competition going unless the Bell companies go along. I can tell you here and now, if I ran a monopoly, I would continue investing in Buenos Aires and all like that for my stockholders, and what have you, and making money, and just hold on and appeal and drag feet and everything else. 
Let me emphasize that is just exactly what has happened, why this particular nomination ought to really be rejected. It is a sort of sad day when you work as hard as you do to get something done for the administration, and the administration sends up an appointment of this kind that upsets the entire apple cart. 
Let me tell you, Madam President, here it is, just last weekend, `MCI Widens Local Market; Loss Estimate,' in the July 11 Wall Street Journal. Some $800 million--saying its losses from entering that business could total $800 million this year, more than double its original estimate. Why? Because here is an analysis right here again in the Wall Street Journal, over the weekend, when they announced that their shares dropped 17 percent. I only quote Chris Mines, senior analyst of Forester Research, Inc., in Cambridge, MA, who said, `MCI's complaints are totally justified. In general, I think local carriers are dragging their feet, using every means at their disposal to protect their monopolies.' 
Now, Madam President, it is just not the news articles in the Wall Street Journal. Take this week's Business Week magazine, on page 33, `Why SBC Shouldn't be the First Bell in Long Distance.' Rather than reading the entire article, little squibs encapsulate those reasons. `How SBC keeps rivals away: one, excess charges. AT&T needed customized routing to provide directory assistance to its customers in SBC's territory. SBC's initial quote is $300 million. AT&T says other Bells charge $1 million to $2 million.' That is rather than the $300 million. 
So it is perfectly obvious that they sit there and make this outrageous charge and that holds up everything. You get Senators running around, `I don't know what is the matter with our bill. We want to open up the market. Let market forces operate.' You have monopolies determined. Here is another reason here how SBC keeps rivals away. `In Oklahoma, competitors must pay $19.13 per line for SBC's unbundled network, but SBC's retail rates are $14.34 a month.' 
So, if they are going to charge 20 percent again more than anybody coming in the market, anybody coming in the market is going broke, and there is a loss by another long distance carrier. AT&T is trying to get in this market. MCI is trying to get in the other long distance market. They are losing already $800 million trying to just break it. 
Third, legal attacks. How SBC keeps rivals away. Legal attacks. SBC has appealed even basic decisions by State regulators. For example, SBC appealed a Texas decision to let Teleport Communications Group provide competing local service. SBC contends Teleport had not met State standards. 
Madam President, I cite this from this particular article because it's momentary, it's timely. What really happens is not just MCI and AT&T, but others in these monopolies, with their lawyers, are bringing cases to test the constitutionality of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The one thing they said, `Let's stop the bickering. Can't we work in a bipartisan nature and get things done?' The one thing done this past Congress on a bipartisan basis was a 95 to 4 vote for the Telecommunications Act of 1996--totally bipartisan. I think those things ought to be understood and how they came about, and how long and hard we worked over them. 
Now, in getting about this particular task, I communicated with President Clinton and the White House and asked him if he could note in a letter just exactly what his concerns were. I want to make sure staff gets copies of every one of these because they are not getting my file. And every time I get ready to talk, I just need a few notes. I can't even get a few notes. They are back there hidden away. So you get your copies.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I quote the second paragraph: 
As I said in our discussion, I am committed to promoting competition in every aspect of the telecommunications and information industries. I believe that the legislation should protect and promote diversity of ownership and opinions in the mass media, should protect consumers from unjustified rate increases for cable and telephone services and, in particular, should include a test specifically designed to ensure that the bell companies entering into long distance markets will not impede competition. 
I emphasize this because I had the charge from the President himself. Now you have the President's nominee coming and refuting all of that, because if you want to know where rates will increase, instead of competition, we are going to get consolidation, and instead of a competitive place in the market, you are going to get fixes all around. This crowd has been operating monopolies for, lo, decades upon decades. They know how to do it. They have a hard time learning. 
AT&T in the 1980's pared down by a third the size of AT&T after the modified final judgment in 1984. But they made twice the profit after they finally learned how to compete. Our friends, the Bells, have yet to come and learn that. In fact, I strongly advised from these happenings that they have no idea of competing; they have every idea of holding onto the monopoly as long as they can. 
Madam President, `If we can get an Assistant Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General'--whatever you want to call Mr. Joel Klein--`in our camp, rather we can hold on and continue making out like gangbusters for years to come.'

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, we had a glowing candidate for the Acting Assistant Attorney General in Joel Klein on March 11, 1997. He went down to a class, a legal work seminar, on March 11, and the title of the seminar was `Preparing for Competition in a Deregulated Telecommunications Market.' 
Joel Klein, on page 9, I read here, and I quote: `Now let me add a few words about how we will apply this standard to our BOC applications under section 271 of the act. Our preference, though we recognize that it may not always occur, is to see actual broad-based business and residential entry into a local market.'

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. 
Madam President, it is very interesting. I want to refer back to this because that is in regular type. `Though we may recognize that it may not always occur'--`though we recognize that it may not always occur.' We are going to refer back to that in just a few minutes because our distinguished chairman of the Communications Subcommittee, Senator Conrad Burns, of Montana, wrote Mr. Joel Klein on May 15, 1997.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, you can read the entire letter. But I can see the thrust of the letter by this language here, and I quote on page 2. 
Congress, however, gave the Attorney General a role in advising the FCC with respect to public interest issues because of the Department's antitrust expertise. See, for example, House conference report 104-458 for a list of some antitrust standards that might be used. A gas-in-the-pipeline standard is plainly unrelated to antitrust laws, and, even worse, violates Congressional intent that the checklist should be the only measure of when local markets are open. 
We in the majority who wrote this particular bill would demur very, very strongly from that wording by our distinguished friend, the Senator from Montana, in this particular letter. 
What occurred is that the nominee, Joel Klein, in the talk, he talked about you can see when competition is present, when you get to see the gas coming through the pipeline. He alludes to the anecdotal situation of gas pipeline cases. 
But Senator Burns differs with that. He says you are supposed to handle this antitrust, and don't give us anything about when competition starts. You can tell his displeasure because, along with the letter, he put a hold on the Joel Klein nomination. You have a hold on the nomination by the chairman of the Communications Subcommittee, and you got a strong letter with a questionnaire that is included, because I have included it in its entirety in the Record. 
So 5 days later, on May 20, the Department of Justice, Acting Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein sends a letter to Senator Burns. 
Madam President, I quote: 
To begin with, I wholeheartedly agree with your statement that the basic point of the Telecommunications Act is that regulators should stand aside and let market forces work once fair competition is possible. I want to assure you that the Department of Justice shares that view. 
Well, both distinguished gentlemen are writing and speaking colloquially. One wants to tell you that competition is present when you can see the gas coming through the pipeline, or smell the gas if you can't see it. Otherwise, the Acting Assistant Attorney General said, `Oh, yes, I want to let' --in the Conrad letter, all these expressions about `let market forces.' What we are trying to do is `let market forces.' He said, `I agree with you. We have to stand aside and let market forces work.' 
That, Madam President, is not the duty of the Acting Attorney General of the United States. He is supposed to stand there by that market and watch it day in and day out. Because there is one thing that will occur if you let market forces work freely, and that is, monopolies will develop. Consolidations and mergers you see afoot right now are occurring every day, and money is talking. People are not suffering yet, but when they get into that monopolistic position, they will, because there won't be any of the rules and regulations, and they will be in their own private businesses. 
This group up here that continues to talk about `let market forces' operate, this tells me, one, I have a questionable candidate for the Antitrust Department of the Office of the Attorney General of the United States when he starts chanting about monopolies. 
Reading on page 2, again, from the Joel Klein letter, I read on page 2, one sentence:  
In order to accomplish these goals, almost immediately after I became Acting Assistant Attorney last October, I asked all of the BOCs [the Bell Operating Companies] as well as any other interested party, to give me their views of the appropriate competition standards under section 271. 
We set it out. We set out our report. We didn't need an Assistant Attorney General running around rewriting the law. He is talking about, `Oh, I got them all in. I am going to start developing policy.' The Congress developed the policy. It took us 4 years to do it. 
Here, he says gratuitously in the next sentence on the bottom of page 2--this is Joel Klein, the nominee: 
In formulating this standard, I specifically rejected using the suggestion in the conference report that the Department analyze Bell Operating Company applications employing the standard used in the AT&T consent decree objecting to the Bell Operating Company in regional long distance entry `unless there is no substantial possibility that the Bell Operating Company or its affiliates could use its monopoly power to impede competition in the market such company seeks to enter.' 
Bear with me a minute. I know this thing sounds complicated. And those who want to watch a good, loud show they put on around the world, or whatever the dickens they put on in the afternoon, go ahead and turn to it. But this is very, very important. 
Judge Greene had what we call in the trade `the VIII(c) test'--that they couldn't enter these markets until--this is the one rejected by Joel Klein--`there is no substantial possibility that the Bell Operating Company or its affiliates could use its monopoly power to impede competition in the market such company seeks to do enter.' 
Madam President, with that particular VIII(c) test, that is how competition starts in long distance that we have today. We don't have any in the local. Ninety-eight percent of the local calls are still controlled by the local Bell Operating Company. They have the monopoly. But this really genius test, the VIII(c) 
test, became the standard of the discipline, the standard of the industry. 
In one hearing, as chairman of the Communications Subcommittee--the Commerce, Science, and Transportation hearing--I had the seven Bells attest. And we will put that in the Record, if necessary. They agreed with this particular test. You have the Bell Operating Companies agreeing to that particular test, and that is why we kept it in there. We didn't write it into the formal statute because one former colleague on the House side had held up. He had tremendous influence, Jack Fields of Texas. So we put it in the language. But you follow the course or talk to any of the conferees, you talk to any of the House and Senate Members, they will tell you the VIII(c) test was the test, and we couldn't think of a better one. 
Here comes nominee Joel Klein, stating categorically here in May, `In formulating this standard, I specifically rejected using the suggestion in the conference report that the Department analyze BOC applications employing the standard used'--the VIII(c) standard. 
Madam President, when you work this long and you know the industry, you know the monopolies, you know how Judge Greene held control and operated as well as he did, and communications prospered, expanded, and competition burst out all over in the long distance field with this particular standard, and then have a gentleman come in totally green and just write back, just as he got a letter from the chairman who put a hold on his nomination, and said `I threw that out.' The Bell Operating Companies tried to throw it out, and they couldn't. They know it because they had already testified in behalf of it. 
He goes on to say that `the VIII(c) standard which has barred Bell Operating Company entry into long distance since their divestiture from AT&T, struck me as insufficiently sensitive to the market conditions, and I was concerned that it would bar Bell Operating Company entry even where it would be competitively warranted.' 
I want him to describe that. My understanding is that another Senator, my distinguished colleague from North Dakota--and also I was talking to the Senator from Nebraska. And they have talked with the gentleman, Mr. Klein, and have asked him. And he has yet to come and elaborate about what is more `sensitive.' He says this is `insufficiently sensitive.' We have yet to find another. 
I have met twice with Joel Klein. And he said I was right. He was there with the Attorney General. He understood, and he would get some ensuing opinion, or letter, or some note that he understood, and he could read the language, and it was going to be corrected. 
Madam President, let's turn the page and go to Senator Conrad Burns' questions and answers, and go to that question. Here is what Senator Burns questioned, and I quote. 
In your speech, you use the following terms: `Real and broad-based competition,' `actual broad-based entry,' `true broad-based entry,' `tangible entry,' `large-scale entry,' and `entry on a large-scale basis.' 
What do those terms mean to the department? 
And I could read it all. The entire letter has been included. But let me read this last sentence. 
Thus, in my March 11th speech-- 
The Acting Attorney General, he knows what we are talking about. He refers to that speech. 
In my March 11th speech to which you referred, I stated that `our preference, though we recognize that it may not always occur, is to see actual broad based, that is, business and residential, entry into a local market.' 
Now, Madam President, for all of those unstudied in trying cases with lawyers, watch this particular language because it has the regular language and regular print but he highlights with italic the phrase: `Our preference, though we recognize that it may not always occur.' 
Now, that is in italic, not the rest of it. So the distinguished chairman of the communications subcommittee is given a signal. Watch the play. And then comes the play. 
Madam President, on May 21, the next day, he doesn't delay. Oh, that Acting Attorney General for antitrust that held up for weeks the answer to the Dorgan letter and the Kerrey letter, he was prompt; he answered that letter of Senator Burns in 5 days, gave the signal with the italics.

It does not, however, require that each class of customers, business and residential, must be served over a facilities based competitor's own facilities. To the contrary, Congress expressly provided that the competitor may be providing services predominantly over its own facilities in combination with the resale of Bell Operating Company services (47 USC 271 (c)(1)(A)). Thus, it does not matter whether the competitor reaches one class of customers, namely residential, only through resale provided that the competitor's local exchange services as a whole are provided predominantly over its own facilities. 
Well, Mr. President, there it was. Bell Operating Companies through the distinguished Senator from Montana got what they wanted in black and white. They just totally refuted 4 years of work, the most important part of the checklist, the most important part that provided for competition in the long distance market, the most important part that we included. We talked about it. We discussed it. We debated it. I was in these conferences. They were in the conferences, like I tried to emphasize. The Bell Companies met all one day with our staffs on both sides and the long distance companies met all one day, and it was worked out. But do not take the word of the Senator from South Carolina.

Mr. HOLLINGS. This is dated June 20, 1997. 
Dear Chairman Hunt: 
I recently read with interest and dismay the Department of Justice's additional comments regarding SBC Communications' application to provide in-region interLATA services in the State of Oklahoma. The department therein clarified its views on section 271(c)(1)(A) of the Communications Act, as amended. As a primary author-- 
Let me emphasize that. This is Chairman Bliley-- 
As a primary author of this provision, I feel compelled to inform you that the department misread the statute's plain language. As you rule on SBC's application and future Bell Operating Company applications, you should not overlook the clear meaning of section 271 or its legislative history. The Department argued that a Bell Operating Company should be allowed to enter the in-region interLATA market under track A, that is, section 271(c)(1)(A) if a competing service provides office facilities based services to business customers and resale services to residential customers, so long as the combined provision of both services is predominantly over the competing service provider's facilities. 
In other words, the Department wrongly takes the view that section 271(c)(1)(A) is satisfied if a competitor is serving either residential or business customers over its own facilities. Section 271(c)(1)(a), however, clearly requires a different interpretation. To quote the statute, `A competing service provider must offer telephone exchange service to residential and business subscribers either exclusively over their own telephone exchange service facilities or predominantly over their own telephone exchange service facilities. Track A is thus satisfied if and only if a Bell Operating Company faces facilities based competition in both residential and business markets. Neither the statute nor its legislative history permits any other interpretation. I know this because I drafted both texts.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Now, you see every effort has been made to try to clear that record, and you can read the Attorney General's letter, and for the purposes at hand it is not worth the paper it is written on. You can throw it away. It says nothing--that she believes in competition. Now, she is a lawyer. She knows how to read emphasized italics language. She saw the pitch. I told her about the pitch and how it occurred. I showed her the talk that Klein made. We went down the whole thing. So Senator Kerrey, and I understand, of course, Senator Dorgan wrote a letter, and we were waiting for a letter back and we had to wait several weeks. Not the Senator from Montana. His letter and addendum and opinion were all put out immediately. But when Senators who worked on the bill as diligently as we did tried to meet with him and then put down in black and white our misgivings, write the Attorney General's department and ask, please, now, let's see your position here on the plain, clear language, they write back--`I believe in competition.' Just two pages of nothing. I have that in the Record. 
Mr. President, I should have, like I say, politicked this nomination for its defeat.

Mr. HOLLINGS. It is not my intent to take further time. I can tell that this was called. I had checked after the last rollcall. They said it wasn't going to be called until after 6 o'clock. When they filed it, they filed cloture immediately before there was any kind of debate whatever. They have not only lost their senses with respect to reality, calling deficits listed in the document as $179.3 billion as balanced, but they have lost their manners and their courtesy. Usually you have the Senator who had the hold and caused the particular confusion put on notice, but I had a staffer watching the TV and saw our friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, was talking. So there we are, just right in the middle. 
You did not need cloture. At the time we put on a hold and were asked: Do you want to be identified as the one having the hold, I said absolutely. I am not playing games, tricks or anything of that kind. I would be glad if you called it this afternoon. That was weeks ago where I would have a chance to explain exactly what occurred. But, of course, you can see what has occurred. They have politically worked it, got the votes, got cloture. Don't waste time. Let us get on with this. 
And then when the rates go up, when you get consolidation instead of competition and those rates go up, and you don't get competition in the local market and you don't get what we intended in the Telecommunications Act, don't come around like in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and say it didn't work. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings worked up until 1990 when they went out to Andrews Air Base and they put in the categories and so-called ceilings--we haven't reached those ceilings yet--and repealed the across-the-board cuts, the sequester language. On October 21 at 1:40 a.m. I made the point of order that you are now repealing the thrust of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. Today, this afternoon, I am making the same point. You are repealing the competitive feature of the Telecommuncations Act of 1996. 
I hope the nomination is defeated and we get somebody here who can read. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was an historic achievement of bipartisan consensus. The act was intended to promote competition in every sector of the communications industry, including the broadcast, cable, wireless, long distance, local telephone, manufacturing, pay telephone, electronic publishing, cable equipment, and direct broadcast satellite industries. At the time of its passage, the law had the support of the Clinton administration and almost every sector of the communications industry. 
Mr. President, the Telecommunications Act was the result of many years of debate in the Congress. In 1991, I authored legislation to allow the Regional Bell Operating Companies [RBOC's] into manufacturing. That bill passed the Senate by almost two-thirds of the Senate, but the House could not pass it. In 1993 I introduced S. 1822 which was a comprehensive effort to update the Communications Act of 1934. Again, we tried to pass the legislation, but at each stage, one industry blocked the other. As a result, communications policy was set by the courts, not by Congress and not by the Federal Communications Commission [FCC], the expert agency. 
It is now almost 18 months after the historic law was passed and critics are already hailing it as a failure because of recent mergers and the apparent lack of competition. In actuality we will not know the impact of the law for years to come. Yet a critical factor that will determine its success has more to do with how the law is being enforced than what the statutory language says. 
First, it is important to note that many of the decisions we made were based on the commitment that the respective industries were going to compete against each other. Telephone companies were going to enter the cable television market. The cable industry was going to enter the local telephone service market. And long distance companies would enter the local telephone service market. 
Now, 18 months later, we're seeing more of the opposite. But I am not ready to simply blame the industry for deciding not to compete. Everyone knows that it's more natural for monopolies to defend their market share than to willingly give it up. Furthermore, competition can only occur if the new competitors are provided the legal and economic opportunity to compete for market share. Thus, the success of the law depends upon its implementation and oversight. 
One major element of the implementation is the rules adopted by the FCC. The FCC has been working nonstop for the past 18 months to adopt rules to implement the law. I have some concerns about how the FCC has interpreted certain provisions, and I have been working with the FCC on those issues. One problem, though, has been that the rules themselves are not in 
effect because these same companies that pledged competition have instead sought consolidation and litigation. 
An example of why vigorous enforcement of the act is necessary is reflected in the difficulty new entrants are experiencing in trying to enter the local telephone market. Financial reports today detail MCI's problems that it faces in trying to break into the local telephone market. MCI will record approximately $800 million in losses this year--almost double its expected loss. AT&T also wrote to the FCC outlining the need for greater enforcement of the act if new entrants are to be successful in trying to enter the local market. 
Three of the FCC's major rulemakings are now tied up in the courts. The interconnection rules have been stayed by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals since last fall. The universal service rules and access charge rules also were recently challenged in the courts. The list goes on with a number of other proceedings being tied up in the courts. The most outrageous example thus far is last week's announcement that SBC, the Bell Telephone Co. for the Southwestern United States, is challenging the constitutionality of the statute itself--18 months later! 
It is important to note that SBC already has merged with Pacific Bell and almost merged with AT&T. At the same time SBC was trying to merge with AT&T, it was seeking to enter the long distance market to supposedly compete with AT&T. SBC was denied in its initial request to enter the long distance market, so instead of challenging the FCC decision, SBC simply decided to seek continued protection from the courts. The irony, of course, is that for 10 years, the telecommunications industry argued that the courts should not administer communications policy. 
With all this litigation going on, it's no wonder the media believes the law was a failure. I think it's time we focused more on why there appears to be more consolidation than competition. Also, I think the Congress needs to be more attentive to whether the administration's nominees support the policies advocated by the administration during consideration of the legislation. 
Let there be no doubt that much of the competition provisions were combined with a transition to greater deregulation. In exchange for less regulation, there had to be competition to protect consumers. That is not happening. Competition and deregulation were all we heard on the floor of the Senate, but all we're now seeing is consolidation and deregulation without the competition. It doesn't appear that some in the administration today share the same views about competition as the administration did in 1995 when the law was being debated. 
Because the litigation strategy of some incumbents appears to have prevented competitors from entering the various markets, the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice is now tasked with a far greater role than anyone envisioned. But the nominee before us today has made certain statements and taken certain actions in his acting capacity that concern me greatly. His actions raise further concern with the direction of the administration's policies with respect to its interpretation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. I believe that these issues need clarification before Mr. Klein's nomination should be brought to a vote in the Senate. 
Whether or not robust competition develops in the local telephone service market depends upon the administration's commitment to vigorous enforcement of the act. Unfortunately, while serving as Acting Chief of the Antitrust Division, Mr. Klein has explicitly contradicted specific statutory mandates and conference report directions that the Congress, working with the White House, fought against all odds to have added to the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Several Members have asked Mr. Klein, Attorney General Reno, and the White House about these concerns and have asked them to demonstrate that the Antitrust Division will follow the explicit meaning of the Telecommunications Act. So far, there has not been a satisfactory response to our concerns. 
Mr. President, with respect to my colleague in discussing the character of Mr. Klein, there is no question about Mr. Klein being of the highest character and integrity. 
But what really occurs, Mr. President, and I have had to respond to a lot of calls from good friends, it was not his character but his ability, even though he is a smart lawyer, to administer the law as written. 
There is no question in my mind that, of course, you have those who believe in weak antitrust. We went through that in the Reagan years. I have been the chairman of the State, Justice, Commerce Subcommittee of appropriations for the Antitrust Division, and during those particular years the Reagan administration cared less whether we had antitrust. To the credit of the distinguished wife of our distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Anne Bingaman, came in there and we really beefed up the department, and we even brought to task none other than Bill Gates of the computer world. So when you can do that you know you have a good antitrust head in power. 
When I saw this particular gentleman take over it gave me misgivings. Right to the point, as the newspaper said, from the very beginning when I put my hold on this particular nomination, I said I would be glad to discuss it that afternoon, I was not going to politic it around, I have other work to do. But as a matter of conscience, I thought I ought to bring these things to the attention of my colleagues.

<TEXT>
Mr. HOLLINGS. And there is no better way to bring this right to the focus of concern. 
Let me refer, without having to put the entire article of the Wall Street Journal from this morning into the Record, a headline, Mr. President, that `MCI Widens Local Market Loss Estimate.' The very first sentence, 
MCI communications corporation is calling for tougher regulatory action to break the competitive advantages enjoyed by the regional Bell telephone companies and the local phone markets, 
and they said its losses from entering that business could total $800 million this year, more than double its original estimate. And then the article continues. 
The point is, it is very difficult to break into a monopoly and it is very difficult to get a monopoly to give up marketshare. That has been quite obvious, working in telecommunications since I have been here, 30 years, that this is the keenest, most competitive, most take-advantage crowd you have ever seen. We are bogged down right now into the courts. All the promises about going into each other's businesses to compete have been forestalled, and mergers on course and everything else of that kind, so in writing this legislation we had a back and forth with the best of Washington lawyers on all sides, on every word, coaching us, more or less, for the last 4 years, until February of this last year, when we passed the bill. 
For that 4-year period, we got into the requirements--we call it a checklist--that the regional Bell operating companies had to comply with to open up their markets before they could get into long distance, ipso facto, allow them into long distance, with the monopoly control of whoever is going to receive the call locally, and you have a monopolistic situation and they will run a touchdown and the long distance companies and all competition will be extinguished. So we had a debate over every particular facet. 
One particular requirement is labeled here in section 271 of the particular act and it is referred to in the actual conference report on page 33 in the report language, section 271. Let me read it so it is intelligently understood here: 
. . . the Bell operating company is providing access and interconnection to its network facilities for the network facilities of one or more unaffiliated competing providers of telephone exchange services . . . [as defined in section 347(A)] to residential and business subscribers. 
For the unattuned, the emphasis should be to `residential and business subscribers.' 
We wanted to have a facilities-based competitor operating there before that particular Bell company could take off into the long distance competition. There is no question in my mind that the distinguished gentleman under consideration, Mr. Joel Klein, understood this. 
He made a talk on March 11 at the Willard Inter-Continental Hotel here in Washington to the Glasser Legalworks Seminar, and the seminar was entitled `Competitive Policy In Communications Industries: New Antitrust Approaches.' 
On page 9 of that particular talk, I quote Mr. Klein himself. 
Now, let me add a few words about how we will apply this standard to RBOC applications under Section 271 of the Act. Our preference, though we recognize that it may not always occur, is to see actual, broad-based--i.e., business and residential--entry into a local market. 
And it goes on and on explaining. 
When my friend from Montana, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Communications on the Committee of Commerce here in the U.S. Senate, Senator Conrad Burns saw that, he wrote a letter to Mr. Klein. I am sorry I do not have my hand immediately on that letter itself, but he listed a series of questions in his letter to the Acting Assistant Attorney General, and the Acting Assistant Attorney General, Joel Klein on May 20, answered the letter.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I refer by emphasis that he says on question one: `In your speech'--Senator Burns is referring to the speech made by Mr. Klein--`In your speech you used the following terms--`real' and `broad-based competition', `actual, broad-based entry', `true broad-based entry', `tangible entry', `large-scale entry', and entry on a `large-scale basis'. What do those terms mean to the Department?' 
The rest is right there, but by way of emphasis, let me quote Mr. Klein in response: `Thus, in my March 11 speech to which you refer, I stated that `[o]ur preference, though we recognize it may not always occur, is to see actual, broad-based * * * business and residential--entry into a local market.' 
Now, Mr. President, it is very interesting because these communications lawyers, and I ought to know, because if you work with them over the years you begin to learn. What should interest anybody looking at qualifications of this particular nominee, he puts in italics `[o]ur preference, though we recognize it may not always occur'--and thereupon, you could not believe it, Mr. President, you could not believe it, our Mr. Klein had the unmitigated gall, in response to his italic to file an opinion here, an addendum to the evaluation of the Department, the U.S. Department of Justice in the matter of the application of SBC Communications, Inc., docket 97-121. When? The day after that letter was sent, and here is what he says--because you get the hint in the letter but you get the fact in this addendum. 
Let me quote: 
The statute requires that both business and residential subscribers be served by a competing provider, and that such provider must be exclusively or predominantly facilities-based. It does not, however, require that each class of customers (i.e., business and residential) must be served over a facilities-based competitor's own facilities. To the contrary, Congress expressly provided that the competitor may be providing services `predominantly' over its own facilities `in combination with the resale of' BOC services. . . . Thus, it does not matter whether the competitor reaches one class of customers--e.g., residential--only through resale, provided that the competitor's local exchange services as a whole are provided `predominantly' over its own facilities. 
Now, Mr. President, you have section 271, that particular provision turned right on its head. I have no better authority, Mr. President, not if this particular Senator's opinion is of any value, and I might say that no one Senator wrote the Telecommunication Act of 1996, but immodestly, if there is one that had more involvement than anybody else, it was me. I had put out a bill S. 1822; Senator Pressler put out his bill, S. 652. We changed it around back to S. 1822. Everyone knows that. Look at the finished documents. I worked around the clock, 
and I worked with Chairman Bliley, the Republican chairman on the House side. Here in a letter of June 20, 1997, to the Honorable Reed Hundt by Chairman Bliley, Chairman of the FCC.

Mr. HOLLINGS. He writes: 
Dear Fritz: I enjoyed our telephone conversation today regarding the upcoming conference on the telecommunications reform bill and would like to follow up on your request regarding the specific issues of concern to me as proposed legislation. 
I am reading just part of it now. 
As I said in our discussion, I am committed to promoting competition in every aspect of the telecommunications and information industries. I believe that the legislation should protect and promote diversity of ownership and opinions in the mass media, should protect consumers from unjustified rate increases for cable and telephone services, and in particular, should include a test specifically designed to ensure that the Bell companies entering into long distance markets will not impede competition. 
Now, Mr. President, that is why we wrote 271 the way we wrote it. That is why we wrote it that way. There isn't any question, as the chairman has said, this is bipartisan. This isn't because some Senator is enraged or upset or something else like that. I have been here long enough to get enraged or upset. I have seen a lot of good ones go through and several bad ones. 
I thought having participated on the ground and worked for 4 years in getting this formative act that was voted on by 95 U.S. Senators--they voted on this particular language when it passed this particular body. They understand not only that this isn't just a singular mistake, we have the proposition of the gentleman, Mr. Klein, also coming forward and disregarding entirely, gratuitously, and summarily throwing out the VIII(c) test, which I will have time to refer to on here later on. 
My point here is that we really worked hard to get participation. There were those who didn't want the antitrust provision. They wanted one-stop shopping at the Federal Communications Commission. We worked hard to make sure that this was done right. We realized many times that they don't have antitrust lawyers like Reed Hundt, who is now the Chairman and understands the law, and you necessarily don't have antitrust lawyers coming in as members and commissioners at the Federal Communications Commission. So to give emphasis to opening up the market for free and open competition, we put in the antitrust provisions in there for its opinion to be provided to the Federal Communications Commission. We worked hard to provide it. We worked diligently on the VIII(c) test, which was Judge Greene's test for over 12 years now in the breakup of AT&T, and every one of the Bell Operating Companies attested to that particular language. And here comes the particular nominee casting aside, in a gratuitous fashion, that requirement, on the one hand, and changing over the statute just on a letter from a Senator, on the other hand. 
When you have that kind of weak nominee, you have thwarted the intent of the Congress and the President of the United States and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of one of South Carolina's finest citizens, Rev. Roscoe C. Wilson, pastor of Saint John Baptist Church in Columbia. For the past 50 years, Reverend Wilson has presided over the same church and during this time, the congregation has increased from 150 to over 800 members. 
Roscoe Wilson began his career of public service very early. In 1942, after graduation from high school, he joined the U.S. Army where he served for the next 4 1/2 years. Upon his discharge in 1946, young Roscoe moved to Columbia, SC, and entered Benedict College where he earned his bachelor of arts and bachelor of divinity degrees. It was there that he met his future wife, the late Ethel Celeste Williams. 
In 1948, at an unusually tender age, Roscoe Wilson was appointed pastor of Saint John Baptist Church. Together Roscoe and Ethel Wilson built a strong parish and became part of the tightly knit Benedict College community. Ethel Wilson worked at the college and was fondly named `Ma' by the students. The Wilsons often provided housing for out-of-town students who were unable to afford a room on campus. Reverend Wilson still refers to them as his foster children. The Wilsons raised two of their own, Roscoe, Jr., and Preston. Roscoe, Jr., director of the Midlands Marine Institute, a foundation for troubled youth, is married to the former Eva Rakes, and has two children, Renaldo and Asia. Preston is a well-known carpenter in the Columbia area, most noted for his woodwork. 
Social activism has appropriately been the hallmark of Reverend Wilson's pastoral career. During the early civil rights movement, he worked to peacefully integrate public health facilities such as the Crafts-Farrow Mental Hospital and the Bryan S. Dorn Veterans Hospital. Saint John Baptist Church, which has a large outreach ministry, runs a progressive preschool serving approximately 100 children between the ages of 3 and 5 years old. This preschool program has been an enormous success. Its pupils begin first grade with strong skills and high confidence. 
In the little free time he has, Reverend Wilson enjoys the outdoors. He loves to hunt and fish and occasionally returns to Texas to visit family. It is at home in Columbia, though, where he indulges his true passion, gardening. He says that tending his roses helps him to focus on the important things. It is this care and focus which has made him such a successful pastor. He tends his congregation like his rose bed. Saint John Baptist Church will dearly miss Reverend Wilson though his work with the church and the community will undoubtedly continue. All of us in South Carolina are very grateful for this Texas transplant. We wish him the very best in his future endeavors.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as Americans across the United States celebrated Independence Day this past weekend, many enjoyed the summer delight of a red, juicy watermelon. I rise today to recognize watermelon farmers, the people who make this Fourth of July tradition possible. 
All day yesterday and today, my staff, along with the staffs of Representative John Spratt and Representative Jim Clyburn, will be delivering South Carolina watermelons to offices throughout the Senate and House of Representatives. Thanks to South Carolina watermelon farmers such as Jim Williams of Lodge in Colleton County, those of us here in Washington will be able to cool off from the summer heat with a delicious South Carolina watermelon. 
This year, farmers across South Carolina planted more than 11,000 acres of watermelons. These are some of the finest watermelons produced anywhere in the United States. Watermelons of all varieties--Jubilees, Sangrias, Allsweets, Star Brites, Crimson Sweets, red seedless, yellow seedlesss, and other hybrids are produced in South Carolina and marketed across the Nation. 
Through the end of this month, farmers in Allendale, Bamberg, Barnwell, Colleton, Hampton, and other southern South Carolina counties will harvest hundreds of thousands of watermelons. In the Pee Dee areas around Chesterfield, Darlington, and Florence counties, the harvest will continue until about August 20. 
Mr. President, as we savor the taste of these watermelons, we should remember the work and labor that goes into producing such a delicious fruit. While Americans enjoyed watermelons at the beach and at backyard barbecues all over the Nation this past weekend, most did not stop to consider where they came from. Farmers will be laboring all summer in the heat and humidity to bring us what we call Mother Nature's perfect candy. These remarkable watermelons are sweet, succulent and, most importantly, nutritious and fat free. The truth is, Mr. President, that our farmers are too often the forgotten workers in our country. Through their dedication and commitment, our Nation is able to enjoy a wonderful selection of fresh fruit, vegetables and other foods. In fact, our agricultural system is the envy of the world. 
South Carolina farmers lead the way in the production of watermelons. For example, my State was a leader in the development of black plastic and irrigation to expand the watermelon growing season. By covering the earth in the spring with black plastic, farmers are able to speed up the melons' growth by raising soil temperatures. In addition, the plastic allows farmers to shut out much of the visible light, which inhibits weed growth. In addition, I am pleased to note that the scientists at the USDA Vegetable Laboratory in my hometown of Charleston continue to strive to find even more efficient and effective ways to produce one of our State's most popular fruits. 
Therefore, as Congressmen and their staffs feast on watermelons this week, I hope they all will remember the folks in South Carolina who made this endeavor possible: Jim Williams of Williams Farms in Lodge; Les Tindal, our State agriculture commissioner; Martin Eubanks and Minta Wade of the South Carolina Department of Agriculture; Randy Cockrell and the members of the South Carolina Watermelon Association; and finally, Bennie Hughes and the South Carolina Watermelon Board in Columbia. They all have worked extremely hard to ensure that Congressmen can get a taste of South Carolina. 
So, I hope everyone in our Nation's Capital will be smiling as they enjoy the pleasure of a South Carolina watermelon.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in every area of human endeavor, major advances often seem to depend on a single individual whose unique vision and dedication to pursuing that vision break through existing barriers to understanding. On Tuesday, the world lost one of those individuals, a pioneer in the area of oceanography and marine conservation. I am speaking, of course, of Jacques-Yves Cousteau. 
I have had the pleasure and honor of knowing Jacques Cousteau as a friend and colleague for more than three decades. Our relationship was based on a common passion for exploring and protecting the oceans. We also shared a lifelong interest in ocean and coastal management and in sustainable development and use of marine resources. One of the most valuable perks of membership in the U.S. Senate is the opportunity it affords us to meet gifted leaders from every walk of life. Few of those leaders have made a greater or more lasting contribution than Jacques-Yves Cousteau. 
Jacques' first adventure underwater was in Vermont at age 10. For the next 75 years, he continued his adventures, and he brought the rest of us with him. He was a pioneer in undersea exploration, and I can testify firsthand that diving with him was an unforgettable experience. He developed the first scuba gear, took the first underwater color pictures, and started the first undersea colony. 
Probably as important as his scientific and technical achievements, Jacques brought the oceans to life for millions of Americans through breathtaking books, films, and his documentary television series, `The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau.' His film `The Silent World' brought viewers aboard his ship, the Calypso, for the first time and won an Oscar for best documentary. He went on to win 2 more Oscars, 10 Emmys, and numerous other awards by astonishing viewers with the life under the waters all over the world from the Red Sea to Antarctica and from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean. 
As Jacques continued to explore the ocean, he became deeply committed to protecting it against pollution and other manmade hazards. In 1971, he accepted the Senate Commerce Committee's invitation to testify and spoke to us about the International Conference on Ocean Pollution. He later testifed before the committee on other ocean issues. His testimony and other activities were key to public realization that the oceans are not a vast and unlimited resource, that human activities do indeed have profound impacts on the oceans, and consequently, that we have a duty to protect the marine environment. 
A number of years later, I was privileged to present Jacques with the 1983 Neptune Award of the American Oceanic Organization. The award recognized his extraordinary contribution to promoting the use, understanding, and protection of the oceans. At the award ceremony, Jacques showed his new film on his trip up the Amazon River. None of those present will forget his evocative description of the pink dolphins and flooded forests of the Amazon. Jacques had a rare gift for allowing people to see the wonderful diversity of life beneath the water's surface. 
Jacques-Yves Cousteau taught the world how to appreciate, understand, explore, use, and preserve the oceans which cover 71 percent of the Earth's surface. We will greatly miss his wit, wisdom, and zest for life.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I, too, would like to join my distinguished colleagues in this discussion. The leadership of the Commerce Committee worked very hard in the Senate and during the Senate-House conference to create this Commission. Congress even provided a substantial appropriation to fund its activities. The work of the Commission is extremely important. I know that my colleagues share my concern that aviation monies are not being used for aviation purposes, and we need to work to correct that. During our Commerce Committee markup recently, I expressed my desire to treat the Airport and Airways Trust Fund differently, and many members indicated that we needed to do something different for aviation. The GAO report on airport funding suggests that the airports are in need of $10 billion, according to the airports, and $6.5 billion, according to the FAA, depending upon the type of projects included. The Airport Improvement Program is an important component of the work of the FAA. We cannot meet future growth needs without expanding our airports and modernizing the air traffic control system. The Commission work and recommendations will help us in the debate in finding ways to meet our future aviation system needs.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition of S. 949, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. I was necessarily absent and unable to vote on the final passage of the bill, but I would like my statement to be recorded in the Record. 
There has been a great deal of congratulations about how this is the first major tax cut since the Kemp-Roth tax cuts in 1981. I would like to remind everyone of the consequences of that particular measure. Since 1981, our deficits have exploded, growing to as high as $403 billion. Our national debt has soared from under $1 trillion in 1980 to $5.4 trillion this year. The interest costs on this debt have skyrocketed during that period from $74.8 billion to $360 billion, representing spending of $1 billion a day. This money does not go to purchase any new bridges, roads, airports, or any other public good. Instead, it is wasted on servicing this debt. These interest payments, in essence, represent a mammoth tax on the American people which will continue to rise until we can get our fiscal house in order. 
Since 1993, we have made substantial progress toward reducing our deficit. Despite the opposition of every Republican in the Senate, we passed a tough deficit reduction bill which included unpopular tax increases and spending cuts. The results have been clear. Our deficit has fallen for 5 years in a row, unemployment is at a 24 year low, inflation is minimal, interest rates are down, 12.1 million new jobs have been created, and business investment is at a post-war high. Yet, instead of building on this progress, we have chosen to abandon ship and engage in the political temptation of tax cuts. 
Mr. President, our Nation is experiencing a period of prosperity, partially because we were courageous enough to make the right choice in 1993 and begin to reduce our deficit. We should stay on this course until we truly balance our books. Instead, this year's budget deal engages in the same old trickery of back loaded tax cuts, borrowed trust funds, and unrealistic economic assumptions. Rather than doing what is right for the American people, we have chosen to do what is right to get us past the next election. I fear, however, that the results of this measure will be felt long after then.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today as a supporter and cosponsor of Senator Byrd's sense-of-the-Senate resolution, Senate Resolution 98, regarding ratification of any international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Back in 1992, the United States and the rest of the world agreed to work, on a voluntary basis, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which scientists believed could affect climate and sea levels over the next century. Unfortunately, this agreement, aimed at returning greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels, has failed. 
Now, the administration is negotiating an agreement aimed at meeting this 1990 level. Instead of requiring countries, all countries--developed, developing, and underdeveloped--to agree on voluntary efforts, these negotiations are focused on making the 1990 level mandatory for only developed countries. In short, it will increase the burden of compliance on the United States and other developed countries, while doing nothing to ensure that developing countries meet these targets. 
Yes, the United States and other developed countries are responsible for the bulk of these emissions but that will not always be the case. Many developing countries, such as China, Mexico, India, and Brazil, are on course to surpass United States emissions. It makes no sense to give these countries a pass. I am not saying the United States should not do its fair share, we should. My concern is that the agreement is shortsighted. Failing to include these developing countries does nothing to head off the emission problems which they will soon face. 
In addition, I have a long record of defending the American worker and American industry from unfair business and trade practices overseas--many of which occur in these developing countries. My fear is that failing to include developing nations in this agreement will undermine America's ability to compete internationally and will only work to force American industry overseas to these developing areas. America has the strongest economy in the world. I want to ensure it remains that way. Placing the burden of reducing greenhouse gas emissions only on developed countries and ignoring developing countries will do nothing to secure economic stability. 
In short, this resolution calls for the United States to refuse to sign any agreement unless the developing countries are included in a legally binding regime of emission control measures. It is an effort to ensure that all countries are placed on a level playing field. 
With regard to my record on environmental issues, there have been some who have asked if my support of Senate Resolution 98 undermines my long record of supporting efforts to clean and protect our environment. Let me say now, it does not. In my opinion, this resolution will strengthen efforts to reduce worldwide greenhouse gas emissions by ensuring that all countries meet the same standards.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Helms and Senator Biden for accepting this amendment regarding facilities to support our men and women serving in the United States' Diplomatic Service in the People's Republic of China. 
Our United States diplomatic facilities in China are in poor shape. The housing is in disrepair and for our chancery we occupy a building that formerly was used as the Pakistani Embassy. We spend years training our diplomatic personnel to be China hands who speak Chinese fluently. They are the best and the brightest in our foreign service. And, then we send them and their families to live and work in substandard facilities. It sends the wrong message. 
Mr. President, it hurts morale and retention. With the fall of the wall, these Americans are our front-line--our State Department economic officers, our commerce Department commercial officers, our consular officers who help Americans in distress overseas, our Customs Service employees who enforce our trade laws, and other agency personnel. 
Regardless of what your position is with China, on human rights or trade, the fact remains that the United States and China have and will have one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world. The People's Republic of China is our fifth largest trading partner and the Chinese economy is growing at over 10 percent per partner and the Chinese economy is growing at over 10 percent per year. They are becoming the preeminent geo-political power in Asia. 
I have raised this issue with former Secretary Christopher and Secretary of State Albright. I have discussed it with Ambassador Sasser. They all agree that something must be done to invest in our facilities to support our people who are serving in China. This amendment provides that from within the total amounts authorized in this bill, up to $90 million is provided for renovation, acquisition, and construction of housing and secure diplomatic facilities at the United States Embassy in Beijing and the consulate in Shanghai. It does so without adding additional funds. It requires the Appropriations committee, on which I serve as ranking member on the Commerce, Justice and State Subcommittee, to actually scrub the budget and find the money and address this issue. 
Mr. President, this amendment is the right thing to do. It is cosponsored by Senator Murray from Washington who has been to Beijing recently and who has seen firsthand the need for modernization of facilities. 
Again, I thank Chairman Helms and Senator Biden for their support.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, today, I, along with Senator Thurmond, introduce duty suspension legislation designed to permit the import of certain tire manufacturing equipment into the United States duty free. U.S. companies do not manufacture the custom equipment to be imported, and therefore its importation will not displace domestic sourcing. Moreover, because the product at issue is manufacturing equipment, it will assist in the creation of additional jobs in the tire manufacturing industry. 
I believe that this is the most appropriate use of duty suspension legislation. The custom imported product will not displace any product manufactured in the United States. Moreover, the imported product will assist in creating more productive capacity in the United States. This equipment will be used to manufacture a product that heretofore was not made in the United States. I am therefore hopeful that this new capacity can be used to supply both domestic and foreign needs and will increase employment in the tire manufacturing industry.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in introducing this important bill to reauthorize the National Sea Grant College Program. Last year marked the 30th anniversary of the Sea Grant Program, so it is especially fitting that we propose legislation today that will revitalize the program and continue its effective operation into the next century. 
At its core, Sea Grant is a program that brings competitive, high-quality science to bear on problems affecting our Nation's oceans and coasts. Sea Grant's top priority is creating new economic opportunities by forging alliances among academia, government, and industry to transfer information and technology into the hands of people who can truly use it. For example, Sea Grant led the development of hybrid striped bass aquaculture, which has grown from a university demonstration project to a $6 million fish farming industry in just 6 years. In addition, Sea Grant has an extraordinary record of success in balancing development with sound marine conservation, working with citizen-volunteers to clean beaches and monitor environmental quality, and promoting the effective management of fisheries and other marine resources for the benefit of future generations. 
Sea Grant is a national leader in the field of marine biotechnology, which has shown enormous promise in truly revolutionizing our use of marine resources. Marine biotechnology research funded by Sea Grant has already succeeded in discovering new pharmaceuticals from the sea, developing new, environmentally-friendly products with a wide range of applications, improving fisheries management and stock assessments through advances at the molecular level, and enhancing environmental remediation through the development of compounds that combat oil spills and other toxic substances in the marine environment. In South Carolina, a study on how the Eastern oyster builds its shell laid the groundwork for the development of alternatives to non-biodegradable water treatment compounds and detergent additives. Based on this research, the Donlor Corporation was formed to synthesize and market these new materials. The company's 50,000 square foot plant will soon begin operations. 
A results-oriented point of exchange, Sea Grant brings Federal and State managers together providing an opportunity for local and regional needs to receive national attention. Conversely, national initiatives are placed on local and regional agendas. This legislation will bolster such exchanges by giving members of the Sea Grant network throughout the country a larger voice in planning national initiatives. 
Moreover, Sea Grant is training the next century's leaders in marine policy. Sea Grant graduate student fellowships give marine policy training to tomorrow's scientists and managers. Efforts like South Carolina's Sea Partners, a joint program sponsored by the South Carolina Sea Grant Consortium and the U.S. Coast Guard, reach out to kindergarten through high school students regarding the problem of marine pollution. Through such programs, young people become interested in ocean and coastal issues and develop life-long respect for conserving the marine environment. 
Mr. President, more than a quarter-century ago, the Stratton Commission outlined a seminal vision for the benefits this Nation could derive from the oceans and coasts. The Sea Grant Program has played a vital part in realizing this vision through the application of sound scientific research to problems affecting our publicly-owned marine resources. The legislation we are introducing today will strengthen the Sea Grant Program, improve the procedures by which it operates, clarify the respective roles of the Federal Government and the universities that participate in the program, and reduce administrative costs. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this important program and this excellent bill.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, let me talk to a very, very important point other than taxes and the increase thereof. 
What we have is the jargon of `I'm against taxes, I'm against taxes, I'm against taxes,' but now we have reached the point where we are increasing spending, because we are not paying our bills. We are increasing spending by $1 billion a day. That is the interest cost on the national debt. 
When Reaganomics commenced in 1981, the interest costs on the national debt were $74.8 billion. We had less than $1 trillion debt, and the interest cost was only $74.8 billion. So looking at it in a historical sense, for 200 years of our history, with the cost of all the wars, we had never reached a $1 trillion debt. We had paid for the Revolution, right on up through World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and yet, in the last 16 years, without the cost of a war, we have jumped to a $5.4 trillion debt. And it is all because you wouldn't pay the bill. You were against taxes, and you were against paying the bill. It is wonderful to go home with that singsong and continue. 
I have a chart right here to show exactly what I am talking about. There is the $74.8 billion in interest costs at the time of President Reagan. This has all the Presidents since Truman, the actual deficits, the actual debt and thereby the forced interest costs, which I call interest taxes. You know, they say death and taxes can't be avoided; neither can interest costs on the national debt. So beware of the colleague who comes and says, `I am against taxes, and I'm never going to vote for taxes,' like this is a luxury we all can afford. I would love that. I can just come here 
and join in the spending. We would never have any taxes and we would all get reelected, but the country would go broke because you have to pay, as this debt goes through the ceiling, the interest cost. 
It is now, as shown here by the CBO figures, at 359 billion, and this chart is somewhat outdated by several weeks. Its actually higher now. Still, there is no question it is $1 billion a day we are spending for nothing. I know my distinguished colleague from North Carolina is interested in highways. So is the Senator from South Carolina. This $1 billion doesn't pay for a single road or a single bridge. It doesn't engage us in any research. It helps us not with health research at the National Institutes of Health. It doesn't pay for defense. It doesn't give foreign aid. It doesn't do anything but represent waste, and we are determined to continue this waste. 
Let me get right to the point about this particular budget resolution because, Madam President, I say advisedly, if there ever was a fraud, this particular budget resolution is a fraud. I say that advisedly to my colleagues in the Senate. The distinguished Senator from Iowa gets up and says, `This is bipartisan, this is bipartisan, and it just passed the House with 350 votes.' Then our distinguished ranking member on this side of the aisle on the Budget Committee said, `This is consensus, we had to get together, we got a consensus,' and thereby is the sizzle that is supposed to sell this steak when the truth of the matter is it is one piece of meat that is an outrageous fraud. 
Let's go to the partisan resolution that we passed in 1993. If you want to see frauds, it is when they get together. When they don't get together, you are getting nearer the truth in budgeting. Back in 1993, Madam President, we cut some 250,000 Federal employees off the payroll. We came in and we created savings, spending cuts of $500 billion, and, yes, we increased taxes. We taxed beer, we taxed gasoline and, yes, we taxed Social Security. 
I can see my colleague on the other side of the aisle talking about that Social Security tax increase that the Senator from South Carolina voted for and, pointing over to this side, the distinguished Senator said, `Ah, they will be hunting you down like dogs in the street and shooting you.' The chairman of the Finance Committee was willing to bet everything on it. He said he would bet his home and everything else. Of course, the poor gentleman is not here anymore, but he was going to bet it all. 
Another distinguished Senator said, `Wait a minute, these tax increases, they'll take the money and spend it, it won't be allocated to the deficit.' And they went down the list deriding, if you please, the partisan budget of 1993, that budget plan. 
What has it given us, without a single Republican vote? The partisan budget is what I want to talk about. This morning, I was listening to early morning TV. I turned on CNN at 6 o'clock, a little before 6, and they had the chief economist for Bear Stearns, and he said this economy is the strongest that he had ever experienced in 24 years. We have the lowest unemployment in those 24 years. We've got inflation down to its lowest point in 35 years. We have created 12.1 million jobs. Business investment is up to the highest point since World War II. The stock market has doubled and, ah, deficits, Madam President, deficits, the deficits for the first time are really starting to increase. I was with President Johnson here in the Senate when we balanced the budget back in 1968 and 1969. Since that time, deficits have been going up, up, and away; the national debt is up, up, up, and away; interest cost spending for nothing is up, up, up and away. But, Madam President, under President Clinton's plan of 1993, deficits have been declining each year, every year, for 5 years. 
Heavens above, what does this instrument do? I hold in my hand the conference report. On page 4, I looked for the word balance. Instead, you see the word deficit. If you want to know what the actual deficit is, all you need do is go to the public debt. For fiscal year 2001, it is $6,307,300,000,000. For fiscal year 2002, instead of balance, it goes up to 
$6,481,200,000,000. So the actual deficit is $173,900,000,000. Here is the figure, here is the document, here is the truth. And while the Senator from South Carolina cries fraud, we have this so-called bipartisan consensus, where we say `I'll take your tax cuts if you take my spending increases and we'll all run around on the floor of the Congress hollering balance, balance, balance.' Everywhere man cries balance, but as for me, give me balance or give me staying the course. I wanted staying the course, but here is what they did instead. 
I hope they get ashes in their mouths, that media crowd, when they say `balance,' `the balanced budget plan,' `the balanced budget resolution that passed,' `the balanced budget.' It is time we stop lying to the American people and tell the truth and show the page. I dare them to refute it. I have the document right here right now. 
So what has happened? Instead of staying the course, Madam President, we have gone off the wagon. 
President Clinton put us on the wagon. We stopped drinking that old deficit whiskey, but now we are taking the bottle back up and we are going to start drinking again. And we are going to get drunk on the wonderful balance--balance, 200-proof--excuse me, $173,900,000,000-proof. That is what we have to drink here this afternoon. 
And how do they do it? It is similar to another time, back in 1990, when I was on the Budget Committee trying to hold the line on Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, with the automatic spending triggers across the board. They abolished them at 1:45 a.m., October 21, early in the morning. And I raised a point of order. They voted me down. That is when I asked for a divorce from Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. It was supposed to be a solid boost toward fiscal responsibility, not a shield they started hiding behind. 
But, again, what they do is take unrealistic savings or spending cuts. We have it over in the Commerce Committee. I talked to the distinguished chairman this morning. You are not going to find $26 billion in spectrum auctions. 
What we did back in 1990 was to revise the economics. We did the same thing again this year. What we did here is, we found $225 billion the day before they made the agreement. That was convenient, wasn't it? They found $225 billion. 
And they came again with backloading, just as they did in 1990. I looked at this particular instrument here, the 1997 conference report, and saw that 72 percent of the spending cuts occur in the last 2 years. They backload it. Unrealistic--not going to happen. 
But worst of all, they go again and start looting the trust funds of America--looting the trust funds, the pension funds, to the extent where we now owe, in 1997, $1.484 trillion. Under this particular resolution, by the year 2002, we will owe just under $2 trillion--$1.992 trillion. 
Now, here is how they do it. They use Social Security moneys. They use the military retirees' money, civilian retirees' pension funds, the unemployment compensation moneys, the highway trust funds--and we are not building highways--and the airport moneys. That is scandalous. 
Right to the point, Madam President, they are going to continue the tax increases that the Senator from North Carolina talks about. They will continue the airport and airways tax on passenger taxes that we pay as airline travelers. But that is not going to airlines. That is going to give you an inheritance tax cut or capital gains tax cut. That is outrageous, scandalous. That is a breach of trust. 
If you want to talk about a breach of trust, I was reading Bob Reich's book. Former Secretary of Labor, Secretary Reich, said, `I'm proud of two things: One, during my 4-year tenure I got a minimum wage; and the second thing, I passed the Pension Reform Act of 1994.' 
And what did that provide? All of us in the Congress said, `Corporate America, you have got to fully fund your pensions so the employees can count on it. You can't use it, you can't raid those trust funds, those pension funds.' 
Madam President, guess what? Just 3 weeks ago, Denny McLain, the all-star championship pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, was sentenced to 8 years in prison because, as head of a corporation, he used the pension funds to pay a corporate debt. 
Here we are using trust funds to pay the Government debt. In private, outside-the-beltway America, you get a prison sentence for this. Here in the wonderful Congress, heavens above, you get the `Good Government Award,' you get consensus, you get bipartisanship, you get one grand fraud. It is time we stopped lying to the American people. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I rise in support of the sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The resolution points out the unreliability of the budget resolution's assumptions about future spectrum auctions. At issue here is the credibility of the entire budget itself. The budget assumes $26.3 billion from spectrum auctions by the year 2002. Such assumptions are not supported by the record. The only explanation is that the Budget Committee and the administration have crafted these assumptions out of thin air. 
We are told by CBO that our budget problems can be solved by auctioning the spectrum. People around here continue to think spectrum is a canned good sitting on a shelf at the FCC. These budget numbers are absolutely irresponsible and CBO knows there is no justification for these estimations. Just look at the most recent auction that was held last month. Last fall, the budget negotiators fell short in their offsets and decided to auction a specific 30 MHz of spectrum. CBO told us the auction would yield $2.9 billion. The auction only yielded $13.1 million. Is this how you balance a budget? 
I must remind the budget negotiators that the law requires the FCC to assign licenses to use the spectrum by auction and that the assignments shall not be based on revenue considerations. Every time the Congress mandates an auction as a budget offset we are violating our own law. And every time we mandate a specific frequency to be auctioned, we are micromanaging in an area we have no expertise in. The spectrum simply is not a canned good sitting on a shelf. Management of the public's spectrum should not be determined on budget numbers. 
Just look at the status of the market for start-up wireless companies. Wall Street is saying there is a glut in the marketplace. There is no financing available for the recent `C' block licensees. How can CBO possibly justify $26.3 billion when you look at the April auction in combination with the problems in the `C' block? 
The FCC recently suspended the interest payments for several of the `C' block licensees because they were unable to meet their obligations to the Treasury. How can CBO justify $26.3 billion when `C' block licensees are going into bankruptcy and being bailed out by the FCC. The Treasury is not receiving any moneys from these auctions. Even the licensees, such as Nextwave, that violated the law are not being required to 
make payments. This is a complete disregard for the law. This is nothing more than an effort to prop up this charade that auctions are good. 
Look at the case of Nextwave. This company bid several billions of dollars for licenses nationwide. When it came time to file complete documentation of their financial backing, the FCC found that this company was in violation of the foreign ownership limits of the Communications Act. To its credit, the FCC issued an order requiring Nextwave to divest itself of certain foreign financial commitments and come into compliance with the law. Now, several months later, Wall Street is still showing no confidence in these wireless ventures, so Nextwave has been unable to raise any capital. 
So, what does the FCC do? The FCC could not afford another embarrassment on the heels of the April fiasco. So the FCC simply waves its previous order and says, don't worry Nextwave, you are in violation of the law but there are more important issues involved here--we must continue the charade that the auctions are working. How can an agency of this Government be so cavalier in its execution of the law is beyond me. Clearly, it pays to be perceived as being too big a player that the FCC cannot let the company go under. 
Tell that to Rocky Mountain Solutions and Carolina PCS. Where was the FCC's consistency in applying the law here? Rocky Mountain Solutions and Carolina PCS had difficulty in raising capital just as the other licensees. Were they in violation of the foreign ownership limits of the law. The answer is `no.' Were they a small company and not perceived as a big player? The answer is `yes.' Where's the consistency? The FCC held to a strict interpretation of their own auction rules--there was no statutory violation--in denying Rocky Mountain Solutions and Carolina PCS request for more time. When a large company violates the law, there is always a creative interpretation of the law in order to keep up the charade. 
How can we have any confidence in the results of these auctions? News reports also indicate that the Department of Justice is investigating collusion and illegal bidding practices in some of the auctions. Obviously, some of the potential bidders think the auctions can be fixed as easily as the budget assumptions. 
The Treasury is not going to get the money CBO had projected. The budget cannot be balanced in this way. Why does the Budget Committee and CBO continue to keep their heads stuck in the sand. How can CBO justify not $26.3 billion 
in light of these recent events? The auctions are not the solution the rhetoric holds them out to be. Clearly the Budget Committee and CBO must have budget blinders on. Their denial of these recent events is further evidence that there is no integrity to these numbers. 
Just look at a breakdown of the budget assumptions and the problems with each item. 
Auction of the returned analog spectrum: The budget proposal requires an auction of 78 MHz of analog spectrum in 2002 with a mandatory return of the analog spectrum in 2006. CBO scores the analog auction at $5.4 billion. There are many practical problems involved here. First, will there really be an interest in this auction when the winning bidders will not have access to the spectrum for at least 4 years? What about possible delays that may occur from zoning ordinances and tower construction problems? In addition, there remains the question of whether there will be widespread demand for digital TV. 
Auction of 36 MHz of spectrum from CH.60-69: This spectrum was originally set aside for the transition to HDTV. No one knows if the FCC plan will actually work. All we have if a computer model from the FCC. All indications are that the FCC'S table of allocations will be challenged at the FCC and possibly in the courts. The budget deal will enshrine the FCC'S plan before we know its implications and possibly foreclose revisions to the FCC'S plan. Such a result would be unacceptably shortsighted. It is highly unlikely this proposal will result in a free and clear nationwide block of spectrum by 2002. 
Spectrum penalty: The Budget Committee Assumes $2 billion from a penalty fee that would be levied against those entities who received `free' spectrum for advanced, advertiser-based television services, but failed to utilize it fully. This is the most incredulous proposal of all. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 authorized the FCC to assess fees on a broadcaster's flexible use of the spectrum--if the broadcaster elects to offer additional services in addition to its free over-the-air programming. CBO staff has no basis to score this provision. There is no evidence in the record to assume the broadcasters will be capable of offering a subscription-based service by 2002. 
Auction of additional 120 MHz: CBO assumes $9.7 billion but where's the spectrum coming from? How can they justify it when the recent auction raised only $13 million when CBO had scored it at $2.9 billion? 
Auction 800 and 888 numbers: Here's a small business tax if you ever saw one. The administration's proposal is simply unrealistic. Large companies will simply outbid all the small players and warehouse popular numbers. Furthermore, the FCC does not have sole jurisdiction of toll free numbers. The United States participates with Canada in the North American numbering plan.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the distinguished Chair. 
No one is more qualified to comment upon the distinguished service of the senior Senator from South Carolina than Robert Byrd of West Virginia, and certainly no one is more eloquent in this U.S. Senate. I thank him for his very generous remarks relative to me, but more particularly the comments relative to Senator Thurmond, because he deserves them. 
I like work, Mr. President, and no one works harder than Strom Thurmond. I love the State of South Carolina, and no one loves South Carolina more than Strom Thurmond. I love this country, and of course no one loves the United States more than Strom Thurmond. 
My senior Senator is the epitome of Robert E. Lee's comment that the most sublime word in the English language is duty. He is the living example of that particular admonition. The fact is that he has done his duty here for the people of the State of South Carolina and this country over the many, many years because he is the greatest disciplinarian I have ever met. He is totally disciplined with respect, not just to his physical being, which has gotten him 94 years, but more particularly his disciplined service and loyalty to his State and country. 
I, too, want to recognize on Sunday he will have most deservedly broken the all-time record for length of service in this U.S. Senate. It will not be the first time the Senator has broken an all time Senate record. We all know he holds the record for the longest extended debate. 
I know others are waiting. They have very generously yielded to me, so I will not attempt to break that record now. However, I will have more to say about Senator Thurmond's record at another time, but I know everyone is interested in hearing from our senior Senator. Let me just say, the greatest privilege for this junior Senator has been to serve under this senior Senator for 30-some years.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this amendment does away with the sweetheart deal that will continue to increase the deficit instead of decreasing the deficit that current budget laws allow. We have had 5 years of decreasing deficits. This amendment continues the decrease of the deficits and actually puts us on a steady path of a balanced budget with no deficit whatsoever by the year 2007. 
I measure my comments and words because we have been engaged in an outrageous charade for 15 years now. I speak advisedly having been on the Budget Committee since its institution and as a former chairman of the Budget Committee. That is one of the reasons I wanted to try to cooperate with the distinguished chairman because he has a tremendous burden of moving this bill along. It was not my intent to hold the legislation up, but to bring into sharp focus the situation we have created for the American people. 
I supported and worked on a balanced budget in 1968 with the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. We did not have a Budget Committee. We called over to the White House to ask President Lyndon Johnson if we could cut another $5 billion so that we could make sure that we had a balanced budget. And he said, `cut it.' 
Mind you me, Mr. President. We had the war in Vietnam: guns. We had the Great Society: butter. Guns and butter. President Lyndon Baines Johnson was awfully sensitive about paying the bill. Wherein, we have no idea in this particular budget resolution of paying the bill. It is a sweetheart resolution, much like we had back in 1985. 
In 1985, the Republicans, to their credit, brought former Senator Pete Wilson to the floor in great pain. Senator Wilson had had an appendectomy, and they brought him in at 1 o'clock in the morning on a stretcher, and they voted to freeze spending, Social Security, and the other particular matters at the time. 
We went over early the next morning to see President Reagan. At that particular time, President Reagan said, `Now, gentlemen, before we start'--we were all gathered around the Cabinet table --he said, `I want to tell you, I had a little visit from the Speaker last evening, Speaker O'Neill.' And we went outside there, you see right underneath that tree, and we had a little toddy, and we talked along, and we finally agreed. The Speaker said, `I'll take your defense if you take my Social Security entitlements.' 
I can see Senator Dole now. He threw down the pencil on the Cabinet table and he said it was a whole waste of time. 
We faced the fire. We did the job that was necessary. So did Senator Domenici. He remembers it. So there was a swap. 
Now, here 12 years later in 1997, we have a swap. President Clinton says, `I'll take your tax cuts if you take my spending increases.' And then everybody races around and hollers `balanced budget.' But folks, there is no balance in this budget. 
Like Patrick Henry might have said, `But as for me, give me either a balanced budget or give me a freeze.' 
Let me show you exactly what is going on here. What we have here are the actual budget realities. And underneath budget realities you can see, Mr. President, the budgets for every President, from Truman right on through President Clinton. 
You see the United States budget, the borrowed trust funds in this particular column, what they call the `unified deficit,' which is the greatest deception of all. For years we have been acting like `unified' meant `net.' Necessarily, the Government has income. It also has spending. And the inference is this is a net deficit after you take it all in. Absolutely false. 
The real actual deficit is really listed in this column, because this one here borrows the money and loots the trust funds. 
We have been looting the Social Security trust fund, as of last year, $550 billion; by 1997, the end of this fiscal year, September 30, it will be $629 billion; and under this budget resolution they take another practically $500 billion, half a trillion bucks to $1.095 trillion. 
They say, `Oh, watch out here in the next century with the baby boomers. The baby boomers are coming. We used to have five or six workers per recipient or retiree. We're only going to have one worker per retiree.' 
Do not watch the baby boomers in the next century. Watch the adults on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Watch the adults that are looting the fund. We are causing the deficit. And it is not any charismatic formula that changes now or in the next century. Incidentally, I voted and will continue to support Senator Kerrey on doing something about entitlements. I am not messianic that you cannot touch entitlements. I voted already with the Danforth-Kerrey solution last Congress. 
But be that as it may, we are using $1.095 trillion from the Social Security trust fund. We have been looting it. After 5 years, the military retirees fund will owe $173 billion and the government will say they ought to start contributing more. If there is any military retiree within the sound of my voice, watch out, because they are already doing this with civilian retirement funds. We have a full $422 billion surplus, and they are saying we have to increase the contribution. Why? If you increase the contribution it goes to the deficit, not civilian retirement. 
It is the same with unemployment compensation and the highway trust fund. We are using $40 billion from the highway trust fund. I have been trying to get funding for a bridge in South Carolina. You can build a bridge in every one of the 50 States with the money we are using to reduce the deficit. 
We are going to continue the airport tax to make way for a net tax cut. So we continue this tax for all the air travelers, but this money does not go to airports. It goes to reduce the deficit. It takes unmitigated gall to extend the airport tax, and then put it toward the deficit. In fact, you don't put it all toward the deficit. Some of it is put toward a tax cut for inheritance taxes or capital gains taxes. And everybody traveling in an airplane wonders why the planes are bumping into each other in the sky and the airport radar is broken down and communications go out and everything else--remember that we are solving the deficit in Washington. We are giving them a unified deficit instead of an actual deficit. 
So turning to the resolution itself, Mr. President, I want you to show me in this document I hold in my hand--Calendar 55, Senate Concurrent Resolution 27--where it says the budget is balanced. Do not give me this nonsense about the conversation that is in the committee report. That is a farce. Look at the actual law, the actual resolution that we are going to pass. If you can find in here, by way of language that there is a balanced budget by the year 2002, I will jump off the Capitol dome. I made that particular charge 4 years ago with the chairman of the Budget Committee, and I have not had to jump yet. Why? 
Just turn to page 2, line 23, under the heading of deficits. `For purposes of the enforcement of this resolution' it says, deficit for fiscal year 2002--$108.7 billion. Then turn the page and get the actual deficit. That only counts under the law of section 13301 about Social Security. But you see, you have all of the other trust funds in there. Anytime you want to add up the annual deficit, just subtract the annual increase of the debt from the present year. In other words, you go here to page 5 and you will find that we have a debt of $6,301,200,000,000 in 1997 but then for the fiscal year 2002 the debt has gone up to $6,473,500,000,000, a deficit of 172 billion bucks. 
Why did they have to borrow? Because that is what the deficit is. Now you can see from this other chart that the deficit this year is $180 billion. That is after 5 years of deficits going down. Under this budget resolution, deficits go up in 1998, 1999, and the year 2000. They go way up. They do not go down. Just look at the figures. 
So after 5 years, instead of a deficit of $180 billion, we will have a deficit of $172 billion. That is, if everything goes right. And then it is still back-end loaded, Mr. President. 72 percent of the spending cuts occur in the last 2 years. It is back-end loaded, as usual, and the back-end loaders will say that those Congresses can do it in the year 2001 and 2002. In any event, the deficit comes out $172 billion. That is according to the Committee's facts and figures. 
What we have to do--and that is why I proposed this amendment--is see if we can just take the entire spending cuts and tax increases and just eliminate them. I want to be realistic. I would like to do away with the so-called spectrum auctions. These are totally out of the question. We got somebody to come in 
last year--and it was verified by the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission--and say that we can get $2.9 billion from this spectrum auction. We had a spectrum auction 6 months later and we got $13.1 million. This is the kind of extreme exaggerated figures we are dealing with. 
But aside from that, take all the figures in the work of the two Budget Committees and the agreement they have made. Eliminate the tax cuts and eliminate the spending increases--the Presidential initiatives--and steady as you go. If we can do that--that is what my amendment calls for--then you actually get a balanced budget. Government on a pay-as-you-go basis in fiscal year 2007. An honest budget. Truth in budgeting. 
Mr. President, we have had conscience. That is why we came back after the Reagan deal with Tip O'Neill. We came back in here and we passed Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. I got it through over on this side over the objection of the majority leader, the majority whip, and the chairman of the Budget Committee. I got 14 votes up and down, the majority of the Democrats joined with the Republicans, in 1985, for that initiative. We could develop that kind of initiative now, instead of this sweetheart deal. 
What good really has occurred as a result of the 1993 vote? Give President Clinton credit. And give this side of the aisle credit, because we could not get a single vote on that side of the aisle. They said they were going to hunt me down in the street and shoot me like a dog. Majority leader Dole said it would cause a recession and the world would end. I wish we had time to read those particular statements made by opponents of the 1993 plan. 
Be that as it may, it worked. And that is the first President that has come around here in the past 15 years, since we started that Reaganomics, and has lowered the deficit. 
To President Clinton's credit, he lowered the deficit in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and we are in the fifth year of lowered deficits, and this particular instrument asks us to go turncoat and start increasing spending so that we can give the rich a tax cut. Inheritance taxes, capital gains taxes, and all of these other things. Somewhere, sometime, Mr. President, we have to tell the American people that we in the Congress have been giving them over 200 billion bucks a year in Government that we are not willing to pay for. We have been buying their votes. 
They are talking about campaign finance reform: it starts on the floor of the U.S. Senate here this evening. If you really want campaign finance reform, quit using the subterfuge to the taxpayers of America and offloading the debt to future years and vote to do away. Keep us on a steady course, because that is exactly what we need to do. 
We are moving this deficit over. I do not know if you can see this on the chart, come up here to President Kennedy. We had already had all the wars under President Kennedy, except the closing days of the war in Vietnam. We had Korea, the world wars, the Revolutionary War and everything else, and we only ran up a debt that cost us $9 billion in interest costs. Now, it is projected by CBO to be $359 billion. So you can see where we have come. 
We are spending $360 billion more--for what? For waste. The crowd that came to town to do away with waste, fraud, and abuse has caused the biggest waste of all. That $360 billion more we are spending is the biggest spending item; it is like taxes. It is almost $1 billion a day. We are sitting around here giving each other the good government award saying, `heavens above, balanced budget, balanced budget, balanced budget,' when we are increasing taxes, or the same as taxes, interest on the national debt, of $1 billion a day. 
Now Mr. President, let me just emphasize exactly the duplicitous conduct here of the Congress up here in Washington. Bob Reich, the Secretary of Labor, retired the other day and he wrote a book. I saw him on TV. He was proud of two things. He said, `You know, we passed the Pension Reform Act of 1994, the 
Pension Reform Act of 1994.' He said, `In addition to getting the minimum wage, I am most proud of that Pension Reform Act because corporate America has to fully secure their pensions so the workers of America moving from one place to another are not going to lose their rights and their entitlements.' 
Now what happens? Mr. President, I refer to the New York Times here just 10 some days ago, May 8, page 26: `Former Star Pitcher Is Sentenced to Prison.'  
Denny McLain, the former star pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, was sentenced today to eight years in prison and ordered to pay $2.5 million in restitution for stealing from the pension plan of a company he owned. 
The two-time Cy Young Award winner, who was the last man to win 30 games in a season, and his business partner were convicted in December on charges that they had stolen $3 million from the pension fund of the Peet Packing Co., then used the money for company debts. . . .' 
We make sure you get a criminal charge and a sentence, and a prison sentence if you steal from the fund, but up here in Washington, the same crowd that passed that, whoopee, there it is. We get the good government award. It is a wonderful thing. You can just steal from these funds; the money is there. I do not see how you could in good conscience come around here with this budget without getting ashes in your mouth. To say balanced budget when you know the instrument itself says we have a deficit of $108 billion. Look on page 4, you can see down there on line 23, the actual amount of $108 billion. Then you can see where they list the debt for each year. As it increased, you can find that the actual deficit in the fiscal year 2002 is 172 billion bucks. 
So after all of this work, we have come from $180 billion--Mr. President, I see the distinguished ranking Member looking at the chart. The actual deficit according for this year according to CBO is $180 billion, not $70 billion. They are bragging about $67 billion. They gave us a figure of $70 billion a couple days ago because we use $110 billion of the trust funds. We steal that money and give it to ourselves, saying we have the deficit down to $70 billion and it is actually $180 billion; and after 5 years under this resolution, by their own figures, it is estimated to be $172 billion. 
So, Mr. President, we have to stop the destruction of the economy of this country. It is a 1 percent drag on economic growth when you run these deficits and pay out all of this money when you don't pay for the Government you have. Here they have 12 million new jobs, low inflation, low interest rates, and the finest growth for 5 years in a row. If we can't stop look, listen, sober up, and begin to put this Government on a pay-as-you-go basis tonight and this week in Washington, DC, in this U.S. Congress, it is never going to happen. And somehow, somewhere, we have to get the free press, the media, to report the truth, because they continue to report misleading figures. They don't quote the actual deficit. All they have to do is read this bill. Find in here where they say they balance the budget in the year 2002. 
On the work sheet, they had the figures down here, Mr. President, of a $1 billion surplus. But when they put out the actual resolution, that is not the case. They hide that in the descriptive language. 
That is the way the system works. It is a cancer. We are spending more money on waste. Interest payments cannot build a school, a highway, and not 1 hour of research. There is no medical treatment. There is nothing for the children of America that we are all concerned about. There is nothing for Head Start, nothing for WIC, nothing for school construction. We could build all the new school buildings all over the country for $360 billion. 
That is how much we have increased our national interest payments with this extravagance and this charade. It is a fraud on the American people. The free press is supposed to keep us honest. They, as co-conspirators, unindicted, joined with us to defraud the American people. 
I hope we can vote for this amendment of mine this evening and stop the fraud and get back to truth in budgeting. It is not too traumatic. Everybody is doing fine this year. 
Just the other day, the Senate said rather than shut down the Government we could take this year's budget for next year. The mayor of any city in this situation would say, `Let's not fire the policemen and firemen. We will just take this budget for the next year.' A Governor of any State would say, `Let's just take this year's budget for next year.' 
We can save $50 billion by doing it. But we don't want to do that. We play this game. We exact this fraud on the American people. Somehow, somewhere it has to stop. 
I yield the floor, and I thank the distinguished chairman of our Budget Committee and our ranking member. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President. The distinguished chairman said in an ideal world that trust funds would be off budget. We live in an ideal world with respect to Social Security. Section 13301, in accordance with the Greenspan commission recommendation--President George Herbert Walker Bush signed legislation on November 5, 1990 that put Social Security off budget. 
That is why, instead of a surplus in this document, you have a deficit of $108 billion. We didn't get the rest of the trust funds off budget like we should have. We should get the highways, airport, retirement trust funds, Medicare off budget. But this document uses the money on the deficit. You are allocating it to the deficit. So the ideal world would be truth in budgeting. 
I thank the distinguished Senator.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair. Right to the point, here is the concurrent resolution. You will not find in this document anywhere a balanced budget. Everyone is running hither and yon: `Balanced budget, balanced budget.' The truth is, if you look on page 5, you have the fiscal year debt to the year 2001 and for the year 2002, the fiscal year debt there going up to $172 billion. Actual deficit, without the use of the trust funds, without looting all the pension funds, there is $172 billion. 
This increases the debt each year every year for 5 years, whereby the interest costs on the debt is a billion a day. We have spending on autopilot of $1 billion a day for absolutely nothing. Not for children. Not for highways. Not for research. Not for foreign aid. Not for defense. We have total waste. 
We have a cancer and it ought to be removed. My particular amendment says do away with the tax cuts in this instrument; do away with the spending increases, the President's initiatives. We are on course for a balanced budget by the fiscal year 2007. Truth in budgeting is the question put before us.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I am proud to join Senator Thurmond in introducing legislation to bring fairness to Federal transportation funding. This legislation would guarantee that the Federal Government would return to each State the same share of gas tax funds that it had paid into the transportation trust fund. 
In 1991, I voted against the current transportation law, known as `ISTEA.' Supporters advocated the legislation as a forward-looking consolidation of Federal highway programs, but the heart of the bill--the way it distributed money--looked backward in every sense. It tightly tied each State's future funding to past funding levels. It used old census data. It used old formula factors which do not even pass the `straight face' test. As the GAO reported, `the Congress elected not to change the basic formula structure' and thus the key factors in the formula are `irrelevant' and `divorced from current conditions.' In other words, we are currently targeting more than $20 billion of taxpayer funds to the wrong places for the wrong reasons. 
South Carolina bears the brunt of this inequity. In 1995, South Carolina received only 52 cents back for each dollar it paid to the highway trust fund. Over the period of ISTEA, South Carolina received only 70 cents back on the dollar. Let me add that I am not unaware of the overall Federal funding situation in South Carolina. South Carolina gets back more Federal tax money than its citizens contribute. Mr. President, that is as it should be. We are one Nation, and some parts of the Nation have lower average incomes. That is no excuse for targeting highway funds in a way that an objective study found to be `irrelevant' and `divorced from current conditions.' 
It is rare that a $20 billion problem has a simple solution. I refer again to the independent assessment of the GAO, which said that basing Federal payments to States on the amounts States paid in would, would meet two major, commonsense objectives of any highway program: 
First, it would be a `relatively simple and direct method of fund distribution.' 
Second, it would `tend to correlate highly with highway needs, particularly for major highways.' 
Furthermore, the GAO found that basing funding on gas tax paid in would effectively kill two birds with one stone by accounting for highway needs and for equity between States with one formula factor. 
Mr. President, a program that does not target funds to today's needs, and which mires States and the Congress in arcane complexity, cries out for revision. The legislation we introduce here today is a good starting point to better address our Nation's highway needs. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, last Congress we were able to enact some important reforms to greatly improve access to health care for millions of Americans. The Kennedy-Kassenbaum Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act improved the insurance marketplace so workers with preexisting medical conditions or who were at risk of losing health insurance when they changed jobs are more likely to have coverage. 
We were successful because we applied certain principles learned in the experience with President Clinton's Health Care Security Act. In the Senate, we worked in a bipartisan manner to fix a targeted number of our Nation's problems in a way that does not completely overhaul our current health care system. Because we did not fix the whole system, there is still work to be done. Today, Senator Hutchinson and I are proposing the next step in an incremental approach. We hope that the Senate can continue to work in a bipartisan way to achieve additional reforms to improve our citizens' access to what many say is the finest health care system in the world--if you have a ticket to get in. 
The Expanded Portability and Health Insurance Coverage Act that we introduced yesterday focuses on improving the health insurance market place so that workers in small businesses and their families can enjoy the health benefits and freedom from fear of a catastrophic illness as employees of large businesses. 
Many of us are greatly concerned about the 40 million or so Americans who currently have no health insurance, 10 million of them children. Looking closely at the problem, you see that over 80 percent of those uninsured live in a family with an employed worker who is likely to work for a small employer or be self-employed. Only 26 percent of workers in companies of 10 or less employees get health insurance through their employer, while virtually all workers in Fortune 500 companies do so. This leads to the inevitable conclusion that, in order to get a handle on the problem of the uninsured, we have to address the health insurance marketplace for small employers. 
A recent study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, entitled `Small Business Problems and Priorities,' ranked the cost of health insurance as the No. 1 problem that small businesses face today. The great majority of small business owners want to provide coverage for their workers and families but they do not have affordable coverage options currently available to them. 
Our bill seeks to address this problem by allowing small businesses to form multi-state purchasing groups under a single set of national rules. This is done through the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. Such a change in law will make health insurance more affordable for small businesses in several important ways: 
First, it will lower the administrative costs of health care coverage for small employers, 
Second, it will give greater bargaining power to small employers so they can negotiate better deals with the health plans and providers, and 
Third, it will eliminate the need for small businesses to have to comply with some costly benefits mandated in some States. 
Administrative costs account for nearly 30 percent of health insurance premiums, so lowering administrative costs will result in decreased premiums. A study by the Congressional Research Service and the Ways and Means Committee of the House of Representatives shows that the administrative costs of insurance for small employers are up to 30 percent higher than for large employers due to the fact that it costs insurers and health plans more to market to these small groups. The per-person cost of processing claims and the general management of benefits is also much higher. Costs are dramatically lower for larger groups. Allowing small employers to form large groups will result in lower administrative costs. 
The bill, in permitting the formation of multi-state purchasing groups under ERISA, will give small employers much greater purchasing power than they have under current law. It will be far easier and safer for the small businesses to self-insure through a purchasing group. Enabling small employers to do this will give the groups the opportunity to get better value for each health care dollar spent. They will be able to act like large employers and directly contract with health plans and providers. In negotiating with health plans and providers like larger companies, they will be able to actively negotiate lower prices in exchange for a large group of users. This will make health insurance more affordable. 
That mandated benefits significantly add to the cost of providing health insurance was documented in an August 1996 GAO Report, `Health Insurance Regulation, Varying State Requirements Affect the Cost of Insurance.' Also, a study by the NFIB Education Foundation shows that State-mandated benefits can add up to 30 percent to the cost of health insurance premiums. Essentially the bill levels the playing field so that small employers can operate health plans under the same set of rules as large employers. Allowing small businesses to operate under a single set of national rules will eliminate the need for such groups to have to comply with each State's list of rules regarding benefit packages, claims and solvency. Instead, the groups will need to follow one set of rules under the ERISA. The rules are changed so that consumer protections and safeguards will apply to these multi-state purchasing groups. For example, only a legitimate association that is certified by the U.S. Department of Labor could become a purchasing group. They are subject to strict standards concerning sponsor eligibility, nondiscrimination, fiduciary, solvency, reporting, disclosure and plan termination standards. States would be permitted to enforce these Federal standards. 
While it is difficult to predict exactly how much coverage will increase through this legislation, at a hearing held by the House Education and Workforce Committee last year, the National Business Coalition on Health and the National Association of Manufacturers predicted about 20 million uninsured adults and children could be covered as a result of this legislation. The Employee Benefit Research Institute estimates that 55 percent of uninsured children have a parent who works full time for the entire year. So a great majority of the uninsured children are likely to benefit from this bill as well. And, the beauty of this legislation is that it enables millions of currently uninsured people to have health care through the private sector, so no new entitlements involving huge costs to the Government are involved. 
The Expanded Portability and Health Insurance Coverage Act gives us an opportunity to enact essential reform to strengthen our current health care system. It is an important step forward in the effort to find solutions to our Nation's health care problems and I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me clarify what is happening in highway funds in this appropriations bill. 
This bill includes $139 million to correct an honest error at the Treasury Department. That error in 1994 rippled through the highway formula and cost South Carolina $9.2 million last year. Making whole all the states which lost funds requires $139 million, and I commend the Appropriations Committee for including these funds. 
The bill also includes another $794 million. The administration requested $318 million of these funds, and the rest were added by the Appropriations Committee. The administration requested the $318 million in what was really an erroneous attempt to correct the Treasury Department error I have mentioned. 
The rest of the funds--$475 million--have no relationship by any stretch of the imagination to the error we are supposedly correcting. They are simply added for some States that disagree with what current law provided them this year, and these States happen to be a majority in the Senate. In other words, today we are watching `might make right' in the allocation of highway funds. 
Senators Warner and Graham have made a proposal that is sensible, right, and in compliance with the highway law we are living under until a new reauthorization passes. They propose fixing the $139 million error, and then allocating the rest of the funds under current law. Mr. President, that is the right thing to do. 
The underlying issue here is a promise made in ISTEA to guarantee any State 90 percent of the funds it paid into the highway fund. This year--for the first time in the 6 years of ISTEA--keeping that promise requires us to trim the historical surplus that some States have long received in order to help a smaller number of States lose a little less. So the winner States are breaking the promise. They are a majority, and they do not want to guarantee 90 percent. 
Mr. President, we should debate the highway formula when reauthorization comes before the Senate. Until then, we should keep the promises made in 1991. We should also correct the error that everyone agrees occurred. I know where the votes are on this, but I want to set the record straight.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased that we have been able to work out an agreement that supports the amendment by Senator Murray and Senator Gorton. This amendment provides $7 million in emergency assistance to deal with the impact on northwest fisheries. 
Senator Murray has worked tirelessly on this issue. She has refused to take no for an answer. These northwest fishermen should know they have a champion here in Washington DC who really understands their industry. I know that from my work on this Appropriations Committee and from my service on the authorization committee that oversees the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
There are no free emergencies any more with this crowd. This particular amendment takes advantage of satellite procurement savings that can be achieved because of the particulars of how NOAA reimburses NASA. So it is fully offset. 
I truly appreciate the willingness of our chairman, Senator Stevens, and our subcommittee chairman, Senator Gregg, to work out a compromise that allows this assistance move forward. 
Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, what it allows is the Census Bureau to continue to plan to conduct a census that uses statistical sampling but the Congress under the leadership here of the distinguished Senator from Alaska, and our chairman and ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which has jurisdiction as the authorizing committee, can change that in the future after careful review and oversight. 
There is a deep misgiving among some of the Members with respect to any kind of taking of polls or handling of numbers or statistics particularly after somehow the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the Department of Justice naturalized a million immigrants to be able to vote last November. And so it is natural that they wanted to make certain that the statistical sampling related to the year 2000 census be taken in a totally professional manner. We have it, we think, on course to be as professional as it can be. Ms. Riche and the professional staff at the Bureau of the Census are just outstanding. 
What the Members need to understand that what really occurred after the 1990 census was it became clear that all kind of undercounting and overcounting occurred, varying in areas. The undercount was especially severe among low-income people, minorities, and rural areas. Congress told the Census to find a way to conduct the next census in a more accurate way at less cost. The Census Bureau went to the National Academy of Sciences. The National Academy of Sciences, after a thorough study, says go ahead, send the forms out, which are really reported back about some 60 percent or so. We get another 30 percent by going around door to door, through telephone calls, and followup. That last 10 percent is next to impossible in some places to find, in the innercity, in the rural areas, and in areas with high native American populations. Some of the census takers themselves--we got some 300,000 earning around $13 an hour--they might get fatigued some afternoons or near a weekend, or not be willing to enter into some areas or buildings. The way it was handled in 1990, the followup was far too subjective. 
So the Academy of Sciences looked at, studied, and have had the best of minds in a bipartisan fashion--this has not been a partisan issue--and they recommended that census find a new way to estimate those hard to reach populations. They told census to use the same statistical methodologies that the bureau uses for all its products that this Nation relies on. They recommended to go ahead with this kind of sampling advancing forward to take the census for fiscal year 2000. 
We really were disturbed in the Appropriations Committee that if we did not allow it to continue at this particular point--this is absolutely not final, of course--that we were going to set a course whereby we were going to have to spend another half a billion bucks trying to go door to door with the same ailments and disturbances and inaccuracies that we suffered back in the 1990 census. And we would end up not only paying more but getting back into court with lawsuits again and everything else of that kind. 
Mind you me, there is over $100 billion in Federal programs allocated according to this census data, the Members of the House of Representatives are apportioned according to this census, and we want to be as nonpartisan and as thorough and as scientific as we can possibly be in its taking. 
To the credit of the Governmental Affairs Committee, which is the authorizing committee, they have been working diligently on this issue. Our distinguished chairman, Senator Thompson of Tennessee, I have talked with him, and our ranking member, Senator Glenn. They have already experienced two hearings which have more or less confirmed that we are on course, but they have yet to finalize any action taken this particular year. 
So what we wanted to do at the moment in this particular emergency supplemental was not stop anything but express our outright concern that this particular census is not to be used politically. It has to be done professionally. 
I thank the distinguished chairman of our Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and his distinguished staff for going along working with the Department of Commerce and myself all last evening and this morning. I think this particular compromise here will allow us to continue on course but not lock in the short form irrevocably. Census can continue to do its planning and dress rehearsals to ensure that the next census is more accurate. 
With that said, I yield the floor.  
Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, when it comes to sampling, I think everyone should understand that we are very familiar with it. Almost every product put out by the census, or from data supplied by the Census Bureau is based on sampling. We quote the gross domestic product. The Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan and others use GDP and inflation statistics based on very small samples. The monthly unemployment rate that all the members listen for. Well that is based on sampling of some 60,000 household of the 115 million households in this Nation. That is less than 1 percent. And, with the full decennial census, the Bureau has been using sampling for the long form for almost 60 years. 
And if there is one group that really believes in sampling, it is Members of Congress. We come here with a poll taken, every one of us. And for a State my size with 3.5 to 4 million people, a sample of 870 to represent that number of people is readily considered authoritative. So we are doing the best and we are doing it professionally. I believe that we are on course now with this particular compromise.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as some say, `Eureka, I have found an honest man.' Well, here, I have found an honest journalist. I don't know who wrote the editorial in USA Today on yesterday, but it is entitled `Sham Balancing Act Hides True Scope of the Deficit.' 
It is not my intent to come out and immediately take the so-called balanced budget plan and trash it. It moves in the right direction. But I want to be constant and persistent until we finally have not just the USA Today realize it has been a sham balancing act, but I want everyone to realize that it is in the law. Section 13301, signed by President Bush on November 5, 1990, says that thou shalt not in this Government use Social Security trust funds in any report of a so-called unified budget or unified deficit. It is the most fraudulent use of the word unified because, to the lay person, unified suggests it is net. In other words, the Government spends money and it also receives receipts or receives money. And the inference is, with unified budgets and deficits, that is the real net or true balance or true deficit. Totally false. 
The truth of the matter is that we have been engaged in a sham now for several years respecting the use of trust funds. Right to the point, Mr. President, what we have is a list of these trust funds here that have been consumed and spent, not just borrowed. I have the March figures. As of the end of March--this is the most updated figure--Social Security will be owed $582 billion; Medicare, HI, $122 billion; SMI, $31 billion, for a total of $153 billion in Medicare. 
Military retirees the land around, you should know they are 
spending your money, which has been set aside under the law for your retirement. That particular fund is $129 billion shy because of this deceit. Civilian retirement--all civil servants within the sound of my voice, remember, the civil service retirement trust fund has now been spent to the tune of $395 billion. Unemployment compensation that the small employer in America pays in regularly, as well as the large ones, that is shy some $51 billion, that particular savings amount. The highway trust fund--we borrowed that money, too, but not for highways. If anybody says a bridge is down, like in my backyard where we have been trying to get a river bridge that has been declared unsafe for 20 years now, that money is already spent to the tune of $22 billion. We can build a river bridge in each of the 50 States with the highway money used to obscure the size of the deficit, the debt, and the interest cost on that national debt. Airports and airways, $6 billion; railroad retirement, $18 billion; $63 billion in the Federal finance bank and the other particular trust funds, for a total of how much? $1.419 trillion. Now, we owe $1.419 trillion.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is another $456 billion that will be spent. So as of the year 2002, we look around at Social Security and everybody is saying, wait a minute, the baby boomers are going to come in 15 years, and the baby boomers will be in a foot race trying to get ahead of us politicians because we are way ahead of them spending this money. We will owe, in the year 2002, in excess of a trillion dollars. That is why this chart has been brought forward. Last year, when we said the annual deficit was $107 billion, the truth of the matter is, it was $261 billion. We borrowed, in order to make it $107 billion, or we spent from the various savings funds here at the Federal level, $154 billion. Why not borrow another $107 billion and call it balanced? That is the gamesmanship that is going on. 
I went home over the weekend and they found $225 billion over at CBO. I have heard that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle were informed of this revenue before the Democratic negotiators were. They went back and forth with respect to OMB and CBO while knowing this extra money was available. You can see the gamesmanship involved. But the hard-core fact is that they have projected, up until now, $360 billion in interest costs on the national debt. That is, while we are debating, we are increasing spending a billion dollars a day for absolutely nothing and adding it to the national debt. So that by the end of the 2002, the debt will exceed $6 trillion, and the interest costs on that will be in excess of $500 billion. 
So what will occur is, at the end of this particular budget that we are all talking about as balanced, domestic spending, which is cut from current policy, defense, which is cut from current policy, will be exceeded by the interest costs on the national debt. The whole time we are going through this charade, they said `sham balancing act' in this particular editorial, they totally ignore section 13301 of the Budget Act and ignore the reality that we will have spent in excess of $2 trillion in trust funds when we get through. 
Mr. President, what we really have is a disaster on our hands. While we are talking about waiting for the baby boomers 15 years out, Social Security is paid for. The taxes are there. We have a surplus, supposedly, of $581 billion. But that $581 billion is not in the desk drawer; it is a little old IOU. We have a surplus in Medicare right this minute, which they are talking about going broke; in Medicare we have a $153 billion surplus. That is paid for. But they are all talking about deficits. Why? Because we are spending it and using this subterfuge of a unified budget, a unified deficit. Until we sober up from that, Mr. President, we are going down, down, down, adding to the debt each year, adding then to the interest cost each year, and then adding to the automatic spending, the spending on automatic pilot at a billion dollars a day. That is spending for absolutely nothing. 
If we had been responsible--interest payments were only $75 billion when President Reagan came to town; we have added over $285 billion in interest spending; that $285 billion is what all of the particular negotiating since January has been about--we could have taken defense, research, technology, education, the environment, and all of these particular needs. 
Point: We are spending the trust fund money up here in Washington. We are telling the people we are not spending it. `It is unified. Don't worry about it.' And we are taking their savings fund and running away with it. And whoever is going to be around here on the bridge to the next century, remember. It is not going to be a bridge. We are going right straight over the cliff. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I think the pending business is an amendment by our distinguished colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, to strike an amendment that was included in the markup of the urgent supplemental at the Appropriations Committee level. I had this included. I think others had it, too. But in my particular instance, it was at the request of a constituent, Hoffman-La Roche, an eminent drug manufacturer, in the city of Florence. They are constructing a facility there now. We are very proud to have them. They are very responsible folks. 
This particular issue was dealt with in full debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate last year by the distinguished Senator from Utah, who dealt with the matter of copyright and patent legislation as the chairman of our Judiciary Committee. What really occurred--it is sort of complicated, but what really occurred is there are two different rulings with respect to the longevity of a particular patent. Under the regular law, a patent is granted for 17 years from the date of the issuance of the patent. In the early 1980's, all patents in existence at that time were granted 2 extra years as recognition that the approval process was resulting in much shorter usable life for the patented drugs. In this case the approval process took 11 years. Along came the GATT agreement. Trying to conform to the global competition and the global rule of 20-year patents, we passed a law which allowed a company to choose to operate under the current U.S. system or to operate a patent for 20 years from the date of the filing of the patent. The courts interpreted these two laws in a way that denied Hoffman-La Roche this choice. I, as well as many Members of the Senate including the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, know this ruling to be in contravention to the intent of the laws in question and this amendment simply sought to right this wrong. 
The drug in question is Toradol. It is a remarkable drug. Of course, it is the pain killing drug with which you can retain total consciousness, and it was administered to the President with his particular knee operation. The patent is to expire on May 16, 1997. As you can guess, the generic drug folks are interested whenever a patent expires, and my intention was to address the generic drug problem. Many a time the generic drug folks, along with consumer organizations, will come and say, `Oh, we can get it much cheaper.' On that particular point, there is no question. The question is to not only make profits, but make enough for other reinvestments to make another miracle drug. So, while I have worked and defended the generic movement in our country, from time to time on close study you can see that the manufacturer himself has a cause and a case and it ought to be defended. That was the intent in this particular amendment. 
Right to the point, everybody wants to either vote or dispose and move along with the underlying disaster supplemental measure rather than this one particular manufacturer and this one particular drug. Under the circumstances here on the floor, I have not been able to talk in caucus or to my colleagues about it. The fact is, I was told, when I came in this morning, it was being worked out. 
Specifically, while we had taken care, I understand, of the drug administered orally with the generic drug folks and consumer groups that called with respect to it, the drug taken intravenously had not been cleared with the generic groups. While we have gone to great lengths to solve all the problems with and get this amendment cleared, we have not been able to do so. It was my hope that we could get the best of both worlds and provide a remedy for a company hurt by a misinterpretation of the law and also get generic competition onto the market faster than it would have without this amendment. That, I thought, was being worked out this morning, but I understand, now, the Senator from Minnesota has not agreed to that. 
I will be prepared, under the circumstance here, to withdraw that amendment and not cause the colleagues to vote. But I do not think, technically or parliamentarily, you can withdraw a section of a bill. So I will be glad to go along with the Senator from Minnesota on a voice vote and vote along with him at this particular time, to see if we cannot get this straightened out. 
The staff, floor and all, have been anxious. They are trying to move this particular bill. I know Senator Stevens has been very anxious to do it. I appreciated being included in the Appropriations Committee version. I still think it is with absolute merit. But, under the circumstance, now I am prepared to go along with the motion of the Senator from Minnesota to strike and we will come back in at the appropriate time. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on this past Sunday, the Outlook section of the Washington Post published articles regarding Uncle Sam's red ink. The unfortunate part is that these stories highlight is that debt is nothing new for the United States. While it is making us poor, one article claims that is has made us prosperous. 
I rise today to make the point that our debt is not only making us very poor, it is making us totally inadequate at the governmental level in Washington, DC. All our moneys are being expended for interest costs on the debt rather than active Government. 
Specifically, I want to talk about the here and now rather than the next millennium. Dick Morris detailed in his book, Mr. President, that he had counseled President Clinton, running for reelection last year, that the budget deficit was a boring subject. He claimed that nobody was really interested in it and that the President should instead focus on school uniforms and child curfews, family values and everything else.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on the matter of the budget realities, I have listed here beside the different Presidents from 1945 right on through President Clinton's first term including estimates for 1997--the different years of the U.S. budget, the actual budget. 
Incidentally, these are Congressional Budget Office figures. These are not tricky figures. They are the ones that we all rely upon. 
Then I have listed the borrowed trust funds. That is all the trust funds that are borrowed--not just Social Security but the military retirees trust funds, the civil service retirees trust funds--there is still a surplus in the Medicare account--Medicare trust fund, the Federal finance bank, the moneys we have been using from the airport and airways improvement fund, the highway trust fund. You can go right on down the different trust funds that are borrowed. 
And then the unified deficit which is the real culprit here in this particular budget fraud. I refer directly to the fraud that occurs when we cannot get the truth out. That is the purpose of my rising again today, to somehow, somewhere, sometime talk the truth because it is not an accurate figure when you say unified. They say, well, that is the net amount in and out. It is not net amount in and out. It is the amount you borrow and you have to replace. 
The distinguished Presiding Officer, being a certified public accountant, knows exactly what I am speaking about. If you were trying to use that unified deficit on your return, the borrowed moneys on April 15, they would cart you off to jail. You are not allowed to do that. But we do that in Washington, and then the media, the market, the Government and everyone else continue to cite the unified deficit as a sort of net figure as to what the real deficit is. 
On the contrary, the real or actual deficit is listed in the next column with the national debt going up and the annual increase in the amount of spending in order to take care of the interest costs. 
So I will be glad to show this particular chart in an enlarged manner. What we have here, Mr. President, is again the Presidents. You have the years. You have the United States budget, the actual budget, the borrowed trust funds, the unified deficit with trust funds. Then the actual deficit without trust funds. That is without the borrowings, what the actual deficit is. 
Those are the terms upon which we must speak. If we are going to continue to talk of a unified net kind of deficit, which is not net, the fraud will continue. There is not any question in my mind that taxes are too high. But taxes are too high because of the interest cost on the national debt. 
All you need do is go to look at our actual interest costs, let us say, before President Reagan came in, just a few short years ago. The interest costs in 1980, going straight across, are $74.8 billion. Well, that is $74.8 or $75 billion. You now in 1997 have listed $360 billion. We have increased spending $285 billion for nothing. You are not getting a road paved. You are not getting a library built. You are not getting research over at the National Cancer Institute. You are not providing for a stronger defense. You are not engaging more in foreign assistance or anything else of that kind. You are getting absolutely nothing for the past profligacy and waste. 
Bottom line. The crowd that came to town in 1981, against taxes and against waste, has taxes on automatic pilot, waste on automatic pilot of $1 billion a day. 
Now, let me say that one more time. At $360 billion--this figure, of course, is the January figure from the Congressional Budget Office, and it does not take into account the recent increase in interest rates by Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve. So that is bound to be at least 365. 
So we have interest payments, that is, annual increases in spending on interest that total $1 billion a day. And it has to be 
paid just like taxes. It is not like increases in other spending which we could forego, but it has to be paid. So that is why I categorically say the crowd that said they were going to come to town in the early 1980's and do away with taxes have put taxes on an automatic pilot of $1 billion a day. 
The crowd that came in town in 1981 and said they were going to be against waste, fraud and abuse--and I was appointed on the Grace Commission, got an award for it and recognition. It was a wonderful instrumentality that went through the Government and tried to cut out all the waste. But we have really increased the waste because we get absolutely nothing for it. 
Now, we increased spending since 1980 by $285 billion. If we had not done that, we would have $285 billion here for us to sit around in the Senate Chamber and spend or give back to the American people. It would be a wonderful thing. We could get all the highways. We wouldn't have any ISTEA bill. We could take care of all the demonstration projects you could possibly imagine. We could go ahead with star wars immediately. We could have all these things that they want for education, student loans and everything else. But instead, we are spending the money and not getting anything for it. 
That is the cancer that we have in the fiscal affairs of the U.S. Government that is totally obscured by news articles like those that claim to show how debt has made us prosperous, like all we have to do is borrow again and that debt has always been with us. 
Well, Mr. President, it has not been with us all the time for the simple reason you can see that when President Reagan came to town--we have it here--the national debt was $994.8 billion. When President Reagan came to town, after 204 years of history, after 38 Presidents, Republican and Democrat, after the cost of all the wars, the Revolutionary, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Mexican War, the Spanish-American War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the cost of all the wars never gave a national debt of $1 trillion. It was less than $1 trillion after 204 years of history. But in 16 years without a war, because the cost of the war in Desert Storm was paid for by the Saudis and others, so in 16 years without the cost of a war, we have gone from less than $1 trillion to almost $5.5 trillion. Up, up, and away with the interest costs, interest spending, interest taxes going up, up and away and added to the debt to the tune of $1 billion a day and we never want to seem to recognize that. 
Right to the point, Mr. President. If you take all the deficits from President Truman, the actual deficits and average them out right on down to President Reagan, 25 years, if you took all those deficits, the average would be about $20 billion a year. 
Now, in contrast, take the deficits for the last 16 years without the cost of a war, without the so-called guns and butter, as they say; but rather, with spending cuts of President Reagan for 8 years, spending cuts of President Bush for 4 years, spending cuts of President Clinton, because he brought the deficit down--his 1993 plan included $500 billion in deficit reduction. Even with all the cuts, we have been giving an average deficit each year to the American people of $277 billion more in Government than we are willing to pay for. Let us not just talk abstractly about a deficit. We are actually giving away $277 billion more in Government than we are actually willing to pay for. 
Let us go to just last year and the campaign, when both Senator Dole and President Clinton used $107 billion, the unified deficit figure, like it was net. That was not the case at all. In order to get to a $107 billion deficit, they had to borrow from all the pension funds. Why not borrow another $107 billion and call it balanced? The actual deficit was $261 billion. You could not get that cited or printed in the press. We gave it to them time and time again. We will give it to them again this morning. I defy you to find it in the morning paper or cited in the evening news on TV. They do not want to say what the actual deficit is. They want to use this obscure figure of unified, trying to act like we ought to be encouraged. That is why they are getting together on a budget deal. They will get together on a deal that will obscure truth in budgeting. 
This fraud has to stop somehow, somewhere, because it is not a bridge to the next millennium. We are going over a cliff by the year 2000. Our domestic budget is $266 billion. Our defense budget is $267 billion. Those two budgets together are slightly over $500 billion. But you will soon have interest costs exceeding the combined cost of both the domestic and defense budgets. We are not building a bridge, we are digging a hole. 
The first order of business, they say, when you are in a hole and you are trying to get out, is stop digging. We continue to dig, and we do it in a dignified fashion around here and praise each other. The President and the Congress have gotten together on a budget agreement and all of that kind of stuff. But watch for the gimmicks in it. 
The biggest gimmick that is never talked about is the fact people consistently obscure the actual size of the deficit. To get it down to $254 billion, we still have to find $110 billion, that is without any cuts, just continuing what we call current policy. I sat at the budget table today to try to get to a budget now of $1.632 trillion. That is current policy. That is domestic of $266 billion, defense of $267 billion, entitlements of $859 billion. That is $1.382 trillion. Just put in the minimal figure $360 billion, that is $1.742 trillion. To bring it down, then, to the $1.632 trillion, I have to find $110 billion. I have to cut entitlements, domestic, defense combined $110 billion. 
That is my job, conscientiously going to the budget table to sit as a member of the Budget Committee, where I have been since we instituted the budget process in 1974. But, instead of discussing the cuts and how are we going to get on top of this downward spiral of interest costs or interest taxes being increased $1 billion a day, instead of that, we are getting letters now to do away with the inheritance tax. We are getting letters now to do away with the capital gains tax. We are getting letters now from Steve Forbes and that other crowd: Let's just get a flat tax and do away with the IRS, the Internal Revenue System, and everything else of that kind. 
Mr. President, we ought to understand once and for all that we are engaged in a fraud that continues to be obscured, due to the fourth estate. The fourth estate has taken it on as a religion, almost, of reciting the unified deficit as if it were the actual deficit. The truth of the matter is, the actual deficit is substantially more. It has averaged $277 billion last year, the year before, and the last 16 years. We have been giving out some $277 billion in Government that we are not willing to pay for. 
We had that Reaganomics. Yes, there is even talk about that--cut taxes and we will get growth, we will grow out of deficits. No mayor in his right mind of a city tries that. No Governor in her right mind has tried that. There was an exception up in New Jersey. Governor Whitman up there said, `Whoa, tax cuts work.' But look at the papers last week. She is now doing two things. She is borrowing, raiding the pension funds, just like we are doing in Washington. She has learned from Washington. And she is calling for a bond issue to cover her financial situation. It does not work. 
There is no free lunch. Long since, we should have understood it. If I have to come every day and point this out, I will because these facts and figures are not disputable. They are not political. They are not Democratic figures or Republican figures. These are Congressional Budget Office figures. That is the actual debt that has gone to exceed $5 trillion. 
I see from the Presiding Officer that my time is just about up. Let me just say one word. I thank the distinguished Chair and the distinguished Senator from Georgia for indulging me just one second more. 
What we have is a fraud on the American public. We have to expose this fraud. We have to speak to truth in budgeting. We have to come up with an actual plan that will eliminate this deficit financing by raiding the trust funds in America. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to remark on the outstanding Senate career of my long time science staffer, Pat Windham, whose last day on the Senate Commerce Committee staff will be tomorrow. At the end of this month, Pat will be returning to the San Francisco area where he grew up. With his wife Arati and their cute infant daughter Katie, he will be living within shouting distance of Stanford University, his undergraduate alma mater, and across the bay from the University of California at Berkeley where he received his masters in public policy. 
Pat first came to the Senate in the late 1970's for a 2-year stint on the Commerce Committee staff as a congressional fellow in connection with his doctoral program at Berkeley. He returned in 1982, when he served for 2 years as a legislative assistant on my personal staff. Since 1984 he has been the Commerce Committee's resident expert on science policy, touching on virtually every science and technology issue you can imagine. 
Early in his career here Pat was deeply involved in the ocean and coastal issues that are so important to the recreational and commercial needs of South Carolinians. On my personal staff he also mastered the myriad complexities of the Nation's nuclear energy policy, acquiring detailed knowledge of 
nuclear powerplant technology and waste storage problems. 
In his service for the Commerce Committee's Science, Techology, and Space Subcommittee, he has had principal responsibility for overseeing technology policy and industrial competitiveness. I strongly believe that the key to our national economic strength is the link between technology and industry. Pat shares this vision, and has made an enormous difference to me in developing programs that are targeted at forging that link. One such program is the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, which facilitates the transfer of manufacturing technology directly from the laboratory to the operations of the small- and medium-sized firms that carry out the bulk of U.S. manufacturing. Thanks in large part to Pat's tenacity in working to steadily improve the program, there are now locally run and cost-shared manufacturing extension centers in South Carolina and throughout the Nation that provide essential technical assistance to thousands of small manufacturers. 
Another such program is the Advanced Technology Program [ATP], overseen by the National Institute of Science and Technology within the Department of Commerce. ATP recognizes the intense investor pressure on American companies to cut costs and spend limited research dollars on projects with short-term payoffs. It is a peer-reviewed, industry-led undertaking that provides matching funds for the development of advanced technologies--in areas like electronics, information technology, robotics, advanced materials, and biotechnology--that will be central to the formation of new industries in the 21st century. Pat spearheaded the creation of ATP in the late 1980's, and now that ATP is beginning to bear fruit, he has fought tirelessly against efforts to undercut its effectiveness. 
During his 17 years of Senate service, Pat has earned wide respect and affection from Members of Congress and staff, administration officials, and the scientific community for his commitment to the development of sound science and technology policy. He has an extraordinary capacity to digest large amounts of highly technical information in a number of scientific fields and communicate it clearly to decisionmakers. Further, in spite of his intense dedication to achieving his legislative goals, Pat has made loyal and enthusiastic friends among allies and adversaries alike. 
I have no doubt that in his new surroundings Pat will find ways to further his splendid contributions to our Nation's industry and technological progress. He has certainly been everything I have wanted, and more, as a staff professional, and I thank him for his excellent work. 
I wish Pat, Arati, and little Katie the best of fortune in all their future endeavors.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have just submitted legislation at the desk to create a separate enrollment version of the line-item veto. 
Mr. President, this is the same bill word for word that passed the U.S. Senate on March 25, 1995, by a bipartisan vote of 69 Senators. It was introduced at the time by Senator Dole. 
It follows a long history of efforts on behalf of the separate enrollment approach and is different to the enhanced rescission which has been found unconstitutional by the district court. 
Back in 1985, I worked alongside Senator Mattingly, and we got 58 votes for the separate enrollment version. 
We passed similar legislation in the Senate in 1995, but lost out in conference when the conferees endorsed the House approved enhanced rescission approach rather than the separate enrollment version. 
But the courts have now struck down that law. They have ruled that once a bill is signed into law, under the Constitution, the President does not have the authority to repeal laws. Such a repeal is a legislative power which article I of our Constitution reserves for the Congress. 
Mr. President, the line-item veto has a proven track record in bringing about financial responsibility at the State and local level. As a Governor, the distinguished Presiding Officer knows that you cannot print money like we do up here in Washington. And if you do all of this borrowing and spending and borrowing and spending, before long you lose your credit rating. 
The line-item veto is used at the present time in some 43 States. The separate enrollment mechanism that this legislation is based upon has been shown to meet constitutional muster by Prof. Laurence Tribe of Harvard in a letter to former Senator Bill Bradley back in January 1993. I spoke with Professor Tribe yesterday morning on the telephone at which time he reaffirmed that legal opinion. 
Mr. President, this effort is not meant to fix the blame, but to fix the problem. We are not enhancing or diminishing Presidential powers. We are simply changing congressional procedures. We are using the congressional power under article I, section 5 of the Constitution which vests Congress with broad authority to set the rules for its own procedure. And that authority is exercised through changes in the rules which would require separate enrollment. That was found to be the one way that a statutory line-item veto could pass constitutional scrutiny. 
We are very, very hopeful that this bill can assist us in fixing responsibility on the one hand and reducing deficits on the other hand. We all know that we are not here, as lawyer Sullivan said, as `potted plants.' But we are sometimes embarrassed when we see things like appropriations for Lawrence Welk's home. 
In 1992, the Government Accounting Office, [GAO] did a study and found that over a 5-year period the line-item veto would save some $70 billion. 
So we are very hopeful that we can get expedited procedure. It has been debated for the past 15 years. It has been used by all the Governors now in some 43 States. And there is no rhyme nor reason for us to play around and wait for the delay in the courts. 
We are in a very serious circumstance. Our debt has so risen that the interest costs to the Government now are $1 billion a day--$1 billion a day--increased spending for interest costs on the national debt. 
It is the largest spending item in the budget. And so I thank the distinguished Senator from Florida for yielding, but I wanted to make sure we introduced this legislation this morning before we got on to the unanimous consent with the particular measure at hand.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to discuss truth in budgeting. Let me emphasize `truth in budgeting.' We do not appreciate, Mr. President, the reality. The reality is that we are giving billions and billions more in Government than we are willing to pay for. 
In fact, Mr. President, from the year 1945 when President Truman was in office until 1980, when President Reagan came in, the deficits were an average of $20 billion. Whereas for the last 16 years, the average has been $277 billion. So for the last 16 years everybody is running around and pointing fingers as to the blame, while we have been giving $277 billion more in Government than we are willing to pay for. 
Now, a couple of years ago, my distinguished colleagues on the other side of the aisle kept saying, `If you want to change the Congress you have to change the Congressman. If you want to change the Senate, you have to change the Senator,' and the American people said `fine, that is what we will do.' 
But instead of getting change, instead of getting a proposed budget where we pay up here for the Government we are giving, we get into this big folderol about leadership and everything else. 
Under the Constitution, the Congress legislates, the President executes. It is our responsibility to legislate. In fact, the concurrent resolution for a budget is not even signed by the President. Yet, this weekend I had to listen to the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee on the House side, Mr. Kasich, say, `If the President could only show leadership and step up to the plate.' They have all the jargon and litany--`if he can only show some responsibility,' and `if he only had the courage.' Well, he has put up a budget. He maintains that his budget is balanced by the year 2002. There is a serious question about that, obviously. But at least he put up a budget. Now, from January to June, we are still hearing the chairmen of the Budget Committees on both sides of the Capitol asking for leadership and courage and everything else, when that is what they asked the American people for and received. We have a Republican Congress; where is the Republican budget? It is just totally out of whole cloth around here; we can't get the truth about where we are. 
Now, going right to the point about their being derelict as to their responsibility. All of us have been derelict as to the reality of the deficit. All you need do is the simple arithmetic to find out how much the debt increases each year and to determine your deficit, not this unified Mickey Mouse thing which uses borrowed funds. The unified deficit is the one that was used all of last year during the campaign, and it was used the day before yesterday on the Sunday morning talk shows. David Broder used it in his column, and all the responsible writers use it. The number they use is $107 billion. Totally false. Totally false. 
To get the actual deficit, you just subtract the increase from one year to the next, and you can find that the actual deficit was $261 billion. How do they get to the $107 billion? Well, Mr. President, they borrow $154 billion. You borrow $154 billion from Social Security, from Medicare, from the civil service retirement, from military retirement, and you go right on down the list until you get to $107 billion. Why not borrow that $107 billion and say the budget is balanced? 
What kind of gamesmanship are we playing? When are we going to get the truth out of the free press in America and quit quoting a silly figure that doesn't reflect the reality. The reality, Mr. President, is when that deficit grows to $261 billion this year, and you add that amount to the debt and the existing interest costs, this conduct, along with Mr. Greenspan's, causes your interest costs to go through the roof. In fact, right now, interest costs are estimated at $360 billion for 1997. That was the CBO figure before the increase in interest rates. So the figure is now around $1 billion a day--$365 billion, or even more. 
Mr. President, today is April 15. Today, everyone is required to pay their income tax. I just got this table from CBO which says the total amount paid in individual income tax is estimated to be $676 billion. We are already 6 1/2 months into our fiscal year. Therefore, when I say a billion dollars a day in interest costs, what I am saying is that the people of America worked from October of last year up until today, income tax day, April 15, for what? To pay for the wasteful interest costs in Government, and this charade that continues. Half of our Nation's income taxes go to pay for interest costs on the national debt. Even if we get a little bit of savings from the CPI, a little bit from Medicare, we are still way off. I will be joining with the Blue Dogs; we are working out the figures right now for a budget freeze--no increase in taxes, no cut in taxes, no back-end loading. And even then, without the borrowings, it is going to take you 5 more years, until 2007 rather than 2002, for a true balanced budget. 
The American people should understand that we are playing a game up here to buy the vote, so we can all get reelected again next year. We have been doing that for the past 16 years with this silly Reaganomics and the litany of growth, growth. One fellow, 
Stevie Forbes, wrote `hope, growth, and opportunity.' You turn on all the programs, and the discussions are all about inheritance taxes and the capital gains tax. `Just do away with the IRS and the income tax,' they say. We are talking out of whole cloth. We act like that is reality. We cannot afford tax cuts. Look at the figures. The domestic budget is $266 billion. The defense budget is $267 billion. Look on page 36 of your budget book. Entitlement spending is $859 billion. That comes, Mr. President, to $1.382 trillion. Then you add interest costs of $360 billion, and that is $1.742 trillion. To get down to CBO's projected revenues of $1.632 trillion, we have to cut $110 billion. 
Now, that's the job that we have at hand--not capital gains, not inheritance taxes, not getting rid of the IRS and income taxes. Yes, taxes are too much. Why are they too much? Because of the interest costs on the national debt. If you go back to 1980, it was $74.8 billion. We have literally added just about $300 billion in interest costs on the national debt that must be paid up first. It is just like taxes. You might call them an increase in taxes each day of $1 billion. We are running around here cutting taxes while we are increasing their taxes $1 billion a day. But if you had that $300 billion, Mr. President, we could balance the budget, we could get improve technology, we could pave the highways, repair the bridges, give more student loans, and we could have double the research at NIH. We could do all these things. Taxes are too high. But why are they high? For the silly charade. There is no better word for this off-Broadway show that goes on out here, without the reality, without the truth in budgeting. These people act as if we have the luxury of cutting taxes because they are too high. 
You have to cut the interest costs on the debt. You have to start paying for the Government we have. They have been meeting since January to decide how can we get both sides to go along with a fraud; one grand fraud is what this is. You know it, and I know it. We will get my budget realities chart up here later on, and I will be glad to give people copies of it. 
There is no question in my mind that this fraud has to be exposed because these interest costs, which are really taxes, are eating us alive. By cutting taxes, we are really saying `let's increase the deficit, the debt, and interest costs.' If the people don't understand that, every one of these writers should tell you that. It is not complicated at all. All you have to do is go from year to year. And we are still going to borrow from the Social Security, which is illegal. We passed a law of the Budget Act, section 13301, that said thou shalt not use Social Security trust funds in order to lower the deficit or in reporting it. Yet they violate it. 
They are running around wanting to know who slept in the Lincoln bedroom or who flew on the Air Force One plane. Come on, when are we going to get to work on the real problem? That is why the American people have no confidence in this institution up here. We don't tell the truth. I remember my friend, Bill Proxmire, who got up here every day on a certain treaty. Finally, after about 6 or 7 years, he got some attention. I don't know whether people would give me that much time, but I am going to have to start taking time every morning hour to show the reality of what we are doing. No, you can't balance the budget and pay for the Government this next year, but you can put us on a truth course. If you saw that chart my distinguished colleague Mr. Conrad had, you will find that the deficit went way down in 1985 and 1986. In 1985 and 1986 was during Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, and this was when we really cut the deficit. 
I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by myself and the senior Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond. 
We all know the score, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has outlined the state of our nuclear waste policy and we are aware of the need to move this bill forward. 
Currently, DOE is contractually bound to begin receiving spent commercial nuclear fuel in 1998. Under the 1982 Nuclear Policy Act, DOE was directed to identify, construct, and operate an underground repository to dispose of the Nation's commercial nuclear fuel. 
Identifying such a site proved difficult, so in 1987 Congress intervened and directed DOE to study or characterize only one site, Yucca Mountain, NV. Since 1987 DOE has been studying the Yucca Mountain site to determine if it is a suitable site for the permanent repository. This characterization was to be completed and, if the site was suitable, a permanent facility was to be constructed by 1998. 
I don't need to point out how far this process has fallen behind. If it was on schedule then we would not be debating this bill today. It is now 1997, and DOE has not finished its site characterization work. In fact they tell me that, if there is no further delay and the site checks out, then the permanent repository will not be ready until 2010 at the earliest. 
Obviously that causes a problem since last year a Federal court held that DOE does have an obligation to dispose of the waste by the 1998 deadline. So where does the waste go in 1998? Well, to Senator Murkowski's credit, he is trying to answer that question. That solution is to construct a temporary storage facility at the Yucca Mountain if the site is suitable for the permanent repository. 
The Senator from Alaska has tried to accommodate a bunch of competing interests, and, hoping to avoid a veto by the White House, he has provided a means by which the President can identify an alternative site if the Yucca Mountain site is deemed unsuitable. It is this provision, allowing the President to designate an alternative temporary storage site, that brings me here today. My friends from Oregon, Senators Wyden and Smith, both of whom are on the Energy Committee, offered a provision at markup to ensure that the DOE's Hanford Site be excluded as a possible alternative temporary storage site. 
As many of my colleagues know, the DOE's Savannah River Site is located in my State, and I am here today to explain why, like the Hanford Site, it is not a suitable site for a temporary facility. After my colleagues hear SRS's disadvantages, they will agree. SRS is not the place for this spent fuel. 
The amendment before us simply codifies that position. It simply states that the Savannah River Site and Barnwell County South Carolina, like Hanford, cannot be identified by the President as an alternative temporary storage site. 
I am not going to spend time arguing why Yucca Mountain is the best site for this facility. The chairman of the Energy Committee has done a fine job of that. What I will do is tell you why SRS is not the site. 
SRS is a 198,000-acre reservation located in South Carolina and abutting Georgia. It is 12 miles southwest of Augusta, GA, and 10 miles south of Aiken, SC. This is a highly populated area which has been and continues to grow rapidly. I have heard people argue that the Savannah River Site is some rural out-of-the-way place. Well, that is just not the case. The population within a 50-mile radius of SRS numbers about 615,000. This obviously encompasses all of Aiken, SC, and Augusta, GA, whose combined population is more that 400,000 people, plus a number of smaller communities that are too numerous to mention. 
What is more astounding is that the population living within a 100-mile radius of the site numbers 2.6 million people. This includes a number of larger cities including the capital of South Carolina, Columbia, Charleston, SC, Hilton Head, SC, Savannah GA, 
and Augusta, GA. In fact, there are private homes located on private lands located within 200 feet of the site. 
To say this is a far and out-of-the-way place is just not the case. Putting additional nuclear waste in such a highly populated area is crazy. 
In addition, as I understand the scientists, their most constant fear is that nuclear material is exposed to water and leaches into surface or subsurface waters and that this water carries the contamination off-site. Therefore it is critical that this nuclear material be kept dry and away from the corrosive effects of water. 
Well, for anyone who has visited the Savannah River site, or, for that matter the lowcountry of South Carolina, they know that in reality it is all wetlands or as some say, a swamp. In fact, the Savannah River site is literally surrounded by water. There are extensive water resources on, under, and adjacent to the site. 
The Savannah River, which marks the border of the States of South Carolina and Georgia also marks the 20-mile western boundary of the site and six major streams flow through the site and into the river. 
It is this river, the Savannah, which supplies drinking water for Beaufort and Jasper Counties in South Carolina and the town of Port Wentworth, GA. In addition, it runs directly through the city of Savannah, GA, downstream and supports an active commercial and sport fishing industry. 
Studies indicate that portions of the site are within the 100-year flood plain, and although this information is not available, I would not be surprised to find that the entire site is within the 500-year flood plain. 
Under the surface there are several aquifer systems. The largest of which is the Cretaceous or Tuscoloosa Aquifer. It is a huge aquifer stretching all across the Southeast. In general, the groundwater on the site flows into one of the numerous streams or swamps on the site and then flows into the Savannah River which is, as I mentioned earlier, the source of drinking water for numerous cities and towns downstream. 
The water not making its way to the river is absorbed into the ground and eventually makes it to the groundwater. The level of this groundwater, like its flow, varies but in some places it is literally within inches of the surface. The rate of flow for this groundwater varies with areas where it travels as fast as several hundred meters a year. So it is not hard to imagine a scenario, and we have had cases, where nuclear contaminants have reached the groundwater and quickly moved off site. 
It is interesting to note, but not surprising, that virtually every county in South Carolina and Georgia has some number of households getting their drinking water directly from these subsurface aquifers. In fact, over 50 percent of the households in two counties that abut the site draw their drinking water from wells. 
Obviously, with the abundant wetlands, rivers, streams, and, an abundance of precipitation, averaging over 44 inches per year, the Savannah River site is not the place for this spent fuel--if you want to keep it dry. 
There are numerous other reasons to eliminate the Savannah River site from consideration. Not the least of which is that South Carolina and the Savannah River site are already doing their share to safely store nuclear waste. In fact, foreign research reactor fuel shipped from all over the world passes right by my front door as it is being shipped to Charleston and then up to the Savannah River site. In addition, the site is constantly receiving waste from the nation's nuclear defense facilities and domestic research reactors. We have all the waste we can handle. 
Trust me, I have visited the site repeatedly over my career, and I am aware of the cleanup job we face down there. We have spent years getting a waste processing facility up and running, and we are just now really beginning to clean up the 33 million gallons of liquid high-level nuclear waste on site. That does not include all the other forms of waste: low-level, transuranic, and hazardous. To add more waste to a site which has its hands full cleaning up the mess caused by 40 years of nuclear weapons production is not the solution. 
It is clear given the dense population of the area and its geography that it is not the best site for any waste. Our goal should be to ensure that the Savannah River site is cleaned up and that its waste is stabilized and moved off-site. The site is not suitable to receive additional waste. This amendment simply ensures that the Savannah River site is not overrun with waste and that it continues without interruption the cleanup and stabilization of its existing contamination. 
I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment. I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.  
Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I respectfully rise today and ask that we pay tribute to Judge Charles R. Richey. 
Today the flags in front of the Thurgood Marshall Judiciary Building fly at half-mast in mourning for Judge Richey. Charles Richey was a great man and a superlative judge. We join in the loss with his wife, Mardelle, and his sons, Charles and William. 
Judge Richey, despite his lofty status in the courts, always considered himself a man of the people and he consistently defied the labels of conservative and liberal. His public career began when he came to Washington as a legislative counsel to Representative Frances Payne Bolton from Ohio. Later he was appointed general counsel for the Maryland Public Service Commission during Spiro Agnew's last years as Governor. He was appointed to the Federal bench by President Nixon in 1971. 
In 1979, the American Trial Lawyers Association voted Judge Richey Outstanding Federal Trial Judge. He was one of the busiest judges in the Washington U.S. District Court and ran a tight ship in the courtroom. He was a firm believer in swift justice and had the most up-to-date docket on the circuit. 
Over the course of his career, Richey handed down many landmark decisions, including one he loved to recount--his 1976 ruling that called in the California tuna ships for violation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In that same year he also became the first judge to hold that employees who are sexually harassed by their superiors can file under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
Ever willing to take on the Government on behalf of the little man, in 1981, Richey awarded $6 million in back pay and $10 million in future earnings for 324 women in the sex discrimination suit against the Government Printing Office, then the largest amount ever awarded in a sex discrimination case. Perhaps the case most indicative of his feeling for the citizens though was his dismissal of charges against people camped in protest in Lafayette `Protest' Park. He said they were exercising their rights under the First Amendment. 
Judge Richey's courtesy in the court was legendary. He used gender-neutral terms when discussing certain statutes mentioning only men. Despite his own strict Methodist upbringing, he gave witnesses options on oaths containing no religious references and dispensing with the Gideon Bible. One said of him, `Judge Richey is tough as shoe leather, but fair minded almost to a fault.' 
We shall all miss this man. He leaves behind an unparalled judicial legacy and record of public service.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to express my concern with the President's proposal for the budget of the Federal Aviation Administration. We all know how important aviation is to our economy, contributing more than $770 billion in direct and indirect benefits. In South Carolina, travel and tourism is the No. 2 industry, accounting for almost 100,000 jobs. The industry is fueled by the aviation industry. 
The President has talked a lot about a bridge to the 21st century. Bridges and highway projects are critical parts of our Nation's infrastructure. But so are airports. I have an airport in almost every county of my State. We have a strong airport system, but one that needs money to rebuild and expand. The $1 billion proposal falls far short of what is needed. It is a shortsighted approach to meeting our country's needs. It also undoes a deal that we had last year with the administration. I am certain that the new Secretary wants to make sure that our Nation's infrastructure needs are addressed, and I want to work with him on ways to meet those needs. 
The President has proposed a $1 billion airport improvement program. The airport community claims that nationwide it needs almost $10 billion per year. In my State alone, money for airports is critically needed for small and large projects. Without adequate funding, these airports cannot expand and cannot begin to attract new businesses. I can cite many examples of this, but one that comes to mind is the Greenville-Spartanburg Airport project. Without an AIP grant, the runway would not have been lengthened. It helped BMW decide to locate in South Carolina. Airport grants mean business opportunities.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me first thank Senator Byrd our resident Senate historian. I do not say that lightly--because the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has been masterful in his analysis and been very, very cautious and careful. He has stood many a time for not amending the Constitution, that we don't do this, willy-nilly, for any and every problem. But, after 20 years, thousands of speeches and hours and effort made, he has given a very masterful analysis of the need for this amendment. The Senate and the Nation are indebted to him. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Dodd, of Connecticut, be added as a cosponsor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, although I commend the efforts of the minority leader and others seeking to statutorily reform our campaign finance laws, I am convinced the only way to solve the chronic problems surrounding campaign financing is reverse the Supreme Court's flawed decision in Buckley versus Valeo by adopting a constitutional amendment granting Congress the right to limit campaign spending. 
We all know the score--we are hamstrung by that decision and the ever increasing cost of a competitive campaign. With the total cost for congressional elections, just general elections, skyrocketing from $403 million in 1990 to over $626 million in 1996, the need for limits on campaign expenditures is more urgent than ever. For nearly a quarter of a century, Congress has tried to tackle runaway campaign spending with bills aimed at getting around the disjointed Buckley decision. Again and again, Congress has failed. 
Let us resolve not to repeat the mistakes of past campaign finance reform efforts, which have become bogged down in partisanship as Democrats and Republicans each tried to gore the other's sacred cows. During the 103d Congress there was a sign that we could move beyond this partisan bickering, when the Senate in a bipartisan fashion expressed its support for a constitutional amendment to limit campaign expenditures. In May 1993, a nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate resolution was agreed to which advocated the adoption of a constitutional amendment empowering Congress and States to limit campaign expenditures. 
Now it is time to take the next step. We must strike the decisive blow against the anything-goes fundraising and spending tolerated by both political parties. Looking beyond the current headlines regarding the source of these funds, the massive amount of money spent is astonishing and serves only to cement the commonly held belief that our elections are nothing more than auctions and that our politicians are up for sale. It is time to put a limit on the amount of money sloshing around campaign war chests. It is time to adopt a constitutional amendment to limit campaign spending--a simple, straightforward, nonpartisan solution. 
As Prof. Gerald G. Ashdown has written in the New England Law Review, amending the Constitution to allow Congress to regulate campaign expenditures is `the most theoretically attractive of the approaches-to-reform since, from a broad free speech perspective, the decision in Buckley is misguided and has worsened the campaign finance atmosphere.' Adds Professor Ashdown: `If Congress could constitutionally limit the campaign expenditures of individuals, candidates, and committees, along with contributions, most of the troubles * * * would be eliminated.' 
Right to the point, back in 1974, Congress responded to the public's outrage over the Watergate scandals by passing, on a 
bipartisan basis, a comprehensive campaign finance law. The centerpiece of this reform was a limitation on campaign expenditures. Congress recognized that spending limits were the only rational alternative to a system that essentially awarded office to the highest bidder or wealthiest candidate. 
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court overturned these spending limits in its infamous Buckley versus Valeo decision of 1976. The Court mistakenly equated a candidate's right to spend unlimited sums of money with his right to free speech. In the face of spirited dissents, the Court came to the conclusion that limits on campaign contributions but not spending furthered `* * * the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption' and that this interest `outweighs considerations of free speech.' 
I have never been able to fathom why that same test--the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption--does not overwhelmingly justify limits on campaign spending. The Court made a huge mistake. The fact is, spending limits in Federal campaigns would act to restore the free speech that has been eroded by the Buckley decision. 
After all, as a practical reality, what Buckley says is: Yes, if you have a fundraising advantage or personal wealth, then you have access to television, radio and other media and you have freedom of speech. But if you do not have a fundraising advantage or personal wealth, then you are denied access. Instead of freedom of speech, you have only the freedom to say nothing. 
So let us be done with this phony charge that spending limits are somehow an attack on freedom of speech. As Justice Byron White points out, clear as a bell, in his dissent, both contribution limits and spending limits are neutral as to the content of speech and are not motivated by fear of the consequences of the political speech in general. 
Mr. President, every Senator realizes that television advertising is the name of the game in modern American politics. In warfare, if you control the air, you control the battlefield. In politics, if you control the airwaves, you control the tenor and focus of a campaign. 
Probably 80 percent of campaign communications take place through the medium of television. And most of that TV airtime comes at a dear price. In South Carolina, you're talking between $1,000 and $2,000 for 30 seconds of primetime advertising. In New York City, it's anywhere from $30,000 to $40,000 for the same 30 seconds. 
The hard fact of life for a candidate is that if you're not on TV, you're not truly in the race. Wealthy challengers as well as incumbents flushed with money go directly to the TV studio. Those without a fundraising advantage or personal wealth are sidetracked to the time-consuming pursuit of cash. 
The Buckley decision created a double bind. It upheld restrictions on campaign contributions, but struck down restrictions on how much candidates with deep pockets can spend. The Court ignored the practical reality that if my opponent has only $50,000 to spend in a race and I have $1 million, then I can 
effectively deprive him of his speech. By failing to respond to my advertising, my cash-poor opponent will appear unwilling to speak up in his own defense. 
Justice Thurgood Marshall zeroed in on this disparity in his dissent to Buckley. By striking down the limit on what a candidate can spend, Justice Marshall said, `It would appear to follow that the candidate with a substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a significant head start.' 
Indeed, Justice Marshall went further: He argued that by upholding the limitations on contributions but striking down limits on overall spending, the Court put an additional premium on a candidate's personal wealth. 
Justice Marshall was dead right and Ross Perot and Steve Forbes have proved it. Massive spending of their personal fortunes immediately made them contenders. Our urgent task is to right the injustice of Buckley versus Valeo by empowering Congress to place caps on Federal campaign spending. We are all painfully aware of the uncontrolled escalation of campaign spending. The average cost of a winning Senate race was $1.2 million in 1980, rising to $2.9 million in 1984, and skyrocketing to $3.1 million in 1986, $3.7 million in 1988, and up to $4.3 in 1996. To raise that kind of money, the average Senator must raise over $13,800 a week, every week of his or her 6-year term. Overall spending in congressional races increased from $446 million in 1990 to more than $724 million in 1994--almost a 70-percent increase in 4 short years. I predict that when the final FEC reports are compiled for 1996, that figure will go even higher. 
This obsession with money distracts us from the people's business. It corrupts and degrades the entire political process. Fundraisers used to be arranged so they didn't conflict with the Senate schedule; nowadays, the Senate schedule is regularly shifted to accommodate fundraisers. 
I have run for statewide office 16 times in South Carolina. You establish a certain campaign routine, say, shaking hands at a mill shift in Greer, visiting a big country store outside of Belton, and so on. Over the years, they look for you and expect you to come around. But in recent years, those mill visits and dropping by the country store have become a casualty of the system. There is very little time for them. We're out chasing dollars. 
During my 1992 reelection campaign, I found myself raising money to get on TV to raise money to get on TV to raise money to get on TV. It's a vicious cycle. 
I remember Senator Richard Russell saying: `They give you a 6-year term in this U.S. Senate: two years to be a statesman, the next 2 years to be a politician, and the last 2 years to be a demagogue.' Regrettably, we are no longer afforded even 2 years as statesmen. We proceed straight to politics and demagoguery right after the election because of the imperatives of raising money. 
My proposed constitutional amendment would change all this. It would empower Congress to impose reasonable spending limits on Federal campaigns. For instance, we could impose a limit of, say, $800,000 per Senate candidate in a small State like South 
Carolina--a far cry from the millions spent by my opponent and me in 1992. And bear in mind that direct expenditures account for only a portion of total spending. For instance, my 1992 opponent's direct expenditures were supplemented by hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenditures by independent organizations and by the State and local Republican Party. When you total up spending from all sources, my challenger and I spent roughly the same amount in 1992. 
And incidentally, Mr. President, let's be done with the canard that spending limits would be a boon to incumbents, who supposedly already have name recognition and standing with the public and therefore begin with a built-in advantage over challengers. Nonsense. I hardly need to remind my Senate colleagues of the high rate of mortality in upper chamber elections. And as to the alleged invulnerability of incumbents in the House, I would simply note that well over 50 percent of the House membership has been replaced since the 1990 elections and just 3 weeks ago we swore in 15 new Senators. 
I can tell you from experience that any advantages of incumbency are more than counterbalanced by the obvious disadvantages of incumbency, specifically the disadvantage of defending hundreds of controversial votes in Congress. 
Moreover, Mr. President, I submit that once we have overall spending limits, it will matter little whether a candidate gets money from industry groups or from PAC's or from individuals. It is still a reasonable amount any way you cut it. Spending will be under control, and we will be able to account for every dollar going out. 
On the issue of PAC's, Mr. President, let me say that I have never believed that PAC's per se are an evil in the current system. On the contrary, PAC's are a very healthy instrumentality of politics. PAC's have brought people into the political process: nurses, educators, small business people, senior citizens, unionists, you name it. They permit people of modest means and limited individual influence to band together with others of mutual interest so their message is heard and known. 
For years we have encouraged these people to get involved, to participate. Yet now that they are participating, we turn around and say, `Oh, no, your influence is corrupting, your money is tainted.' This is wrong. The evil to be corrected is not the abundance of participation but the superabundance of money. The culprit is runaway campaign spending. 
To a distressing degree, elections are determined not in the political marketplace but in the financial marketplace. Our elections are supposed to be contests of ideas, but too often they degenerate into megadollar derbies, paper chases through the board rooms of corporations and special interests. 
Mr. President, I repeat, campaign spending must be brought under control. The constitutional amendment Senator Specter and I have proposed would permit Congress to impose fair, responsible, workable limits on Federal campaign expenditures and allow States to do the same with regard to State and local elections. 
Such a reform would have four important impacts. First, it 
would end the mindless pursuits of ever-fatter campaign war chests. Second, it would free candidates from their current obsession with fundraising and allow them to focus more on issues and ideas; once elected to office, we wouldn't have to spend 20 percent of our time raising money to keep our seats. Third, it would curb the influence of special interests. And fourth, it would create a more level playing field for our Federal campaigns--a competitive environment where personal wealth does not give candidates an insurmountable advantage. 
Finally, Mr. President, a word about the advantages of the amend-the-Constitution approach that I propose. Recent history amply demonstrates the practicality and viability of this constitutional route. Certainly, it is not coincidence that five of the last seven amendments to the Constitution have dealt with Federal election issues. In elections, the process drives and shapes the end result. Election laws can skew election results, whether you're talking about a poll tax depriving minorities of their right to vote, or the absence of campaign spending limits giving an unfair advantage to wealthy candidates. These are profound issues which go to the heart of our democracy, and it is entirely appropriate that they be addressed through a constitutional amendment. 
And let's not be distracted by the argument that the amend-the-Constitution approach will take too long. Take too long? We have been dithering on this campaign finance issue since the early 1970's, and we haven't advanced the ball a single yard. All-the-while the Supreme Court continues to strike down campaign limit after campaign limit. It has been a quarter of a century, and no legislative solution has done the job. 
Except for the 27th amendment, the last five constitutional amendments took an average of 17 months to be adopted. There is no reason why we cannot pass this joint resolution, submit it to the States for a vote, and ratify the amendment in time for it to govern the 1998 election. Once passed by the Congress, the joint resolution goes directly to the States for ratification. Once ratified, it becomes the law of the land, and it is a Supreme Court challenge. 
And, by the way, I reject the argument that if we were to pass and ratify this amendment, Democrats and Republicans would be unable to hammer out a mutually acceptable formula of campaign expenditure limits. A Democratic Congress and Republican President did exactly that in 1974, and we can certainly do it again. 
Mr. President, this amendment will address the campaign finance mess directly, decisively, and with finality. The Supreme Court has chosen to ignore the overwhelming importance of media advertising in today's campaigns. In the Buckley decision, it prescribed a bogus if-you-have-the-money-you-can-talk version of free speech. In its place, I urge the Congress to move beyond these acrobatic attempts at legislating around the Buckley decision. As we have all seen, no matter how sincere, these plans are doomed to fail. The solution rests in fixing the Buckley decision. It is my hope that as the campaign financing debate unfolds, the majority leader will provide us with an opportunity to vote on this resolution--it is the only solution. 
I now yield 5 minutes to the distinguished colleague from California, Senator Boxer.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me thank the distinguished colleague from California. She has spoken to the reality of what we really are confronting. 
I do not know how you run a race in the State of California. Mr. Huffington, of your State, spent $30 million of his own money to run for Senate and lost. Last week the Senator from Nevada suggested that all Mr. Huffington needs to do would be come to Nevada. In Nevada he could run a fine campaign for $10 million. He could move, saving $20 million of his money, down to the State of Nevada and win, so to speak, with the $10 million. We know we know as in warfare, he who rules the air controls the battlefield. And he who rules the airwaves in politics controls the election. 
And it is just that cold, hard reality that the Senator from California has spoken to. I am most grateful for her leadership on this particular score. 
Going right back, Mr. President, to 1974 and the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act, in the aftermath of Watergate. We acted together--Republicans and Democrats and said with a strong vote that we shall not have the Government up for sale and that we had to limit spending in campaigns. 
So in the 1974 act we limited the individual amount of a contribution. In short, we limited the free speech. Congress did that after a studied debate. We limited the spending of the independent groups at that particular time. We limited the spending of the political action committees. We limited the spending of the individual candidates' own personal wealth, and we limited the overall spending. So the manifest intent in 1974 was to limit what my opponents now characterize as free speech. 
In the 1976, Buckley decision, the Court went along with Congress' effort to limit an individual's free speech. When it comes to an individual's contribution, they said fine, it is constitutional to limit the spending or free speech of independent groups or of political action committees. 
On the other hand, the Court then said, expenditures, they are not limited. Any limit on expenditures would be a violation of the first amendment. Now, that left us with a dilemma, the rich candidate or the candidate with a fundraising advantage, he has got unlimited speech because he does not have limits. This and the unlimited spending by candidates has become a cancer on the body politic. Combined spending of both political parties has gone up, as the Senator from California said, to almost a billion dollars. 
So, Mr. President, what we have here is a terrible dilemma. We wrestled with it for 10 years after that 1976 decision until the mid-1980's when I first introduced a joint resolution to amend the Constitution and provide Congress the authority to limit campaign spending. We did not have a Pavlovian kind of reaction of `Ipso facto, just run. Let's go ahead and amend the Constitution.' We did it after numerous attempts to correct the problem. First it 
was Common Cause, they said we ought to publicly finance. Time and time again, Congress rejected public financing. Opponents characterized it as food stamps or welfare for politicians. So that is not going to fly. 
We tried individual voluntary restrictions. If we voluntarily limited, then you can get free time, free television time, free mailings and other benefits. 
We were never able to come to grips with reform largely because of the Buckley decision. As Chief Justice Burger said in his dissenting opinion, expenditures and contributions were two sides of the same coin, and to try to limit the one and not the other would not wash. That was Chief Justice Burger's characterization of the decision. 
So we are not coming here as just politicians, but with the support of the best of jurists who have come over the years and criticized the Buckley decision. J. Skelly Wright in the Yale Law Journal said that there was nothing in the first amendment that commits us to the dogma that money is speech. 
So after trying for 10 years I introduced a constitutional amendment. At that time, we believed perhaps the Court itself saw the practical and the scandalous effect the decision had had and that they would reverse their own decision. 
But please, my gracious, Mr. President, they shot that idea with last years Colorado Republican Party versus FEC decision and now `Katie, bar the door. The sky is the limit.' 
Now what do we have? We have the practical effect of absolutely no limits. Business leaders now say, `Senator, you know, we thought that we sort of had done our part when we gave our $1,000. Now after that Colorado decision the telephone rings off the hook. Now I want $100,000.' `What in the world has happened to you all here in Washington?' 
They think this is the result of a congressional decision. 
Back in 1974 the Congress agreed, in a bipartisan fashion--not partisan-- that we could only ask for that $1,000. That is no longer the case. 
I refer to an article in the Monday Washington Post, `Parties' Congressional Campaign Committees Took in Millions in `Soft Money' in 1995-96.' This is the practical effect of the Colorado decision. 
This soft money represents independent contributions that, under the Colorado decision, can be spent on congressional campaigns so long as you cannot prove categorically it was coordinated--even though it went for the benefit an individual candidate. In that case, they just started savaging a potential candidate way ahead of time on the radio. 
Even though the Court is limiting the individual contributions, the PAC contributions, and right on down the line, now they say, `Well, after all, just go ahead with the so-called soft money,' so that practically congressional committees have no limits. As the chart shows the committees received `donations of as much as $735,000 from a single corporation, $310,000 from a union, and $250,000 from an individual from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 1996.'  
The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee raised near $27 million in these unregulated donations in the election year, about three times the total 4 years earlier. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee actively solicited soft money for the first time in the 1995-96 campaign, collecting about $14 million compared with the $566,111 in 1991-1992. 
So, you see, both parties just went running amok. 
In response to my distinguished friend from Texas, who last week said on this floor that the Republican Party was the poor party and the Democrats were rich, I suggest a look at this chart.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, according to the Federal Election Commission, the total amount of money raised overall, hard and soft money, in 1996, by the Republicans was $548.7 million and by the Democrats was $332.3 million. 
So, the Democrats scramble everywhere. To the embarrassment of all of us both Democrat and Republican, but my opponents do not want to recognize that. 
I got a call from my distinguished colleague, the Senior Senator from Alabama. I understand he took the floor yesterday. Five times he has been a cosponsor of this particular joint resolution for a constitutional amendment. Now he is worried about the freedom of speech. You see now, the Senator from Alabama seems to have lost his freedom of speech. It is a sad, sad, commentary, Mr. President, but that is exactly what is happening. The other side says, look, here we have the advantage of money overwhelmingly, and that is our advantage in politics, and we are not going to give it up, so let us hide behind the First Amendment. It is a very shameful performance, a dog-and-pony show, coming up here and saying we should not amend the Constitution, we should not think of it. The very people saying that and quoting Patrick Henry have voted to amend the Constitution relative to the burning of the flag--the very speakers that have taken the floor. I have seen hypocrisy before, but not like this. 
Then they come saying `Well, you know, we are not spending enough money in campaigns. What could happen,' under this amendment is, `the Congress could legislate us into incumbency, whereby you would never be opposed.' 
They use Patrick Henry to defend their actions. He once cried, `Peace, peace, there is no peace.' Here today we cry `Free speech, free speech, there is no free speech.' In politics it is paid speech we are talking about. As for me, give me this constitutional amendment to save democracy. 
Justice Jackson said that the Constitution is not a suicide pact, Mr. President. In that context, I will review several of the most recent constitutional amendments and show their relative significance to the pending amendment. Amendment No. 27 has to do with the compensation of Senators and Representatives. Certainly, this is more important than the 27th amendment. The 26th amendment has to do with the voting age. If they can change the voting age, they can certainly change the money limit. This is more important than the 26th amendment. The 25th amendment had to do with the succession in office. This is far more important a problem. We deal with this each and every day--day in and day out, exacerbating, getting worse and worse, turning elections into auctions. And going right to the 24th amendment, the poll tax. Well, we said in the 24th amendment that you cannot separate voters financially. That is exactly what Buckley has done. Those who have the money can shout to the rooftops. Those without money can get lockjaw--just hush, you cannot compete. The last five or six amendments, Mr. President, we have shown have been adopted in about a 20-month period. You can bet your boots that this could easily be adopted in 1998. 
What we have here is an amendment that is neutral. We do not say limit spending or not limit. We merely authorize the States and the Federal Government to limit spending. Here we are asking for a right. 
Here this devolution crowd that keeps coming up here and saying, `return government to the states, return government to the people, let the people act,' that is what I am trying to do. Pass my amendment, send it to the States and let the American people make the decision. We do not say `limit.' We do not say `not limit.' We just say give the people's representative body--namely, the Congress of the United States--the authority to limit. My opponents do not want to give the people a chance to vote on it. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is rather amusing to hear my distinguished colleague say that this particular initiative is `without a constituency.' The constituency started 10 years ago with the Commission on the Constitutional System. I have quoted a group of several hundred present and former legislators, executive branch officials, political party officials, professors, and civic leaders who are interested in analyzing and correcting the weaknesses that have developed under our political system since the Buckley case. 
We have the support of 44 law professors, which I have inserted into the Record, as well as 24 State attorneys general. When I introduced this joint resolution in some 10 years ago, it was only relevant and pertaining to the Federal Government. The States came and begged and said, `Amend the Buckley ruling and include protection for us also.' The cities came and said, `Amend it, please, and include the protection for the cities also.' 
Yet, my distinguished colleague says that he has the endorsement of the Washington Post and the ACLU. He had better not let many on his side of the aisle hear that or they will start changing their votes. I know that crowd over there. I can tell you, Mr. President, we need to examine the very authority that the distinguished Senator from Kentucky uses--the Buckley case--which he said was good. He said it was good 1976 it is good in 1997. He says it's good and that `we don't want, need the Hollings resolution.' Incidentally, it is the Hollings-Specter. I don't know whether they are ashamed to have a Republican cosponsor it. They don't mind saying `McCain-Feingold,' but they don't want to say `Hollings-Specter.' 
But I do appreciate the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania joining in. I understand also that my colleague from Delaware, Senator Roth, has asked for time. I was waiting to make sure he had a moment. But in any event, I admire their courage for joining me because apparently they have made this into a party position. When I lose my good friend, the Senator from Alabama, Senator Shelby, who cosponsored this three times and now comes and says he is worried about the freedom of speech, I know the pressure is on. But, after saying Buckley is good, they then say vote against the Hollings initiative. They argue that my amendment would be the first time in 200 years we have limited the freedom of speech, whereby there is no question that this is exactly what the Buckley decision does. The Buckley decision limits the freedom of speech of those who wish to contribute in political campaigns. The Buckley decision limits to this very moment the freedom of speech of political action committees. He talks about this being the first time in 200 years, yet he has to acknowledge that their authority shows the spurious nature of their defense. 
Mr. President, what we have is what the Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, said would gut the freedom-of-speech provision for the first time. Yet, we have already had it gutted in the Buckley decision. Thereupon, as the Chief Justice said in his dissenting opinion, it is half a haircut. You can't deal with the contributions without dealing with the expenditures of those contributions--both sides of the same coin, as he expressed it. 
So we have been at this now for 20 years. We have had over 240 votes in Congress on campaign finance reform. What we have finally come to is not the question of how but the question of whether or not we are going to really limit. Heretofore, for 20 years we have had Common Cause say that this measure is public financing. We have had McCain-Feingold say, if you will voluntarily limit yourself, you can get free time, free TV time, free mailing time, and everything. All of those initiatives were dealing with how to limit. But now, my good friend from Kentucky says really we should not limit it at all. 
That is the vote. If you want to limit, this is the way to give the authority to the national Congress to limit it. If you do not want to limit it, then vote against it. If you want reform, if you want to really get on top of this problem, we don't tell you how to do it. But you have to have the authority within the people's national Congress to actually limit it. That is the resolution. A constitutional amendment which is just as significant--in fact, more important than-- five of the last six amendments to the national Constitution dealing with elections. Adopt it, if you please, and in 18.5 months--the average of those five--I would dare say that with the constituency we have of the cities, the States, the interest, and the people, this would be ratified in the 1998 November election. 
They have worked it pretty good in a partisan fashion to try to bring in the freedom of speech, by saying money is speech. But it can't be. But what we are talking about is paid speech, not free speech. You go down to the Washington Post, which he says endorses this, and ask them for a quarter page or half page, and see how much free speech you get out of that newspaper. 
What we are talking about is the right to control the election. The war in the field of battle, as the distinguished Senator Inouye knows, is won by those who control air over the battlefield. Those who control the airwaves win political elections. There isn't any question about it. Money talks here. If we can't get on top of this monster, as Elizabeth Drew has said, we will never be able to save the process. We will never be able to save the democracy itself. Chief Justice Jackson said that the Constitution is not a suicide compact. We can move after 20 years to address this important problem facing our nation. We should move. 
I thank the Chair.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to commend Linda J. Morgan, the Chair of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board [STB], for her leadership in facilitating the discussions that have led to a possible settlement among the three major eastern rail carriers that would end the bitter, long, and costly merger fight between the Norfolk Southern, CSX, and Conrail Railroads. For months the Nation has witnessed the spectacle of these three giants trying to gain an advantage over each other and access to almost 4 billion dollars' worth of annual rail freight. This merger fight was shaping up to be a battle costing millions of dollars with no end in sight. And certainly there was no guarantee that the American consumer would be better at the end of the struggle than they were at its beginning. 
Ms. Morgan's service to this Nation is two fold. First, there was her simple, and very wise, suggestion to the parties that a settlement between the parties ending this fight would probably be preferable to having the Government step in and end the fight. Second, there was her astute suggestion that gaining rail competition in the Northeast should be an important goal in any final decision by the STB, which must approve any merger. 
It is important to note that many interested parties appreciated her candor and attention to the people's welfare. State agencies in the Northeast had urged a negotiated solution that would encourage more competition. Certainly, shippers have long seen the need for more competition in moving cargo through the largest North American consumer markets. The Journal of Commerce was moved to editorialize on [March 6, 1997] that the agreement spurred by Chairman Morgan's comment `makes good business sense' and that `Ms. Morgan showed a deft touch, hinting at regulators' views without compromising her objectivity about a case that hadn't yet been filed.' 
Let me close by saying that Linda Morgan's deft touch has given consumers and shippers some hope that they will come out ahead after any merger. It's a view that was articulated in The Journal of Commerce: `The deal * * * will provide effective rail freight competition into New York * * * (and) offers more competitive service in other cities--among them Baltimore, Philadelphia, Wilmington and Pittsburgh * * *' I offer my thanks to Ms. Morgan, a fine example of a dedicated and effective public servant.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have tremendous respect for my colleague from Wisconsin. I voted for McCain-Feingold. But in a breath, when the Senator says he wants meaningful campaign finance reform, he is asking that the only real meaningful campaign finance reform be tabled or rejected. 
Let's look, for example, at the Senator's own initiative here. In McCain-Feingold, it says that voluntary spending limits are set according to a State's population. You get free broadcast time--30 minutes of prime time--and then you get half-price broadcast discounts and reduced postal rates. How much is that going to mean to the Huffington-type campaigns that we see, where they are ready to spend $30 million, or the Steve Forbes-type campaigner, who is ready to spend $35 million? That is not even going to give them a burp in their campaign. 
The candidate's individual contribution limits would be raised from $1,000 to $2,000, if the opponent does not agree to the voluntary limits or declares an intent to spend $250,000 or more of their personal funds. But that is just the interest on the money the amounts of money we are talking about, were it to be loaned. But they have it available. So that really doesn't control the buying of the office. It doesn't control the buying of the office. It is not meaningful campaign finance reform. 
The Senator wants to ban soft money. Now, here it is. With respect to the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee against the Federal Election Commission, the Federal Election Commission brought suit charging that the Colorado party had violated the party expenditure provision of law by buying radio advertisements attacking the Democratic Party's likely candidate. This is the evil that you have in these decisions. It went on, and the Colorado Republican Party won out. Why? On account of a key little word: coordinated. You have to prove affirmatively that the candidate himself called up and suggested it or coordinated it, as they say, even if it is proven he called up. It has to be coordinated. 
Now, I want you all to know the reality of my particular comment. In next year's campaign, newspapers have already run a poll where they have shown that the former Governor of South Carolina, Carol Campbell, if we had the election this afternoon, would beat me. All I have to do is tell that friend there to tell that friend over there to get the third friend to tell the 
Democratic Party of South Carolina to start running radio advertisements attacking the former Governor as a likely candidate. He hasn't announced, but he is a likely candidate. 
But they say everything is fair in love and war and in a political campaign. This is the mischief. It is not just the money, it is the mischief that this nonsense promotes. You can't get to it, Mr. President, without a constitutional amendment. You can't get to it. The distinguished Presiding Officer and I went through this yesterday afternoon. I read down the 20 to 25 campaign finance initiatives we have had over the last 30 years, trying to get a grasp and a grab and a handle on this evil, this corruption. We have tried every way in the world, from having cloture after cloture vote, to arresting the Members and bringing them to the floor. We have tried everything. The best offer now, they say, is McCain-Feingold, but I have gone down it. It has voluntarism. We know from the campaign in Massachusetts what `voluntary' means in politics; it means temporary. When the two gentlemen that ran last year got down to the end of the campaign, they said of the public agreement they had agreed to--both of them are affluent--they said, `Let's forget about this limit and let's get affluent.' Then they started spending like gangbusters. There you go, voluntary limits and everything else. We have to nail this buzzard with a limit, a constitutional authority to limit. 
I hasten to add that I don't prescribe the specific limit. It is still up to Senator McConnell, if he has a majority, to prevail. Unfortunately, we see the machine. We see the orchestration. When I first presented this, we got many Republican cosponsors, and we had a majority, bipartisan vote. Again, on two other occasions, we had a bipartisan vote and the support of a majority. But I can see right now the orchestrated drumbeat of first amendment. And they go back to Patrick Henry and James Madison, and every other kind of fanciful position, to try to get everybody's mind on `let's not rip a hole in the first amendment.' And the very authority they are using that money is speech, or speech is money, is Buckley versus Valeo, which does what? It rips a hole in the first amendment. That is their very holy grail that speaks of money. `The first time in 200 years' I don't know how they have the unmitigated gall to come out and say `the first time in 200 years,' when in the same breath they are saying, `Buckley versus Valeo, speech is money.' Buckley versus Valeo limited the freedom of speech. It `ripped a hole,' as they phrase it, `in the first amendment.' We can read it. 
I read from Buckley versus Valeo, the majority opinion:  
It is unnecessary to look beyond the actual primary purpose to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption, resulting from large individual financial contributions, in order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for a $1,000 contribution limitation . . . 
I will read that again. 
. . . resulting from large individual financial contributions, in order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for a $1,000 contribution limitation on political discourse. 
They limited the freedom of speech of the contributor when they equated speech with money in this famous decision. 
Everybody knows it. But they want to totally ignore; like this fellow from South Carolina is going to rip a hole for the first time in 200 years in the first amendment. What a charade. They are hiding. They do not want to get serious. They don't want to limit expenditures. They don't want what they overwhelmingly supported 20 years ago with the original Federal Election Campaign Practices Act that said you are not going to be able to buy the office. Now, with Buckley versus Valeo, and particularly with the Colorado decision, you have to buy the office. And they show you how to do it. Two years ahead of time you can see a potential opponent. Just let the party start savaging him on radio and TV. If the gentleman were disposed to announce, by the time he got ready to announce he would announce for the State border trying to escape. They would make him an outright rascal by that time with money. 
That is not free and open discourse in the political arena. That is discourse in the financial arena. The financial marketplace is where we are allowing the decision to be made. And everybody in America knows it. That is why we had the investigating committee by unanimous vote of this body day before yesterday saying we cannot countenance this conduct any longer, and we can't dance about on illegalities. We have to look at the improper as well as the illegal. So we unanimously voted it. But now we are trying to cover up on a party position. 
Someone asked me, `Senator, how many votes?' I said, `Well, I came yesterday with hope. But after I saw the particular activity among some of the finest Members that you will ever have in this body, and come along giving me James Madison, Patrick Henry, and the Founding Fathers, they didn't have to get in the horse and wagon and go out and collect $14,000 a week in order to get the office. They didn't have to go around with their national party asking to cut up the opponent before he could even announce. They didn't ask him to spend an average of over $4 million. 
The Senator from Kentucky, who just withdrew, said he would have to get $5 million. So that is more than $14,000 a week--not a day, a week--each and every week between now and election time. Patrick Henry had the freedom of speech and a strong democracy trying to counter--of course, what the distinguished Senator from Texas commented on, the Gephardt remark. The truth of the matter is they had it in those days as I had it in my days of the beginning political arena. We went around on the stump. You had to get there, or you were embarrassed. `Why weren't you there?' You had to answer the questions. It wasn't all of that expense. It wasn't this third party activity in soft money. 
So don't come now on the floor joining the stonewalling on the other side of the aisle that we have an advantage--that we have a financial advantage in spite of all the shenanigans that President Clinton and Vice President Gore engage in. `We have $150 million more. Whatever they did, we did better.' You remember that song in the Broadway play. Whatever the Democrats did we can do better on money. And do not be toying around. Get in there and support that Constitution, and read. And they come out and religiously read it. You can't pass any laws, or do anything with the freedom of speech. And, in the next breath, they say whoopee for Valeo. Money is speech in politics. And we have to protect and limit the contributors. That in and of itself sets aside their thrust here today. 
I can read on. Maybe, if we have the time, we will read on because I would be prepared. Some of the colleagues said they would come. But I can see that there is very little interest. I was wondering why the majority leader allowed me to get this on an up-and-down vote. I know I had the amendment on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. And the distinguished Senator said, `Now, look. If you set this aside, withdraw your amendment, we will give you an up-and-down vote and sufficient time.' I can see after yesterday afternoon, Mr. President, that I have had sufficient time because whatever we say here, they are 
cast now in the sort of party preference of spending, spending, spending. I hope we can expose it because that wasn't the real opinion over on the other side of the aisle. I had Senator Kassebaum from Kansas. I had Senator Roth from Delaware. We still have, I am pretty sure, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania because he had a personal experience. When he comes to the floor you ought to listen very carefully because you can see in reality what this bifurcation finding that contributions are corruptive, or gives rather the appearance of corruption, whereas the explosive expenditures in campaigns, `Oh, that particularly has to be allowed to reign free because we have the free public discourse in politics.' You can see the `free.' None of this is free when it says here--`bought' radio advertisements. You can bet your boots the word `bought' b-o-u-g-h-t--`bought' radio advertising; the word `free.' Basically every one knows we are not talking about free speech. 
We have to go along with the Supreme Court in our discourse for the present time. But if we can come now with this proposed constitutional amendment which is stated is needed by a majority of the Senate now three times, by the law professors, by the State attorneys general. And the gentleman here says he has--that was interesting. He has the Washington Post and the New York Times. 
Let's see now. I heard just a minute ago from the Senator from Wisconsin. So let's see what the Wisconsin State Journal has to say. 
Our former colleague stood there as sort of the one man on S. 2--that supersonic plane that we can all spend billions on, and now the market has barely supported it financially. The Europeans with subsidies have to support it. But the entire Pentagon with all of their minions over here and big budget and everything else, one little Senator, Senator Proxmire of Wisconsin, stood there time and time again with a staff. And he finally conquered not just the Pentagon but the consciences of all of Senators, and we voted along with him. 
Now let's see, on Monday, March 10, the Wisconsin State Journal, and I quote:  
Part of the American dream is that any child can grow up to be President. Our Government is of, by and for the people, and ordinary citizens should have the opportunity to attain office by virtue of their ideas, their talent and their integrity. 
Unfortunately, the ideal of self-government has succumbed to rampant special interest money in elections that only an amendment to the U.S. Constitution can restore. Our elections are now auctions, with the average price for a seat in Congress costing more than $500,000. 
In the Senate, the average cost of a seat exceeds $4 million. As former Senator Proxmire said: 
Few Americans have the desire or ability to raise that sort of money. 
It is not only the time devoted to fundraising that we take away from the people's business, but also the fact that really good candidates are deterred from running for public office because they see the financial obstacles raised against them. For example, as was the case recently in Colorado, the party trying to defend an incumbent can come in and start savaging the likely opponent without any announcement and without any controls over their spending because there is no way to prove coordination. As a result of this flood of money, the regular, average, sane and prudent man or woman is deterred from running for office and democracy itself is corrupted. 
It is just not family concerns that causes candidates to bow out. It is the fact that if candidates get serious, they will get savaged. Often I run into friends of fairly good affluence who say, look, I can't expose my family to all this complete disclosure. 
People do not want to expose themselves to such public notoriety. If you want a free genealogical study of your family, Mr. President, all you have to do is announce for public office. Opposition researchers will dig up the place you were born, find out what kind of house you had, where you bought a washing machine on credit, automobiles, how much you contribute to the church, what is in your doctor's records and everything else you can think of. Most of it has little to do with one's qualifications for public office, but that is the nature of the beast--not the issues, not the ideas, not the candidate's integrity, but insinuations that can be distorted and used against an individual in the court of public opinion. 
But the real corruption is in the amount of money necessary in this day and age to run a modern political campaign. 
Let me go back to the quote of our former colleague, former Senator Proxmire from Wisconsin. 
The latest headlines focus on Democratic donors buying coffee at the White House and on the Republicans $250,000-a-person `season tickets' designed to give the largest donors more access to the elected officials. But the problem is not that interested people have given money and in return received access--politicians will always grant audiences to their donors. The problem is that few Americans can play in this big money game. Majority rule takes on a whole new meaning when the majority of campaign cash comes from just one quarter of 1 percent of Americans. 
Well-heeled interests have largely usurped power from the people. Big money determines who runs for public office and who wins elections. Last November, the House candidates who spent the most won their races 96 percent of the time. In Wisconsin, this held true in all but two races. 
We know the solution is to limit what anyone can spend on elections, whether they are running for office themselves or giving money to a candidate, party or independent advocacy campaign. But here we run into the problem of the foxes guarding the chicken coop--incumbents have little incentive to change a system they have mastered. 
However, even incumbents can act when public pressure is high. 
Let me say that again. `Even incumbents can act when public pressure is high.' We saw a perfect example of that the day before yesterday. The Republicans they had it greased; they had a majority in that Rules Committee. The leader came out and said this is the scope of the hearings that we are going to have, like it or not. We are only going to examine alleged illegalities and not the broader question of improper campaign financing. But, as they say, public pressure will change that, and public pressure did. 
As a result, we had 99 Senators vote on the day before yesterday for broader investigation into improper as well as illegal actions. 
After Watergate, Congress took bold steps and set limits on campaign cash. But in the now infamous 1976 case, Buckley versus Valeo, the Supreme Court struck down most of the law, ruling that unlimited spending on campaigns deserves protection as free speech. Again, quoting Senator Proxmire: 
When we equate spending money with speech, then speech is no longer free. 
I must read that again, because it is so basic. 
When we equate spending money with speech, then speech is no longer free. 
Moneyed interests can pay the price and the rest of us are free to be silent. The Buckley ruling is simply wrong. Twenty-four State attorneys general have recently called for Buckley to be reversed, as have a host of constitutional scholars. But the current court appears unlikely to do so. 
As in the past democratic struggles to end slavery and give women the vote, the only certain recourse is to amend the Constitution and overturn the Court. We must clearly authorize Congress and the States to limit campaign contributions and expenditures. 
A majority of the Senate has voted to support such an amendment in the past but a two-thirds vote is required. Another vote is likely soon. Senator Russ Feingold, D-Wis., has voted for the constitutional amendment in the past but now says he is against it. Senator Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., also has a mixed voting record. He has voted once for and once against a similar amendment. Let's hope that this time they read the headlines about fundraising scandals and decide to change them by voting for the amendment. 
We must take down the For Sale sign on Capitol Hill by authorizing limits on campaign cash with a constitutional amendment. Let us not be daunted by how difficult such a task may appear, for the price of inaction is far too great. 
Mr. President, I thought that we might be daunted by how difficult the task would appear. That argument has been made previously by our good friend Lloyd Cutler. He said it would take 4 to 20 years to get a constitutional amendment enacted, and therefore we were wasting our time. But it has been 20 years since the Buckley decision. Let us not talk about wasting time. That is what we have been doing since Buckley. 
How are you going to stop doing that? A constitutional amendment. The arguments were, `It would take too long,' or, `I don't believe in a constitutional amendment; leave it as it is.' 
Now, we know the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, and the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Senator Roberts, engaged in their little sweetheart exchange on the floor yesterday. They both believe in amending the Constitution. They both voted to amend the Constitution in order to prevent the desecration of the American flag. In fairness to Senator McConnell, he said it was a mistake. Fine business. The Court made a mistake when they outlawed the Federal income tax. So, what did the body politic do? The Congress passed a joint resolution and the people of the United States ratified the 16th amendment. Let us read how you can correct a mistake. Amendment 16:  
The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration. 
That is not what they are talking about now, because we know mistakes are corrected; mistakes with respect to elections have been corrected. The 21st, 22d, 23d, 24th, and 25th amendments to the Constitution, all except the last one, have dealt with elections. So we corrected those mistakes. One important mistake, perhaps most significant, was the poll tax. The people said, `Wait a minute, disqualifying people from voting through a poll tax--we are not going to allow it.' So we adopted that amendment to the Constitution. 
Now we want to disqualify candidates, parties, and everyone else from running for office by allowing the explosive spending of money; thousands of dollars, $200,000 for this, $500,000 for that. It is just outrageous. Yet, they do not want to recognize it. They want to give me Patrick Henry and go back to the first amendment and read it to mean that any restriction `rips a hole' in our freedom of speech. But it is not so when for the safety of people, we prohibit shouting `fire' in a theater; not when for national security reasons, we prohibit disclosure of classified documents; not so in the matter of obscenity and false and deceptive advertising. Just the other day, concerning a buffer zone around an abortion clinic--the Supreme Court said, oh, no, you don't have a freedom of speech in that buffer zone. That restriction is constitutional. 
The contention was made that unless people were given the right to be heard in that particular area, you were ripping a hole in the first amendment. The Supreme Court said no. Get out. Don't get into this buffer zone. 
So we have example after example, but none better than the Senate itself that says you cannot have unlimited debate here in this body; we can get a 60-vote majority and hush you. Over on the House side, they have to follow the 3-minute rule; the 5-minute rule. In committees, we regularly agree and conform to a 5-minute rule for all the members. We know the value of limiting speech. Don't come here with this sanctimony about the first amendment and Patrick Henry and talking about ripping a hole in the first amendment for the first time in 200 years. Buckley versus Valeo--the very basic authority that you use when you come to the floor of the U.S. Senate saying speech is money, or money is speech--ripped a hole in the first amendment. That is the exact finding of Buckley versus Valeo. 
So, that will not wash.

Mr. HOLLINGS. These liberal eastern papers, the Washington Post and the New York Times make the argument of free speech. I hope you midwesterners do not get bitten by that. I want to see you stay in the U.S. Senate. I want to see you all continue to serve. The best way is not to get wrapped around and go back to the Midwest and say that the ACLU is a wonderful authority. I know how to lose an election. I have lost before. I don't know any quicker way to lose one than to run around in my backyard or your backyard, Mr. President, quoting the ACLU. You folks have to be embarrassed with this kind of argument about first amendment and the ACLU. And even more embarrassing is the anecdotal nonsense they put up relative to what could happen. The Senator from Utah even said Congress might decide not to let anyone oppose them. 
He got into a wonderful discourse with the Senator from Kentucky. He said if this amendment passed, Congress could put such low limits that the opponent's name would never become known and that Congress might decide not to let anyone oppose them. 
Of course, in the next breath they say it is vague, 
because the language says `reasonable,' `reasonable limits.' 
The courts said they are going to decide what is reasonable. But they put up all kinds of examples about how newspapers might write an editorial against someone. And they said that could be a contribution for or a contribution against. 
Right now the newspapers do write editorials for and do write editorials against. We have the free press. No one has the gall to contend that is a contribution in the context of being a violation. No one is going to contend that now, and they are not going to contend it later on. 
But these are all straw men, because they do not have the argument. But they have the frontal assault of Patrick Henry and the first amendment. And trying to say, as the Senator from Texas said, the simple question is `Do you believe in free speech or not?' He says if he can answer this question, then he is home free. All 100 of us believe in that. That is not what we are voting on. The question is, Do you believe in limiting spending or not? They know it. And they do not want to hear of it. So they bring out the volume and repetition of numerous Senators talking about 200 years and the first amendment and Patrick Henry. If you pass this, you can go back to what we voted for in 1974 and have complete disclosure, rules against bundling, rules against soft money, rules against individual wealth buying elections. It would free up the speech of the poor. Buckley really freed up the speech of the rich, but it has taken away freedom of speech from the poor. That is the actual effect of the decision, and we are suffering from it. 
We have lost the confidence of the people in the political institutions up here because we do not want to deal with it. We tried and tried and tried over a 30-year period without success and now we are using the octopus approach. We want to sneak off in the dark ink of a charade about Patrick Henry, the first amendment, and what may happen. 
Mr. President, let us go back to better times. Let us go back to better times. 
What happened was, in better times, we had the orderly process of several hearings before the Judiciary Committee. We had several witnesses. And I come to the distinguished Mr. Lloyd Cutler, who served as Counsel for the President. 
But he says now on the House side:  
An amendment would take too long to adopt, 4 to 10 years. 
He did not testify on behalf of the Commission for the Constitutional System heretofore, but he says now that it would take too long. We know that is totally wrong. The last five amendments preceding the most recent one, which took 200 years, took an average of 20 months to ratify. 
The gentleman, I think, is suffering from battle fatigue because he said: This could be a camel's-nose-under-the-tent aspect. He did not see a camel's-nose-under-the-tent aspect when he was representing the Commission for the Constitutional System. He says that the Hollings resolution in the Senate authorizes `reasonable regulation of expenditures. Only the Supreme Court can draw the line between reasonable and unreasonable.' 
The courts are always directing the jurors in determining if they have gotten a reasonable decision, the `reasonable, sane and prudent man,' in law talk, is the test. We did not have `reasonable' when we first drafted it, but we put it in there so the amendment will not look categorical and result in a legal contest. The Supreme Court is certainly going to decide if it is unreasonable, as they have decided that the matter of contributions is constitutional, if limited to that speech, but unconstitutional if you limit the speech of those who spend it. 
Let me read parts of the hearing here that we had before the Judiciary Committee some 10 years ago. We had already been on this a dog-chasing-its-tail solution for 10 years. 
My name is Lloyd N. Cutler. Along with Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Mr. Douglas Dillon, I am a Co-Chairman of the Committee on the Constitutional System, a group of several hundred present and former legislators, executive branch officials, political party officials, professors and civic leaders who are interested in analyzing and correcting some of the weaknesses that have developed in our political system. 
One of the most glaring weaknesses, of course, is the rapidly escalating cost of political campaigns, and the growing dependence of incumbents and candidates on money from interest groups who expect the recipient to vote in favor of their particular interests. Incumbents and candidates must devote large portions of their time to begging for money; they are often tempted to vote the conflicting interests of their contributors and to create a hodgepodge of conflicting and indefensible policies; and in turn public frustration with these policies creates cynicism and contempt for the entire political process. 
A serious attempt to deal with the campaign financing problem was made in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 and the 1976 amendments, which set maximum limits on the amounts of individual contributions and on the aggregate expenditures of candidates and so-called independent committees supporting such candidates. The constitutionality of these provisions was challenged in the famous case of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, in which I had the honor of sharing the argument in support of the statute with Professor Archibald Cox. While the Supreme Court sustained the constitutionality of the limits on contributions, it struck down the provision limiting expenditures for candidates and independent committees supporting such candidates. It found an inseparable connection between an expenditure limit and the extent of a candidate's or committee's political speech, which did not exist in the case of a limit on the size of each contribution by a non-speaker unaccompanied by any limit on the aggregate amount a candidate could raise. It also found little if any proven connection between corruption and the size of a candidate's aggregate expenditures, as distinguished from the size of individual contributions to a candidate. 
The Court did, however, approve the Presidential Campaign Financing Fund created by the 1976 amendments, including the condition it imposed barring any presidential nominee who accepted the public funds from spending more than a specified limit. However, it remains unconstitutional for Congress to place any limits on expenditures by independent committees on behalf of a candidate. In recent presidential elections these independent expenditures on behalf of one candidate exceeded the amount of federal funding he accepted. Moreover, so long as the Congress remains deadlocked on proposed legislation for the public financing of Congressional campaigns, it is not possible to use the public financing device as a means of limiting Congressional campaign expenditures. 
Mind you, Mr. President, as I cover this particular testimony, it is 10 years ago. They are talking about the dilemma, the problem, and how it was exacerbating at that particular time. You can tell the frustration from the wording of this testimony. 
I go to the quote of Mr. Cutler: 
Accordingly, the Committee on the Constitutional System has come to the conclusion that the only effective way to limit the explosive growth of campaign financing is to adopt a constitutional amendment. 
Now, my colleague from Kentucky says you do not have any authority and there is no constituency. The fact of the matter is that this particular committee is a group of several hundred present and former legislators, executive branch officials, political party officials, professors, and civic leaders who are interested in analyzing and correcting some of the weaknesses that have developed in our political system. 
Not the ACLU. I do not rely on the ACLU for my case. I want to win this thing. I do not want to be spreading the dark ink of the ACLU in the Washington Post. Go down to the Washington Post and ask them for free speech. Say, `I want a little free speech. Not a whole page, a half, maybe a quarter of a page.' They will not give you a little tidbit of a column free. 
Going back to the testimony before the Judiciary Committee: 
The amendment would be a very simple one consisting of only 46 words. It would state merely that `Congress shall have power to set reasonable limits on campaign expenditures by or in support of any candidate in the primary or general election for federal office. The States shall have the same power with respect to campaign expenditures in elections for state and local offices.' 
This was 10 years ago, Mr. President, and those who have been working on this particular problem copied the language, adopted the suggestion. It was a reasonable thing because here are the best of minds, without a particular Republican bent or Democratic bent or interest, who said here is the way to do it not only constitutionally but in a constitutionally sound manner so that the court could properly interpret it. 
Let me go back to the testimony of Mr. Cutler: 
Our proposed amendment would enable Congress to set limits not only on direct expenditures by candidates and their own committees, but also on expenditures by so-called independent committees in support of such a candidate. The details of the actual limits would be contained in future legislation and could be changed from time to time as Congress in its judgment sees fit. 
It may of course be argued that the proposed amendment, by authorizing reasonable limits on expenditures, would necessarily set limits on the quantity of speech on behalf of a candidate and that any limits, no matter how ample, is undesirable. But in our view the evidence is overwhelming by now that unlimited campaign expenditures will eventually grow to the point where they consume so much of our political energies and so fracture our political consensus that they will make the political process incapable of governing effectively. 
Mr. President, I divert here to emphasize just exactly that concern that our political consensus will be so fractured that it will make `the political process incapable of governing effectively.' Put that on as a test to this particular Congress. If you think we have governed effectively, I have grave misgivings with that opinion. I think that is exactly where we are, and exactly was the concern 10 years ago. 
And I continue to quote the testimony of Mr. Cutler:  
Even Congress has found that unlimited speech can destroy the power to govern; that is why the House of Representatives has imposed time limits on Members' speeches for decades and why the Senator has adopted a rule permitting 60 Senators to end a filibuster. One might fairly paraphrase Lord Acton's famous aphorism about power by saying, `All political money corrupts; unlimited political money corrupts absolutely.' 
There is no question in this Senator's mind. Quoting further: 
Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would not be discouraged from taking the amendment route by any feeling that constitutional amendments take too long to get ratified. 
You see, Cutler has come over from the other side earlier this 
year and he said it would take too long. He was not worried then, some 10 years ago, because he knew exactly that. The last five amendments at that particular time were all ratified within the 20-month period. Now he has misgivings. 
Let me quote further: 
The fact is that the great majority of amendments submitted by Congress to the States during the last 50 years have been ratified within 20 months after they were submitted. All polls show that the public strongly supports limits on campaign expenditures. The principal delay will be in getting the amendment through Congress. Since that is going to be a difficult task, we ought to start immediately. Unlimited campaign expenditures and the political diseases they cause are going to increase at least as rapidly as new cases of AIDS, and it is high time to start getting serious about the problem. 
Mr. Chairman, on three past occasions we the people have amended the Constitution to correct weaknesses in that rightly revered document as interpreted by the Supreme Court. On at least two of these occasions--the Dred Scott decision and the decision striking down federal income taxes, history has subsequently confirmed that the amendments were essential to our development as a healthy, just and powerful society. A third such challenge is now before us. The time has come to meet it. 
That was in March 1988. 
Now, Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleagues on the Senate floor. At this time I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this explains the subjects outside our first amendment protections. It mentions the Sullivan case, New York Times, and others. 
One. We are not talking here about free speech. We are talking about paid speech. My amendment reads `expenditures.' It has nothing to do with the free press. The very horrors that are mentioned could happen today, and in fact, happened to this particular Senator in his race for reelection back in 1992 with the Wall Street Journal. 
I will get into that in depth, but I am delighted at this time, Mr. President, to yield, and I hope the Senator from Rhode Island can be recognized.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Chair. I had hoped, when I see the distinguished Senator, that he and others on the other side would have an open mind. I know there was a time when that occurred. 
But, obviously, you can see from their strategy here that they are taking the party position. It is unfortunate when you do that and try to hide behind free speech, which is not at issue. We are talking about paid speech. But instead, they hide behind James Madison and Patrick Henry and do not want to recognize the truth. 
I would be ready to vote this afternoon. I can see at a glance that time and again we face a false charge. Time and again my opponents come up with the same false representation. And time and again we met with anecdotal `could be's,' and `what would happen's.' 
For example, the distinguished Senator from Alabama just said, `This is remarkable. This goes to a fundamental issue. Congress should not be amending the Constitution.' 
And under my amendment, Congress is not. Instead, it will be up to the people of America. This amendment simply is a joint resolution giving authority to the Congress to limit expenditures, should the States approve this. We have to get 34 States to approve of this joint resolution, and this joint resolution only gives to the people an opportunity to vote. I wrote the first version of this resolution 10 years ago with, `The Congress is hereby authorized to regulate or control expenditures in Federal elections.' The States and the Governors and everyone else said, `Include us.' So we amended the joint resolution giving the people a chance to vote. So it is not Congress that is running around amending the Constitution. 
Then the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, `When we put the rights of free speech in the hands of Congress'--we have done it. But we did it with respect to false and deceptive advertising. On television and radio, we gave Congress the right to regulate free speech when Congress acted in controlling obscenity. We told the Federal Communications Commission, as the administrative arm of the Congress, `We want you to watch these programs and rule out obscenity.' And then in Buckley, in a 5-to-4 decision by the Supreme Court, they held--as the Senator from Washington says, if we put the rights of free speech in the hands of Congress, oh, that would be a terrible thing. But if we look closely at the Buckley decision, it has been put there and has been found constitutional by none other than the U.S. Supreme Court. 
When the Congress acted in 1974 to control expenditures in Federal elections, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, to use the opposition's expression, took a big hunk out of the first amendment. And there are those who would, in political discourse, see their freedom of speech to contribute as they choose limited. So don't come around here with the call of horrors--`this is fundamental'; `this is so terrible'; or, `this is remarkable.' 
Their conduct in the treatment of this joint resolution is what is remarkable. They don't want to admit that what is involved here is limiting spending, not freedom. There is nothing free here at all but our chance to limit expenditures in political campaigns. If you want to limit spending, if you want to excise the cancer on the body politic that has grown so now that we can't even do our business except in a party fashion, so be it. 
We have tried over the years in every way. I don't want to clutter the Record with the entire article in Congressional Quarterly a few years back discussing the need for campaign finance reform, but it I will read part of it: 
Most Democrats supported spending limits which would allow challengers to spend on a level equal to incumbents. Under the 1976 Supreme Court decision in Buckley v. Valeo, spending limits had to be voluntary. The Court said that public financing was a legitimate carrot to encourage compliance with those voluntary limits, a concept some Democrats supported anyway, calling public funding `clean money.' Most Republicans, however, strenuously oppose taxpayer financing of congressional campaigns which they liken to welfare for politicians. Many Republicans also argued that spending limits locked in incumbent advantages. They said challengers needed the option to outspend incumbents to make themselves equally viable to voters. 
Then, Mr. President, going along: 
In 1987, debate over these issues threw the Senate into a virtually unprecedented procedural fit. Consideration of a bill that included spending limits and Federal funding stretched over 9 months and forced a record 8 cloture votes in an effort to break a Republican filibuster, a 53-hour-24-minute session and a Senator injured and dragged to the floor under arrest highlighted the episode. In the end, the Senate failed to overcome partisan divisions, and the bill succumbed to the process. 
The article goes on to talk about a bill in 1992. They wrote: 
In the years that followed with a Republican in the White House pledging to veto any bill approved by the Democratic Congress, neither party showed much interest in restaging the drama. Instead, when an ethics scandal broke, such as the Keating Five affair in 1990 and 1991, in which five Senators were accused of accepting favors from a savings and loan magnet, campaign finance legislation was trotted out as a symbol of reform. The two Chambers reached agreement on a bill in 1992, after the House came under siege over the House bank scandal. That bill stapled a plan House Democrats had crafted for their campaigns to an entirely different plan Senate Democrats had sanctioned. Both plans, however, included spending limits and public finance and, as promised, President Bush vetoed the bill. 
I only mention this because it has been a long, hard road, and I hoped, as that article said, that we would have another fit here. I thought that we would get a fit of conscience here and really do away with the partisanship stonewalling, because they know that is what is involved. They have the advantage, in spite of all that the White House did in the last Presidential race. Just mark it down in Senator Thompson's hearing that the Republicans got $150 million more. So whatever the Democrats did, the Republicans did better. We all know it, and you can ask anybody in the public. 
We have been in the game, we have watched it, we have read about it, everybody knows about it, and we have tried over the years to correct it. In 1966, Congress adopted public financing for Presidential elections, and then in 1967, they repealed public financing for Presidential elections. 
In 1971, there was the passage of the Federal Election 
Campaign Act. 
In 1974, the amendments to that. 
In 1976, a further amendment. 
In 1979, another amendment. 
By 1985, we had the Boren-Goldwater amendment--we had bipartisanship then--to change the contribution limits and eliminate the PAC bundling, but that was tabled. 
Then, in 1986, the Boren-Goldwater amendment was adopted, but then it didn't go far. 
In 1988, Senator Byrd forced nine votes on the motion to instruct the Sergeant at Arms and request the attendance while trying to get a vote on S. 2. That is when they arrested a Senator, only the second time in history, dragging him in. 
In 1988, we had the Hollings constitutional amendment to limit campaign expenditures, and we got a 53 to 47 vote on cloture. Of course, we needed 60 votes at that particular time, and the majority didn't control. 
In 1989, S. 139, a comprehensive reform passed the Senate but never made it out of the conference. 
In 1991, of course, as I just mentioned, a comprehensive reform passed, which President Bush vetoed. 
In 1993, we had a sense of the Senate by this Senator that Congress should adopt a constitutional amendment limiting campaign expenditures which passed 52 to 43. 
In 1993, we had a comprehensive reform pass the Senate but it never made it out of conference. 
In 1995, again the Hollings constitutional amendment to limit campaign expenditures offered as amendment to the balanced budget amendment. That was tabled by a vote of 52 to 45. 
And, in 1995, the Senate passed the sense-of-the-Senate amendment to address the campaign finance reform during the 104th Congress. Again, we got a majority vote. 
Then, in 1996, we had cloture on the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform, and that cloture vote failed by a vote of 54 to 46. 
So we keep hammering and hammering and trying every kind of which way. But we know that the intent in 1974 was to prevent individuals from buying their way into office. And now we are continuing our fight in trying to overturn the Buckley decision that held the office must be bought. We are trying to remove that requirement, because the money in campaigns has gone up, up, and away. Good people are being withheld from public service, and the public is losing confidence in the democratic process. 
The only way to save this democracy is amend the Constitution. And rather than recognize this fact, the opposition simply raises strawman after strawman. 
The distinguished Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, say, `Might a Congress not come up and cut off speech entirely?' The Senator from New Mexico says, `I could dream up a scenario where that would be constitutional.' He said he did not think it was going to happen, but he could think of that later on at a time when Congress would act in an inordinate fashion. 
Then he turns to the Senator from Washington. He asks, `Can't you think of a Congress that may shut down entirely any opposition that just comes?' Well, Senator Gorton, the Senator from Washington, said, `I doubt that that would happen, but it is the most fundamental attack on the freedom of speech since the adoption of the Constitution.' 
So they continue the same rhetoric about the freedom of speech. But if Buckley says that freedom of speech can be limited with respect to those contributing in politics, then why not for those spending? They do not want to answer that question. 
Chief Justice Burger, in the better of the opinions in that case, said they are two sides of the same coin, contributions and expenditures. 
To quote exactly, he said, `The Court's attempt to distinguish the communication inherent in political contributions from the speech aspects of political expenditures simply will not wash.' 
But, no, we come here with the Senator from Alabama, `Congress should not amend the Constitution.' I agree with him. It cannot. But instead, we let five Justices of the Supreme Court--over the opposition of four individuals--amend the Constitution whereby they limit freedom of speech as to contributions. 
I put it word for word in this particular joint resolution. I wanted to show how we had come and aimed right down the barrel of the U.S. Supreme Court on the so-called freedom of speech. `Congress shall have power to set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted by * * *.' That is word for word the Buckley versus Valeo decision. You can limit the amount of contributions. 
That is what Congress did in the 1974 act. It is a frustrating thing that is going on today because we try and try over a 30-year period. We arrest people, get into a 9-month debate, and have cloture resolutions. 
But now they ignore the need for action. They go in the back room and say, we are going to vote as a party so do not worry about it. We let it go on over the weekend, discuss it maybe on Friday or Monday, and vote on Tuesday, because no one is going to listen. All that is required is for someone to come out from time to time, mention freedom of speech, and talk about how remarkable, how untoward, how drastic this amendment is. 
Then they have the Senator from Kentucky get up and say, `Don't you think the Congress could do all these horrible things?' Well, it has already occurred. Congress passed the 1974 act, and the Supreme Court has held it binding. Our mistake was in figuring that conscience and common sense would say, as Chief Justice Burger said: two sides of the same coin. 
We say, `Congress shall have power to set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions that may be accepted * * *.' We have done it, and we are doing it. Then we add `* * * and the amount of expenditures'--which is what we try to get--`that may be made in these campaigns.' That is all it is. And it is said, let the 
people vote on it. 
I wish I could get enough publicity to get the people focused on what is involved here and break down the stonewall thrown up by most on the other side of the aisle against limiting expenditures. We tried in a bipartisan way in 1974 to limit expenditures, and we said so much per our votes at that particular time. 
After Watergate, Congress did not say, `Heavens above, let's limit the campaigns to $50,000,' or any such thing. We had limits in a small State like South Carolina where we could spend $510,000, and inflate that over the 20-year period. That is not $50,000. But no, they come up and say what Congress could do and how the U.S. Supreme Court, under the mandate of being reasonable, would agree with them. 
You know and I know that is a straw man. It should not even be considered seriously. But they come here with a very analytical argument about, `The media sets the agenda, the fourth branch,' and try add to their parade of horribles as to what the media could do. Well, look at this particular joint resolution. It has nothing to do with the freedom of the press, absolutely nothing to do with the freedom of the press. And on the other hand, you have that freedom of the press right now. 
I related in the debate yesterday that I was running along with a nice little lead going into the election in 1992, and along comes the Wall Street Journal and Paul Gigot. We had not heard of him before and we have not heard of him since. But it was coordinated with the London Economist and Robert Novak and others. Articles started being written about the right to work. They know South Carolina is a right-to-work State. And they said, by cracky, I was opposed to it, but in fact I voted for it as a member of the State legislature and have stuck with it throughout my political career. Organized labor knows that. 
My opponents try to make the claim that I could say that the editorial was a contribution against me or a contribution for my opponent and therefore set it aside. Nonsense. They know that. 
If you get a violent, caustic, scavenging editorial against you as a politician, wake up, because you are in the game. As Harry says, you have to take the heat or get out of the kitchen. If you are in the kitchen of politics, that is going to happen. There is no such thing as stopping it under our Constitution. Certainly not this amendment, which is to limit campaign expenditures, not the free press. 
But they try to distort and stretch with this strawman exercise and charade that we have been going through here all day today. Here and now, and I have experienced it, that kind of activity has already occurred. 
What we say here, and it is as simple as was testified before the Judiciary Committee in 1988, is 43 very simple, very clear-cut, words to limit expenditures in Federal, State, and local elections. That is all it is. Shall we do it? Shall we have the authority? It does not address those questions. It does not say how you do it or that you must do it. 
The Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, has been forthright. He says we have not spent enough money on politics. He talks about how we spend way more money on cat food and dog food and Kibbles 'n Bits and yogurt. You would think that there would be some kind of dignity in the silly things they put out as real arguments against this particular mission. But the Senator from Kentucky has come forward and said we are not spending enough. Well, that is forthright. Maybe he can persuade others, as he has persuaded the stonewalling opposition here today, and he might get it increased. Then we can all get out and let the idle rich come in here and make the laws for the people of America, because we will not have any regular folks that are willing to listen to the people, who demand we get this money out of politics, that we limit this thing, that we get this corruption out of politics. 
Everybody admits to it and everybody says, `I am for reform, reform, reform, campaign finance reform.' But you cannot get reform unless you have the authority. This has been proven over the last 30 years by all of these failed attempts. So if you want new authority, which does not say whether or not to do it, does not try to limit newspapers, does not say what it is expenditures, vote for this amendment. As a politician, you are not going to get anything free from the free press. Go to them and ask them for a quarter- or half-page ad and they will laugh at you. They just do not give free coverage. I have not ever heard of a newspaper doing it yet. 
The same with the radio and the TV advertisements. Go tell them how much you want to buy, and we are couched in a very sinister way into these 30-second ads. You cannot discuss intelligently the issues before the American people. That is the real burden on an incumbent. They say, `Well, Hollings, you voted in 1974 one way and now in 1994 you are voting another way.' Well, you come forward and try to explain that, but you cannot explain that in a 20-second bite on TV. And try to buy 5 minutes. They will say, `No, we are not selling that, and there is nothing you can do about it. Nothing you can do about it. We control the prime time that you need to do it. We control that freedom of your speech.' 
It is already controlled here in the U.S. Senate with the filibuster rules, and over on the House side with the 1-minute, 2-minute, 5-minute rules, and in the committee with 5 minutes per Senator to examine the witnesses. We all agree and understand and know the reason for the limits, but then they bring on the dog and pony show, saying `remarkable, fundamental, never heard of it before.' Who believes that? 
Mr. President, for 21 years Buckley versus Valeo has been on the books and we have abided by it, as the distinguished Senator from Arizona says. We have the PAC limits and individual contribution limits. But there is no limit on the individual candidate. That is what we were after back in 1974. I was there. I voted. We said, `Mr. Rich Man, you cannot buy this office.' Now with this half a haircut solution, what we have is the ones who contribute 
are totally limited, but the ones with the wealth are totally unlimited. In reality, then, you have taken away the speech of the poor. You have indirectly limited the speech of the poor in spending. 
The Supreme Court, five individuals against four, have amended that Constitution. You know it and I know it, but yet you come up here and talk about what is remarkable and fundamental and `the first time in 200 years' and on and on and on. Congress was given the authority to prohibit false and deceptive advertising and it has been upheld by the Court. Congress has amended the right of free speech with respect to obscenity. It has been exercised, and in the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court upheld. In a sense, we now have the rights of free speech in the hands of Congress. They said that is fundamental, and do not ever do that. Like this is something new, putting the right of free speech in the hands of Congress. But Congress has done it, and it has been upheld in Buckley versus Valeo. To use their expression, the Court `took a big hunk' out of the first amendment, and found that among those who want to exercise their free speech by contributing, free speech is limited. 
So we should get the real facts out about what we have here. We have a bottom line. Do not come here congratulating on a misdescription by the Senator from Texas as to whether or not you are for free speech. We say expenditure. We do not say anything about `free' in this amendment. It has nothing to do with free. It has to do with paid speech, paid expression. 
I was really moved by the Senator from Texas, who tried to change the debate. That is what you have constantly with the stonewall against limiting spending on the other side of the aisle. That is what we have. They do not want to limit spending. They will say, `Well, you have the advantages of people. You have the AFL-CIO, the organization labor fellows, but we have the banks and we have the money and you expect us to give up our money.' 
Well, well, well, I think that both sides have the cancer of money. They ought to be able to recognize the reality that faces us after the 30-year trying. They ought to give the people of America the right to vote and amend the Constitution. 
When my Southern State and a lot of other Southern States had the poll test, we amended the Constitution. I told the story about the poor minority that presented himself to the polls in the early years and we had the literacy test. They said to the poor minority, `Boy, read that paper.' They gave him a Chinese newspaper. What goes around comes around; we are back to China. And the poor individual just looked at it and he said, `Yes, sir, I can read it.' He said, `You can? What does it say?' `It says, 'Ain't no poor minority fellow going to vote in South Carolina today.' Yes, he could get the message. There were all kinds of devices to prevent some from voting. However, we have amended the Constitution to fix that. 
If Madison, Patrick Henry, and Jefferson and all that crowd that the other side has been celebrating were so good, with their slaves, why did we have to pass the 14th amendment? We didn't agree with what they found, so we had the discrimination cases and the civil rights movement. In my lifetime, we have had the poll test. We changed the Constitution to fix that. 
We changed the Constitution when we made a mistake in Prohibition. We changed the Constitution when we made a mistake with respect to the Federal income tax law. 
Now, professors, all the studied minds, jurists, attorneys general, and the like have, said the Supreme Court made a mistake in Buckley versus Valeo, and the only way to correct it is with a forthright, restricted, limited kind of constitutional amendment. An amendment that says expenditures are limited in Federal, State, and local elections. It is not free speech, it is paid speech. We are just as assiduous as any other Senator in the protection of the freedom of speech. We know its value, but we know it must have exceptions. 
I put in the Record, Mr. President, a statement by Prof. Lawrence Tribe of the freedom of speech and some of its exceptions that have developed over the years. So don't come here on the floor of the Senate with the act about fundamental, how remarkable this is. Egads, the U.S. Senate has voted for a constitutional amendment to grant Congress the authority to limit campaign spending three times. We just voted 4 years ago for a Sense of the Senate Resolution. Is there any sense of history and experience around here that we can finally come to grips with the fundamental--yes, it is a fundamental--money is a cancer on the body politic. 
If money corrupts in political campaigns, then unlimited money corrupts absolutely in political campaigns. We know that, in warfare, he who controls the air controls the battle. We know and understand and appreciate that, in campaigns, he who controls the airwaves controls the campaign. 
What you have here is the rich, as we saw 2 years ago in California, spending $30 million to be a Senator, and we think that is legitimate. It is a disgrace. It is buying the office, and everybody knows it. 
The rich who walk in and say, `I am making so much money, but I need another tax cut, a flat tax,' and they sell it by controlling the airwaves with their millions of dollars in a Presidential race--they ought to hang our heads in shame. That kind of activity is going on and is even covered by the free press. They ought to understand that freedoms really are in jeopardy when we allow the rich to come along and buy the office. 
My amendment says reasonable limits on expenditures, not on speech. 
Mr. President, if others want to be heard, I will be glad to yield the floor, but I have plenty here with respect to the authorities and the witnesses that appeared before the Judiciary Committee. We have had hearings. The former Senator from Illinois, Paul Simon, was on the other side. He withheld in that 
committee for a long time. I had to struggle to get a majority vote. But we had the witnesses. They were heard, and a majority of the Judiciary Committee voted the amendment out and to the floor. 
Please, my gracious, they reported it out. Once out, we didn't get it passed, but we got a sense of the Senate that it should be passed. Senators want to get that political credit. It's a pollster politician that says, `I am for reform and that is what we ought to do.' `Yes, sir, I believe we ought to limit this financial cancer.' `Yes, I voted reform when it was only a Sense of the Senate.' And then when they get to real reform, they put on this big show here trying to quote Mr. Gephardt and saying, `You can't have a strong democracy and freedom of speech.' They know and I know, this democracy is strong because of free speech--none of us believe otherwise. I think it is a distortion. I think it is a distortion perhaps of what the gentleman said, but be that as it may, no one ascribes to that in this particular body. 
Everybody knows how we got here. Incidentally, we all got here not through free speech--unless somebody was appointed, and I can't think of any appointments now that we have had the election--but every one of the 100 have had to pay through the nose to be heard on the TV, to be covered in the newspapers, to be heard on the radio, and seen on the television, billboards, and yard signs. So we know all about the paid speech. 
That is what we are trying to do, put an ultimate limit on it because, once done, then we can get a handle on some of the real abuses. Then we control all of the monkeyshines that go on. 
Once you get it limited and fully disclosed, like in the 1974 act where every dollar that I receive in a campaign is recorded in the secretary of the senate's office in my State capital and with the Secretary of the Senate, then you get it under control. With that limit and disclosure, you can see from whence they come, and who has, if at all, tried to buy or has been subject to undue influence. 
After all, it is the people who are the ultimate jury. They decide on election day. You can refer to that public record and say, see, he is bought and paid for by such and such an industry or such and such an interest, whatever it is that comes out in the campaign. That is what the disclosure requires. You can't receive huge sums and have it obscured. 
We ran it the right way back in 1974. But the justices who amended the Constitution in that Buckley decision, they created the system we have been tortured with now for the past 20 years. And every time we make the good college try to fix it, they come out here, and I am surprised, frankly, at this particular charade because they got a lot of good conscientious Members that have come to the Senate, and they say we will not fix it. 
Some of those Members have run on the proposition of trying to limit spending. Here is the one opportunity to ask the American people if that is what they want to do. Hollings is not amending the Constitution. The Senate is not amending the Constitution. The Congress is not amending the Constitution. We simply, in a little closely worded amendment, said the people will have a chance to vote on it in the several States. 
The last amendment to the Constitution took 200 years to pass. That is the 27th amendment. `No law varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives shall take effect until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.' 
Congress submitted the text of the 27th amendment to the States as a part of the proposed Bill of Rights on September 25, 1789. The amendment was not ratified with the first 10 amendments, which became effective on December 15, 1791. The 27th amendment was ratified on May 7, 1992, by the vote of the State of Michigan. 
Just like the 27th amendment, you can put this Hollings-Specter amendment up and let the people decide. You don't have to talk about this amendment being so remarkable. It is not remarkable to let the people decide. Only the people will change our fundamental rights. Don't believe those who say it is going to guarantee incumbency or any other of those parade of horrors that they bring up. Just remember, we are just giving the people, the good, commonsense American people, the chance to vote. 
When the people looked at the 27th amendment, it wasn't until 203 years later, in 1992, that they finally got the State of Michigan to ratify it and the people decided. So there you are. It is just a chance to give the people chance to clear up this Buckley versus Valeo decision. 
The distinguished Chief Justice said, `The Court's result does violence to the intent of Congress.' There isn't any doubt about it. I was there. Chief Justice Burger,  
The Court's result does violence to the intent of Congress in this comprehensive scheme of campaign finance. By dissecting the act bit by bit and casting off vital parts, the Court fails to recognize the whole of this act is greater than the sum of its parts. Congress intended to regulate all aspects of Federal campaign finances. 
I read again Chief Justice Burger: 
Congress intended to regulate all aspects of Federal campaign finances. But what remains after today's holding leaves no more than a shadow of what Congress contemplated. 
This decision, a 5-to-4 decision, and they are talking about what Congress might do. Look at what those five individuals have done. 
Look what Justice White said in dissent, 
The judgment of Congress was that reasonably effective campaigns could be conducted within the limits established by the act and that the communicative efforts of these campaigns would not seriously suffer. In this posture of the case, there is no sound basis for invalidating the expenditure limitations so long as the purposes they serve are legitimate and sufficiently substantial, which in my view they are. 
So there is Justice White finding them `substantial' back 20 years ago, long before any kind of Keating Five, long before the Lincoln Bedroom, long before the soft money scourge with the Colorado decision. Long before all these things, there was `substantial' then, and they are more than `substantial' today. `Expenditure ceilings reinforce the contribution limits and help eradicate the hazard of corruption.' 
Justice Byron `Whizzer' White couldn't be more correct. He couldn't be more on target. We know it. The American people outside this Chamber know it. They have asked for a chance to correct it. Let me read further from Justice White. 
I have little doubt, in addition, that limiting the total that can be spent will ease the candidate's understandable obsession with fundraising and so free him and his staff to communicate in more places and ways unconnected with the fundraising function. There is nothing objectionable, indeed, it seems to me, of weighing the interest in favor of the provision in the attempt to insulate the political expression of Federal candidates from the influence inevitably exerted by the endless job of raising increasingly large sums of money. I regret that the Court has returned them all to the treadmill. 
Mr. President, when you talk of that treadmill, you can't ignore the description that was used by the distinguished writer some 15 years ago, Elizabeth Drew, in the New Yorker when she described, if you please, the same situation with respect to that treadmill in her article `Politics and Money.' And I read: 
Until the problem of money is dealt with, it is unrealistic to expect the political process to improve in any other respect. It is not relevant whether every candidate who spends more than his proponent who wins--though in races that are otherwise close, this tends to be the case. What matters is what the chasing of money does to the candidate and to the victor's subsequent behavior. The candidates' desperation for money and the interests' desire to affect public policy provide a mutual opportunity. The issue is not how much is spent on elections but the way the money is obtained. The point is what raising money, not simply spending it, does to the political process. It is not just that the legislative product is bent or stymied. It is not just that well-armed interests have a head start over the rest of the citizenry--or that often it is not even a contest . . . 
It is not even relevant which interest happens to be winning. What is relevant is what the whole thing is doing to the democratic process. What is at stake is the idea of representative Government, the soul of this country. 
That was written in 1982, some 15 years ago. We were worried then about Buckley versus Valeo. That was 6 years after everybody had looked at it and seen the treadmill, exactly as Justice White called it, and the damage to the soul of the country as a result of this treadmill. It was an injury to our democracy, according to Elizabeth Drew. 
There is no question that this has to be dealt with. They might run, as Joe Louis said, but they can't hide. I am not going to let them hide behind this freedom of speech babble. I have it in here word for word. Mr. and Mrs. American people, you are given the authority to vote. You are not controlling it unless you vote yea, allowing Congress to have the power to set reasonable limits on the amount of contributions. 
That is already in place under the Buckley versus Valeo constitutional decision. We have that limit on the freedom of speech which is so remarkable and so fundamental that they inaccurately continue to caterwaul about. Now, we are attempting to limit the amount of expenditures, not freedom of speech. It is limits on the amount of contributions, limits on the amount of expenditures, nothing free. It is contributions and it is expenditures, and it is limits thereof, and it is whether or not the American people shall have the right to vote on it after this 30-year trial. 
Otherwise, as Justice Thurgood Marshall in another one of the distinguished dissenting opinions stated, and I quote:  
It would appear to follow that the candidate with the substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a significant head start. Of course, the wealthy candidate can potentially overcome the disparity in resources through contributions from others, but ability to generate contributions may itself depend upon a showing of a financial base for the campaign or some demonstration of preexisting support, which in turn is facilitated by expenditures of substantial personal sums. Thus, the wealthy candidate's immediate access to a substantial personal fortune may give him an initial advantage that his less wealthy opponent can never overcome. And even if the advantage can be overcome, the perception that personal wealth wins elections may not only discourage potential candidates without significant wealth from entering into the political arena but also undermine public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process. 
There it is, that last phrase--`not only discourage potential candidates without significant personal wealth, but also undermine public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process.' That is exactly what is occurring 
That is the trouble. As Marshall said: 
Large contributions are the less wealthy candidate's only hope of countering the wealthy candidate's immediate access to substantial sums of money. With that option removed, the less wealthy candidate is without the means to match the large initial expenditures of money of which the wealthy candidate is capable. In short, the limitation on contributions puts a premium on a candidate's personal wealth. 
Think about that. This is, as expressed, `a big hunk of the first amendment,' as expressed by my distinguished colleague from Kentucky. We are capable of limitation on contributions. And that is sustained here by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Buckley case. That puts a premium on a candidate's personal wealth because the only way that a less wealthy candidate can catch up is with large expenditures. But the Court, has `limited the freedom of speech for the first time in 200 years.' I will use their expression and see if anybody believes it. This happened in 1976. It happened after many other times the Court has upheld limits, but let us use their expression if that is what everybody wants to believe. The Supreme Court, in Buckley versus Valeo, for the first time in 200 
years, limited a contributor, his expression, and his freedom of speech in politics and therefore has put a premium on the candidate's personal wealth. He is penalized. The speech of the less affluent candidate is taken away because the less affluent candidate can only make it up, if he has no personal wealth, by larger contributions. But the Court, in limiting contributions, limited free speech for the first time in 200 years. 
Maybe that is the way they will understand it. I do not know how to get their attention and get them out from this stonewalling on limiting spending in political campaigns. 
Everywhere we go, they all say, what about campaign finance reform, Senator? I say, `Oh, yeah, I am for reform.' And then one chance we get here this week to vote for it, we decide to put it off until next week. We hope it does not appear on the Sunday programs or anything of that kind so the people will never know we had that chance. And once we have done that, then they will tell Senator Feingold and Senator McCain, `Well, you had your vote; you can see Congress does not want to limit it. We cannot spend a whole year on reform. You have had your chance, and the majority voted against that chance. You did not pass the joint resolution of Hollings-Specter so let's go on to something else.' Thereby, the entire thing is supposed to be swept under the rug. Well, it was almost swept under the rug on Monday. On Monday, they had it greased. They had a majority vote out of that Rules Committee, Mr. President, to just look at the illegal and not look at the improper, and they thought they had a majority vote along party lines. But Senator Thompson of Tennessee won out. He said we had a fit of conscience of at least eight or nine on that side. 
They were going to have egg on their faces. They were going to lose to a Democratic amendment. 
`My gracious, we cannot ever let that happen. We are so bipartisan around here,' they said. My Aunt Ida. Instead they said, `we just cannot have a Democratic amendment prevail in this particular score. So, we will just all join in, then, and vote the 99 votes and adopt it.' They had a fit of conscience. 
Maybe we will get a fit of conscience. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow or next week, but we will keep coming back. We have had it three other times. We will get this the fourth time. We keep picking up steam. 
My difficulty over the years has been in trying to put up an amendment again and again, because they tell me at the desk, that according to parliamentary rules, you cannot amend a simple bill--three readings in the House, three in the Senate, signed by the President--because this is a joint resolution. It is not to be signed by the President, but to go directly to the people for their ratification in the several States. 
So, if I bring it up on any and every bill--which I am prepared to do, because I know the people are demanding it, and we will finally make a breakthrough--I have to wait for a joint resolution. That is why I finally got it up on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, for the simple reason that last year Senator Dole would not let me up. He just would not bring up a joint resolution on anything. When he got his unanimous consent to bring up the balanced budget amendment, I told them that I had an amendment to offer. They said later on, `Oh, that is not relevant and our agreement meant relevant amendments on the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.' 
So I struggled all last year, 1996, and could not even get it up. I am going to look for any joint resolution that quietly comes by, and I will draft my resolution so that it is separate and apart from the other resolution, so that it would not interrupt it, and we, maybe we can get an up or down vote at that particular time again. But I can tell what the strategy is here, now. It is to get an arguable reason to stonewall McCain-Feingold. We can say, `Well, we have had enough debate. We debated it 3 or 4 days, and everything else. Everybody has considered it. They are not going to limit campaign expenditures, so why do McCain-Feingold? If you do this, you are going to limit it. If you do that, we are going to limit it. We have already voted on limits in the Hollings amendment and that is it. Forget about it and let us all go home and say we all tried. We were all for reform.' 
Oh, yes, we are all for limiting it any time it is in a sense of the Senate. It is kind of hard to hide behind that. Maybe that is what I will continue to do, on every bill, get a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I think you have to get 25--we can get 25 Senators to cosponsor that right easily, and keep bringing it up until they get that fit of conscience. 
They do not have it now. They are not interested in the soul of democracy. They are not proud to be in public service. What they are proud to do is outmaneuver; what they are proud to do is avoid and evade; what they are proud to do is finesse, in a clever, parliamentary way. What they are proud of is parliamentary maneuver. So, then they all vote up or down on this. They smile at each other. And they will give that praise to the Senator from South Carolina. They will say, `We know he is sincere, but he is so misdirected, the poor fellow. He has tried hard. We respect him for trying so hard, but, bug off, son. You are not going to pass anything here that has to do with limiting expenditures in Federal elections.' 
That is what we have considered, time and time and time again. And it is not freedom of speech--it is the protection of speech. But if they want to say it is the freedom of speech, then we have drafted it after Buckley versus Valeo, which said that part of the speech is already limited. Let us give a neat little other side. There are two sides to the Buckley coin, as Justice Burger said. Let us take care of the expenditures themselves and not dance 
around the mulberry bush with Patrick Henry and James Madison and anybody else from the time that they believed in slavery. 
That is the forefathers. I think we have come a long way. They did not have to go down the road in the wagon and solicit $14,000 every week. They did have freedom of speech and free elections. 
They did a pretty good job, though. We got a good Constitution, generally. But we have had to amend it because they did believe in slavery and we have outgrown that particular cancer. We are trying this afternoon to outgrow this particular cancer. We can get elections back to the issues and the confidence of the people back in their Congress and their democracy. And we can get participation. But why did less than 50 percent come out to vote? The votes say, `What is the reason? The money controls the whole blooming thing.' 
Look at what is in the headlines, that is all we have had--January, February, down into March. There is another shoe that falls every day. They begin to think this political contribution character is a centipede. I have never seen so many shoes falling. 
We go from Indonesia to China to all these different countries to everything else of that kind. It would be helpful to me if they all would say: `Look, we tried to compete. We stretched every law. We intentionally stretched every law. We asked Philadelphia lawyers, `Can you do it?' And when the Philadelphia lawyers said, `You can do it,' then we said, `We have to do it, because that Republican crowd is going to outraise us anyway you look at it.' And they did. They raised over $150 million more than the Democrats were able to raise. 
So, why don't they admit to what exactly occurred and then let us pass this amendment and give the people an opportunity to vote on what they have been asking for 30 years now. I went down the litany of failed reforms, Senator, from 1966 right on. 
But when we get the distinguished former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and now ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, to come to the floor, the Senator from South Carolina knows when to hush. I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Would the distinguished Senator yield? I know others want to be recognized, so before you yield the floor, let me take this opportunity to thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada. He has really given a very, very cogent analysis of the dilemma that we face, the real-life experience, now, that we have all engaged in, and what we are trying, in the best of our ability, to reform, and reform ourselves, as you so sincerely pointed out. 
So I cannot thank you enough for your presentation and joining with us. I have been delighted to work, over the many years that we have been here, together. This is one more time. I, again, admire the Senator from Nevada. He has sincerity and bipartisanship. I have seen him work with the other side of the aisle so often. So he is looking at getting something done and making headway rather than headlines. It is with that knowledge, listening again this afternoon to your sincerity of purpose, that I truly thank you for your support and your cosponsorship.

Mr. HOLLINGS. If the Senator will yield, I came in at the very beginning. I could not repeat it better than what the distinguished Senator from Nevada said when he congratulated the Senator from Pennsylvania not just on the guts to be able to cosponsor this, because he takes it from his side--there is no more erudite attorney and legal scholar within this body. I would not miss a word of it.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in a line, what we say is that the Congress is hereby authorized to regulate or control expenditures in Federal elections. 
Let me say that I come now to this particular subject of a constitutional amendment, which we have been on for over 10 years, with some hope, because I noticed on yesterday, Mr. President, we had a fit of conscience. We were about to pass a resolution that said Congress was only going to look at illegal contributions and not at improper ones, and, finally, in a fit of conscience, the Congress, particularly here in the Senate, decided that was not going to fly. It would appear to be, if we took that course, a coverup whereby we did not want to get into soft money and all of these other extravaganzas, legal as they are, says the Supreme Court, but as improper as can be. 
That is what is causing the headlines and the consternation and the money chase that we read in the headlines and news stories. We had a fit of conscience when we passed the 1974 act. This act came about due to the untoward activity in the 1967 and 1971 Presidential races. In the 1967 race, President Nixon had designated Maurice Stans, later the Secretary of Commerce, to collect the money. 
And I will never forget; he came to the State of South Carolina, and he told our textile friends, `your fair share is $350,000,' almost like the United Fund or Community Chest. Well, I had been their Governor and everything else and had never gotten $350,000 out of the textile industry, and they were all my friends. But the ten of them, at $35,000 apiece, got up the money, and more than that. There were other large contributions, including one of $2 million from Chicago. 
The fact was, after President Nixon took office, Treasury Secretary John Connally went to the President and said, `Mr. President, you have got a lot of good support and you have not even met these individuals much less thanked them. Why not come down to the ranch and we will put on a barbecue and you can meet and thank them.' President Nixon said, `fine business,' and they did. But as they turned into the weekend ranch barbecue on the Connally Ranch in Texas, there was a big Brinks truck. Dick Tuck, the prankster from the Kennedy campaign, had stationed a truck with signs out there. A picture of it was taken. And we in Washington, Republican and Democrat, said, `heavens above, the Government's up for sale.' 
Thereafter, you had the extremes of Watergate, which everyone is familiar with. So, in 1974 we had a fit of conscience. Yes, everybody thought they had advantages with respect to getting the money. They had gotten here on the ground rules as they then appeared, and said `Why change? I can operate as the rules are.' 
But, with that fit of conscience, we came and passed the 1974 act. I want to remind everyone that this was a very deliberate, bipartisan effort at the time. It set spending limits on campaigns, limited candidates' personal spending on their own behalf, limited expenditures by independent persons or groups for or against candidates, set voluntary spending limits as a condition for receiving public funding, set disclosure requirements for campaign spending and receipts, set limits on contributions for individuals and political committees, and created the Federal Election Commission. 
When you hear the debates, some of the new Members will come on the floor talking about what we really need is disclosure. That is what we have, still, under that 1974 act. I am required to record every dollar in and out with both the Secretary of the Senate on the one hand and the secretary of state back in the capital of my State, Columbia, SC, on the other. We have complete disclosure. You cannot take cash. I had always thought it was illegal to take a contribution on Government property. And we thought we had soft money and independent contributions regulated. 
But, in Buckley versus Valeo they stood the original intent of the Congress on its head. It is this original intent of limited expenditures in Federal elections that our constitutional amendment is offered, in a bipartisan fashion, with the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, and myself in the lead, along with the strong support of those I have enumerated. 
Now, back to the fit of conscience. I initiated this particular approach, in frustration, over 10 years ago, after realizing, like a dog chasing its tail, we were not getting anywhere. We had voluntariness prescribed by giving certain amounts of money if you voluntarily limited. There was free TV. You had public financing. You had all the different little tidbits of the different bills that have come around. 
Necessarily, I support them for the simple reason I am looking for votes. I am looking to finally get a concurrent majority of 67 Senators, so I do not want to turn off any of these sponsors, even though I know there are constitutional questions under the Buckley versus Valeo decision. But the real opposition is not the freedom of speech under the first amendment in the Bill of Rights to the Constitution. The real opposition, if you please, is a small group among us Senators who feel like this money is a tremendous advantage and they are not going to give it up. 
I know where the opposition lies. It is in the very thought that we are not spending enough. As was said in the debates here on the floor: `On Kibbles and Bits cat and dog food we spend $4 billion; why don't we spend $4 billion on national elections?' So I hope we can flush those who really believe this to come up and debate this idea on its merits. 
They will come under the cover of the freedom of speech. It is very interesting that what we have under consideration is paid speech, not free speech. Heavens above, we have all the free speech that you can think of. 
I remember for 20 years in politics we had more or less a one-party system in my State. We would go around stump speaking, as we call it, from county to county. In some of the larger counties several speeches were made. Each of the candidates would come and get up on the stump and say what they stood for. The battle was not in the financial arena; the battle was in the political arena. It was not who had the most money but who had the better ideas, the better initiatives, the better vision, the better programs. But they have tried, following the Buckley decision, to equate just exactly that. What you pay for is free. 
It amuses me when they come up here and read the Washington Post editorials. Go down to the Washington Post and say, `Now I 
want some of that free speech. I would like about a quarter page of that free speech, or a half page of that free speech you just editorialized about.' And they will say, `Son, bug off. There is nothing free down here in this newspaper. You are going to have to pay for it, and you are going to have to pay for it under our rules and our regulations and our limits.' The very crowd editorializing about free speech is the very crowd that is demanding their pay--paid speech. So let us not come here with an adulteration of the first amendment. 
As Judge J. S. Wright stated in the Yale Law Journal, `Nothing in the first amendment commits us to the dogma that money is speech.' That was their finding. But, unfortunately, the Supreme Court found that you should have total freedom with respect to spending, speech, and politics. But when it came to the contributions, the court's Buckley decision amended them. They may come now and say the first amendment has never been amended in 200 years. They are very authoritative, but Buckley versus Valeo amended the first amendment. It limited speech of those who contribute. 
What did Chief Justice Burger say about that? I will quote from the Buckley versus Valeo dissent of the Chief Justice.  
The Court's attempt to distinguish the communications inherent in political contributions from speech aspects of political expenditures simply will not wash. 
That was Chief Justice Burger. And, as everybody with common sense knows, here was the original intent. Here were the big ads. Here were the big contributors. Here was all the cash and the corruptive influence of large amounts of money. And after Congress acted in a bipartisan fashion in 1974, here came the United States Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, if you please, and by a 1-vote margin, with this distortion, this more or less amendment of the first amendment. 
Certainly it is an amendment with respect to contributors' speech. If I am a contributor and I want to contribute to the distinguished Presiding Officer, I am limited in my speech, my political expression. I can only give him $1,000 in his primary and $1,000 in his general election. That is the limit in Buckley versus Valeo, amending, if you please, the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
We act as if, Mr. President, there is some sanctimony or sanctified position of the first amendment, and, of course, the Senator would agree in a breath that there should be. We should really approach amending the Constitution of the United States with trepidation. I know some of the arguments are: Wait a minute, the President's got one on victims rights, and others have one on prayer in school. Somebody else has a constitutional amendment about the flag. Someone else has another constitutional amendment. This is an exception, already written in the Constitution and recognized in the Constitution in the 24th amendment, the influence of money on political expression, the influence of money on the freedom of political speech. 
I have to emulate the distinguished leader from West Virginia, the Honorable Senator Robert Byrd, who says he carries his contract up here in his left-hand pocket, and I find that is a pretty good habit. 
Let me read amendment 24, section 1: 
The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President, for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax. 
Section 2. The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. 
So they said, if you are going to put a financial burden on the voter that he can't participate in the freedom of political expression because of a tax, that is unconstitutional, and we have expressed already in that 24th amendment our abhorrence of the financial influence and corruption, so to speak, upon political expression. 
In a sense, it gives us one man, one vote. The poorest of the poor can cancel out the richest of the rich. I can take Bill Gates and say, `Ha-ha, I vote the other way,' and his vote is gone. I can take Steve Forbes and say, `Ah, yeah, you can pay your own $35 million,' or whatever it was, `to get in the race at the last minute and mess up Bob Dole.' I better not get off on too candid a delivery here this afternoon. But, in any event, Steve Forbes cannot only buy a vote, he can buy several States in the primaries. He has proven that. But when it comes down to one vote, I can cancel him. That is the greatness of our democracy, our republic form of Government. 
Here we are coming around and talking totally out of mystery and nonsense about the unlimited freedom of speech, that it has never been amended in 200 years. I want the Senator from Kentucky to come, because we are going to read those amendments. One, obviously, is with respect to public safety. You can't walk into a theater and shout, `Fire.' That is a limit on your freedom of speech and an amendment of the first amendment. 
You have the exemption for national security with respect to disclosing secrets of the Government itself. Senator Moynihan just sent around a book this thick about secrets and classifications and everything else. Perhaps the distinguished Senator is correct, we ought to do away with at least half of them, because when you see that book, you say, `We are overwhelmed now with the so-called classified, the so-called eyes only, the so-called top secret.' 
Although we have the best of the best intelligence systems, we didn't even know about the fall of the wall. It happened, and we all got the news within 24 hours. The intelligence community --and I was on the Intelligence Committee at the time--had nothing to say. We were talking about all the other extraneous things, but nothing about the greatest happening, in a sense, in the last generation of our time. 
So we have the exception, too, for fighting words, where they would provoke retaliation or cause retaliation. We know about that one. 
We know about the exception for obscenity. In fact, the FCC has been given the authority--we had the seven or eight little 
dirty words on a radio station out on the west coast, and that decision, Pacifica, went all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, and we found out that, yes, the Federal Communications Commission, the entity and agency of the executive branch, the administrative body, could determine whether or not it was a violation on the public airwaves of obscene talk and speech, and that is limited. We said it could be limited. We legislated that it could be limited. 
False and deceptive advertising. If you want to come up to just 2 weeks ago, Mr. President, they had the buffer zone--I hate to raise the question of abortion--but by legislation, they put a buffer zone around these abortion clinics, and those who demonstrate and say, `Wait a minute, we have the freedom of speech,' the Supreme Court ruled 2 weeks ago, `No, you don't, not in that buffer zone, keep your mouth shut, stay out of that zone, your freedom of speech is limited.' 
Mr. President, I certainly want to hear from the distinguished Senator from Nevada. He has been a strong supporter and leader in this particular cause, and he has other commitments. So, at the present time, I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator from Nevada made a very valuable contribution to the consideration of this all-important initiative. 
Our democracy has cancer. It has to be excised. As I explained in my opening remarks, and as has been emphasized by the distinguished Senator from Nevada, all of these little things that come about--whether you get the money from the State, whether you get the money from bundling, soft money, hard money, voluntarism, free TV--just go around and everybody has an eye on it. But if you put a limit, as the 1974 act said, of so much per registered voter, then you have stopped, once and for all, that problem, because with disclosure you can see exactly what you have on top of the table. 
I remember in one of the debates we had with the distinguished then-Senator from Louisiana, Senator Russell Long, and we both agreed that if I appeared, by my disclosure, to get a substantial sum of contributors from the textile industry, call me the textile Senator. There it is. I defend it. I frankly brag about it. If he gets the contributions all from the oil industry and is known as the oil Senator, so be it. The distinguished Presiding Officer, the farm Senator, the agriculture Senator, because his leading talent has been in that field over the years. 
But by disclosure you can see it, and by the limit you cut out all of the shenanigans of the soft money, hard money, bundling and all of the roundabout end course taken to get around the law. 
This amendment, Mr. President, is absolutely neutral. My friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, who has been the leader in opposition, can still prevail under the amendment. The amendment says Congress is authorized to limit. It does not say limit; it does not say not to limit. It just gives the authority to Congress to act so that when we do get out here, we can have a majority vote so without going through the legal hurdles and delay and put off that we have been going through now for 30 years. That is why I say a constitutional amendment is our only recourse. 
I got into a debate on this in 1967 when we passed an act. It is now 1997. We have been trying to get our hands around this problem of campaign finance without a constitutional amendment. Having made the good college try now over the many, many years and listened to all the others, and analyzed as they put up McCain-Feingold and the many other fine initiatives, you can look at the Supreme Court, particularly in the Colorado case, not just the Buckley case, and you can say you are wasting your time. The voluntarism we know in politics means temporary. You saw this in the race up in Massachusetts. They voluntarily said they would have a limit. They got down to the wire and that limit went out of the window. 
What we are trying to do is give everybody back their freedom of speech. Namely, that I may not be extinguished by money. When I say that I say that advisedly. I know the mechanics of political campaigns, and when you have an opponent with $100,000 and I have $1 million, all I need do is just lay low. He only has $100,000 and I know that he wants to wait until October when the people finally turn their interest to the general election in November. Say he is only in print, in polls, and what have you, he spent over $25,000 and you cannot get a good poll for less than $26,000 or $27,000, but he only has $50,000 to $75,000 left, and then I let go, come October 10. That is 3 to 4 weeks leading into 
the campaign, and I have yard signs, billboards, newspapers, TV, radio for the farmer in the early morning, I have early morning driving-to-work radio, I have radio for the college students. I know how to tailor make with my million bucks, and I can tell you by November 1, after 3 weeks of that, my opponent's family has said what is the matter? Why are you not answering? Are you not interested anymore? 
I have, through wealth, taken away his speech. I know that, you know that, that is the reality, the political game. That is what we are talking about, making it so that you cannot take away that freedom of speech, so that you can reinstill the meaning of the first amendment. It was adult rated by the five-vote majority against the four minority in Buckley versus Valeo. 
We will see what the Court said and go to some of the expressions, Mr. President. Here is not what politician Hollings said, but what a Supreme Court Chief Justice says, `The Court's result does violence to the intent of Congress.' Can I say that again for all those who are listening? That is exactly the belief of this Senator. I am not saying because I need money or want money or I think I have a financial advantage or whatever it is. 
Incidentally, I can get on to the point of incumbency. We just swore in some 15 new Senators about 6 or 8 weeks ago. All my incumbents, friends I used to sit around with, are just about gone. I know it is less than 10 years average in the House of Representatives, and I think it is exactly that on the Senate side. What did incumbent minority assistant leader Senator Wendell Ford of Kentucky say just the day before yesterday about money? He said, `I neither have the time nor the inclination to collect that $14,000 to $20,000.' He has to get $5 million in Kentucky. I think he mentioned $100,000. But he said `Look, in order to qualify as a candidate, I have to defend my incumbency role, and my incumbency role involves thousands of votes.' I can say to the other side of the aisle, I have been in the game. They are very clever. They know how to put up and force-feed votes on very, very, controversial amendments or subjects. 
How do you explain in this day and age in a 30-second sound bite, a particular vote? You take 5 minutes, and you can go down to WRC, right here in Washington, with all the money they talk about, or freedom of speech as they call it, with the wealth of Bill Gates, and say I want to buy an hour on the eve of the election, the night before the election. They will tell him to bug off, it is not for sale. It is limited. It is paid speech. 
Free speech--I am trying to reinstill a freedom of speech among those who are financially limited so we make certain that our democracy is not imperiled. 
I read again what Chief Justice Burger said. `The Court's result does violence to the intent of Congress.' He is exactly right. I was there in 1974.  
In the comprehensive scheme of campaign finance, the Court's result does violence to the intent of Congress. By dissecting bit by bit and casting off vital parts, the Court fails to recognize the whole of this act is greater than the sum of its parts. Congress intended to regulate all aspects of Federal campaign finances but what remains after today's holding leaves no more than a shadow of what Congress contemplated. 
Now, I cannot say it any better. That is exactly what we had in mind, to limit the spending. And that is exactly what they did not do. 
They limited the contributions on the premise that it gave the appearance of corruption, or was corruption itself, but not the expenditures. Let's see what Byron Raymond White, the Associate Justice said: 
Congress was plainly of the view that these expenditures also have corruptive potential, but the Court strikes down the provision, strangely enough, claiming more insight as to what may improperly influence candidates than is possessed by the majority of Congress that passed this bill and the President who signed it. Those supporting the bill undeniably included many seasoned professionals who have been deeply involved in the elective processes and who have viewed them at close range over many years. It would make little sense to me--and apparently made none to Congress--to limit the amounts an individual may give to a candidate or spend with his approval, but fail to limit the amounts that could be spent on his behalf. 
There, again, I could not say it better. That was Justice Byron White. 
I quote him further: 
The judgment of Congress was that reasonably effective campaigns could be conducted within the limits established by the act and that the communicative efforts of these campaigns would not seriously suffer. In this posture (section 264 of the case) there is no sound basis for invalidating the expenditure limitations so long as a purpose is served or is legitimately and sufficiently substantial, which, in my view, they are. 
We might get into the debate, Mr. President, about the word `reasonable.' That word appears, if you please, because of the suggestion by the commission on the constitutional system. They wanted `reasonable' limits. I think they were right. I am going back to the Court's decision, trying to aim the gun barrel down the constitutionality of the better constitutional thought in these dissenting opinions. 
Expenditure ceilings reinforce the contribution limits and help eradicate the hazard of corruption. 
That is exactly what common sense would indicate. Here is a court finding that expenditures do not contribute at all to any kind of corruption whatsoever and, therefore, spend to the ceilings. We will have a chart here and put it up and show you how, as the Senator from Nevada said, a Senate race used to be. In 1980, it was about $1 million. By 1986, it was $2 million. By 1990, it was $3 million. By 1994, the average one was $4 million. So it keeps going up, up and away. Expenditures in the Presidential race are up around $670 million. It has gone through the roof. 
Now, Mr. President, I will quote further Justice White: 
I have little doubt that, in addition, limiting the total that can be spent will ease the candidate's understandable obsession with fundraising and so free him and his staff to communicate in more places and ways connected with the fundraising function. There is nothing objectionable, and indeed it seems to me a weighty interest in favor of the provision, in the attempt to insulate the political expression of Federal candidates from the influence inevitably exerted by the endless job of raising increasingly large sums of money. I regret that the Court has returned them all to the treadmill. 
Here, this was written 20 years ago. How pathetic. `Treadmill.' When I was first here in the U.S. Senate, from time to time we would rearrange the fundraisers in accordance with the schedule that we had. You would not dare go up to a leader on either side of the aisle and say: Mr. Leader, I hope we can get a window, or whatever it is, because I have a fundraiser. He would look at you and--if nothing else, I guess it was unethical. They ought to refer that to the Ethics Committee. But we have given up on that now. It is like the tail is wagging the dog. It is now turned around, and we schedule the Senate around the fundraising schedules--what 20 years ago Justice White called the treadmill. You are just constantly having a fundraiser to get on 
TV, to have a fundraiser to get on TV, to have a fundraiser to get on TV; all paid speech, not free. I haven't seen anything free yet out of that TV crowd. They will charge you for it one way or the other. 
I will quote Justice Marshall, and then I will yield. I see that my colleague is prepared to comment. Justice Marshall said: 
It would appear to follow that the candidate with a substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a significant head start. Of course, the less wealthy candidate can potentially overcome the disparity and resources through the contributions from others. But ability to generate contributions may itself depend upon a showing of a financial base for the campaign or some demonstration of preexisting support, which in turn is facilitated by expenditures of substantial personal sums. Thus, the wealthy candidate's immediate access to a substantial personal fortune may give him an initial advantage that his less wealthy opponent can never overcome. And even if the advantage can be overcome, the perception that personal wealth wins elections may not only discourage potential candidates without significant personal wealth from entering the political arena, but also undermine public confidence in the integrity of the electoral process. 
And here we continue and oppose, willy-nilly, any effort, really, to excise this cancer. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. 
When you sit up limply and say there is no constituency for this, the constituency is building. There is no question about that. 
It is bipartisan. It is very clever in trying to say that the Hollings resolution is the Hollings-Specter, when it is bipartisan. They will talk with conviction that McCain-Feingold is bipartisan, but not Hollings-Specter. The fact of the matter is, Madam President, that we had a news conference--we have had various ones over the 10-year period--and hardly anyone attended. On yesterday, the room was overflowing, in the context that they realize now that after all the endeavors made to try to reconcile this situation, the only route left for us now to correct this cancer that imperils our democracy is authority for the Congress to act. 
Now, they, in sanctimony, stand and talk about Buckley versus Valeo, and in the same breath, `200 years,' `the first amendment,' `loopholes,' `let's don't have a loophole or gut out the first amendment'-- my opponent is very erudite, a very learned Senator, and he has been working on this particular subject for quite some time, and he has to know that Buckley versus Valeo does exactly that. 
Buckley versus Valeo limited the speech, the first amendment rights, of contributors. Say I make a contribution to the Senator from Utah for only $1,000 in the primary and $1,000 in the general election; my freedom of speech has gutted a hole in the first amendment by Buckley versus Valeo, because my freedom of speech to contribute and participate has already been limited by Congress, of all people, and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. I gave example after example of the safety measures with respect to not being able to shout `fire' in a theater. I went to the national security. I went to the obscenity provisions. I wish I had the time and disposition here this afternoon to put in Laurence Tribe's restatement of the freedom of speech, and you would have a powerful grasp of what is in order and what is not in order. You can bet your boots that this has been building. 
In 1993, we had a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, and a majority of the U.S. Senate said that they should have a constitutional amendment, such as is here now introduced. The Senator comes and limply says, `I have Common Cause, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the ACLU, and the Senator from South Carolina has no constituency.' We have the constituency. We know about the newspapers. They don't want to recognize the fact that we are talking about `paid' speech in this constitutional amendment--expenditures--not `free" speech. `Limit the amount of contributions that may be accepted by and the amount of expenditures that may be made by'--expenditures for speech, paid speech, not free speech.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Chair for his friendship, even though we don't agree on a particular point, and particularly my friend from Nebraska. There is no question that if he and I could handle this particular problem--like he says, we would have to amend our ways and he and I can amend our ways immediately--we wouldn't have the problem that confronts us. 
The Senator from Nebraska did have a comment that was encouraging to me. He said let's not be swayed by the emotion of the moment. I think that is the only way we are going to get something done, is get an emotion of the moment, a fit of conscience, like you saw on the floor of the U.S. Senate yesterday afternoon. We had the emotion of the moment when we realized that it was a total fraud and farce to just investigate illegal activities. The Justice Department is there and fully aware and fully performing the investigation of illegal activities. Ours in the legislative branch is to investigate the improper activities and see what laws we can do to rectify that situation, particularly soft money. 
Some who have been on the floor today are the leading opponents of soft money, and that brings me right to the opening statement of the distinguished occupant of the Chair. He said the constitutional amendment is not the way to begin the debate on campaign finance reform. I agree. That is not the way to begin the debate on campaign finance reform. But the distinguished Senator should understand that we began this debate in 1966. The Congress adopted public financing for Presidential elections. 
Then, in 1967, we repealed the public financing for Presidential elections. 
In 1971, we had the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act, and by 1974, we passed, which is the major act of today, the amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act. 
In 1976, again we had the amendment of the Federal Election Campaign Act. 
In 1985, we had the Boren-Goldwater amendment that changed the contribution limits and eliminated the PAC bundling. But, Mr. President, that was tabled back at that particular time. 
In 1986, we had the Boren-Goldwater amendment adopted. 
In 1988, we had nine votes on the motion to instruct the Sergeant at Arms to request attendance while trying to get a vote on S. 2. In fact, I think it was at that time we even had to arrest Senators. We are not just beginning the debate on campaign 
finance reform. We had to arrest Senators and everybody else to try to get a vote. But in 1988, we had a Hollings constitutional amendment to limit campaign expenditures. We had to finally file cloture, and that failed by a vote of 53 to 37. 
In 1989, we had S. 139, comprehensive reform, which passed the Senate but never made it out of the conference. 
In 1991, we had S. 3. We did pass comprehensive reform of campaign financing, and President Bush vetoed it. 
In 1993, we had the Hollings sense of the Senate that Congress should adopt a constitutional amendment limiting campaign expenditures. 
In 1993, we had a majority of the Senate vote for it--not the Washington Post, not the New York Times, not the Common Cause crowd or the ACLU group, but the U.S. Senators, the representatives of the people who have been in the game and know it best. The majority said that we ought to have a constitutional amendment limiting campaign expenditures. 
In 1993, we had S. 3, comprehensive reform, pass the Senate, but it never made it out of the conference. 
I say to our distinguished Presiding Officer, in 1995, again, we had the Hollings constitutional amendment to limit campaign expenditures offered to the balanced budget amendment, but that was tabled by a majority of the Senate on a vote of 52 to 45, and they had a real chance to do it. 
Then, in 1995, we passed the sense-of-the-Senate amendment to address campaign finance reform during the 104th Congress, sort of urging us along. We finally are going to get to it. And, in 1996, cloture on the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform failed by a vote of 54 to 46. 
Mr. President, you are right, a constitutional amendment is not the way to start, but after 30 years of everything that we could get out of Common Cause and the Washington Post and all of those disparate groups like the ACLU, it is time, I hope, that, as the Senator said, that we get swayed by the emotion of the moment, that we get a sort of fit of conscience so that we can really act here and realize that if we don't, we really are in the hands of the Philistines with this Supreme Court. 
Read this one. Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee versus the Federal Election Commission:  
Before the Colorado Republican Party selected its 1986 senatorial candidate, its Federal Campaign Committee (Colorado Party), the petitioner here, bought radio advertisements attacking the Democratic Party's likely candidate. 
That is not the candidate that is likely. They are ahead of the curve. 
The Federal Election Commission brought suit charging that the Colorado party had violated the party expenditure provision of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 which imposes dollar limits upon political party expenditures in connection with the general election campaign of a congressional candidate. 
The Colorado party defended, in part, by claiming that the expenditure limitations violated the first amendment as applied to its advertisements, and filed a counterclaim seeking to raise a facial challenge to the Provision as a whole. 
The district court interpreted the `in connection with' language narrowly and held that the Provision did not cover the expenditure at issue. It therefore entered summary judgment for the Colorado party, dismissing the counterclaim as moot. 
In ordering judgement for the FEC, the Court of Appeals adopted a somewhat broader interpretation of the Provision which it said both covered this expenditure and satisfied the Constitution. 
So the judgment was vacated and the case was remanded. But Judge Breyer, joined by Justices O'Connor and Souter, concluded that the first amendment prohibits the application of the party expenditure provision, not the kind of expenditure at issue here, an expenditure that the political party has made independently without coordination of any candidate. 
That has thrown open the door. That is the soft money. That is the headlines. That is the debate. That is the grinding the Government to a halt. They talk about closing down the Government in Washington. Well, we very actively closed it down with that Colorado decision, because you can see the headlines. `The Poor Party Had to Rent the Lincoln Bedroom to Get Money.' Anything they could do to get money, for Heaven's sake. 
If you can believe the distinguished Senator from Texas coming on the floor, and if you are convinced that the Republicans are the small givers and the Democrats are the big givers, that the Republican Party is the party of the poor and the Democratic Party is the party of the rich, you will believe that the world is flat. This is just flat nonsense. 
I mean, come on. They come in here with all this erudition and quote something about a gentleman over on the House side stating that there are two important values: The freedom of speech and our desire for a healthy campaign and a healthy democracy. And you cannot have both. And the free speech must die in order to have a healthy democracy. Nobody believes that, including the gentleman on the House side. I can tell you that here and now. 
The Senator from Texas says, `Do you believe in free speech or not? That is the question.' We all believe in free speech. And we go about this with trepidation. Only after 30 years and all the initiatives and arresting the Members and cloture votes after cloture votes, and, yes, coming back to the people in a sense of that is what we need do, that is what we need do. And then when we start to do it, we come on the floor of the U.S. Senate and talk about Patrick Henry and freedom of speech and everything else. 
This has to do with whether or not you believe in limits on campaign spending. Every one of you believes in limits of the free speech of political contributions. That is the Buckley versus Valeo decision. None of these speakers coming up here opposing this particular initiative have come forward and said, `Oh, wait a minute. Let's take the limits off on contributions.' They would not have the unmitigated gall to say that because they know that the evil here is too much money. 
If you are going to take the limits off on the contributions and everything else, we are gone as a republic, you are not going to decide anything in the marketplace of ideas. It is all going to be in the financial marketplace. The very idea that we had, the intent of the national Congress, in 1974 was that you cannot buy the office. Under the Buckley versus Valeo decision, now coupled with this Colorado soft money nonsense, you must buy the office. 
What did the Senator from Kentucky say, as to withdrawing from running again, on the day before yesterday? That he resented the 
idea of having to get up all that kind of money. What did the Senator from Ohio say? The same thing. We who have been in it and everything else--I resent it, you resent it. 
It is time now that we act. And do not give us this Patrick Henry. The Senator from Utah was quoting Patrick Henry. And the Senator from Texas followed him, and he said about free speech, `You bet your boots, Patrick Henry had free speech in the campaign.' There was not any radio to buy. There was not any TV to buy. There was not any political consultant to buy. There was not any money to get out the vote to buy. 
You can go on down the list of all the things. That is when the Constitution had free speech. But as J. Skelly Wright stated--and I want to get that right--J. Skelly Wright, the eminent jurist, he said here, Judge Wright in the Yale Law Journal--and I quote: 
`Nothing in the first amendment commits us to the dogma that speech is money.' 
We are not talking about what is free. We are talking about what is expensive, what is paid for. They know it. You know it. I know it. You have all the free speech you want. 
When they talk about the newspapers, you can take the present law. They raise these straw men again and again and again. The Senator from Utah, he got up and said that the Congress could come back and put such low limits on candidates that only the incumbents would prevail, that we incumbents would come in here and Congress might decide not to let anyone oppose them by putting just a limit of $100. Now where have you heard such a thing? 
None of this is in the Senator from South Carolina's constitutional amendment. The Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from Pennsylvania--it is bipartisan. I could go on down the list of none of that nonsense of the straw men that could happen. I am going to give one example and then yield to my distinguished colleague. 
I know what can happen under the present law because I had it happen to me. The Senator from Texas ran that campaign against me in 1992. And we will get to some issues there in a minute. Since he acknowledged he had that experience, I want to tell you about his experience and what he charged falsely. 
But getting right to the point, right before we were going to vote, the week before the election day--they are very clever. They had, first, the Wall Street Journal come out with three articles. The Wall Street Journal has never mentioned me before or since. They could care less about Hollings from South Carolina. But they had three spitball articles in there about the right to work and how I was against business. 
They even had coordinated it with the London Economist with `Quits for Fritz.' Robert Novak, he came on Saturday night in `Capitol Gang.' And he said it is also, `Quits for Fritz,' `The white-headed Senator from South Carolina will bite the dust.' Well, I am here. 
But if you want to use their logic, I would sue Dow Jones. I would sue the Wall Street Journal, that they own, for coming in and making a contribution to my opponent under the present law. Now everybody knows that is out of the question. The press is going to have freedom of the press, and we all defend it. 
But under the silly roundabout analysis they give in erecting these straw men on the floor--and I think even the distinguished Senator from Wyoming said that while they did not think newspapers were covered, newspapers could write, but you would not have the money to rebut it. 
You see the dilemma of the Senator from South Carolina. That is exactly the way it was. I did not have the money to rebut it. I had to let it go the last weekend, going right into that election. There was not any way to buy time to rebut it. There was not any way to answer it at all. 
We have that under the present law. But if you limit, as we intended back in 1974, spending as well as expenditures, then all this bundling, soft money and everything else, comes under control because you have to disclose, you have a limited amount. We will still exercise free speech, get out and hustle, like I used to do in the early days of my political career. 
I ran for the legislature on $100. I went all over the county and I shook hands and saw everybody. I lucked out. I was elected. I was almost elected by free speech. So I enjoy free speech. When it is so expensive that all you can to is collect money to get on TV to collect money to get on TV to collect money to get on TV, all as expressed by Justice Byron White in the dissenting opinion of Buckley versus Valeo, `put the Congress back on a treadmill.' That is his expression, and so aptly expressed. You can see exactly what we have. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague. I appreciate his leadership on this floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I understand that we are about to close debate for this afternoon. Let me thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, because he put the issue involved in a very calm and succinct fashion. What we have done here was done with tremendous caution. We haven't come and said, `Here is the solution.' We have come and said, `Here is the authority to solve it.' Now, they bring in these red herrings and everything about the freedom of speech. We are not disturbing the freedom of speech at all. We would not disturb the freedom of speech, except for Buckley versus Valeo, which did put a hole in that first amendment, as they use that expression. 
They say we are limiting the freedom of speech for the political contributor. He can only give so much. If that is what it is, if money is the expression, then that group is limited. But the real evil in causing our dilemma here over the past 30 years, particularly with this Colorado decision now that puts a premium on buying the office by the national parties, if we don't act now to at least have the authority, we don't say in this amendment that the distinguished Senator from Kentucky is right. We don't say that the distinguished Senator from Kentucky is wrong. He may later on, with the authority, prevail. They might increase spending. Like I say, we are not spending more on yogurt and Crackerjacks, and whatever else they had around here. I have forgotten the things they brought up. I would not have dared to stand up as a candidate and say I spent $86,000 for food. I could not hope to get elected in South Carolina buying $86,000 worth of lunches. That, perhaps, points to the dilemma. 
The public that I represent and have worked with over the years really is asking and begging. That is why they included the States. 
Mr. President, we know that, as in warfare, he who controls the air controls the battlefield. In politics, he who controls the airwaves controls the campaign. That is where all the money is. That is what we are trying to limit. But I do not say that by voting for this that you limit. I only say that by voting for this you give constitutional authority because you see the extremes of the Supreme Court--it is the `Extreme Court of the United States'--when they come with the Buckley versus Valeo distortion. It is the `Extreme Court of the United States' that comes with Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee against the Federal Election Commission. 
So, right to the point, we are saying that we can amend this Constitution, that the last five of six amendments dealt with elections, that certainly the weight of money as qualifying a vote was constitutionally outlawed in the 24th amendment. We ought to outlaw extreme and expensive expenditures in this. That would be the 28th amendment, I think. They approved these particular amendments in 18.1 months, which was the average. We know we can get this approved next year in 1998, and we will be on the road to really getting campaign finance reform. 
This is the acid test. Do you believe in limiting, or do you not believe in limiting? We are talking about expenditure of paid speech--not free speech. It does not affect free speech whatever. You don't affect it under the Constitution. We wouldn't dare try to affect it under the Constitution. And, of course, after the 30 years and all of the debates in three Congresses having given us a majority here in the U.S. Senate saying we believe in a constitutional amendment and let's see if we can at least get that majority, they are really coming now and are so opposed to McCain-Feingold and are so opposed to any campaign finance reform as to vote this down. Then we will know exactly where they stand. 
I thank my distinguished colleague from Kentucky. I appreciate the debate this afternoon. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from California. She has, as usual, done her homework and, her persuasive arguments at last Thursday's caucus where she debated General McCaffrey changed my mind. 
I had hesitated endorsing her initiative. They taught us in the Army years ago, no matter how well the gunners aimed, if the recoil is going to kill the gun crew, you do not fire it. 
I had to question myself on the recoil here, from this particular initiative. What good was it going to do? Would it do more harm than good? It was easily determined, after listening to Senator Feinstein, that it was definitely going to do more good because, in line with the limited time, you find exactly what I have learned through hard experience, in the most recent issue of the London Economist, on page 43: 
The Americans' uncritical support of Mexico may have helped to spread drug corruption in that country over the past decade. 
I will never forget, a good 15 years ago or so, when Senator Howard Baker, Senator Paul Laxalt, Senator Simpson from Wyoming, and myself, we were down in Mexico. We had a briefing at that time by President de la Madrid. At that time everything was just peaches and cream. We were getting along fine. We were moving forward on then the drug program and enforcement. I had gone downstairs and forgotten my jacket, raced back up to get it, and President de la Madrid at the time was briefing the Mexican press. My consulate there was interpreting for me. He was giving us unshirted dickens. He said, `We told those gringos from the north that we weren't going to stand for this, we weren't going to do this,' that was a report of a totally different meeting than which we had. 
My point is they have constantly used the United States against their particular opposition, time and again, in order to maintain office. In that light, I want to say again what I said at the hearing with Secretary Madeleine Albright at the subcommittee for State, Justice, Commerce on last Thursday afternoon, whereby I was counseling Secretary Albright, immediately after her statement about Mexico and the great progress we were making in the drug effort. I said I didn't want to sound as an upstart, I certainly did not want to sound impudent in any way, but what I had just heard from the Secretary was State Department boilerplate. 
Why did I say it was State Department boilerplate? I read, back in the record, the statement made by Warren Christopher 4 years ago. It was almost word for word just exactly what Secretary Albright was saying. You can go back to Secretary of State Baker's statement and I will show you it is almost the same thing. From hard experience, I have learned that Senator Feinstein is on target and doing this Nation a wonderful service. As she points out this influx of drugs is a cancer that is spreading into small towns and communities all over the Nation. It is going to take some harsh action of some kind. We have to break this notion that we are neighbors and can't speak freely about our problems. The situation in Mexico is spinning out of control. The head of the drug effort down there in Mexico, turns out to be an associate of the drug cartels. Yet we had him here for 12 days of meetings. 
The problem in Mexico was highlighted in the Dallas Morning News: 
`The intelligence on corruption, especially of drug traffickers, has always been there,' said Phil Jordan, who headed DEA's Dallas office from 1984 to 1994, `but we were under instructions not to say anything negative about Mexico. It was a no-no, since NAFTA was a hot political football.' 
Well, there you are. What we are doing is following a policy to protect our financial interests; our Wall Street, or our economic interests, which of course has not worked out. But that is the motivation. That is the influence, and not really getting to the drugs and the gangs and the corruption and the law enforcement and crime problem that we have in this country. 
So, where I indicated I would withhold because I thought it would cause too much damage and I didn't have enough to work with, I went to General McCaffrey's statement. This was in an open session not--a secure briefing. When asked, `If this 
decertification initiative passed here and Mexico was decertified, what would happen,' he said--I almost quote it word for word--`we would not be able to work with our friends on drugs.' 
The conclusion of this Senator is we have the wrong friends. We have the wrong friends. We have been going through, as Bob Dole says: Same act, same scene, been there, done that, again and again and again. Until we take up something like the Feinstein initiative, here, we are not going to get any results. 
Immediately, there is the overreaction. The Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, was at the hearing. He said, `Oh, I differ with Senator Hollings absolutely. We don't want to overthrow President Zedillo.' 
I don't want to overthrow President Zedillo. I know from the politics of Mexico that is the best chance that he stays on, if the United States jumps him; then he is secure in office politically. That is not the intent. I think the man is honest. I think he is working hard at it. But I think it is too great a problem for him. And I think there are going to have to be some changes down there. I don't see how a decertification initiative of this kind, with the evidence at hand, should upset or overthrow. 
I was called by the Albuquerque paper over the weekend, that I suggested we overthrow Zedillo. That is how things can get that far out of hand. That is nonsense. If he is that weak that a decertification initiative here, with the facts at hand, would cause him to lose office, then he is very weak and I think maybe that is the problem. 
I think it would be a problem for me, you, or anyone else down there. This thing has grown bigger than us all and it is going to take this kind of approach to bring ourselves to any kind of results and stop this. Because it has been going on year in and year out and we have given way to our economic interests in order to continue. As the London Economist says, `The American's uncritical support of Mexico may have helped to spread drug corruption in that country over the past decade.' 
I agree with that statement. That is an editorial, lost in a news column. We ought to take heed and I am delighted, at this time, to join in, and I thank Senator Feinstein for enlisting me as a cosponsor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the esteemed journalist David Broder profiled Mayor Joe Riley of Charleston, SC, in Sunday's Washington Post. Joe Riley has done more for Charleston and the State of South Carolina than anyone could have dreamed. He is truly one of the brightest lights in the American political scene. I strongly encourage everyone to read Mr. Broder's article and I respectfully request that it be printed in the Record.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my fellow Charlestonian and good friend, Samuel Irwin `Sonny' Goldberg. Sonny was one of a kind, a true gentleman who was loved by all. As many others have said, if there was ever an ambassador for Charleston's King Street, it was Sonny. An esteemed businessman, he had friends in stations both high and low all over town. The origin of his name lay in his father's penchant for singing Al Jolson's `Sonny Boy.' Sonny inherited his father's gift of song and everyone in the lowcountry is richer for it. Sonny sang all the old greats: `Marialana.' `Embraceable You,' `Honeysuckle Rose,' `I've Got You Under My Skin' and a number of others. He was the King Street Singer. 
Sonny's singing did not outshine his talent for business and friendship. To know him was to love him. As his good friend, Douglas Donehue, said in his eulogy, `Sonny had within him a spark of genius that won the hearts of people from all walks of life.' He loved to read; he was a student of the world and an avid observer of mankind. Sonny was a man of his word, a man of his faith, strictly observing the Sabbath every Saturday, and a man of family. His wife Shirley, and his children will greatly miss him.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the amendment that has just been read is so simple, so fundamental. I am hearkening to our new Members of the U.S. Senate, just in January, a few weeks ago, `I hereby pledge to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.' 
This is constitutional language, that no international agreement that would, in effect, amend or repeal statutory law can be implemented until approved by the Congress. Under the Constitution, article 1, section 8, it is the duty of the Congress to regulate foreign commerce--not the executive branch; not the executive branch. 
Obviously, to really change the law you would have to have three readings in the House and three readings in the Senate and signed by the President. The fact that this amendment, which I tried to make as clearcut and as principled as it possibly could be, where there would be no confusion, has been so vigorously opposed by the White House and certain ones in Congress that there is no doubt in my mind that with respect to foreign trade, with respect to global competition, we are in the hands of the Philistines, we are in the hands of the multinationals. Rather than the Congress controlling the multinationals and international trade, the multinationals, by this initiative, are controlling the Congress. 
What is the initiative? Well, they could not find any language to amend my amendment. They could not find anybody to really object to it. What they did do, then, was to say, well, we will get some letters written--incidentally, by people who had nothing to do with this particular part of the telecommunications bill--and the comments were that Mr. Archer of the Ways and Means Committee over on the House side then sends a letter on the one hand, saying that he would blue slip this particular appointment of Barshefsky in that the Hollings amendment would involve revenues. 
You know that is not going to happen. I think they made some bad mistakes over on that side. I think they have sort of redeemed themselves from the contract. They certainly have redeemed themselves from three budgets. In 1995, they said the President was inconsequential and that they had three budgets, and whether you agreed or not, that is what they were going to do. Now they say, Mr. President, `Please give us a second budget.' They do not even give one, much less three. But I do not think they would revert back to nonsensical conduct and try to act like an appointment to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate wherein it had a rider that the law be obeyed, 
the Constitution be supported and defended. `Protect and defend' is the oath we take, and that involves revenues. But be that as it may, Mr. President, that is exactly what they have done. And more recently, they have come by--and I have been vitally interested--and one of the ambassadors in the United States Trade Representative's office was to be appointed ambassador in charge of trade there at Geneva--we have written letters and made calls to the White House--Ms. Rita Hayes. Now we have calls in, indirectly, that that can't be had or done. I think it was about to be approved--`unless Hollings gives up his amendment.' 
So they have tried every shenanigan in the world, which tells me--and should tell this Congress--that the executive branch is going to make its agreements, come hell or high water, and they could care less. Not a treaty, but just executive agreements. The media and everybody is supposed to go along and say, well, I think the Senator is right, but we have to go ahead with this appointment. They are changing the law. They admire the three readings in the House and the three readings in the House with respect to Ms. Barshefsky. She does not previously qualify having registered British Steel and foreign competitors. They passed that waiver out, and it no doubt will be adopted here in the U.S. Senate, but to just say `provided further, that if she enters into an agreement that would amend or change statutory law, that before it be implemented, it first must be approved by Congress.' Just as simple as that. 
So let's get right to the `meat of the coconut,' as they say, because this has been going on for 2 years. This isn't any last minute--one of the letters from one Senator said this is a last-minute attempt. Oh, no, this isn't last minute. We had hearings on foreign ownership of telecommunications. We have had testimony of the different entities. Mr. Reed Hunt, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, who was at one time conspiring for this particular approach--I don't know where he is now, but I am checking him. I quote Mr. Hunt:  
I am concerned about the prospects of foreign monopolies being able to buy into our markets while they are still monopolizing their home markets. And as global media developments occur, as the Congressmen mentioned earlier, we must be attentive to the fact that if a foreign company is a monopolist in its own country, it has a prospect of using that monopoly to leverage unfair competition into this country. I am concerned about that. 
That is in May 1995, almost 2 years ago. 
Mr. President, we also have the statement of the FBI and the DEA, who wrote, also, in May 1995: 
Even with the foreign corporation as privately held, we believe that a foreign-based company could be susceptible to the influence and directives of its own government. There are numerous examples of foreign companies being used and directed by their governments to carry out, or assist in carrying out, government intelligence efforts against the United States Government and all major corporations. 
That is a letter to the Honorable John D. Dingell, on May 24 1995, by the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Judge Louis J. Freeh, and the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Thomas A. Constantine. 
Mr. President, the law that we are talking about, and the two sections--section 310(a) of the statutory law of communications--`The station license required under this act shall not be granted to or held by any foreign government or the representative thereof.' Section 310(b) limits any owning or controlling interest to 25 percent. 
Now, I understand somebody is going to say the special trade representative never testified. We had numerous meetings. You have to know how the executive branch works. We haven't had any hearings from them once they got the agreement here in February, just last month--any hearings on the agreement, or anything else of that kind. They just gave away 100 percent in violation of 310(a). They didn't just do the 25 percent in 310(b). They go in, 
as naive as get out, I can tell you that. I want to build a bridge back to the old-fashioned Yankee trader. Come in and say, look, we have the largest and the richest market; what can you come up with? Let's see what you propose and we will work with it. Instead, like goody-goody two shoes, this touchy-feely crowd that we have up here in Washington says, `We will give you 100 percent and let's see what you come up with.' Nippon Telephone & Telegraph says, `Thank you for the 100 percent, bug off, you get nothing from us.' And you go down the list. No country gave us any kind of 50-percent ownership. Our best of allies and friends in international trade, Canada and Mexico, in NAFTA, said, `No, you can't get a 50-percent.' Under 50 percent. So you can see what a spurious approach they used, in violation of the law.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I will just read one line: 
By amending the legislation as we suggest, the Congress would provide effective market opening authority for both multilateral and bilateral negotiations on basic telecommunications services. 
I emphasize the phrase `by amending the legislation as we suggest,' because you got the U.S. Trade Representative Barshefsky, she says, `You don't have to amend it now. I got agreement. Take it and like it or else.' But that isn't what the U.S. Trade Representative said in 1995. We heard about this. So on April 25, we wrote a letter--the distinguished majority leader, Senator Trent Lott, the distinguished Senator from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Daniel K. Inouye, and myself.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we cite thereon the independence and integrity of the Federal Communications Commission. `Congress did not make any changes to the foreign ownership limitations of the Communications Act when it enacted the Telecommunications Act of 1996.' 
What really occurred was, on the Senate side, we said, fine, we will go along on a majority percentage of ownership by a foreign entity if there is reciprocity. If there is an equal opportunity for U.S. companies to own and control, we will let them own and control, under certain circumstances, with, of course, Judge Freeh's and Mr. Constantine's inhibitions, and we had the same concerns. We would study them and go over them very closely. We had reciprocity with the snapback provision. I authored it. We put it in the bill after hearings and said, look, if the country changes its mind or comes under improper control and they kick us out, snap back, kick them out. Fair is fair. We thought that very reasonable to move an agreement on the international telecommunications. But the representatives of the White House, in particular the Special Trade Representative, now called U.S. Trade Representative, started dealing with Mr. Oxley on the House side. 
And we were in the conference. 
So all during 1996 in that particular conference, we worked around and we worked around. Finally, in December, I talked to our friend Mickey Kantor, the Ambassador. I said, `Mickey, we can't get together on this one. There is not going to be any change. Whatever agreement you make will just have to come back. Maybe that is the way. If you want some change in the law, then come on back to Congress.' 
We have debated it already now for 3 years. We would be glad to get together on it. But with all the facets of the upgrading and the revision of the 1934 telecommunications act and considering all the various decisions made over a 60-year period, we couldn't agree. 
So Ambassador Kantor said, fine, that is what they would do. However, in the early part of the year when we came back--again negotiating all during 1996--to the Congress just a couple of months ago, we kept hearing again that we were somehow going to be ignored and that they were making offers over there. 
Mr. President, on February 4, 1997--again Senators Robert Byrd, Byron Dorgan, Daniel Inouye, and Fritz Hollings--the four of us joined in a letter to the White House saying that the USTR should not commit the United States to a trade agreement that limits the scope of the public interest test administered by the FCC, and any changes to current U.S. law should be done only with the approval of the Congress. 
So it was clear in January and February, long before they made the agreement, that we were watching closely as best we could. I met on January 17 with Ambassador Barshefksy. I want it clearly understood that at that particular time we meant exactly what we said. I cautioned her. It was on January 17. I had already met. That is why we sent that February letter. When I met with Ambassador Barshefksy, it was crystal clear to this Senator. I have been up here 30 years. I am the senior junior Senator. And my friend Strom says, `You had better get used to it.' But I dealt with these trade representatives way back into the 1950's, 40 years ago. I have handled clients as a practicing lawyer, when the individual continues to not answer the question and is sort of hugging up to you and says, `I want to work with you, I want to work with you, I want to work with you.' I said to Ambassador Barshefksy, `Madam, I do not want you to work with me. I want you to work with that statute. Don't go over and say you did not know anything about it because we have been in the debate, and you are going to have many Members really turned off on this one, and we will have to take action.' But it was quite apparent to me with that `I want to work with you' stuff that she had no idea of working with us in good faith. Of course, now we know. 
As reported in the Journal of Commerce on February 19, 1997: 
The United States decision to end its statutory restrictions on foreign investment in this sector was crucial to carrying along a global deal in which the rest of the world has made varying levels of commitment to similarly open their markets. 
So, to end the statutory restrictions, we have not extended the statutory restrictions. Nothing has been happening. There has not been three readings in the House nor three in the Senate. We haven't even debated it here this year. But they already have the trade press quoting exactly what the public official of the U.S. Government is saying. Here we are all in the uproar. We have the special committees, the independent prosecutors, `Get them, get them, foreign influence on policy. We can't have anybody give us a contribution and influence policy.' And over here, while we are not looking, a public official of the U.S. Government is giving it away in violation of section 310(a) and 310(b) of the communications act. So, yes, I talked to Members. I said, `I just want to make it crystal clear that either we are going to go to conference'--like our lawyer friend Sullivan, who said, `I am not a potted plant'--`or else we will let the executive pass its own little laws, and we can go on home and forget about trying to work 
up here to set some valid policy.' 
So thereby is the amendment. 
Mr. President, it is interesting. I must report to you that even while Ms. Barshefsky couldn't get it, I read that the Canadian official reported in the Wall Street Journal--and, I quote again, prior to the amendment--`We think that when you look at the overall package, our offer is every bit as good as the American offer.' However, Canada `has serious reservations about the United States proposal because it won't be backed by U.S. legislation.' At least the trade negotiator from Canada got my message. I never have talked to that individual. But I can tell you now, we could not get through. We couldn't get through at all. 
You have to understand along this line, Mr. President, because you are from the hinterlands where people think straight, that you can tell why this crowd up here operates in the beltway and miasma totally of their own dreams. And when we as Senators go home--Oneita Mills, which just a couple of months ago closed down, was just not a complicated operation making T-shirts. But I got there some 35 years ago when I was Governor--and I am proud of it--in a little country town of Andrews, SC, and I got 487 employees, and Washington says, `Don't worry about it. What we need is retraining, retraining, retraining.' The former Secretary of Labor, my friend Bobby Wright, that is all he thinks: Skills, skills, skills, retrain. We have skills coming out of our ears. We manufacture automobiles. They didn't go to Detroit. We never made one. But we have the skills, and we put in there a technical training system. I put it in. In 1961, we broke ground up there in Greenville on a garbage dump. I guess EPA would catch me now. But that is where the school is. And I broke ground for 16 others. We got the skills. 
But back to Oneita, they said, `Retrain, retrain; get another job; we don't have enough skills. You don't understand the problem. We up here in Washington understand the problem.' Nonsense. Assume that they retrain as computer operators; tomorrow morning you have 487 computer operators. The average age at Oneita was 47 years of age. Are you going to hire the 47-year-old computer operator or the 20- or 21-year-old? You are not going to assume the retirement costs and the health costs of the 47-year-old. They are out. 
Yes, I see it when I look at that GE plant that I brought in from Brazil. In the competition they said, if you want to sell those transformers to us, you are going to have to move your plant. So when I brought one to South Carolina, they closed the plant down and GE is gone, moved offshore. 
Malaysia, Baxter Medical. I brought that one in, but we are still giving tax incentives to invest overseas, so they closed down last year and they have gone to Malaysia. Saturday before last, Sara Lee in Hartsville, with 187 jobs, gone to Mexico. 
We lost, in the year 1995, 10,000 textile jobs in South Carolina, and I think an equal amount this past year. I am trying to get the figure. When they talk about educate, educate, educate, educate here at the White House, they better buy a few books and read them themselves. They better get hold of `Looking at the Sun,' by James Fallows, or `Blindside' by Eammon Fingelton or `The Future of Capitalism,' by Les Thurow, or our friend Bill Greider, `One World, Ready or Not,' and, of course, the most recent book by Robert Kuttner `Everything For Sale.' You begin to sober up and understand what the head of Motorola, in Malaysia said as quoted by Mr. Greider that the people of America have no idea in the Lord's world what is happening to them. 
What we are doing is making the exception the rule. And what is the exception? The exception is free trade, free trade, free trade. Adam Smith, market forces, market forces. After World War II, that was a valid contention. We had the dominant auto industry. We wanted to foster capitalism in the emerging Third World. We were looking for freedom and democracy to be spread into Europe and into the Pacific rim. So we taxed ourselves by billions for the Marshall Plan and thereupon coaxed our industries to invest overseas. And invest they have. 
But if you want to see the sheep dog gobbling up the entire flock, you ought to watch these multinationals that we created. The nationals went over. They resisted it at first. They could not speak the language. The air flights were not good. They did not get good food on them or anything else of that kind. But gradually they learned that in manufacturing, 30 percent of volume is in labor cost--payroll. And you can save as much as 20 percent in a typical manufacturing entity by moving to a low-wage country. So it is that an entity, a manufacturing company that has $500 million in sales can keep its sales force, its executive office back here at the home headquarters but move its production, its manufacture to a low-wage country and make itself $100 million, or it can stay here, continue to work its own people and go broke. 
That is what is going on. How do you get that through the news pages so they understand it? 
So the nationals gradually became over the 50-year period since World War II, multinationals, and then the national banks, Chase Manhattan and Citicorp, as of 1973, made a majority of their profit outside the United States. So you have got the multinational corporations and the multinational banks. And thereupon you have them making their money and coming back in with the consultants and the takeover of all the think tanks and everything else. 
I can bring you right up to date. They just established a chair at the Brookings Institute on free trade, and do you know who is financing it? Toyota. Toyota. So Brookings comes and says, this is great about free trade. Oh, sure, those multinationals, they joined up with the foreign countries. The foreign countries want to dump everything. The multinationals want to manufacture and dump everything back here. 
Then, of course, the retailers. The retailers, we proved here in many a debate, do not lower their price. They make a bigger profit. So every time we bring up a reciprocal trade measure or try to get customs agents, which are needed because there is over $5 billion in transshipments in violation of our agreements, whenever we try to get that, the retailers are up here pigeonholing every Senator. 
So you have the multinationals, the multinational banks, the consultants, the campuses, the think tanks, and then read `Agents of Influence,' by Pat Choate, and that was back 7 years ago when Japan, one country, had a $113 million retainer of--I don't know how many law firms or whatever it was around here--representatives. I got up at that time the total salaries of all the House Members, 435, and all the Senators, 100. Of the 535, we were only paying to have represented the people of America some $71 million. Japan was better represented in Washington at $113 million. 
Read the book and you will see how these U.S. Trade Representatives, after putting in time here, went to represent the other side. That is why we have the waiver. Senator Dole said you cannot represent a foreign entity and then come in here and represent us. But, of course, the Finance Committee is in a fix, and there we are. There we are, in the hands of all the lawyers around here. There are 60,000 lawyers registered to practice in the District of Columbia. That is more lawyers than the entire country of Japan. And they come around here and they hate lawyers, they hate lawyers. They are all billable hours. Get yourself charged on an ethics charge and try to find one for less than $400 an hour. They have never been in the courtroom. They never tried a case. They come around here. They ought to all go to work for O.J. Fix that jury. Fix that Congress. That is what we have on us, and you cannot get a word for anybody to represent the reality of this global competition. 
There are two schools--two schools of international trade. One, of course, is Adam Smith, the market forces, fostered by David Ricardo, comparative advantage, comparative advantage. But the other school, Friedrich List, which is almost top secret in this body: The strength and the wealth of a nation is measured not by what it can consume but by what it can produce. And that is the global competition. None of them have gone down the road of Adam Smith. They have all gone down the road of mixed economies, and that is what built the United States of America. That is what built this great economic giant, the U.S.A. 
The earliest day after we had won our own freedom, the Brits corresponded back to our forefathers and they said, now, as a fledgling little colony here, you have gotten your freedom. You trade back with us what you produce best and we in Great Britain will trade back what we produce best--free trade, free trade, free trade. Alexander Hamilton wrote a book that there is one copy of under lock and key over here at the Library of Congress. 
I will not read the booklet. We have had a copy of it in my file. But in the line, Hamilton told the Brits, Bug off. We are not going to remain your colony. We are not going to ship our natural resources, our timber, our coal, our iron, our wheat, our farm stuffs, and you ship back the finished products. We are going to make ourselves economically strong. And the second bill that ever passed this U.S. Congress in its history--the first had to do with the seal of the United States--but on July 4, 1789, the second bill to pass this Congress was a tariff bill of 50 percent on 60 different articles. We started with protectionism, protectionism, protectionism. 
Later, when we were going to build a transcontinental railroad, they told President Lincoln we could get the steel from England. He said, No, we are going to build our own steel mills. And when we are finished, we will not only have the transcontinental railroad, but we will have an industrial steel capacity. 
Again, in the darkest days of the Depression, when people were in food lines, Franklin Roosevelt, with his Economic Recovery Act, put in--what?--put in subsidies for America's agriculture, payments to the farmers that continue today, and protective quotas. And therein is the wonderful success story of America's agriculture. 
So, we say, `Preserve, protect, and defend.' We have the Army to protect us from enemies without, the FBI to protect us from enemies within, we have Social Security to protect us from the ravages of old age, Medicare to protect us from ill-health--we can go right down the functions of Government. When it comes down to a competitive trade policy, we are in the hands of the Philistines, the multinationals. They are pulling our strings. They want fast track. They do not want any debate. They want to just pass the bills and, if you don't do it, we will make the agreement anyway and bag it. Bug off. That is what they are telling us. So we put in our amendment. 
I have had long experience in this field. I testified during the 1950's. I came up here and testified before the old International Trade Commission, and Tom Dewey represented the Japanese. He chased me around the room for a couple of days, and he said, `Governor, what do you expect the Third World emerging countries to make? Let them make the shoes and the clothing, the textiles. And we, in turn, in the United States, we will make the computers and the airplanes.' 
Now, they do not realize it--yes, they are making the shoes: 89 percent of the shoes on the floor of this Congress are imported; two-thirds of the clothing in this Chamber is imported. They are making the shoes and the clothing, the textiles, but they are also making the cameras, the watches, the electronics, the machine tools. You can go right on down the list. And the computers and the airplanes--all of it. 
Wake up, America. The majority of that Boeing 777 is made offshore, a good bit of it in China, the People's Republic of China. There are some of them who want to say Communist China, we are going to get a Communist China airplane to ride around in. That is how far we have come, but they do not want to admit to it. 
So, there we are. What we have is a situation of the typical promises they make. I am prepared to get into those promises, Mr. President, but, perhaps, I see my distinguished colleagues have been very patient with me. I guess they would be glad to be heard at this time, so I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. 
Madam President, it is difficult to really determine the position of our distinguished leadership on the Finance Committee. In one breath, they say it is unnecessary and, in the next breath, they say it is going to really ruin $500 billion in trade. Then they come back and say the statutory law pertains and talk at length about how they have worked over the years with Ambassador-designate Barshefsky. 
In fact, the point was just made by my distinguished colleague from New York, since 1934, they have been working. I have been on the Communications Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee for 30 years, and I watched it develop over that 30-year period. When we had a majority on our side of the aisle, I introduced the formative legislation to revise that 1934 Communications Act with the initiative that would allow the trade representative to negotiate an international telecommunications agreement. 
I am totally familiar, during the past 3 to 4 years, with what they are talking about because this is a Senator who has been working with the White House and with the trade representative, be it Ambassador Kantor or now Ambassador Barshefsky.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, let's just read 310(a): 
The station license required under this Act shall not be granted to or held by any foreign government or the representative thereof. . . 
And in section (b) starting off: 
No broadcast or common carrier license-- 
And I jump down to four: 
. . . any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than one-fourth of the capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens, their representatives, or by a foreign government, or representative thereof, or by any corporation organized under the laws of a foreign country. 
It is just as plain as can be and very simple, totally disregarded by Ms. Barshefsky. We kept telling her, we wrote the White House letters, we admonished, `Wait a minute, your predecessor came before us, testified, asked that it be changed,' and then we see in the letter by these three gentlemen the phrase `as authors of the Senate and House foreign ownership provisions.' False. Mr. Oxley, yes, at the request of the administration. On the House side, it put in there the 100-percent ownership which could be negotiated away. That was never agreed to. 
I authored the reciprocity provision with the snapback condition on the Senate side. So I have to correct the distinguished chairman of my committee and the chairman of our subcommittee, Senators McCain and Burns. As the authors, this is very misleading to the particular body here and the other Senators reading that. And then reading further, `No administration official requested that we legislate in this area.' These gentlemen were not intimate to the negotiations or members of the conference committee that actually did the work. 
Let me refer to, on August 4, 1995, the Congressional Record. Page 8451 is the page. I am quoting Mr. Bliley, the chairman of the Commerce Committee on the House side and the chief negotiator for the House membership. I quote: 
Additionally, we have addressed the issue of foreign ownership or equity interest in domestic telecommunications companies. The new language reflects the hard work of Messrs. Dingell and Oxley, who sponsored the proposal in committee, the administration and myself. I must observe, Mr. Chairman, that the foreign ownership issue is the only matter on which the administration offered specific language to the Commerce Committee. And I believe this administration's concerns have been largely resolved. 
Madam President, there it is. We made the official Record. The administration, after they did not get their desired result on the Senate side, went to work on the House side. And they did request, where they say no request after requesting us. We talked to them back in 1995 several times. We knew exactly what they had in mind. We tried to comply. But we did not change the law. 
Now we have leading Senators, the chairman of our full committee and the chairman of our subcommittee, saying that the administration possesses the authority to give away 100 percent in violation of sections 310(a) and 310(b). That is why it is necessary. To be told now on the Senate floor that the Constitution, that we all take an oath to support and protect--it has a chilling effect that is out of the whole cloth. To come now and say it is vague is out of the whole cloth. You cannot make language any more categorical. I did not say `regulation,' like they tried to read and make for confusion. It is just as plain as can be. 
I have talked with many of the Members, and asked if they wanted it changed in any way. And they said they did not see how you could vote against it. Well, the way they vote against it is to come up and now argue the capabilities of what I was going to hear again. 
Heavens above. When we had Ambassador Carla Hills, who is now gone in representation I guess, we had to put the provision in law. I am glad to see the Senator from Colorado on the floor saying that he did not agree with that waiver. That was the Dole waiver that we are talking about. The Hollings waiver, which is on the appropriations bill, that is in relation to the special trade or U.S. Trade Representative, that you shall not engage in the representing of foreign interests in trade for a 5-year period, which applies of course to our distinguished friend, Mickey Kantor. 
But when we had Carla hills, every one of these negotiators--the Finance Committee leadership comes with again the `Dragon Lady, Dragon Lady,' `Oh, man, tough, tough, tough.' He did say, the Senator from New York, that Ms. Barshefsky was formidable to the point of being dazzling. Well, I will agree. She has been dazzling. And this Senator has not. That is exactly the point I am trying to make. 
I met with Ms. Barshefsky, and she did have a dazzling approach of `I want to work with you. I want to work with you. I want to work with you.' As I have stated earlier, `Madam, I want you to work with the law, not me. Just adhere to this law.' 
We have had this in dispute. We have had this in discussion. We have had this in negotiation with Members and Senate leadership in the Congress, leadership in the White House. And the law is the law. It has not been changed. 
And they go there and can justify further that the distinguished negotiator is so tough she just walked away on the telecommunications negotiations. 
Well, that is not what the Wall Street Journal stated on May 20 of last year. And I quote: 
U.S. negotiators did pull back from a telecom deal at the 11th hour, but not because Clintonites were queasy about inking another market opening pact in an election year. Administration trade officials would have been delighted to trumpet a telecom deal to counter mounting U.S. skepticism about the WTO's accomplishments, but they walked away from the table after industry executives and leading Republican and Democratic Senators balked. 
Madam President, that is exactly what happened on the telecom deal. 
And they mention the capacity deal out there in Singapore. One would say how she worked so hard. Well, she gave away the store, without talking to the capacity manufacturers, specifically she gave away 4,000 jobs in the Carolina's. 
The Japanese make these capacities, but when she did away with the 9.6-percent tariff, you have the weakness of the yen combined with the tariff phased out. The existence of Kaymet in Greenville, SC, I remember that. And I asked the officials there, and they were never contacted. Just at the last minute they agreed to it. Fine, you can get when you give away the store in capacities, when you give away your broadcast entities. 
Under this agreement--I want to make it crystal clear--Nippon Telephone & Telegraph can come in here and buy CBS, ABC, NBC. 
I talked earlier with one Senator. He was talking about the opportunity that Castro seems to do business with the Canadians. He could get the Canadians to come in and buy a station down in Miami and really turn the particular Senator from Florida into an upset condition. He is wanting to get into China and we have to move in a hurry. I have a good eye here today, but the Senator from Florida wants to be able to have any foreign entity come in, Castro or otherwise, Qadhafi, the whole kit and caboodle of the rascals around the world or any foreign country. They delight now in coming in and buying these that we have been trying to protect. 
That is why the Members would not agree. They held fast. I am speaking on behalf of the majority of the U.S. Senate, 95 votes, if you please. We approved that. And that was in discussion up until the last minute, and they would not yield. So there it is. They do so well on these other agreements. 
Let us see, Madam President, how they have done on this particular one. 
If you believe the U.S. Trade Representative, world commerce would come to an end unless we continue to negotiate these one-sided agreements. But the truth of the matter here is Ambassador Barshefsky, in announcing the successful conclusion of this telecom negotiations stated--and I quote: 
This agreement represents a change of profound importance. 
U.S. companies now have access to nearly 100 percent of 20 telecommunications markets. Now, unfortunately, Madam President, nothing has changed. Nothing has changed at all. Once again, the trade representative has obtained inadequate concessions. 
A review of those agreements--not these laudatory press releases--reveals that the market openings are limited, at best, or nonexistent, at worst. 
While the United States has agreed to permit complete foreign ownership of our broadcast properties and U.S. telecommunications providers, our major trading partners have severely restricted our access to their most well-established and entrenched companies. USTR claims that Australia, Italy, Japan, France, New Zealand, and Spain have all agreed to permit ownership or control of all telecommunications providers. Yet, you take a closer look and you see there are severe foreign ownership restrictions still remaining in place for Vodafone and Telstra in Australia, with Stet in Italy, KDD and Nippon Telephone and Telegraph in Japan--you cannot own any of it--Telecom NZ in New Zealand, Telefonica in Spain, France Telecom in France that prevents U.S. providers from owning the controlling interests or no interest at all in these telecommunication giants. 
U.S. companies have access so long as they are not interested in getting into the best and most sophisticated and competitive companies. They could come in and buy AT&T, not just the companies like GTE, or whatever. They can come in and buy the broadcast properties, which is most disturbing to this particular Senator. 
Now, going further, Madam President, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, India, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Canada permit no foreign control for facility-based providers. The fastest growing and most important markets in the world are closed tight as a drum. Take the Korean market. Foreign individual shareholding in Korea Telegram is limited to 3 percent--3 percent. We gave away our most powerful negotiating tools, just for 3 percent. When you give away 100 percent, there is no more negotiations, you are through. Ask Senator Dole--been there, done that. It is over with. You got no more negotiating authority or any negotiating tools. 
Or take Canada. The Canadians provide for no foreign control of facility-based providers--none. Yet, under this agreement, Bell Canada can purchase any United States-based provider it wishes. What a wonderful agreement. What a wonderful agreement they are all bragging about. 
The other developing markets also include severe restrictions. Brazil has liberalized ownership restrictions only with regard to seller, satellite, and nonpublic services. Mexico has retained ownership restrictions on all types of services except seller. Poland retains foreign ownership restrictions for wireless, international, and long distance. So the total liberalization of the U.S. marketplace, what incentive was that liberalization? What incentive do these countries have to liberalize their particular markets any further? None whatever. None whatever. We have given away the store. 
I told you in the very beginning about clothing, and they keep exporting the jobs faster than we can possibly create them --300,000. We were going to create 200,000, but we have exported already, lost 300,000 jobs in textiles alone. And we can go further. 
The FCC recently issued an international notice of proposed rulemaking. This particular rulemaking would force foreign providers to lower their prices. However, many of the enforcement mechanisms contained in this particular rulemaking are violations of the MFN, most favored nation provisions. Different benchmarks based on the gross domestic product, denying access to providers from countries who refuse to meet the benchmarks, and granting waivers to those who restructure more quickly are all integral parts of these benchmark policies, but illegal and likely to be challenged, no doubt in the WTO. 
So the agreement on telecom can have perverse effects on the price system they are trying to tell us about now, telling the competing countries we have a question there with respect to ownership and MCI, and with respect to Sprint, so they stay quiet. 
You do not find them all coming in here. And they are being told, `Hush now, at the FCC we will help you with the access places in these international long-distance calls, and we are going to get something done.' They will never get it done. Watch this MFN provision and watch the World Trade Organization. 
These are the kind of promises that continually come up when we have one of these agreements. Just remember, Madam President, the promises they made with NAFTA. You have to realize, we must learn from experience. As George Santayana said, those who disregard the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them. We should see the history of this wonderful U.S. trade agreement that they had with NAFTA. At that particular time, they said if we fail to pass NAFTA, one, Mexico would face economic collapse; two, immigration would increase; three, drugs would flow freely; four, 200,000 new jobs would not be created; five, the U.S. exports surplus would disappear; six, Asian investors would move into Mexico to take advantage of the growing markets. That is why they said we had to approve NAFTA. 
We have approved NAFTA, and this is exactly what happened--exactly what happened. Mexico is in economic collapse; immigration has increased; the drugs flow freely down there; 200,000 jobs have not been created; the U.S. exports surplus has disappeared. We had a $5 billion surplus. It is now a $16 billion deficit. The Asian investors who were going to be prevented from moving in are moving in like gangbusters and dumping back here under NAFTA free trade arrangements into the United States. 
I could go on further. I see some here who want to talk, but I will complete this thought now, because we had the classic case for free trade with an emerging country, and the Secretary of Treasury, in particular, the Deputy Secretary of Treasury, Lawrence Summers, said, this is really it, we really are getting free trade now. And everybody is going to get, I think they said, about $1700 for everybody, and we were going to have everybody better off. 
Well, Lawrence Summers, he is the one that sold this thing to the House memberships and the Senators. Since that time, he has now appeared on Thursday, January 16, in the Congress, and I quote from the Wall Street Journal of that particular date. `By many measures, most Mexicans are worse off than they were before the financial crisis,' Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers conceded. 
The Members do not have a sense of history, understanding, or appreciation. What happened is that a million Mexicans have lost their jobs since NAFTA has passed. Wages have fallen by a third. Mexico's external debt reached $150 billion, higher than that during the debt crisis back in 1982. The bold visionary man of the year, Carlos Salinas--that is right, in December, after we voted in November, they made him the man of the year. Now he is living in exile in Ireland and you cannot catch him. He is the man of the year. 
This is the kind of nonsense that we have to put up with. If we want to go through the same act, same scene, dragon lady, tough, and everything else, it makes a sorry agreement, sells out the store. And we call that progress, and we have to create jobs, and education, education, 
education is the solution. Well, Madam President, like I say, if they read one thing, they ought to read the book, `One World, Ready Or Not' by Bill Crider. They will get an education on where we are, because the author spent 2 years going around the world, as well as in the United States, talking to the various executives and quoting them at that particular time. You can't understand some of the various provisions. 
I think, since I have the opportunity to present them, we ought to understand, in country after country, the precious rules of international trade. In India, for example, when General Motors wanted to sell its European-made Opal, the price of admission was a radiator cap factory. So GM moved the factory from Britain. In Korea, to sell fast trains, the French agreed to subcontract the assembly to the Koreans. In China, AT&T agreed to manufacture advanced switching equipment as a quid pro quo for wiring Chinese cities. In Australia, if your sales are above a certain threshold, you must negotiate with the Government on an agreement locating research and development in Australia. For production, you must export 50 percent of what you import, and it must have 70 percent local content. At least 33 electronics companies from Japan, Europe, and the United States have agreed to do that. 
According to an official from Motorola, `If you don't cooperate with the Australians, they have the statutory authority to exclude you from bidders' lists and deny regulatory permits for products.' 
Well, Madam President, it's not just out there in the Pacific rim, where the control--Friedrich List kind of control --trade that works, that builds them up. Right this minute, one-half of the world's savings is in the country of Japan. While they are talking about the yen and the devaluation of it and while they are talking about the banking difficulties, watch what Edmund Finkleton said in `Blind Side.' Come the year 2000, while they are a bigger manufacturing country, with 120 million, compared to our 260 million and the vast natural resources that we have in the United States, they already outproduce us. They will have a larger economy and gross domestic product--that little country of Japan. Why? They control it. As Friedrich List says, the wealth and strength of a nation, if you please, is measured not by what they consume, but what they produce. Akio Marita went on further--I was at a forum with him about 16 years ago up in Chicago. We were talking about the Third World emerging nations, and he commented: `The emerging country has to develop a manufacturing capacity in order to become a nation state.' After we talked a few minutes, he pointed to me and said, `Senator, that world power that loses its manufacturing capacity will cease to be a world power.' 
We have gone, in a 10-year period, from 26 percent of our work force in manufacturing down now to 13 percent. We are back to Henry Ford. Henry Ford said that he wanted his workers to be able to purchase the article they were producing. Madam President, today, middle-America workers, not having those manufacturing jobs, can't afford the car. They can't purchase it. We are losing our middle class, all along, if you please, competing with ourselves. 
Over 50 percent of what we are importing, if you please, is U.S. multinationally generated. The U.S. multinationals are the fifth column in this trade war that we are in. They are in behind the lines gutting us here in the Congress, working through the special trade representative, trying to take away the authority under the Constitution to make laws and otherwise regulate foreign commerce. That is the authority of the Congress, and that is the reason we have that particular amendment. But we always talk, and I listened to the distinguished President when he talked about trade. He only mentioned exports. 
I want to challenge anybody to go to a CPA when they do their tax return next month and say, `Let's just talk about what we got in, not what we spent, just one side of the ledger.' If you had a CPA that made up your return that way, you would fire him. But that is constantly, constantly, constantly the way we look at the returns with respect to international trade. 
What really happens is, yes, while we in the United States are the most productive industrial workers, whereas we have improved productivity, and whereas we are, for example, in my State, an exporting State--I was just down at a Presidential Exporting Council meeting in Greenville, SC, and we are proud of it--the imports far and away outdistance the exports. 
In the last 15 years, before we got to last year, there has been an average of over $100 billion a year deficit, imports, in the balance of trade. That means we have bought from the foreigners $1.5 trillion more than we have sold to them. But how do you get that through to the Finance Committee where they just casually go on and on talking about dragon ladies and what a wonderful agreement we have? What, Madam President, is the merchandise deficit--I say `deficit'; I repeat `deficit'--in the balance of trade last year? The merchandise deficit in merchandise trade was $187 billion.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Now, we made some money off of loans, insurance, and services. So the overall deficit was quoted to be $114 billion. But I am looking at that industrial backbone. I am looking at that economic strength. I am looking at that world power trying to continue being a world power. I am realizing more and more every day that the 7th Fleet and the atom bomb don't count anymore. They just don't regard it. You are not going to use a nuclear attack; we all know that. I was bemused when they moved the fleet into the Taiwan Strait, because, in 1966, I was on an aircraft carrier, the Kitty Hawk, up in the Gulf of Tonkin, and we could not stop 20 million North Vietnamese. They didn't have planes and choppers and all this equipment that we had. But we have already tried that aircraft carrier. I wondered how an aircraft carrier or two in the Taiwan Strait was going to stop 1.2 billion Chinese when it could not stop a mere 20 million Vietnamese. Come on. 
Money talks. The economic strength, and in the world trade councils and otherwise in this global trade war that we are in--we are unilaterally disarming. We are giving away capacity. That capacity agreement in Singapore was where they manufacture them in Japan but Japan very cleverly got the Europeans to bring the pressure on us. And we walked away and said it was a good agreement. And I have lost 4,000 jobs in my State. I am losing thousands of jobs with NAFTA. I am looking around. Now I am seeing in telecommunications--what effect is this going to have? I guess in order to keep the Senator from South Carolina quiet they will buy the TV stations and run them because under the agreement they can. There is no question about it. They can own these broadcast properties. 
Down to the basic fundamental involved, just a couple of weeks ago we had Washington's Farewell Address here. The very Founding Father talked about the fundamental of the Hollings amendment. I can almost quote word for word. He said, If, in the opinion of the people, the modification or distribution of the powers under the Constitution be in any particular wrong, then let it be changed in the way that the Constitution designates, for while usurpation in the one instance may be the instrument of good it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. 
That is the line of this particular amendment. We are giving it away. We proceed by a fifth column. We are talking about jobs but we are exporting them faster. We are importing even faster the finished goods. We are weakening the democracy. The middle class is disappearing. And they are all hollering `Whoopee. The economy is good, and let's give some millions so that politicians of one group can investigate politicians of another group about politics.' That is the most asinine thing that you have ever seen. But that is where they give all the time. I can see some impatience. They don't want to listen about international trade, and the trade war. No. They don't want to listen about that. But they want to talk about independent prosecutors and investigators. I would give millions to the Federal Election Campaign Commission. They are bipartisan. Let them investigate, no holds barred. I would give even more millions to the Department of Justice. Let them investigate, no holds barred, for any violation of the law. 
But mind you me. It seems like we have learned enough here from that Whitewater thing. We went through an exercise. We had 44 hearings, millions of dollars wasted, and time and everything, all hoping to get on TV and investigate each other. Now they want to start up this session and talk about bipartisanship, and not talking about what is eroding the democracy itself in this country. I say that because when I talk about the middle class, Chesterton wrote that the strength of this little democracy here in America was that we had developed a strong middle class. 
We are headed, if you please, the way of England. That is what they told the Brits after World War II. `Don't worry. Instead of a nation of brawn, you will be a nation of brains. Instead of producing products, you will provide services; a service economy. Instead of creating wealth, you will handle it and be a financial center.' And England has gone to hell in an economic hand basket. You have the haves and the have-nots, London is no more than an amusement park. You go there, and the Parliament is talking the same kind of extraneous nonsense that we are engaged in, and investigating each other and not getting on with the serious matters of truth in budgeting. Let's have it. I am going to talk to a group here in just a minute, and I hope we can get to them so that we can bring the record out about truth in budgeting. 
And truth in trade negotiations agreements and trade--an agreement has been made, not a treaty. They insist that you don't have to come back to the Congress itself when they amend the law, and they are in 100-percent agreement of foreign ownership. There is no question about that. They just say it is not necessary while other Members say it is necessary. I thought that we ought to clarify once and for all our duties here, and have a clarion call, or a wake-up call, on this most important issue. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

We go home and we see the jobs not only created at the BMW's but we see the jobs that have been lost, and that retraining out of Washington will not suffice. I do appreciate it very much, and I agree with him. He brings it right to the fore, the straw man they have put up. 
They talk fast track, they talk regulations, they talk the differences between broadcast and common carrier under the statute, as there being a distinction, and, of course, the most serious one they bring is the character of the lady herself, which I never would suggest anything otherwise, and is of the finest character as an individual, Ms. Barshefsky.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a most valued staff member of the Senate Budget Committee who will leave the committee this Friday to join Senator Kennedy at the Labor and Human Resources Committee as general counsel and deputy staff director. 
I am speaking of Mr. William G. Dauster, known to every Democratic Senator who ever had a question on the budget, an amendment to the budget resolution, or a budget point of order, simply as, `Bill.' 
You could see Bill Dauster on the Senate floor, late at night, at the side of Budget Committee Chairmen Chiles or Sasser, or Ranking Minority Member Jim Exon. He was the best right hand and the finest counsel these Senators could seek. 
As the longest serving member on the Budget Committee, I have known Bill since he first walked in the door almost 11 years ago after working in private practice as a litigator with the New York City law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. Bill Dauster served on the committee, first as chief counsel from December 1986 to November 1994, and then rose to the position of Democratic staff director and chief counsel. 
I saw Bill grow into one of the most respected and expert voices on the budget. His advice and guidance made him an invaluable resource to all Democratic Senators. I think he taught a few lessons to some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle as well. But they respected him, too. 
Bill Dauster took on more thankless tasks than any reasonable man could ask for, including some of the most arcane issues and twists and turns of budget process imaginable. And he did it with enormous dedication, consummate patience, an abundance of affability, and a large dose of excellent humor. Bill doesn't take himself seriously. He takes the issues seriously. 
Bill Dauster leaves behind him a string of accomplishments of which few can boast, and of which many would envy. He has participated in Congress' reception of 11 Presidential budget submissions and 11 years of budget hearings. 
He had a strong hand in drafting 8 budget resolutions, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990, the 1987 revision of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, at least a few amendments to the balanced budget amendment, and amendments exposing the weaknesses of entitlement caps. 
During that time, Bill also wrote 3 editions of a budget process law book, 3 budget law review articles, numerous speeches, and more than 20 op-ed pieces that have appeared in the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Monthly, Roll Call, the Hill and the Sunday Journal newspapers of suburban Washington, DC. He can be justifiably proud of all of them. Bill's keen wit, nimble mind, and ability to turn a phrase are as evident and legendary as his extensive library and e-mail list. The Budget Committee may have afforded Bill a wealth of opportunities, but this body is the richer for it. 
Bill's resume, however, does not do justice to the enormous contributions he has made, not just to the budget process, but to our fellow citizens as well. He personifies a true servant, not only of this great institution, but of the people we serve. 
Blessed with enormous intellectual skills, Bill has also exhibited great compassion for the less fortunate among us, especially America's children and the disabled. Bill has toiled tirelessly on their behalf. And his source of inspiration has always been his family--his wonderful wife Ellen Weintraub and their three children, Matthew, Natanya, and Emma--to whom Bill is devoted. 
I certainly don't want to make this sound like a eulogy, since Bill will be just down the hallway from the Budget Committee. And I trust Senator Kennedy will still let us call or visit with Bill to benefit from his counsel. So this is not farewell, but merely thank you, Bill, for a challenge well met and a job well done.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues Senators Conrad and Grassley in introducing the Primary Care Health Practitioner Incentive Act of 1997. Today I specifically want to address the provision that would allow for direct Medicare reimbursement for services provided by nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists regardless of geographic location. For many years we have been trying to pass legislation that would allow these health care providers in urban settings the same direct Medicare reimbursement as those in a rural setting, and I am hopeful that this is the year it will actually be enacted. 
Currently, nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists may treat Medicare patients without a physician present if they practice in a rural setting or in a long-term care facility. I believe that it is time for this antiquated restraint to practice to be removed so that health care choices may be improved and increased for all Medicare patients. If we are to have any hope of providing adequate care with huge reductions in both Medicare and Medicaid, it is essential that service be provided by the least costly provider of quality care. We simply cannot afford to ignore the quality care of which nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists have proven they are capable. 
I would also like to point out that many times there is a discrepancy in the designation of rural and urban areas. In my home State of South Carolina, as in other States, a number of the areas listed as urban are, in reality, rural areas. Medicare patients in these areas are unable to receive home visits or utilize local community satellite offices staffed with nurse practitioners. Rather, they are required to travel miles to see a physician. As a result, many patients forgo preventive health care and wait to seek care until they become so ill that they must be hospitalized or they are forced to seek care in more expensive emergency rooms. Not only is access to physicians more limited, but their fees for services are usually higher as well. Recent figures published by the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners estimate a cost savings of greater than $54 million per year if nurse practitioners were utilized appropriately in the provision of Medicare services in ambulatory care settings. 
The primary objective of nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists is to provide routine care, manage chronic conditions, promote preventive health care, and make medical care more accessible and less expensive. Nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists have proven that they are able to provide high-quality, cost-effective primary care in all settings in which they provide services. It is foolish to restrict their ability to provide primary care services to the elderly based on setting or geographic location, and I urge your consideration and the passage of this bill.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 668 which extends the aviation ticket tax through the end of fiscal year 1997. This tax is essential to the day-to-day operation of our Nation's aviation system. Money to improve, maintain, and run our airports is wholly supported by fees paid by the users of the air transportation system. It is not paid for by the taxes we all pay on April 15. Air travelers paid for our airports in the form of a 10 percent ticket tax every time they flew prior to December 31, 1996. That money has been going into the airport and airway trust fund, and the money is then disbursed through the appropriations process. 
We have told people to pay this tax, and we have told them we will then spend it on airports and making improvements to the air transportation system. I know that there is a great need to refurbish our Nation's airports. In South Carolina, I visit small airports and see the condition of the runways. Small airports cannot generate the funds needed without the assistance of the Federal Aviation Administration, which provides the necessary money from the trust fund. 
Our problem now is that the ticket tax expired at the end of 1996. Due to budget games, the money that we thought would be in the trust fund is not there. Originally we were advised that the trust fund would be broke in July, but it will be depleted as early as March. If this situation is not corrected, millions of dollars in airport modernization projects, aviation safety enhancements, and airport security efforts will have to be delayed or terminated. The obvious answer to this untenable situation is to reinstate the aviation ticket tax, and that is why I am supporting H.R. 668. I urge my fellow colleagues to quit playing budget games and start fulfilling one of government's primary functions--preserving the safety of the American people.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to offer legislation that will help parents limit the amount of television violence coming into their homes. As my colleagues know well, Congress has been studying this issue for 40 years and the issues have not changed. Recent press reports continue to validate my concerns that all the talk and promises have yielded nothing but the status quo, and efforts to encourage the industry to police itself continue to yield meager results. 
Enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 marked the second time Congress has passed legislation to encourage the entertainment industry to limit the amount of violence seen on television. The first time was the effort in the late 1980's led by our former colleague from Illinois, Paul Simon. Senator Simon's approach, the Television Program Improvement Act, was designed to grant the industry a 3-year antitrust exemption to work together to adopt voluntary guidelines that would lead to reducing violence depicted in television programs. The result of this industry collaboration was announced in December 1992 with a statement of joint standards regarding the broadcasting of excessive television violence. In June 1993, the networks made a commitment that, before and during the broadcasting of programs that might contain excessive violence, the following announcement would be made: `Due to some violent content, parental discretion is advised.' The Independent Television Association, the trade group representing many of the television stations not affiliated with one of the networks, adopted a similar voluntary code. Subsequent studies detailed, however, that despite these voluntary guidelines, violence continued to rise. 
In 1993, therefore, I introduced my safe harbor bill for the first time. The Commerce Committee held one hearing in the 103d Congress and a second hearing during the 104th. The Commerce Committee reported my bill, S. 470, by a vote of 16 to 1. The hearing record substantiates the constitutionality of my safe harbor approach, with both Attorney General Reno and Federal Communications Commission [FCC] Chairman Hundt on record as testifying that the safe harbor approach is constitutional. My efforts to bring my bill to the floor for a vote were repeatedly blocked. 
The second time, Congress legislated in this area was last year when the so-called V-Chip provision was incorporated into the Telecommunications Act of 1996. I voted for this provision but had my doubts about its effectiveness. Once again, Congress relied on the industry to help parents limit the amount of violence. To make the V-chip work, the 1996 act encouraged the video programming industry to `establish voluntary rules for rating video programming that contains sexual, violent or other indecent material about which parents should be informed before it is displayed to children,' and to broadcast voluntarily signals containing these ratings. 
Pursuant to the 1996 act, all segments of the entertainment industry created the TV ratings implementation group--ratings group, headed by the Motion Picture Association of America [MPAA] president Jack Valenti. The group devised an age-based ratings system--not a content-based system. The proposal has been met with widespread criticism as being too broad and vague for parents. I recommend that my colleagues read this past Saturday's New York Times February 22, 1997, to understand the confusion surrounding this issue. The age-based ratings system does not give parents sufficient information. Parents want the ability and the choice to block out specific content they find unsuitable for their children. 
So, here we are. Congress passes legislation designed to limit the amount of television violence, again relying on the industry to act responsibly. The voluntary ratings system proposed by the industry, called the TV parental guidelines, consists of the following six age-based ratings: 
TV-Y 
All Children. This program is designed to be appropriate for all children. Whether animated or live action, the themes and elements in this program are specifically designed for a very young audience, including children from ages 2 through 6. This program is not expected to frighten younger children. 
TV-Y7 
Directed to older children. This program is designed 
for children age 7 and above. It may be more appropriate for children who have acquired the developmental skills needed to distinguish between make-believe and reality. Themes and elements in this program may include mild physical or comedic violence, and may frighten children under the age of 7. Therefore, parents may wish to consider the suitability of this program for their very young children. 
TV-G 
General Audience. Most parents would find this program suitable for all ages. Although this rating does not signify a program designed specifically for children, most parents may let younger children watch this program unattended. It contains little or no violence, no strong language and little or no sexual dialogue or situations. 
TV-PG 
Parental Guidance Suggested. This program may contain some material that some parents would find unsuitable for younger children. Many parents may want to watch it with their younger children. The theme itself may call for parental guidance. The program may contain infrequent coarse language, limited violence, some suggestive sexual dialogue and situations.  
TV-14 
Parents Strongly Cautioned. This program may contain some material that many parents would find unsuitable for children under 14 years of age. Parents are strongly urged to exercise greater care in monitoring this program and are cautioned against letting children under the age of 14 watch unattended. This program may contain sophisticated themes, sexual content, strong language, and more intense violence. 
TV-M 
Mature Audience Only. This program is specially designed to be viewed by adults and therefore may be unsuitable for children under 17. This program may contain mature themes, profane language, graphic violence, and explicit sexual content. 
I ask my colleagues, how will parents be able to block out a specific violent program based on this system? 
There are several problems with this approach. 
The 1996 Act envisioned that the ratings system, and consequently, the encoded programming, would allow parents to block specific programming content they found objectionable. Under the proposed age-based ratings system, parents are unable to block specific violent programming. The proposed age-based ratings place the entertainment industry in the position of making the judgment about program suitability--not the parent. Moreover, one of the biggest problems with the proposed age-based ratings system is that it intermingles three types of programming content: violence, sexual material, and adult language. Thus it prevents parents from gaining any specific information about whether or not a show actually contains any violent depictions. 
The National PTA, the American Medical Association [AMA], the American Academy of Pediatrics [AAPA], the National Education Association [NEA], Children Now, the American Psychological Association [APA], the Coalition for America's Children, the Children's Defense Fund, the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry [AACAP], the Family Research Council, the Foundation to Improve Television, and the Center for Media Education all have criticized the age-based ratings systems. Instead, they advocate ratings based on specific program content. These groups have criticized the proposed age-based ratings as too vague and broad for parents to decide what is right for their child to watch in their own home. In addition, the groups state that the ratings raise more questions than they answer. 
The AACAP was particularly critical of the ratings system, stating that: 
Programs portraying graphic and realistically appearing violence, sex, horror, adult language, and illegal behavior without social consequences increase the risk of dangerous behaviors and aberrant emotional and intellectual development by children and adolescents. . . . An age-based system, such as the one now being proposed, carries the risk of missing significant developmental variations in young people. 
The V-chip legislation was intended to empower parents with the ability to block out objectionable content-specific programming. The ratings system does not accomplish this objective. To correct this, I have decided to reintroduce my safe harbor legislation with the addition of a new provision. The new version requires confining the distribution of violent programming to hours of the day when children are not likely to comprise a substantial portion of the audience unless the broadcasters adopt a content-specific ratings system that allows parents to block out violent programming. If the industry continues to insist upon the age-based ratings, then my safe harbor would apply for violent programming. It's a very simple proposition. Either the intent of the 1996 law is met and parents can block out objectionable content, or my safe harbor will ensure that violent programming is aired at hours later in the day to protect children from the harmful effects of violent programming.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, this crowd on the other side of the aisle has no shame. Let me make it absolutely 
clear. They come here and use the floor of the Senate for these demonstrations. What that pile of books over there on the other side of the aisle says is any time that you can flash on C-SPAN, that side of the aisle is for cutting spending, reducing deficits, and balancing the budget, and this side of the aisle is for spending--you know, tax and spend, liberal Democrats. 
Let us find out what the record is. I believe it is too much, but let us just say my pile of books is about one-tenth of that pile over there. If you take the average real deficit--and I put a table on everyone's desk so you can verify the CBO figures, Madam President--in the 36 years from Harry Truman up until President Reagan--ah, those were a tough 36 years; we had to pay for World War II; we had to pay for Korea; we had to pay for Vietnam; and we had to pay for the Great Society that Lyndon Johnson started. During that 36 years, the actual average of real deficits is $20.41 billion. 
Now, in the last 16 years, from 1982 to 1997, without the cost of a single war or the Great Society, the average deficit is $277.58 billion. We have gone from $20 billion deficits with the cost of all the wars to the Republican initiative of growth, growth, growth. My friend, Steve Forbes, is running around again saying, `Hope, growth and opportunity.' 
What a charade. What a farce. They ought to be ashamed of themselves--the unmitigated gall to put those books up there and try to demonstrate that they are for cutting spending, that 
those are the deficits that we piled up casually. The truth is we balanced the budget under President Lyndon Baines Johnson, and the reason this growth started was that silly Reaganomics, which Howard Baker, who sat in that chair as the Republican leader, called a riverboat gamble, and which then Vice President George Herbert Walker Bush 
called voodoo. But there is no historical memory under these youngsters who come here to the Senate floor and try to demonstrate, with a pictorial thing here, with a pile of books: Now, we are concerned about these deficits, and the other side does not have any regard for them. They are the ones who caused it. 
That is the Reagan-Bush memorial deficit pile right there. That is what it is. In fact, Madam President, you can go back to 1776 and take 38 Presidents, 205 years of history, the cost of the Revolution and all the other wars, and we never got to a $1 trillion debt. When President Reagan took over, it was $909 billion, still not a $1 trillion debt. Now, under Reagan-Bush, President Reagan and President Bush, they have gone to $5.3 trillion. And do not blame President Clinton. Gosh knows, he did not know how to take credit. He went down there to Texas. I guess we all make mistakes running for office, but I think he overspoke. He said he raised taxes too much. But that did not take away from my vote. 
In 1993, we had a budget plan, and the budget plan was to reduce the deficit by $500 billion. It was to raise taxes on gasoline, and, yes, Social Security. And over on that side they said, pointing at us, you raise taxes on Social Security, they will be hunting you down like dogs in the street and shooting you. They said, `We are going to have a recession.' Ah, not even a recession, but a depression. Instead, the stock market is going through the roof. Inflation is down, jobs are up, and now they want to manufacture a problem. 
I say that is their problem. We did not get a single Republican vote in the Senate, we did not get a single Republican vote in the House of Representatives to do anything. We passed it by ourselves. And President William Jefferson Clinton is the only President since Lyndon Johnson to reduce the deficit. He spent 10 years as Governor down in Arkansas, each with a balanced budget. 
Then he comes to Washington and he changes the direction of increased deficits. You can see the real deficit under the last year of President Bush exceeded $400 billion. Madam President, $400 billion. The exact CBO figure for 1992 was $403.6 billion. That is where the spending comes from. And they get up here and put on these silly shows of piling up books and everything else to appear on C-SPAN and make the most extravagant statements you have ever heard, really totally out of whole cloth.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, if you look back to 1968-69, back when we used to have budgets from July 1 around the clock to June 30. We have changed now the fiscal year, so October 1 is the beginning of the fiscal year. 
But under that last year of President Johnson, let us credit him, you can see going right straight across the board we had a surplus of $2.9 billion. Trust funds were only $300 million--but dispel from your mind that President Johnson used trust funds because even using trust funds he would have had a surplus. So, here comes President Lyndon Baines Johnson with a surplus that year, and all he had to spend was $16.6 billion on interest costs. 
Now, Madam President, do you see today's interest costs of $360 billion at the bottom of the page--$360 billion? This is how we have increased spending. The Grace Commission, upon which I served, came to town to do away with waste, fraud, and abuse. The biggest waste is spending money for nothing, just for extravagance. The biggest waste is the past profligacy of not paying the bills and actually increasing spending on interest payments by some $344 billion during that period of time for absolutely nothing. 
President Clinton is working on it. He has slowed it down. But they are the ones who increased it with Reaganomics, `hope, growth and opportunity,' and television buzz words they can buy up. But let us get to the truth. That is why I put this table here, so we can look at the unified deficit, the real deficit, and gross interest, Madam President, which is forced spending, just like taxes. 
It is an insidious way to raise taxes. We have $360 billion to be expended this year on interest costs. Because these interest costs continue to grow, the debt goes up, up and away. This year, it is estimated that the debt will go from $5.182 trillion to $5.436 trillion, an increase of $254 billion. So, while we are increasing the debt, we are spending $1 billion a day in interest. In essence, we are increasing taxes $1 billion a day. Because, like taxes, it has to be paid. It has to be paid. So the crowd against taxes is insidiously increasing taxes $1 billion a day. That is where the spending is. 
Let me get back up here where my file is, Madam President, and get to the proposition and join issue, if you please, with the statements made by the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. Again yesterday, and he continues this wherever he goes, he referred to the Concord Coalition report as evidence that the matter of Social Security, again, was a gimmick, that is was just all nonsense. 
I had hoped we could really avoid that, because I have tried my best to counsel the Concord Coalition. To justify the sincerity of my remarks, let me go back and show that I am not just saying so today. I will read into the Record part of my letter of August 16, 1996 to the Concord Coalition.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this is addressed to the Honorable Warren B. Rudman and the Honorable late Paul Tsongas. We lost Paul. I have the greatest respect for these gentlemen. They are the best of the best. I say here in this letter: 
Dear Warren and Paul: You two friends should be ashamed of yourselves. I have just received the Concord Coalition Social Security mailout, and in four pages and in a 13-item questionnaire, there is no mention of the willful bankrupting of the Social Security trust fund in violation of section 13301 of the Budget Act. Mind you me, I support such coalition initiatives as the age increase for retirement to help strengthen the trust fund, and I have voted three times, now, for the Danforth-Kerrey recommendations. But back in 1983, the Greenspan commission recommended that Social Security be put off budget so that we could take care of the baby boomers through the fiscal year 2056. President Bush signed this provision, making it illegal to borrow from the fund or use Social Security moneys to obscure the size of the deficit. Now we know both the President and the Congress violated this. We know both parties violated this. But if we cannot get the truth out of esteemed colleagues like you two, instead of being fiscally in balance until the year 2029 we will be fiscally bankrupt by the year 2002.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I have the greatest respect for our friends there in the Concord Coalition, the former Secretary of Commerce, Secretary Pete Peterson--I worked with him way back under the initial days of President Reagan when I opposed Reaganomics. We got Senator Mathias, the distinguished Republican Senator from Maryland, to go along with us. But there were only 11 of us here that were fighting at that particular time against this. What you do is you cut all your revenues and the money because, `The people back home will know better than the politicians in Washington and they will have so much money, there will be so much spending, there will be so much income tax and sales tax that, my heavens, we will have growth and we will grow out of this.' 
Go ask the mayor of a city to cut his revenues 25 percent. Go ask a Governor to cut his revenues some 25 percent. They work with common sense because they cannot print money like us up here in Washington. They have to have a credit rating. They have to be able to keep interest rates down and get the investments in their communities and in their States. But we come to Washington and lose all common sense. We engage in a tremendous charade up here about piling up books, and how sincere we are, when we disregard the Greenspan commission and we disregard the law. 
I have here the report of the National Commission on Social Security Reform dated January 1983. From that report I read, `A majority of the members of the national commission recommends that the operation of these'--these are fancy words, but `Social Security trust funds'--they use the word `trust funds,'--this is a study commission--`should be removed from the unified budget.' 
They go right on down, `The national commission believes the changes in the Social Security Program should be made only for programmatic reasons and not for the purposes of balancing the budget.' 
So, pursuant to taking it out of the unified budget and building up the surplus funds, that is how we got the votes. If we had said at that particular time, `Look, we are going to use this money for foreign aid, we are going to use this money for welfare, food stamps, anything else of that kind,' you could not have gotten the votes. 
We had a horrendous tax increase in 1983, in a conscientious fashion, to build up surpluses to the year 2056. I can show you that right here in the 75-year period. But don't depend on just what the Senator from South Carolina says. Let's get back to the vote and the actions at that time of my distinguished colleague, the now chairman of the Budget Committee.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I moved at that particular time that we comply with the Greenspan commission and we put Social Security off budget, out of the unified deficit, so we could build up these surpluses so that the baby boomers and the next generation could be sure of receiving their money. We have lost trust in Government with the present activity. But here is what the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, stated at that time: 
I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I support the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget deficit calculation. 
I am going to read that again. Here is what the gentleman calls gimmick, here is what the gentleman called nonsense when referring to the Concord coalition's report yesterday. 
Senator Domenici: 
I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I support the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget deficit calculation. 
Then reading further: 
But I cast this vote with reservations. 
He says about my particular amendment: 
Unfortunately, the Hollings bill does not protect Social Security sufficiently. 
He says further: 
That's why Senator Nickles and I offered our firewall amendment. This amendment, drafted over the last 6 months by myself, Senator Heinz, Senator Rudman, Senator Gramm and Senator DeConcini, included a 60-vote point of order against legislation which would reduce the 75-year actuarial balance of the Social Security trust fund. 
There is the Concord coalition, the president, the former Senator Warren Rudman, the best of the best, saying, `Fine, I'm voting for the Hollings amendment to put Social Security off budget, make it a trust fund, build up the surpluses so that the younger generation, who is working and paying their taxes, knows the money is not being frittered away by an irresponsible Congress.' And we are going to go even further. We are going to say you have to get a 60-vote majority in order to reduce the 75-year actuarial balance. 
Now, they knew at that particular time it was going to be for 75 years, and here is the committee vote on July 10, 20 to 1. The one Senator voting against it at that time was our distinguished colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm.

Again, on the Hollings-Heinz amendment, I got together with my good friend, the late Senator John Heinz, and we worked in a bipartisan fashion, and we got an overwhelming bipartisan vote--98 Senators out of the 100. We missed two of them, Senator Armstrong and Senator Wallop. But we got 98 Senators, and any Senator, Republican or Democrat, who was a Member of this body back in 1990 who votes for the proposed Senate Joint Resolution 1 that would eviscerate the Social Security trust fund, that would turn the trust fund into a slush fund, constitutionally, is breaching the trust that he voted for on October 18, 1990 at 4:41.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, now we have a complete picture. They are running around here with demonstrations, with piles of books and their pile of books is the quintupling of the national debt under their particular leadership and trust, the 12 years really of Reagan-Bush, because we have reduced the deficit since then under President Clinton. Here is one-tenth that amount for the 205 years of our history, and they have the unmitigated gall to come here and continue with that demonstration. It is the Reagan-Bush memorial deficit pile. They are the ones who ran up the national debt. They are the ones who quintupled the national debt, and we are fighting in order to protect the Social Security trust fund. 
I could go into other reports, but I have received a note from my distinguished leader, Harry Reid, of Searchlight, NV. What we are going to do is have a vote for the balanced budget amendment. I have cosponsored one. I have been working in the vineyards for years. I balanced the budget back in the fifties in the State of South Carolina and got for the first time in its history a triple A credit rating. I was the first State from Texas up to Maryland to ever receive that from Moody's and Standard & Poor's. 
I voted for a balanced budget. I worked with George Mahon in 1968. I worked in a bipartisan fashion with Senators Gramm and Rudman in the mideighties to cut deficits, and I am willing to work with them anytime anywhere. This is not a partisan fight. This is a bipartisan fight to keep the trust. The distinguished Senator from Nevada will have a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution that we can support that will protect Social Security, and I intend to vote for it. But I am not voting, Mr. President, to breach the trust to vote against my own bill that I worked so hard for that we got President Bush to sign into law. 
Mr. President, here is what really happens. Here is the President's budget, and on page 2--literally on page 2--you will find that in the year 2002, we have a surplus of $17 billion. But if you turn--this is the gamesmanship on both sides, both in the White House and the Congress--but if you turn to page 331, you find a deficit in 2002 of $167.3 billion. Why do we have to borrow $167.3 billion? That is because we increase the debt that amount, and we are going to have to go out and borrow to pay the interest costs. That is the real deficit. It is not a $17 billion surplus. 
If you don't protect Social Security, then I come as a budgeteer and say, `Now, wait a minute, the other side is going to have $543 billion,' which is how much they will have borrowed from Social Security under this particular budget that we are discussing. If they are going to use $543 billion, some will want to use it on defense, some will want to use it on education, and some will want to use it on highways. 
If they are going to use and spend the money, I might as well get my projects in there. That is wherein the discipline breaks. If you are going to use Social Security and turn it from a trust fund into a slush fund, you do not have the discipline. 
Again, Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for yielding the floor.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, today I recognize Lockwood Greene, and its chairman, Donald R. Lugar, for the company's donation of 5,000 original engineering drawings to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. 
The Lockwood Greene Collection dates to the mid-1800's and is the largest single holding of early American engineering and architectural drawings. The drawings offer a window into the U.S. industrial history and the changes that occurred with the harnessing of electricity and the invention of the automobile. 
The donated drawings, mostly on linen using India ink and still in mint condition, reveal the skills and talent of 19th and early 20th century draftsmen. They document information unrecorded elsewhere such as: The first application of electric drive to an 1893 manufacturing operation in Columbia, SC; modifications providing for the transition from horse and buggy to automobile to the important east west route, the Lincoln Highway in Lake County, IN; designs for WWII era radio stations; and drawings of the Androscoggin textile mill in Lewiston, ME, from the 1890's depicting power transmission through the factory prior to the introduction of electricity. 
The official ceremony for the donation will take place at the Smithsonian's Ceremonial Court Hall on February 19, 1997. Museum officials are delighted by the gift and they have begun compiling a computerized index of them. 
I congratulate Lockwood Greene's generous decision to make this priceless gift to the Smithsonian Institution, thus securing it for future generations. Lockwood Greene, one of the country's most prominent consulting, design, and construction firms, was founded in New England in 1832 and is now headquartered in Spartanburg, SC.

Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas is right on target, it is the king of corporate welfare. The Senator from Arkansas has been at this for years trying to save the conscience of this particular body. I have been most interested in his factual, indepth study and report to the Congress, and particularly here to us in the Senate. It is just astounding to me that it continues. 
As he said, the public can hardly believe what he says. I want to turn to a subject that the public cannot believe, and that is what we say, because we have a funny way of talking about deficits. Specifically, if you look, Mr. President, at the budget message of the President in the budget green book, fiscal year 1998, on page 2, and you want to see what the deficit is after the fifth year out, it says on page 2 at the bottom, `Surplus deficit.' Why doublespeak? You would not get that from your accountant. 
Do not, by gosh, make your income tax statement in April on the basis of surplus deficit, on budget/off budget, unified budget, unified deficit. But you will see here that they show a $17 billion surplus on page 2. However, Mr. President, if you turn to page 331, buried in the back, you will find table S-16, `Federal Government Financing and Debt.' All one needs do to ever determine a deficit is to just look at the increase, if you please, of the debt each year. If the debt stays the same, you have a balanced budget. If the debt goes down, then you have a surplus. But, if the debt goes up, as it says on page 331, clearly you have a deficit. You can see that the debt in 2002 is $6.6525 trillion on the line which says `Total gross Federal debt.' Then, if you subtract the previous year's debt of $6.4852 in 2001 from the 2002 figure of $6.6525 trillion, you will get, of course, a $167.3-billion deficit. This is not a surplus as you find on page 2, 
but a deficit, as it states on page 331. That is the real world, and it should be our real world. It should be our real world, Mr. President, because, otherwise, the discipline has broken here in this body. Specifically, if you are going to use some offset borrowing, it is like going to the bank and the teller says, `Well, Hollings, you don't have any money left,' and I say, `Well, let me borrow from the next fellow's account over there and put it in mine.' 
So what we do for the unified budget is borrow from Social Security and highway trust funds. Let me give you the list, Mr. President. This chart lists each President since Harry Truman in 1945, the U.S. budget, the trust funds that are used, the real deficit, the gross Federal debt, and then the gross interest costs.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you go down each year and--incidentally, when I got here, in 1966, there wasn't any unified budget, or unified deficit, or unified surplus. There wasn't anything unified. There wasn't any in 1967, 1968, and 1969. When they started that under President Johnson, they said President Johnson started it as a gimmick. If you look at these figures, you will find out that President Johnson did have a surplus and a balanced budget--I voted for it; I was here then--and it did not use Social Security or any of the other trust funds. 
Then, Mr. President, as I was saying, there is a table here of the different amounts used in this so-called unified budget, or deficit. In the year 1997, there was $78 billion in Social Security moneys to reduce the size of that deficit; in 1998, $81 billion; in 1999, $88 billion; in 2000, $94 billion; in the year 2001, $98 billion; and in 2002, $104 billion. That is a total of $543 billion. 
Now, I am a budgeteer. I am on the Budget Committee. I go in the room and I say: Well, now, are we going to really look at the debt and see if we've got this Government on a pay-as-you-go program, or are we going to play the gamesmanship? Oh, they have reporters running all around the world, to China, to find out whether or not they made a contribution in the Presidential election. But they don't have the integrity to report the facts, truth in budgeting. The discipline is broken. I go in as a budgeteer and you say: Wait a minute, you have $543 billion, a half trillion bucks, over the next 6 years, and if I don't spend it for what I want, that fellow over there is going to spend it on defense; this one over here is going to spend it on foreign aid; the next one is going to spend it on the national parks. I might as well get my money to take back home. There is no discipline. There is no trust. 
Obviously, the public has heard us talk ad nauseam about deficits and balancing budgets. And like old Tennessee Ernie sang, `Another day older and deeper in debt.' We have these polls taken to see whether or not they trust us. I hope they don't because we are not giving them the truth in budgeting. I am trying my dead-level best here to list these amounts.

Mr. HOLLINGS. You will find that in the 1997 budget we use $78 billion from Social Security; military retirement, $9 billion; civilian retirement, $28 billion; unemployment compensation fund, $7 billion; highways, $3 billion; additional borrowings from banking, $10 billion; Treasury loans, another $11 billion. 
So you can see the tremendous amounts that we do to obscure the size of that deficit. And this has been quite a problem for this particular Senator, because I have been trying to get one vocabulary, if you please, so when we go into the Budget Committee we all talk the same language. Then, we can have `slush' funds instead of `trust' funds. We, very lightly, make a motion and say the money is there and we will use it there, and we will use the CPI and pick up a trillion dollars over 10 years. Oh, there are all kinds of gimmicks to use. I got an initiative in the formal statutory law, which was called a gimmick less than 24 hours ago by the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. I don't think the law is a gimmick. 
I want to talk seriously about that, Mr. President, because we can go back to the National Commission on Social Security Reform in January 1983. You will find, under section 21, a majority of the national commission recommends that the operations of OASI, DI, HI, and SMI--the trust funds, Social Security trust funds--should be removed from the unified budget. In the operations, the Social Security trust funds have been included in the unified budget. However, by including Social Security trust funds in the annual budget process, it gives a false impression to the American public. The national commission believed that changes in the Social Security program should be made only for programmatic reasons and not for balancing the budget. 
Then, they projected as the reason for removing it from the unified budget was to take Social Security from a pay-as-you-go program to building up surpluses--tremendous reserves--to take care of the baby boomers in the next century. They use the year 2056 in one instance and talk about protecting the fund for 75 years in another. Now, in all the litany from these reports and emergency committees that go around studying this, they are coming back in and saying it will be broke in the year 2029, not 2056 or 75 years out as the Greenspan Commission reported. 
What should we do? We should reduce benefits and increase taxes. But do you know what happens? The trust fund surpluses created by the tax increases are spent on other programs. The Social Security taxes that we passed in 1983 were formally declared as revenues for Social Security surpluses, a trust fund for the baby boomers in the next century. They were certainly not to be used for defense, or foreign aid, or housing, or any of these other endeavors. But we are spending it for any and all purposes except Social Security. It is a dirty shame what is going on. You cannot get it reported. And the effect is on us immediately, not in the next century. The effect is this particular minute. We are running up these horrendous deficits and debt to the tune now--as you can see from the table that I put in--of $1 billion a day in interest costs. It was only about $1 billion a week when President Reagan came to town. He was going to balance the budget in 1 year. I can show you the talk. He came to town and he says, `Oops. This is the way it works. I am going to balance it in 3 years.' He came in with `Reaganomics.' Brother, I can tell you the debt just went soaring through the ceiling. We had 210 years of history with the cost of all the wars, the Revolution, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish American War, the Mexican War, World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam--we had the cost of all the wars; we had 38 Presidents, Republican and Democrat; and we never got to a $1 trillion debt. Yet, without the cost of a war in 15 years, we now have $5.3 trillion in debt. That is the crowd around here talking about they are concerned about deficits and the next fellow is not. 
When the Greenspan commission made this recommendation I was on the Budget Committee. I cosponsored and worked in a bipartisan fashion on Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. Then I went to work on really stopping this debt from soaring that nobody knew was soaring because we were using billions from the Social Security trust fund. And it took me until 1990, Mr. President, to do just exactly that. And in July of 1990, as a member of the Budget Committee, I made the motion that we do as the Greenspan commission had recommended and put it off budget; build up an accounting surplus. And the vote was 20 to 1. 
I ask unanimous consent to include the vote in the Record at this particular point.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, 98 Senators in the U.S. Senate agreed with me. I will tell you, Mr. President, it was really interesting because I have never seen such a thing occur. We all went home in those campaigns and we talked about how we had finally put it into law. It was on November 5, 1990, that George Herbert Walker Bush signed that into law. That is the formal section of the Budget Act, section 13301. It says, `Thou shalt not use Social Security surpluses to obscure the size of the deficit.' We wanted to have truth in budgeting. When I say 98 Senators, I counted up about 33 that are still here in the U.S. Senate that were there in 1990 voting for this. 
Right to the point, here is the provision in the statute. It says: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and disbursements of the Federal Old Age and Survivors Insurance trust fund shall not be counted as new budget authority, or as outlays, or as receipts, or deficits, or surplus for the purpose of the budget of the U.S. Government as submitted by the President, or for the purposes of the congressional budget, or for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. 
When we passed that, the distinguished Senator--and there is no one I have greater respect for, and he is my friend, and I am his friend--came on the floor yesterday, the chairman, the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, and he came on the floor yesterday late in the evening, and it is one of the things that prompted my appearance here this afternoon. Let me quote from page S. 1294 of the Congressional Record of February 12: 
Frankly, I want to make sure that everybody knows that the best use of the word gimmick for anything going on on this floor has to do with the gimmick that some on that side of the aisle are using when they speak of taking Social Security off budget so you will assure Social Security's solvency and the checks. That is a gimmick of the highest order. For you do that, and there is no assurance that Congress will not spend the trust funds surpluses for anything they want. It is no longer subject to any budget discipline. It is out there by itself. 
Senator Domenici is totally mistaken. 
Let me quote the real Senator Domenici. Here is the report, and I refer to the Social Security Preservation Act of July 10, 1990, and the additional views of Mr. Domenici.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I quote: 
We need to balance our non Social Security budget so that the Social Security trust funds surpluses can be invested by lowering our national debt instead of using it to pay for other Federal operating costs. If we take Social Security without any new protection for the trust funds, Congress could spend the reserves without facing new spending cuts or revenue increases in other programs, and, if we spend the trust fund reserves today, we will threaten the solvency of the Social Security program putting at risk the benefits we have promised to today's workers. 
Then the Senator goes on to submit firewall protection. He said this particular statute is not enough. Here he is adamant about this statute, says it is necessary, says it has to be done so you can't use the money for anything else. Yet he insists now using the money for anything else as just hunky-dory, and the law itself is a gimmick. 
Let me make sure so they don't have to look it up, subtitle C, section 1301. 
I ask unanimous consent to include it in the Record.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, that is pretty serious business when the distinguished chairman of your own Budget Committee, who is supposed to lead the discipline, leads the nondiscipline. 
I have laid it on the line. When you spend these moneys to obscure the size of the deficit, thereupon that discipline is broken because you are spending it. We have already spent about $570 billion, at this particular point, Mr. President, and by the year 2002 we will owe over $1 trillion. In any of these budgets that will be debated here this year, we will use over $1 trillion of Social Security trust funds to balance the budget.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I stood here with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of our Budget Committee, 2 years ago and said if you can give me a balanced budget by the year 2002, without increasing taxes, I will jump off the Capitol dome. 
Right to the point, we have tried our best, Senator Dorgan, myself and others--there are five of us--and I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a letter dated March 1, 1995, where five of us said just reiterate the law rather than repeal the law.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Quoting on page 2: 
Under this version of the balanced budget amendment, total Government expenditures in any year, including expenditures for Social Security benefits, could not exceed total revenues collected in the same year. The implications of this requirement for Social Security are profound. It would mean that Social Security surpluses could not be used to cover the benefit costs of the baby-boom generation when it retires. The benefits for the baby-boom generation would, instead, have to be financed in full by the taxes of those working in those years. 
Continuing to quote: 
The leadership version, thus, would eviscerate the central achievement of the Greenspan Commission. 
Mr. President, that is followed up, finally, here, of course, with the Congressional Research Service, which on February 5, came out with a report from the American Law Division.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I quote from this: 
Because a balanced budget amendment requires that the required balance be between outlays for that year and receipts for that year, the moneys that constitute the Social Security surpluses would not be available as a balance for the payment of the benefits. 
Now, Mr. President, we are talking about serious matters--the American Law Division, the priorities on budgets. You have a very serious matter which has been called by the chairman of the Budget Committee a `gimmick.'

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I read on the first page of that letter the last line: 
It is equally true that excluding Social Security would allow us to run massive budget deficits equal to the deficits that are projected to occur in the Social Security trust funds beginning in 2019. These deficits would be real deficits. 
That is what I am talking about, real deficits, not gimmicks. When you borrow from one to minimize the size of the other; namely, the deficit itself, then you really mislead the real deficit; you misreport it. Again, on yesterday, the distinguished leader for the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, the distinguished Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch], said on page S1336:  
The 1990 Budget Act basically stated in one section to take Social Security out of budget. It said in another section to leave it in. 
That is not the case. Only one law passed in 1990. It is not a different section. He said: 
This is confusing: 
Well, the statement made by the distinguished Senator from Utah is what is confusing. 
But both Congress and the President have construed the Budget Act of 1990 to allow Social Security to be included within the unitary budget. 
How? This is in violation of the 1990 law. If we had an enterprising free press, a media who would go for truth in budgeting so that the public would be properly and accurately informed, the Members themselves would begin to command discipline rather than broken discipline when deficits are misreported. Mr. President, you can see what we really have here. 
Now, they come, of course, and say that what really has occurred is that this is a vote for the senior citizens. Not at all. I readily acknowledge that Social Security is the senior citizens' program and they are vitally interested in it. But between Medicare and Social Security, the present-day recipients have yet to be heard from. I haven't heard from them. I have asked why not. Of course, the obvious reason, Mr. President, is they are going to get their money. They know they are going to be paid right now. So they are putting all their efforts on saving Medicare and health costs and could care less about the baby-boom generation. In contrast, the baby-boom generation are being told they are not going to get it, so why should they show any kind of interest in the thing that they say is not going to be there for them anyway? 
And the politicians sometimes say: Why should we concern ourselves about the baby-boom generation? Why should we not look to the next election rather than the next generation? Of course, that occurs. They look just to the next election. 
This particular initiative--the amendment that will be presented by the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Senator Reid--is not a gimmick. It is based in law. It is one worked on by the Senator from Utah, who voted for it, the Senator from New Mexico, who voted for it and said it has serious purpose. He did not call it a gimmick in 1990. We thought we had it all down and understood. But that's what happens when they go out to Andrews Air Force Base. They went out there in 1990 and they repealed the targets of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. So often, having been a principal cosponsor, I am asked, `Senator, what about Gramm-Rudman-Hollings?' Oh, no, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings was working. We had an automatic cut across the board, and they eliminated it. I made the point of order at 1:15 in the morning on October 21, 1990, that is exactly what they were doing. They voted that point of order down. So don't come to me and say Gramm-Rudman-Hollings didn't work. It worked and would have continued to work had they not repealed it in 1990. 
My final statement is to the effect that the distinguished President of the United States, for 10 years prior to his arrival here for his first term in 1993, spent 10 years balancing budgets down in Arkansas. He is the only President since Lyndon Baines Johnson balanced this budget in 1968 and 1969 to reduce the deficit 4 consecutive years. President Clinton is the only President who has come to Washington and lowered the deficit. Listen to that statement. 
He has lowered it each year and every year. Yet, there is a crowd here on the Senate floor which keeps running around in a circle like the President is a tax-and-spend liberal Democrat when they are the ones that tripled--excuse me, quadrupled--excuse me, quintupled the Federal debt. Five times $1 trillion is $5 trillion. It was less than $1 trillion when Ronald Reagan came to town. Now it is $5.3 trillion. They are the ones, not President Clinton, that ran up this horrendous debt that is causing us to spend $1 billion a day in interest costs which increases taxes $1 billion a day. Because you add it to the debt, you have to pay for it, and it is a subtle way of increasing taxes. And running around fussing at the President saying, `Where is his balanced budget? And he has not balanced it.' Where is their budget? I am looking for one. I am on the Budget Committee. I attend meetings. I look around. They don't have a budget. 
It is wheeling and dealing, and all these other things going on. If that is what we are going to have, let us get rid of the Budget Committee so we can put our effort and time somewhere else. But that is the gamesmanship that is being played. They don't want to put up a budget because they know that budget will show massive tax cuts in that 5-year period being offset by cuts in Medicare. And on up and up and away the deficit goes. 
So I think the gamesmanship as we go on our break here in February ought to conclude. Let us get their budget. Let us compare the two budgets like we do in the regular sense of the word, reconcile the differences, and go forward with the work of the American people. 
Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota. 
I yield the floor. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Berlin George Myers is dedicated to his hometown of Summerville, SC. His life has revolved around an eight-square block area in the heart of this town also known as Flowertown in the Pines. In this small area, he grew up and raised his own children and today, continues to run his business and govern the town. 
Mayor Myers' first public office was membership on town council in 1965. His vote returns were the highest ever achieved by a town official and as a result, he became Mayor pro tem. History repeated itself in the following elections and Mayor Myers is further distinguished by having served on every town committee. 
Under Councilman Myers, many civic improvements were made: a new town hall and a new fire station were built, an extensive paving program enacted, town clean-up was given a high priority and annexation began in earnest. 
In June 1972, the incumbent Mayor Luke died and Berlin Myers stepped in to fill the remainder of his term. Four months later, he won his own election and every one since with a large majority of the vote. During Mayor Myers' tenure, Summerville's population has grown from 3,700 to approximately 25,000. 
Under Mayor Myers, Summerville's Public Safety Department has combined police and fire departments, telecommunications--including an enhanced 911 system--and municipal court in a single headquarters building complex. He helped plan and proudly presided over the ribbon cutting for a perimeter road around Summerville--named the Berlin G. Myers Parkway by an act of the South Carolina legislature. In 1994, under his direction, the 27-year-old townhall was renovated and expanded. His tireless, around-the-clock leadership during 1989's Hurricane Hugo put Summerville back in operation quickly and smoothly. 
The order and organization for which Summerville is renowned founded his business, the Berlin G. Myers Lumber Co., which in 1989 celebrated its 50th year. There's neither a piece of lumber nor a piece of paperwork out of place in this operation. He began working in his Uncle Allen's sawmill and small retail outlet after school and weekends when he was 10 years old. After graduating from high school in 1939, he took over the latter. Mayor Myers is past president of the Carolinas Tennessee Building Materials Association and has served on committees on both the regional and national chapters. 
In 1989, Mayor Myers was awarded the Order of the Palmetto, the highest civilian accolade the State of South Carolina can bestow. He keeps the same rigorous schedule he has all of his adult life, arriving first at the lumber yard every morning, holding regular townhall work hours, talking with school children about the town's history, and actively participating in Summerville Baptist Church. Mayor Berlin Myers is a devoted husband and is the father of four children and three grandchildren. 
In this, his 80th year, his mayoral tenure has reached a quarter of a century, the longest in Summerville's history. His postion is unpaid and he says that he sees politics as service to his town, `It's a way to give back to my community which has given me so much.' Summerville's sesquicentennial takes place this year, 1997, and you can believe that Mayor Berlin Myers will be leading the parade.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Lawrence Gressette, Jr., is well known to all of us in South Carolina and we salute him as he retires on February 28 as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of SCANA Corp., in Columbia, SC. 
Excellence is a Gressette family tradition. Lawrence Gressette learned much at the knee of his father, Marion, the esteemed attorney and South Carolina State senator. He once told Lawrence, `Things must not only be right but should also look right.' Lawrence Gressette has long adhered to his father's sage advice. In college, he not only played football for Clemson University, he earned a football scholarship. He was so liked and respected by his classmates that they elected him student body president. At the University of South Carolina Law School, he finished first in his class. Upon graduation, he joined in his father's practice and earned a reputation as a solid litigator. 
It was in working alongside his father that Lawrence Gressette became involved with utility regulatory work. The powers that were at South Carolina Electric and Gas were so impressed with his talents that they persuaded him to become a senior vice president in 1983 and executive vice president the following year. In 1990, John Warren retired as CEO of SCE&G's parent company, SCANA, and the board of directors tapped Lawrence to fill the top spot. Through vision and consistent leadership, he has guided SCANA into a successful, cohesive commercial force --a goliath of energy-related and communications businesses. Fortunately for all of us, he has shared his talents with his community as well. Some of his achievements include: chairman of the board of trustees for Clemson University, trustee of the Educational Television Endowment of South Carolina, member of the steering committee of the South Carolina Governor's School of the Arts, and chairman of the United Way of the Midlands. Through it all, he has been blessed with the love and support of his wife, Felicia, and their three children. Although Lawrence will be sorely missed at SCANA, I am confident that he will continue in his role of excellent public service and will hand down this Gressette legacy to his four grandchildren.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Bernice Scott, of the Richland County Council, is a philanthropist in the truest sense of the word. 
Bernice is generous with heart, time, talent, and money and employs these resources on behalf of the community and in particular for those less fortunate. Her largess is well known and more than one child remembers her for the gift of shoes or school supplies that made it possible to attend school. Each winter she hosts a dinner for senior citizens in need and every spring, in her mother's memory, she throws a banquet for the entire community. 
Bernice's efforts on behalf of individuals and the community at large is legendary. Always one to go the extra mile, Bernice has driven to Washington and slept in her car in the battle for a sewer for a small community. She has led countless countywide efforts to improve roads, storm water drainage, sewer, and water conditions. Her constituents have full faith in her ability to make things happen. Whether saving the Lower Richland Rural Health Center, improving recreation facilities for children, or turning out the vote with her `Wrecking Crew', Bernice Scott is always sure to be in the thick of things. 
Bernice grew up the 7th of 11 children on a family farm. She is married to Deacon Thomas Gilmore and is the mother of two children and three grandchildren. First elected to county council in September 1988, Bernice Scott is the first African-American to chair Richland County Council. In addition to her duties on county council, she has held the positions of assistant to the court administrator, county ombudsman, records clerk in the county treasurer's office, tax collector and assistant to the clerk of council for Richland County. She is a member and a deaconess of Mount Nebo Baptist Church in Gasden, SC. 
A short list of her civic activities include: member of the Central Midlands Regional Planning Council, the HOME Committee, vice-chair of the Transportation Committee, member of the Richland County Administration and Finance Committee, member of the Soil and Water Conservation Board, and chairperson of the board of directors for Richland Community Health Care Association. 
Bernice Scott is the embodiment of public service at its very best.

Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator from Arkansas has been so laudatory, I think the Record should show that Rodney Slater is a Democrat. 
The fact of the matter is, he has strong, strong bipartisan support because he truly comes as an appointment, not on account of the color of his skin, but the content of his character. As the distinguished Senator pointed out, he started in the most humble Mississippi Delta section of Arkansas, attended the public schools, graduated, then, from Eastern Michigan University, and then from the University of Arkansas School of Law at Fayetteville. 
Working as a commissioner on the Arkansas Highway Commission, he then was able to serve as its chairman and came here just almost 4 years ago as the Federal Highway Administrator. You only have to go to Northridge, CA, to ask how he did. Right after that earthquake out in California, Mr. Slater cut through all the bureaucracy. His actions there, instituted immediately, facilitated the provision of alternative transportation, and then Mr. Slater's FHWA allowed the repair and rebuilding of the damaged highways out there in record time. 
He has become familiar with all modes of transportation, working at DOT--the civilian airline system; all the railroads, including the Nation's rail passenger service, Amtrak; the water borne transportation system, and everything else. So he is totally familiar with it. I don't know any better compliment than that related by my distinguished colleague from Arkansas. Mr. Slater appeared with the strongest bipartisan support of any nominee I have seen in my time up here, and I think he deserves it. I have watched him over the past 4 years, as I have watched other Federal Highway Administrators, but none has done a more resourceful job, a more understanding job, and a more effective job than Rodney Slater of Arkansas. 
It's quite a journey from those rural roots to being chairman of the Arkansas State Highway Department to administering the Nation's highway program and now, I hope, to Secretary of Transportation. Mr. Slater's journey began with a loving family and community, and we should, as he does, pay tribute to them. They instilled in him the thirst for education, the drive to succeed at every job, and the determination to be fair in whatever he did. These are qualities that we should look for in every nominee for every office. But in addition to Mr. Slater's personal story there are several other excellent reasons for confirming Mr. Slater in this very important Cabinet position. 
He has high-level experience in transportation dating back to 1987. Mr. Slater has served as a member of the Arkansas State Highway Commission and later as the commission chairman. In these positions he received high praise for his ability to bring together diverse interests in order to get the job done. Part of Mr. Slater's success is attributed to his willingness to listen to disparate points of view and a desire to learn from others. 
Mr. Slater was appointed to the Federal Highway Administration [FHWA] by President Clinton in 1993. As Administrator, Mr. Slater managed a $20 billion annual budget in an agency with 3,500 employees and an office in every State. In that capacity, he impressed both local officials and Members of Congress with his ability to work within the system to get things done. During the last 4 years the FHWA under Mr. Slater has expanded our Nation's highways and linked isolated communities to new jobs and opportunities. 
One important example of this nominee's abilities is the response of the FHWA to the devastating earthquake that took place in Northridge, CA. Mr. Slater received high marks from those who witnessed his ability to cut redtape and lessen response time so that critical funds would be released promptly to the communities hit by the earthquake. His adept maneuvering through the bureaucracy resulted in the provision of alternate transportation and the rebuilding of vital highways in record time. 
In nominating Mr. Slater, President Clinton said: `* * * he was recommended by more people from more places in more ways for this job than any person for any position I have ever seen.' Nothing is more true. Look at the Members of Congress, on both sides of the aisle, who have supported this nomination. During the Commerce Committee hearing on his nomination, Mr. Slater was endorsed by Senators Warner, Bumpers, and Hutchinson and Congressmen Hutchinson and Berry. That's a good cross-section of support--the chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and four members of the Arkansas congressional delegation, two from each party. He has also received high praise from our House colleagues. Congressman Wolf, chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, called the nomination `a natural.' House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bud Shuster said he considers the nominee one who `can work well with both parties.' 
Mr. Slater's nomination is not just endorsed within the Washington Beltway. Indeed, the transportation industry uniformly praised Slater both for his abilities as the FHWA Administrator and for his interest in learning the promises and prospects of the other modes of transportation. 
From my perspective as Senator from South Carolina, I am very pleased to have a nominee who has a firm grasp of the highway system that is so vital to my State. Moreover, in Mr. Slater we have the opportunity to confirm as Secretary of Transportation a man who knows the value of the other modes of transportation as well: The Nation's civil aviation system, Amtrak, and the country's waterborne transportation system. 
With Mr. Slater, we will have a Secretary who knows that we must rebuild the Nation's infrastructure if we are to grow and prosper in the 21st century. He is a man who believes, as I do, that the number of ships that steam into our ports means little if road or rail transport is insufficient to speed the cargo on its way to points inland; and that increasing tourism in Charleston or Boston or New Orleans won't matter unless trains and planes are available to bring the tourists to those cities. 
He is also a man who is well aware that a carefully constructed reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 [ISTEA] can give us the boost we need toward the year 2000. We in South Carolina have worthwhile intermodal projects that need funding. These intermodal projects will relieve choke points in the States, giving us a start on the seamless transportation network that ISTEA envisions. An example of one of our most pressing issues for ISTEA is the long overdue replacement of the bridges over the Cooper River in Charleston. These bridges are essential to the movement of cargo to and from the port. 
In conclusion, Mr. Slater has earned my support and my vote because I am impressed with the intelligence, dedication, and ability I believe he will bring to this job. I urge my colleagues to join me in confirming this excellent appointment.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to restore the constitutional balance to our trade policy and preserve the Congress' constitutional obligation to regulate foreign commerce. The bill I introduce requires that before a trade agreement negotiated under the auspices of the World Trade Organization is accorded the force of law, it must be ratified by the Congress. It is a simple bill, but I believe it protects a fundamental principle of our democracy, the separation of powers.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I had the opportunity at the NATO conference in November, as the ranking member and former chairman of State, Justice, Commerce Appropriations, to spend an entire morning with Ambassador Harriman going over her particular needs, her budget. I was really impressed with the overall view she had of the needs of the Department of State, particularly her grasp of bringing the Department up to date in the area of communications, upgrading its computers, and other technological issues. 
I could tell that she understood, after we had some time together, that the lack of real financial support for the Department of State has been at the executive branch, not here in the Congress. I have fought for many, many years to try to get the needed increases for the endeavors of the State Department. And now with the fall of the wall, defense is not our first line of defense. The State Department is. 
We are trying to sell capitalism. We are trying to sell democracy and individual rights the world around. And that is the province of our Department of State, which has been cut back. We have been closing consulates and closing embassies. 
The record will show that the distinguished Ambassador had really been to the President on these issues, and for the first time President Clinton has made a substantial request for an increase for the Department of State. There will be many kudos, well deserved, for Ambassador Harriman, but I think she was the one who finally got the message to the executive branch as to what was needed at the State Department.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I am delighted to serve with my distinguished white-haired chairman. My wife says when I appear on TV I look like a Q-Tip. 
Mr. President, next week the President of the United States will be delivering his State of the Union Message. The Union is in somewhat disrepair, intense disrepair, I might say, because for 50 years after World War II, with the Marshall plan, we sacrificed our economy. And it has worked. Capitalism has overcome communism. They are going the way of freedom and individual rights the world around now. But it has been at quite a cost to our economic strength. 
We have lost over 2 million jobs just in the past 10 years. Our manufacturing sector has gone from 26 percent of our work force down to 13 percent. Now is the time to rebuild. In order to do that, we need a very strong Secretary. I am pleased that President Clinton has chosen an unusually strong Secretary in the person of Bill Daley of Chicago. 
The fact of the matter is, for many years now he has been a business leader, a business attorney, a banker, an outstanding civic leader, in many respects, and more particularly we know him here in Washington as a special counsel to President Clinton on extending the North American Free-Trade Agreement from Canada down to Mexico. Necessarily, there was quite a difference on this side of the aisle with respect to that agreement, but be that as it may, Bill Daley handled that with thoroughness and with tact and with persistence. And it passed with strong bipartisan support. 
He knows his subject of trade. He understands the business needs. He is a very strong individual. He came to the assignment immediately going over to brief himself on the 
Department and, as the distinguished chairman has already pointed out, has announced, in unique form for a nominee, that he was going to downsize some of the duplications there in the Department itself and make sure that the trips were made for industry and not for politics. 
More than anything else, he is really intent on reestablishing the morale of the Department with the loss of Ron Brown who did an outstanding job as the Secretary of Commerce. And I say that advisedly because I have been at least through a dozen or so in the last 30 years and worked with them in that 30-year period, not only with respect to the authorization of the Department, but the appropriations there. 
Ron Brown did an outstanding job. Yes, there were some solicitations. Thank heavens it was not solicitations by Ron Brown like most Secretaries of Commerce. We had one Republican Secretary of Commerce go to jail for his solicitations. If we have to get into solicitations, I am going to be glad to make the record. 
But the spirit here is one of bipartisanship in the support for Bill Daley. I was particularly impressed that not only the distinguished Democratic Senators, Senator Moseley-Braun of Illinois, and our distinguished colleague, Senator Durbin of Illinois, were there to present him in enthusiastic fashion, but he was presented to the committee by none other than the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, the most respected Henry Hyde of Illinois, and the campaign manager for Robert Dole's Presidency, the former Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld. 
So we have the respect and confidence of the leadership in Chicago and Illinois that really knows him best. And it is with that record here that he comes. I am particularly enthusiastic that President Clinton has made this appointment. I want to yield now to our distinguished colleague from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Michael Jordan makes his money in Chicago, but he spends it in South Carolina. We welcome him down there regularly. I think he is a property owner by now in Hilton Head. I will check it out, because that would be one of the few votes I could get on Hilton Head. 
Mr. President, the appointment of William Daley to head the Department of Commerce comes at a critical juncture in our history. We have emerged triumphant from our long struggle against the forces of tyranny and totalitarianism. Our victory in the cold war was secured through the commitment and sacrifice of the American people, who willingly subordinated their economic interests to sustain the alliance against Soviet expansionism. It was access to the rich American market that enabled our allies to rise from the ashes and rebuild their economies. For four decades the American market absorbed the world's exports while our exporters confronted closed markets abroad. Our generosity has taken a tremendous toll on the American economy. For the past 20 years wages for the American worker have remained stagnant. The average American now earns 20 percent less today than he or she earned 20 years ago. The toll has been most devastating in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing now accounts for a mere thirteen percent of our GNP, half that of Germany or Japan. The most terrible price that we paid was the loss of 2 million manufacturing jobs, which were the backbone of the American economy. 
Having triumphed abroad it is now time to rebuild at home. Restoring the promise of America and rebuilding our economy will require the same commitment and sacrifice that won the cold war. The Commerce Department should be at the forefront of this effort. There are some, who in the name of budget discipline, call for the Department's elimination. In an era in which economic and national security are synonymous, eliminating the Commerce Department would be tantamount to unilateral disarmament. The budget will not be balanced by political gimmicks and symbolic gestures. Abolishing the Commerce Department will not make a dent in balancing the budget; what it will do is put us at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy. 
In today's new world economy American firms and American workers compete against foreign companies whose governments are allies of business, not adversaries. Where once we stood at the apex of the world economy, now no industry in America is immune from this intense foreign competition. 
In market after market, industry after industry, U.S. companies compete against foreign companies that are the beneficiaries of strategic alliances with powerful ministries of trade and industry. Those who believe that government has no role in supporting industry and American workers seek to rewrite history and ignore the realities of the new international 
competition. In the new global economy, the line between public sector and private sector is at times indistinct. 
Our competitors nurture industrial development through rigged capital markets, generous subsidies, infant industry protection, and favorable export incentives. The invisible hand of the free market did not develop Korea's world class semiconductor industry. Instead it was the iron fist of decrees laid down by Korea's Ministry of Trade, which kept out foreign competition unless they licensed technology to Korean companies. The iron fist was complemented by the largesse of Korea's Finance Ministry which provided low interest loans to foster the development of its industries. 
The invisible hand of the market did not create Airbus, nor does it guide the development of the faster growing economies in the Pacific rim, which are following the Japanese model of development. The irony is that the market alone was not responsible for the development of our own industrial base. From Alexander Hamilton's `Report on Manufactures,' to the revolution in information technology initiated through research conducted by the Department of Defense, our economic strength has been fortified by a symbiotic relationship between government and the private sector. 
The strong Commerce Department is an essential prerequisite for competing in the global economy. The Commerce Department, through its technology administration, plays a crucial role in developing the critical technologies of the future. Although the National Institute for Standards and Technology [NIST] accounts for only 1 percent of the U.S. research and development budget--it is the principal program dedicated to fostering critical technologies that have a commercial application. U.S. companies face great pressure to deliver short run returns for the fund managers who dominate America's capital markets. As the Wall Street Journal noted, `the biggest U.S. companies have cut back sharply on research into `basic science' to pursue short term goals * * *.' This alarming trend did not go unnoticed by the Council on Competitiveness, which noted, `Long-term investments rates as a percentage of GDP are falling just when Asian and European competitors are ramping up their R&D programs.' This is why it is crucial that we maintain our Advanced Technology Program. It enables industry and government to join forces in carrying out broad-based, long-term, peer-reviewed projects that could have large payoffs down the road. Eliminating the Government's role in technological development will consign our economy to second-rate status. Furthermore, it would allow Asians and Europeans to dominate the emerging technologies which will create the jobs of the future. 
Not only does the Commerce Department play a critical role in fostering technology, it plays an equally important role in protecting U.S. industries from the predatory trade practices that have crippled many of our domestic industries. Vigorous enforcement of our antidumping laws is crucial to maintaining our standard of living. Far too often our competitors have hidden behind a citadel of protection in their home markets while simultaneously flooding our economy with illegally dumped products. A Commerce Department that aggressively enforces our trade laws will enable U.S. companies to sustain their investment in strategic technologies and keep jobs at home. 
Strengthening the Commerce Department will require a strong Secretary. Bill Daley fits that description. He has been both a civic leader and a business leader. Those of us who opposed NAFTA know him as a worthy adversary, a man who gets things done. More important, Bill Daley is a man who understands what a privilege and an honor it is to be a public servant. While it may be fashionable in some quarters to denigrate public servants, this nominee knows how effective government can change people's lives for the better. 
I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm this excellent appointment. 
Mr. President, let me emphasize once again the point made by both our distinguished chairman and distinguished colleague, Senator Durbin. The Commerce Department has got to be in this front line now of rebuilding our economic strength--a very, very important division within the Department, foreign commercial services, the International Trade Administration. The consensus, I should emphasize to my friends, that while we are spending some $600 million, in a couple of years that budget that is getting ready for the next millennium that everyone is talking about, that budget will jump to $1.5 billion. I can see some saying, `Heavens above, this is a runaway Department.' But these endeavors cost, and we want to make sure that they do a credible job, as they have been doing, in my opinion. 
We have the very strong divisions in there with respect to the Economic Development Administration that has worked extremely well over the years now, and the Department has a group of the best professionals with respect to this global competition. When the special trade representative, when the State Department and others come and try to learn the facts, it is our Department of Commerce that furnishes the weaponry, so to speak, the statistics, the findings, and everything else as to exactly where we are and how well we are doing to give them credibility in their negotiations. 
So, to have the brilliance of Bill Daley of Chicago come to head up the Department, the conscientious nature that he has already displayed with respect to taking over these duties is heartening to this particular Senator, and I am delighted to be with our distinguished chairman in endorsing his nomination.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the problem of China is most frustrating. I guess the question is, how best do we extend freedom and individual rights in a country of that kind? It is very difficult for a nation with a 220-year history to tell a culture and nation of 3,000 to 5,000 years of age what to do and how to do it, particularly a country, Mr. President, of 1.2 billion. 
If you have ever dealt with China, you understand immediately that human rights begins, first, with hunger. That is the first human right in the People's Republic. They have to feed 1.2 billion. The second human right is that of housing. The third human right is perhaps education. The fourth human right is ours--one man, one vote. If you start off on the other end of the spectrum, one man, one vote, you have chaos. I say that advisedly. 
I wish I had the time as a southern Governor, because I stand with pride--no life was lost, no one was hurt during my 4 years. I integrated, as the distinguished president pro tempore's alma mater, Clemson University, in a peaceful fashion. We have a track record. We know how you have to handle crowds and make sure no one is hurt. 
That approach to China with respect to commercialization and capitalization, I think, is going to be better than confrontation. It is good to come and say we will not trade with you unless you do A, B, and C; however, the others are going to trade with them. It is a nonstarter. It just will not work. The Germans, the French, and the Japanese are in there like gangbusters, and we cannot use that particular tool. 
The bottom line, you can look at democratic India and its approach and you can look at the People's Republic and you may reason that perhaps the People's Republic approach will extend more housing, more feeding, more education in the next 10 or 20 years than the democratic India. It is going to be interesting to follow. 
But mind you me, China is there. They feel very strongly with respect to Taiwan, to Hong Kong and those possessions that have been taken from them, and their stand has been recognized by us in our foreign policy. We have to be more realistic in its treatment. I yield the floor.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of extending the aviation ticket tax through the end of fiscal year 1997. This tax is very important to the day-to-day operation of our Nation's aviation system. Money to improve, maintain, and run our airports is 100 percent supported by fees paid by the users of the air transportation system. It is not paid for by the taxes we all pay on April 15. Every time they fly, people have been paying the user fees in the form of a ticket tax. That money has been going into the airport and airway trust fund, and the money is then disbursed through the appropriations process. We tell people to pay these fees, and we tell them we will then spend it on airports. 
However, there is one small problem. The ticket tax expired at the end of 1996. Due to budget games, the money that we thought would be in the trust fund is not there. Originally we were advised that the trust fund would be broke in July, but now it appears that it will be depleted as early as March. If this situation is not corrected, millions of dollars in airport modernization projects, aviation safety enhancements, and airport security efforts will have to be delayed or terminated. The obvious answer to this untenable situation is to reinstate the aviation ticket tax, and that is why I am cosponsoring Senator McCain's bill. I urge my fellow colleagues to quit playing budget games and start fulfilling Government's primary function--preserving the safety of the American people.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair. Let me thank my distinguished colleague from North Dakota. Senator Dorgan has been forthright and persistent on this particular score. He has given us the necessary leadership to bring truth in budgeting. 
I will never forget when we started out in this budget process back in 1973 and 1974--and I am the only remaining Member in either body, House and Senate, that still serves on that Budget Committee--the litany was all for a 10-year period and, particularly up through Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, about truth in budgeting. No more smoke and mirrors, no more rosy scenarios and those kinds of things--certainly no use of trust funds to obscure the actual size of the deficit. 
It is very easy to determine what a deficit is. All you need to do is find out what the debt is this year and then what the debt is the ensuing year, and a simple subtraction will determine for you, if you please, that the debt this past fiscal year, for 1996, was $261 billion--not $107 billion. Not $107 billion, $261 billion.

Mr. HOLLINGS. You see, by subtracting last year's debt from this year's debt, the increase of the debt over the last fiscal year gives us a deficit of $261 billion. Immediately the question is: How do we all run around claiming that we have a $107 billion deficit? The truth of the matter is that we go and borrow from other trust funds.

Mr. HOLLINGS. You will see that we had in 1995 a debt of $4.920 trillion and a gross debt in 1996 of $5.181 trillion. So the difference was $261 billion. And the reason that we listed the $107 billion is because we borrowed $66 billion from Social Security, a net of some $10 billion from Medicare, some $42 billion from the military and civilian retirement funds, banking and Treasury loans amounted to some $36 billion, for a total of $154 billion. 
Trying to put Government on a pay-as-you-go basis has been my intent since I arrived here 30 years ago. I balanced the budget in South Carolina, and as Governor I received the first AAA credit rating of any Southern State, ahead of Texas on up through Maryland. I am proud of running Government on a pay-as-you-go basis. 
I worked with George Mahon back in 1968-69, and we balanced the budget under President Lyndon Johnson. Incidentally, we did not use Social Security trust funds. Even though he changed it to the unified budget, at this particular time the use of the funds was not necessary to balance the budget. So we have to credit President Johnson with the last balanced budget we have had in that 30-year period. 
By the early 1980's, we realized that Social Security was going broke, and we came in here in a very formal fashion after a wonderful study by Alan Greenspan, the present Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. We passed the Greenspan Commission program of tax increases in order to make Social Security solvent. 
Let me go right now to the Greenspan Commission report, and you will find therein that `a majority of the members of the national commission recommends that the operations of the OASI, DI, HI, SMI, trust funds,' which is Social Security trust funds, `should be removed from the unified budget. The national commission believes that changes in Social Security programs should be made only for programmatic reasons,' and not--not--Mr. President, for balancing the budget. 
When we debated this, we increased the taxes so that we would keep Social Security solvent until the distinguished occupant of the Chair was ready to receive his amount. This particular Senator is already receiving it. I am paying into Social Security. Senator Thurmond and I are also receiving Social Security. But, Mr. President, you are not going to receive it under the Domenici balanced budget to the Constitution. They absolutely prohibit it in the wording of this particular amendment. 
Let me show you exactly what I am saying. You come right now to the resolution, S.J. Res. 1, just put in a couple days ago, and you will find:  
Total receipts shall include all receipts of the U.S. Government except those derived from borrowing. Total outlays shall include all outlays of the U.S. Government except for those for repayment of debt. 
That repeals section 13-301. And if there were any doubt about it, let us read section 1. 
Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year. 
I repeat very calmly, very clearly: `Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year--unless three-fifths of the whole Congress votes it.' 
So that means that the very intent of the Greenspan Commission, namely that surpluses be built up to protect the baby boomers into the next generation--that money, even if it were saved, even if the surplus were built up and not being expended, as is the case--that money under this particular constitutional amendment could not be expended. You would have to cut right straight across the board. And let me be specific on just exactly what the Greenspan Commission stated at that particular time. If you refer to statement 5 on page 2, they talk about for the `75-year valuation period, ending with 2056.' You can move on further. They refer to 75 years several times in the report. On page 5, statement 5, 75 years. 
They were trying to provide solvency to the year 2056. In the 75 years ending in 2056, we were going to have a solvent surplus, a redeemable Social Security trust fund. And they recommended it be put off budget, not included in the unified budget, and not expended for other matters. 
Now, let us get to that particular point about the taxes Congress voted for in 1983, because when you continue doing what we are doing now, you violate the trust. Back in 1983 we did not vote an increase in the payroll taxes for defense or for housing or for welfare or for foreign aid or for the expenses of the President or the Congress. It was a trust fund. You would have never gotten a majority vote in this national Government, in this Congress of the United States; you would have never gotten an affirmative vote, as we did in a bipartisan fashion, to increase the payroll taxes for the other instances of Government. We all pledged that that money was going into Social Security, and to make sure that the trust was maintained we voted it formally in July 1990. 
I refer, as a past chairman of the Budget Committee, to the conference report of the Committee on the Budget on the Social Security Preservation Act, dated July 10, 1990. If you see, at that particular point on page 20, there was a Hollings motion to report the Social Security Preservation Act. It passed by a vote of 20 to 1--only the distinguished Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, voted against it. All of the other present Senators voted it out at that particular time. 
Then, of course, later on the floor of the U.S. Senate we had a vote of 98 to 2. It was on October 18, 1990. A bipartisan vote of 98 Senators here said, Take Social Security and put it out as a trust fund, not a unified budget. 
It is very interesting to read in this particular Social Security Preservation Act, the language--and I want all the Members' attention to this, because this is the present chairman of the Budget Committee--I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.

Mr. HOLLINGS. I refer, on page 29, to the additional views, by Mr. Domenici, the present chairman of our Budget Committee. I quote: 
I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I support the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget deficit calculation. But I cast this vote with reservations. 
And what was his reservation? It was that my provision was not strong enough. He wanted to build a firewall. He goes on to say: 
We need a firewall around those trust funds to make sure the reserves are there to pay Social Security benefits in the next century. Without a firewall or the discipline of budget constraints, the trust funds would be unprotected and could be spent on any number of costly programs.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, he said: 
It is true that Social Security is currently running surpluses, and these surpluses offset deficit spending in the rest of the budget. 
Well, heavens above, that is what we are trying to stop. We are not trying to pass a constitutional amendment as a subterfuge to the American people. He comes now and says we, who want to protect Social Security--as he voted to do in the Budget Committee, and provided in his formal views in the Budget Committee report, and thereupon, as he did on the floor of the U.S. Senate--are using the surpluses to `offset deficit spending in the rest of the budget.' That is a gimmick. That is a subterfuge. He expresses concern because we might build up deficits for Social Security in the next century. How about our deficit to Social Security this minute? Spending $66 billion, this past year over $70-some billion, we owe Social Security this minute $570 billion and by the year 2002 we will owe it $1 trillion. 
Who is going to raise taxes $1 trillion to make Social Security solvent?

Mr. HOLLINGS. I will read just one paragraph from this report and then my statement will be complete. 
Unfortunately, the balanced budget amendment pushed by the leadership would undermine the approach to protect Social Security in promoting generational equity. Under this version of the balanced budget amendment, total Government expenditures in any year, including expenditures for Social Security benefits, could not exceed total revenues collected in the same year. The implications of this requirement for Social Security are profound. It would mean that Social Security surpluses could not be used to cover the benefit costs of the baby boom generation when it retires. The benefits for the baby boom generation would, instead, have to be financed in full by the taxes of those working in those years. The leadership version thus would eviscerate the central achievement of the Greenspan Commission. 
Mr. President, we have some 33 cosponsors to Senate Joint Resolution 1, who now want to eviscerate the Social Security protections they voted for earlier. I have counted them. The majority of these cosponsors were here in 1990 when we voted to take it off budget--the others were not here in 1990 when this vote was taken, but 33 of these cosponsors were here. 
We wrote a letter just a few years ago to Senator Dole, some five Members on this side. It was a letter dated March 1, 1995.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Look, I have cosponsored a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I voted for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. But I am not going to, by gosh, play tricks with the Social Security trust fund and repeal the law that I worked so diligently to have enacted and signed, on November 5, 1990, by George Walker Herbert Bush into law. So we said: Not one vote of Senator Hatfield from Oregon, here, Mr. Leader Dole, you can pick up five votes. 
I cannot speak for the other four this morning. I have not checked with them. But he can get the vote of this particular Senator from South Carolina, if they write the constitutional amendment so as not to violate the trust that we so formally voted into law.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there are those in public service who feel that since posterity can do nothing for them, they see no reason to do anything for posterity. They look to the next election rather than the next generation, and this is the contrary for that. 
We are not vying for the AARP or really the senior citizens. You don't get any letters on what we are talking about this morning from the AARP or any of those other seniors because they got their money. They know that surpluses are there right now. They are worried about Medicare, but they are not worried about this one. 
The youngsters, the baby boomers that we are trying to look out for, the unborn that we are looking out for now have been told they are never going to get it, so they are all running around with IRAs and all these other kinds of things totally distorting a social insurance program. 
Right to the point, and then I will sit down. We are doing this for the trust of the baby boomers, for the yet unborn in the next generation, not for the senior citizens right now. This is not a political thing for senior citizens or gimmick or tactic, as they call it in this morning's Washington Post. This is truth in budgeting and maintaining the trust that we all voted for 98 to 2.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I have, in the last few minutes, secured what I observed last evening on television by a statement by the most distinguished of distinguished Senators--there is none more responsible--the distinguished Senator from Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch. 
I now have his news release, Judiciary Committee, dated January 21, 1997. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-hollings-sc-11-19970128</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. HOLLINGS. I quote from this release. 
Hatch noted that opponents to a constitutional amendment have tried and will continue to try to divert attention from the pressing issue of controlling our Nation's debt. The fact is, contrary to the opponents' scare tactics, the balanced budget amendment would ensure the long-term stability of Social Security and other retirement investments of every American as well as long-term growth of the United States economy. 
Absolutely the contrary is the case. Absolutely the contrary is the case. You are not going to `ensure the long-term stability of Social Security' with this particular amendment. 
This is the Senator that put it into the Budget Committee back in July 1990 where we voted 20 to 1 to protect Social Security. Thereupon, on the floor of this Senate, 98 Senators--the distinguished Presiding Officer was not present at that particular time--but 98 Senators voted in the affirmative, section 13-301 of the Budget Act signed into law by President Bush. That is what section 1 and section 7 of Senate Joint Resolution 1 does--vitiate, or to use the language that I included from the particular quote, `eviscerate the intent of the Greenspan Commission.' All this, after I worked to put into the law a provision saying `Thou shalt not use Social Security trust funds to obscure the size of the deficit.' 
When you use that $107 billion deficit for last year's figure, that is exactly what you are doing. So this is not a scare tactic. 
Unfortunately, the media has picked up on the diversion because, as you can see this morning's paper here, our friend Eric Pearman here says, `President Clinton intends to raise concerns about the potential impact of the amendment on the Social Security trust fund, a tactic Democrats used last time to defeat the amendment.' 
This is no tactic. I have not talked to President Clinton about it. In a way, I do not welcome his joining in because it tries to make it a partisan issue. It was bipartisan, 98 votes of 100 in this Senate when we put into law section 13-301. It was a Republican President that signed that into law. So it was not any Democratic tactic. It is truth in budgeting. And that is what we have a difficult time with. 
You can see again in here--and I use the quote from our distinguished colleague from Utah:  
Last Congress when the amendment failed by a mere one vote of passage in the Senate, I vowed that we would be back to try and pass this amendment and put America back on the course of fiscal responsibility, 
the Senator added. 
Every one of the 55 Republicans in the Senate are original cosponsors, and we are joined by 7 strong Democrats, giving us 62 original cosponsors. If only five other Senators join us, we will have the votes necessary. If everyone keeps their promises to their constituents and votes as they said they would before the November elections, we will pass a balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, it wasn't one vote, it was five votes. And we had the five votes. We included it. I have that letter, Mr. President, for the Congressional Record. Here it is, dated March 1, 1995. We said at that particular time to Leader Dole, five Democratic Senators. It didn't fail by one vote, as they keep on saying. They had every opportunity to pass it, and they have every opportunity, I think, right at this moment to pass it. They say `If everyone keeps their promises to their constituents,' but they want to eviscerate the commitment we have made to Social Security. When they voted in 1990, that was a promise to their constituents in law. It is formalized in law, section 13301 of the Budget Act. That is what we are trying to do, keep our promises to our constituents. That is what we are doing, trying to keep our promise to the Greenspan Commission. When we raised the taxes, we didn't raise the taxes for foreign aid and welfare and food stamps. We raised the taxes for the Social Security trust fund--not for the seniors today, but as the Greenspan Commission report says, for the baby boomers in the next century. That is what we are trying to do. That is why we are having such a difficult time. 
The media is looking only at today's politics, and the seniors could not be less interested in today's politics. They are concentrating on Medicare and their health costs. They know there is a big surplus that is already built up. So they are going to get their Social Security checks. But it's the baby boomers who are now misled into IRA's and investments in the stock market and everything else, because they almost believe, to a man or woman, that they are never going to get that money. And we continue to make sure they don't get that money by passing Senate Joint Resolution 1. 
Now, I have talked to the leadership and said, `Turn it around and make certain that we can carry out the trust that we instituted into law back in 1990.' We voted for this again last year in another vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate by an overwhelming 86 votes. If we can carry out that promise to our constituents, you've got the Senator from South Carolina. 
I believe in a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I have cosponsored it. I have introduced it. I have voted for it. But not with this situation here, where having passed it into law, I am supposed to vote to repeal my own trust and repeal my own law that I worked so hard on the Budget Committee to get. 
We had a conscience in those days. We had a conscience. Now, it's all gimmickry, it's all pollster politics, unfortunately, on the floor of the National Government. Anything that is momentary, we fall. And right to the point, we are not really taking care of the needs of America. 
I was on a panel--since we have a few moments--recently of 18 distinguished Senators and myself, and the question was, how could President Clinton make his mark now in history during the next 4 years? And the conventional wisdom right across the board with this particular panel, Mr. President, was that, look, there is not going to be any honeymoon. The Democrats are after Gingrich, and Gingrich was after Gingrich. So any honeymoon would be short-lived. Very little would happen on the domestic front here in the next 4 years, just a little incremental adjustment perhaps on Medicare, a little bit on welfare. But the President's opportunity to make his mark in history was in foreign policy. They recommended--and it was a bipartisan group--what we ought to do is get computers to the third world, get technology to the emerging nations. That would make his mark in history. 
When you drive home today, go down by Foggy Bottom, as I do, by the Watergate, and you will see the homeless lying on the streets of America. You will find this city in crime. You will 
find the children on drugs. You will find that schools are down, illiteracy is up. You will find the infrastructure, roads and bridges, haven't been repaired in 20 years. And those who are lucky enough to have a job are making less than what they were making some 20 years ago. As we work on that NIH budget, the medical brains of America come with these research grants, but 80 percent of the grants which are approved go unfunded. Medical and other research is languishing in this land. And here during this 4 years, we don't have a war, inflation is down, and the deficit is coming down, to President Clinton's credit. 
The economy, generally speaking--the stock market--is strong. So this is a beautiful opportunity. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, where we had to sacrifice our economy heretofore during that 50-year period, we can now rebuild that economy. We can come in now and flesh out the meaningful programs that save us money in the long run. There is no question that only 50 percent of those on Women, Infants, and Children, Head Start, and title I for the disadvantaged are funded here at the Federal level. Rather than Goals, let's flesh out monetarily those programs; let's get revenue sharing back rather than Goals 2000; give the communities the revenue sharing to rebuild our educational system, the roadbeds of our railroads, and the infrastructure of our highways and airports. Instead, the $50 billion is going to be frittered away with pollster politics: a little here on capital gains, a little bit here for families, a little bit over here for some higher education. We can do way more on Pell grants than tax cuts for higher education. We haven't fleshed that out for those eligible. 
We have a wonderful opportunity, but instead I am afraid we are on track now to get ourselves reelected. We are using the Government to get ourselves reelected. We are not responding to the needs, and the kick-off of this particular measure is totally political--Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I will cut the spending with you. We will withhold on programs with you. We will increase taxes, if you can get some votes around here. My plan would not only reduce the deficit, it would reduce the trade deficit. 
We are not willing to pay for what we are getting. That is the truth here in America.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, first I want to thank my colleague, Senator Daschle, for introducing this legislation in the Senate. Also, I must thank Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro for taking the lead in the House in protecting mastectomy patients from new Health Management Organization [HMO] payment guidelines. Today, one in eight American women develop breast cancer, and they and their families will thank her when the bipartisan members of this Congress act to ensure that medical decisions for mastectomy patients are made by the doctors and patients involved in the case, rather than by HMO's or insurers. 
When I notified one constituent that I would help introduce legislation to guarantee women at least 48 hours of hospital coverage for mastectomies and 24 hours for lymph node removals, he asked `what have we come to when we need legislation like this?' What have we come to, indeed. 
Most Senators are not doctors, but common sense dictates that mastectomy is not generally an outpatient procedure. Not only the pain, but also the need to tend drainage tubes and the psychological shock usually require at least two days of medical care and adjustment, and often more. Unfortunately, managed care payment rules have led to cases where women are forced out of the hospital on the same day as their mastectomies, before spending a night in the hospital. 
These extreme cases are part of a nationwide reduction in hospital stays for women with breast cancer. Outpatient mastectomies have risen from less than two percent of mastectomies 5 years ago to nearly 8 percent now. Mastectomy patients overall now spend only half of the time in the hospital that they would have ten years ago--2-3 days rather than 4-6. Medical experts know that sometimes a shorter stay is appropriate or even requested by a patient who wants to get home and has access to adequate follow-up care. But we obviously need to take note of increased pressure to send women home early. Medical and personal considerations between the patient and attending physician, and not HMO financial rules, should be the determining factor. 
I am still collecting data in my home State of South Carolina, which is among the States least affected so far by HMO's. With our more personalized medicine, we have not seen the same-day discharges without an overnight stay. But South Carolina has a relatively high number of mastectomies and it appears that many South Carolina women stay 21 hours, or 23 hours in the hospital after their surgery. Again, something is wrong when patients tell me that they felt like the stay was too short, the newfound pain was still there, and the medical practitioners speak in terms of 21 or 23 hours. Obviously, this is someone's attempt to call a procedure `outpatient' by not covering 24 hours in the hospital, and it represents a more subtle affect of insurance payment rules on medicine which this Congress should consider. 
Mr. President, I will also join my colleagues, Senator D'Amato and Senator Snowe, in introducing slightly broader legislation. I am heartened that so many Senators of both parties are anxious to pass legislation in this area and I commend their bipartisanship. I invite all of my colleagues to join these efforts to make sure in this Congress that doctors and breast cancer patients, rather than insurers, determine the best length of stay in the hospital for each mastectomy case.

Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my collegue and cosponsor Senator Specter, to introduce for the sixth time a constitutional amendment to limit campaign spending. Although I commend the efforts of the Minority Leader and others seeking to statutorily reform our campaign finance laws, I am convinced the only way to solve the chronic problems surrounding campaign financing is to reverse the Supreme Court's flawed decision in Buckley versus Valeo by adopting a constitutional amendment granting Congress the right to limit campaign spending. 
We all know the score--we're hamstrung by that decision and the ever increasing cost of a competitive campaign. With the total cost for congressional elections, just general elections, skyrocketing from $403 million in 1990 to over $626 million in 1996, the need for limits on campaign expenditures is more urgent than ever. For nearly a quarter of a century, Congress has tried to tackle runaway campaign spending with bills aimed at getting around the disjointed Buckley decision. Again and again, Congress has failed. 
Let us resolve not to repeat the mistakes of past campaign finance reform efforts, which have become bogged down in partisanship as Democrats and Republicans each tried to gore the other's sacred cows. During the 103d Congress there was a sign that we could move beyond this partisan bickering, when the Senate in a bipartisan fashion expressed its support for a constitutional amendment to limit campaign expenditures. In May 1993, a non-binding sense of the Senate resolution was agreed to which advocated the adoption of a constitutional amendment empowering Congress and States to limit campaign expenditures. 
Now it is time to take the next step. We must strike the decisive blow against the anything-goes fundraising and spending tolerated by both political parties. Looking beyond the current headlines regarding the source of these funds, the massive amount of money spent is astonishing and serves only to cement the commonly held belief that our elections are nothing more than auctions and that our politicians are up for sale. It is time to put a limit on the amount of money sloshing around campaign war chests. It is time to adopt a constitutional amendment to limit campaign spending--a simple, straightforward, nonpartisan solution. 
As Prof. Gerald G. Ashdown has written in the New England Law Review, amending the Constitution to allow Congress to regulate campaign expenditures is `the most theoretically attractive of the approaches-to-reform since, from a broad free speech perspective, the decision in Buckley is misguided and has worsened the campaign finance atmosphere.' Adds Professor Ashdown: `If Congress could constitutionally limit the campaign expenditures of individuals, candidates, and committees, along with contributions, most of the troubles * * * would be eliminated.' 
Right to the point, back in 1974, Congress responded to the public's outrage over the Watergate scandals by passing, on a bipartisan basis, a comprehensive campaign finance law. The centerpiece of this reform was a limitation on campaign expenditures. Congress recognized that spending limits were the only rational alternative to a system that essentially awarded office to the highest bidder or wealthiest candidate. 
Unfortunately, the Supreme Court overturned these spending limits in its infamous Buckley versus Valeo decision of 1976. The Court mistakenly equated a candidate's right to spend unlimited sums of money with his right to free speech. In the face of spirited dissents, the Court came to the conclusion that limits on campaign contributions but not spending furthered `* * * the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption' and that this interest `outweighs considerations of free speech.' 
I have never been able to fathom why that same test--the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption--does not overwhelmingly justify limits on campaign spending. The Court made a huge mistake. The fact is, spending limits in Federal campaigns would act to restore the free speech that has been eroded by the Buckley decision. 
After all, as a practical reality, what Buckley says is: Yes, if you have a fundraising advantage or personal wealth, then you have access to television, radio, and other media and you have freedom of speech. But if you do not have a fundraising advantage or personal wealth, then you are denied access. Instead of freedom of speech, you have only the freedom to say nothing. 
So let us be done with this phony charge that spending limits are somehow an attack on freedom of speech. As Justice Byron White points out, clear as a bell, in his dissent, both contribution limits and spending limits are neutral as to the content of speech and are not motivated by fear of the consequences of the political speech in general. 
Mr. President, every Senator realizes that television advertising is the name of the game in modern American politics. In warfare, if you control the air, you control the battlefield. In politics, if you control the airwaves, you control the tenor and focus of a campaign. 
Probably 80 percent of campaign communications take place through the medium of television. And most of that TV airtime comes at a dear price. In South Carolina, you're talking between $1,000 and $2,000 for 30 seconds of primetime advertising. In New York City, it's anywhere from $30,000 to $40,000 for the same 30 seconds. 
The hard fact of life for a candidate is that if you're not on TV, you're not truly in the race. Wealthy challengers as well as incumbents flushed with money go directly to the TV studio. Those without a fundraising advantage or personal wealth are sidetracked to the time-consuming pursuit of cash. 
The Buckley decision created a double bind. It upheld restrictions on campaign contributions, but struck down restrictions on how much candidates with deep pockets can spend. The Court ignored the practical reality that if my opponent has only $50,000 to spend in a race and I have $1 million, then I can effectively deprive him of his speech. By failing to respond to my advertising, my cash-poor opponent will appear unwilling to speak up in his own defense. 
Justice Thurgood Marshall zeroed in on this disparity in his dissent to Buckley. By striking down the limit on what a candidate can spend, Justice Marshall said, `It would appear to follow that the candidate with a substantial personal fortune at his disposal is off to a significant head start.' 
Indeed, Justice Marshall went further: He argued that by upholding the limitations on contributions but striking down limits on overall spending, the Court put an additional premium on a candidate's personal wealth. 
Justice Marshall was dead right and Ross Perot and Steve Forbes have proved it. Massive spending of their personal fortunes immediately made them contenders. Our urgent task is to right the injustice of Buckley versus Valeo by empowering Congress to place caps on Federal campaign spending. We are all painfully aware of the uncontrolled escalation of campaign spending. The average cost of a winning Senate race was $1.2 million in 1980, rising to $2.9 million in 1984, and skyrocketing to $3.1 million in 1986, $3.7 million in 1988, and up to $4.3 in 1996. To raise that kind of money, the average Senator must raise over $13,800 a week, every week of his or her 6-year term. Overall spending in congressional races increased from $446 million in 1990 to more than $724 million in 1994--almost a 70 percent increase in 4 short years. I predict that when the final FEC reports are compiled for 1996, that figure will go even higher. 
This obsession with money distracts us from the people's business. It corrupts and degrades the entire political process. Fundraisers used to be arranged so they didn't conflict with the Senate schedule; nowadays, the Senate schedule is regularly shifted to accommodate fundraisers. 
I have run for statewide office 16 times in South Carolina. You establish a certain campaign routine, say, shaking hands at a mill shift in Greer, visiting a big country store outside of Belton, and so on. Over the years, they look for you and expect you to come around. But in recent years, those mill visits and dropping by the country store have become a casualty of the system. There is very little time for them. We're out chasing dollars. 
During my 1992 reelection campaign, I found myself raising money to get on TV to raise money to get on TV to raise money to get on TV. It's a vicious cycle. 
I remember Senator Richard Russell saying: `They give you a 6-year term in this U.S. Senate: 2 years to be a statesman, the next 2 years to be a politician, and the last 2 years to be a demagogue.' Regrettably, we are no longer afforded even 2 years as statesmen. We proceed straight to politics and demagoguery right after the election because of the imperatives of raising money. 
My proposed constitutional amendment would change all this. It would empower Congress to impose reasonable spending limits on Federal campaigns. For instance, we could impose a limit of, say, $800,000 per Senate candidate in a small State like South Carolina--a far 
cry from the millions spent by my opponent and me in 1992. And bear in mind that direct expenditures account for only a portion of total spending. For instance, my 1992 opponent's direct expenditures were supplemented by hundreds of thousands of dollars in expenditures by independent organizations and by the State and local Republican Party. When you total up spending from all sources, my challenger and I spent roughly the same amount in 1992. 
And incidentally, Mr. President, let's be done with the canard that spending limits would be a boon to incumbents, who supposedly already have name recognition and standing with the public and therefore begin with a built-in advantage over challengers. Nonsense. I hardly need to remind my Senate colleagues of the high rate of mortality in upper chamber elections. And as to the alleged invulnerability of incumbents in the House, I would simply note that well over 50 percent of the House membership has been replaced since the 1990 elections and just 3 weeks ago we swore in 15 new Senators. 
I can tell you from experience that any advantages of incumbency are more than counterbalanced by the obvious disadvantages of incumbency, specifically the disadvantage of defending hundreds of controversial votes in Congress. 
Moreover, Mr. President, I submit that once we have overall spending limits, it will matter little whether a candidate gets money from industry groups, or from PAC's, or from individuals. It is still a reasonable amount any way you cut it. Spending will be under control, and we will be able to account for every dollar going out. 
On the issue of PAC's, Mr. President, let me say that I have never believed that PAC's per se are an evil in the current system. On the contrary, PAC's are a very healthy instrumentality of politics. PAC's have brought people into the political process: nurses, educators, small business people, senior citizens, unionists, you name it. They permit people of modest means and limited individual influence to band together with others of mutual interest so their message is heard and known. 
For years we have encouraged these people to get involved, to participate. Yet now that they are participating, we turn around and say, `Oh, no; your influence is corrupting, your money is tainted'. This is wrong. The evil to be corrected is not the abundance of participation but the superabundance of money. The culprit is runaway campaign spending. 
To a distressing degree, elections are determined not in the political marketplace but in the financial marketplace. Our elections are supposed to be contests of ideas, but too often they degenerate into megadollar derbies, paper chases through the board rooms of corporations and special interests. 
Mr. President, I repeat, campaign spending must be brought under control. The constitutional amendment Senator Specter and I have proposed would permit Congress to impose fair, responsible, workable limits on Federal campaign expenditures and allow States to do the same with regard to State and local elections. 
Such a reform would have four important impacts. First, it would end the mindless pursuits of ever-fatter campaign war chests. Second, it would free candidates from their current obsession with fundraising and allow them to focus more on issues and ideas; once elected to office, we wouldn't have to spend 20 percent of our time raising money to keep our seats. Third, it would curb the influence of special interests. And fourth, it would create a more level playing field for our Federal campaigns--a competitive environment where personal wealth does not give candidates an insurmountable advantage. 
Finally, Mr. President, a word about the advantages of the amend-the-Constitution approach that I propose. Recent history amply demonstrates the practicality and viability of this constitutional route. Certainly, it is not coincidence that five of the last seven amendments to the Constitution have dealt with Federal election issues. In elections, the process drives and shapes the end result. Election laws can skew election results, whether you're talking about a poll tax depriving minorities of their right to vote, or the absence of campaign spending limits giving an unfair advantage to wealthy candidates. These are profound issues which go to the heart of our democracy, and it is entirely appropriate that they be addressed through a constitutional amendment. 
And let's not be distracted by the argument that the amend-the-Constitution approach will take too long. Take too long? We have been dithering on this campaign finance issue since the early 1970's, and we haven't advanced the ball a single yard. All-the-while the Supreme Court continues to strike down campaign limit after campaign limit. It has been a quarter of a century, and no legislative solution has done the job. 
Except for the 27th amendment, the last five constitutional amendments took an average of 17 months to be adopted. There is no reason why we cannot pass this joint resolution, submit it to the States for a vote, and ratify the amendment in time for it to govern the 1998 election. Once passed by the Congress, the Joint Resolution goes directly to the States for ratification. Once ratified, it becomes the law of the land, and it is a Supreme Court challenge. 
And, by the way, I reject the argument that if we were to pass and ratify this amendment, Democrats and Republicans would be unable to hammer out a mutually acceptable formula of campaign expenditure limits. A Democratic Congress and Republican President did exactly that in 1974, and we can certainly do it again. 
Mr. President, this amendment will address the campaign finance mess directly, decisively, and with finality. The Supreme Court has chosen to ignore the overwhelming importance of media advertising in today's campaigns. In the Buckley decision, it prescribed a bogus if-you-have-the-money-you-can-talk version of free speech. In its place, I urge the Congress to move beyond these acrobatic attempts at legislating around the Buckley decision. As we have all seen, no matter how sincere, these plans are doomed to fail. The solution rests in fixing the Buckley decision. It is my hope that as the campaign financing debate unfolds, the Majority Leader will provide us with an opportunity to vote on this resolution--it is the only solution.

 Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on the Appropriations Committee we have always prided ourselves for having the best and most professional staff in the Senate. We maintain a team of staff who are experts on budget and finance and a group of professionals who know these agency programs inside and out. In a few days we will be losing one of our very best staff members to have ever served this body. Proctor Jones, the minority staff director for the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee will be retiring from the Senate to take a position in the private sector. 
Proctor Jones hails from Twin City, GA. He came to the Senate way back in 1960 as a special assistant to one of the greatest legislators to ever serve this institution, Senator Richard B. Russell. At that time Senator Russell was chairman of the Armed Services Committee and Proctor served as a special assistant working on military issues. From 1966 to 1968, Proctor took a leave of absence and served on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps. In 1968, Proctor returned to the Senate and was assigned by Chairman Russell to work on the Appropriations Committee. In 1971, he was assigned to what was then known as the Subcommittee on Labor--Health, Education and Welfare. So, Proctor Jones and I have something in common. We both were close to Senator Richard B. Russell and considered him to be our mentor, and, like Proctor, Senator Russell also advised me that the only committee to be on is the Appropriations Committee. 
In 1973, Proctor took over as staff director for the Subcommittee on Public Works for Water and Power Development, and Atomic Energy Commission and Related Agencies. In 1978, this subcommittee was given its current name, Energy and Water Development. Since that time Proctor has served as staff director or minority staff director of that subcommittee. Simply put, Proctor Jones has been the Senate's go-to man on issues regarding Army Corps of Engineers' civil works, defense nuclear weapons development and environmental cleanup, scientific research, power marketing administrations, and other energy issues. Whether it was the Appalachian Regional Commission or biomedical research, the Members of the Senate could trust Proctor Jones to understand the impact that the energy and water development bill had in their States. Proctor understood that these programs affected real people, communities, and institutions. 
Of course, it is difficult to speak about Proctor Joines without also referring to Senator J. Bennett Johnston. In 1978, Senator Johnston took over as chairman of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee. I am a member of that subcommittee. I can tell you that Senator Johnston and Proctor Jones have made an unbeatable team. They really mastered that bill and have run it in a straightforward and fair manner. 
Mr. President, we do not acknowledge often enough the staff people who make this institution run day in and day out. In Proctor Jones we have had a superb individual who has dedicated over three decades to this Senate. I, for one, would like to express my appreciation for his hard work and his outstanding record. I wish him well and thank him for a job well done.
