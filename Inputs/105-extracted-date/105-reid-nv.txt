 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to the outstanding achievements of a Nevadan who has dedicated himself to helping individuals who often lack the means to help themselves. Dana Taschner has achieved national recognition as a champion for victims of domestic violence and civil rights abuses. He is a 38 year-old lawyer from Reno who chooses cases that are relatively small-scale, but representative of many of the problems facing Americans. Time and again, Mr. Taschner has had the courage and initiative to take on cases that more prominent firms are hesitant to handle for political or monetary reasons. Dana Taschner truly brings honor to his profession. 
Mr. Taschner's devotion to fighting oppression recently earned him the American Bar Association's Lawyer of the Year award. He was chosen from a pool of approximately 245,000 other lawyers in North America, competing with litigators with much higher profiles and greater wealth. In 1993, Mr. Taschner took on the Los Angeles Police Department and succeeded in forcing them to change their policy regarding police officers who commit domestic violence. In this case, he represented 3 orphans whose father, an L.A. police officer, murdered their mother and then took his own life. Taschner was able to overcome his own painful childhood memories of domestic abuse and secure the orphans a settlement. He argued that the department should not have returned the officer's gun after he had beaten his wife and threatened to kill her. He also forced the department to treat these matters as criminal cases, rather than internal affairs. 
In this era of cynicism and self-promotion, I believe we must take steps to encourage and reward sincerity. Dana Taschner's unwavering dedication to his clients can be seen in his personal relationships with them, relationships that often outlive the outcome of the case. As an attorney myself, I have seen firsthand how much our country needs people in my field who care enough about their clients to commit themselves personally, as well as professionally. Many litigators find it much easier to take the cases that bring financial gain, rather than attempting to help the true victims of injustice. 
I am proud that his colleagues have lavished accolades upon Mr. Taschner, but I believe it is a much greater sign of his success that his clients put their faith in him. Dana Taschner, whose integrity and selfless devotion to fairness truly embody our American justice system, is a role model for us all.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Nevadan, my friend and former colleague, Judge Jan Smith. At the age of seventy-one, after years of service as Justice of the Peace for the Jean-Good Springs community, Judge Smith will retire from the bench next year. I want to take this opportunity pay tribute to Jan for her efforts to improve the lives of so many Americans, because her accomplishments have helped us all. 
I have been fortunate enough to be a first hand witness to some of Jan's incredible achievements. I have watched her rise from legal aide and working mother in the early nineteen sixties to become one of Nevada's most influential judicial officers. 
After toiling away as a legal secretary for a District Attorney and a county judge, Jan became deeply involved with a variety of grass roots causes. She was one of the first women in the state to be an advocate on behalf of the environment. In the city of Henderson, she canvassed neighborhoods and city hall to prevent industry from inflicting permanent damage to the environment. As a mother of six, she was insightful enough to take action so that her children could grow up with an ample supply of clean air and water. 
Judge Smith was also a champion for the underprivileged. She worked tirelessly to create opportunities for the poor and disadvantage in Nevada. Like many of her contemporaries, she marched on behalf of women and children who needed a `hand-up', rather than a donation or handout. 
When I served as Nevada's Lt. Governor, I began working closely with Jan when she was chosen to run the Southern Nevada office of then Governor Mike O'Callahan. Savvy and determined, she made an impression on everyone she worked with throughout those six years. Much of her success on the job came from her staunch work ethic and strong ties to both her family and the community. 
The people of Nevada were truly fortunate to have Judge Smith come out of semi retirement to accept an appointment as a Justice of the Peace for the Jean-Good Springs district. She single-handedly reorganized the court so that it eventually became a model of fairness and efficiency. She has subsequently been reelected with overwhelming community support. 
Judge Smith is one of the unsung heroes of the American justice system. Like many of our nation's Justice of the Peace Officers, she does not typically preside over big dollar, high drama cases. However, those like Judge Smith are the representatives of our legal system most likely to come in contact with everyday Americans. Professionals like Jan do more to preside over basic public safety issues because they handle the difficult events that are all too common in communities across the country--drunk driving and domestic violence. Essentially, Jan's career has required her or exercise judgement and make tough decisions that have lasting impact. 
Judge Jan Smith truly believes in the law, as a fellow officer of the court and United States Senator, I have relied upon on Judge Smith's trademark intelligence and honesty, as well as her ability to astutely assess the character and behavior of the many Nevadans who visit her court. 
Much of my admiration for Judge Smith stems from her enduring commitment to people of the Silver State. Her values are reflected not only in the way she lives her life, but in the many organizations she has served over the past thirty years. Judge Smith's lifetime of achievement is truly an inspiration, and she serves as an incredible role model for judicial prudence, legal acumen, and personal integrity.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce today the release of findings from an important environmental conference held in my home State this summer. RENOX '98 gathered together experts from across the country to focus on the issue of oxides of nitrogen (NOX) pollution. NOX is a hazardous pollutant that is produced primarily by internal combustion engines and power generation boilers and furnaces. 
In 1996, more than 23 million tons of NOX were released into the atmosphere in the U.S. alone. NOX is a key component in the formation of ground-level ozone and urban smog. The health effects of ground-level ozone are well-documented. It contributes to respiratory diseases that cause premature death. It is harmful to children who play actively outdoors and damages agricultural crops and natural vegetation. 
RENOX '98 explored all of these effects and identified strategies and solution for the control of NOX pollution. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has some NOX reduction programs under way in both the transportation and power generation sectors. However, one of the messages of RENOX '98 is that more needs to be done and it needs to be done more quickly if we are to make our cities more livable for children and the elderly, who are the most vulnerable to the effects of NOX emissions. 
For these reasons, I hope that all Members of the Senate and their staff will take some time to read the copy of the RENOX '98 proceedings that was mailed to each office last week. After reading it, I believe you will see the urgency of this issue. I know the Gunnerman Foundation, the lead sponsor of RENOX '98 intends to aggressively pursue legislation and policy changes that will make NOX emissions reductions a higher national priority. Dr. Jack Gibbons, formerly Science Advisory to the President and one of the keynote speakers and RENOX '98, said: `We must move the NOX problem, which has languished, toward the front of the line.' 
This is an issue worthy of our attention and I urge you to give it a closer look.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the distinct honors I have had is joining with the senior Senator from Maine in legislation that passed unanimously in this body and passed by an overwhelming margin in the House. It was an amendment we placed in the Treasury-Postal Service bill. It was a bill that we had introduced on the floor. 
On this occasion, we decided to limit it just to Federal employees, which we did. We were elated that we were able to make great strides on this issue about which we felt so strongly. And we were contemplating the day when this bill would be signed and become law, because certainly it should. It passed over here unanimously; passed the House by an overwhelming margin. 
I cannot speak for my colleague from Maine, but I am sure she feels just as disappointed as I am that this bill was stripped during the conference of the Treasury-Postal Service bill for really no reason. There was no debate among the conferees. It was just taken from the bill. 
It would be easy for me to be partisan here and say this is some cabal by the Republicans. The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, this bill had bipartisan support. It was not a Democratic bill; it was not a Democratic amendment. It was not a Republican bill, a Republican amendment. 
So I am here to complain about the process. This should not have happened. I am not going to point fingers as to why it happened, but it happened. I am tremendously disappointed. 
What am I talking about? I am talking about a bill that the senior Senator from Maine and I have been working on for over a year, a bill that has 35 cosponsors in the Senate. It is a bill that recognizes that each year in this country there are 3.6 million unintended pregnancies. Forty-four percent of those pregnancies wind up with abortion. We find that insurance companies' health care providers routinely pay for abortions, vasectomies, tubal ligations, 
but they don't pay for the simple contraceptives that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration. There are only five. They don't pay for them. 
We are saying it should be done. Women pay almost 70 percent more for health care than men. It seems unusual that when Viagra came out there was a mad rush to make sure that there was insurance coverage and every other kind of coverage for Viagra. We said at that time, the Senator from Maine and I, shouldn't we recognize the fact that women pay more, that insurance companies and health maintenance agencies do not pay for contraceptives and they should? We would save huge amounts of money. We would have healthier mothers and healthier babies. But it doesn't appear we are going to have it this year. 
Our bill, called the Prescription Contraceptive Fairness Act, would apply this to Federal health care plans. There are 374 different health care plans under the Federal system that would cover these pills or the other four devices. It would save money. 
It was killed in conference based upon some illusion that it had something to do with abortion. It has nothing to do with abortion. In fact, it would cut down on abortions. We are not forcing anyone to use contraceptives if they don't want to. We think they should be made available. 
I was on a talk show. A woman called in and said, `I'm pregnant with our third child. I'm a diabetic. I would prefer I were not pregnant. I'm going to carry the baby to term but it could endanger my health. I hope the baby is healthy. My husband's insurance company does not cover contraceptives, and as a result of that, I'm pregnant because the stuff we used doesn't work very well.' There are a multitude of stories just like this. Remember, there are 3.6 million unintended pregnancies in our country every year. Not every 10 years--every year. 
I am embarrassed this was stripped from the bill for some reason that is not justifiable. The Federal Government serves as a role model for other employers across the Nation. This would have been a great start. It has received support from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. We have received little static from the insurance companies. Why? It creates an even playing field. If they all have to do the same thing, it doesn't hurt anyone. In the long run, people in the plans would save money. 
Individuals who led the effort to strip this historic amendment from this Treasury-Postal Service bill are ignoring the will of both the House and the Senate. The House voted in favor of this amendment in July; the Senate accepted our amendment in July, also. I don't think it is fair. I think these individuals who feel they have the authority to ignore the decision already made in both Houses should consider why they did this. They had no good reason to do it. It has nothing to do with abortion, which is supposedly the reason it was done. 
Politics aside, the real losers in this battle are the 1.2 million women covered under the FEHBP system who will continue to be denied the quality in health care coverage they deserve. People who fought behind closed doors to strip this amendment from the bill are using the anti-abortion statement as a defense. That is wrong. They shouldn't do that. This argument is unfounded. 
As I said, this bill would lead to healthier mothers, healthier babies, and lower health care costs for all Americans. This legislation doesn't require any woman to use contraceptives, but it gives them a choice. 
I see my colleague on the floor. It has been an honor for me to work with her on this legislation. She has been the driving force in getting this legislation to the point we thought we were. 
I will yield the floor.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator Kohl, in introducing the `Long Term Care Patient Protection Act of 1998'. This legislation represents our latest step in a series of efforts to institute greater protections for nursing home residents. 
Over the past year, Senator Kohl and I, along with our colleagues on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, have worked to ensure that seniors are not placed in the hands of criminals in nursing homes. The disturbing problem of nursing home abuse by workers with a violent or criminal history was brought to our attention just over a year ago. Shortly thereafter, Senator Kohl, Grassley, and I introduced S. 1122, `The Patient Abuse Prevention Act.' This measure would require criminal background checks for potential long-term care facility workers and would create a national registry of abusive health care workers. 
This past July, Senator Kohl and I sponsored an amendment that would authorize nursing homes and home health agencies to use the FBI criminal background check system. This amendment is an important step towards our goal of mandatory background checks, and I am proud to report that this language was included in the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Bill. 
Upon our request, the Senate Special Committee and Aging dedicated a hearing to the issue of criminal background checks for long-term care workers. At this time, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) at the Department of Health and Human Services released a report entitling, `Safeguarding Long Term Care Residents'. The year-long investigation by the OIG spanning facilities across the country produced the very recommendations Senator Kohl and I have been advocating for over a year. Specifically, the OIG concurred with our proposal to develop criminal background checks, and to create a national registry for nursing facility employees. Their findings were consistent with our position that a criminal background check system could help weed out potential employees with a history of abuse and prevent them from working with patients. 
Recently, President Clinton acknowledged the need for tough legislative and administrative actions to improve the quality of nursing homes. Using our original legislation as a guide, the Administration drafted a proposal to address the crucial issue of criminal background checks for nursing home workers. I am pleased that the Administration has recognized the need for criminal background checks and has modeled its initiative after our legislation. I am introducing the `Long-Term Care Patient Protection Act of 1998' on behalf of the Administration because it builds on our extensive work in this area and represents an important step in the right direction. 
The `Long-Term Care Patient Protection Act of 1998' would create a national registry of abusive workers. Further, the bill would expand the existing State nurse aide registries to include substantiated findings of abuse by all nursing facility employees, not just nurse aides. States would be required to submit any existing or newly acquired information contained in the State registries to the national registry of abusive workers. This provision is crucial because it would ensure that once an employee is added to the national registry, the offender will not be able to simply cross state lines and find employment in another nursing home where he may continue to prey on vulnerable seniors. 
Another important portion of the bill outlines the process by which nursing homes must screen prospective employees. According to this legislation, all nursing homes must first initiate a search of the national registry of abusive workers. In cases where the prospective employee is not listed on the registry, the nursing home would be required to conduct a State and national criminal background check on the individual through the Federal Bureau of Investigations. 
Finally, nursing homes would be required to report to the State any instance in which the facility determines that an employee has committee an act of resident neglect, abuse, or theft of a resident's property during the course of employment. The OIG at the Department of Health and Human Services reported that 46 percent of facilities believe that incidents of abuse are under-reported. This provision would ensure that offenders are reported and added to the national registry before they have the opportunity to strike again. 
One of the most difficult times for any individual or family is when they must make the decision to rely upon the support and services of a long-term care facility. Families should not have to live with the fear that their loved one is being left in the hands of an individual with a criminal record. No one should have to endure the pain and outrage of learning that their loved one has fallen prey to a nursing home employee with a violent or criminal record. At last month's Aging Committee hearing, we heard the real life nightmare of Richard Meyer, whose 92 year-old mother was sexually assaulted by a male certified nursing assistant who had previously been charged and convicted for sexually assaulting a young girl. We can and we must work to prevent tragedies like this one from occurring again in the future. 
Americans over the age of 85 are the fastest growing segment of our elderly population. There are 31.6 million Americans over the age of sixty-five, and as the baby boom generation ages, that number will skyrocket. Over 43 percent of Americans will likely spend time in a nursing home. As our nation seeks ways to care for an aging population, we must establish greater protections to ensure that our seniors will receive the best care possible. 
I have visited countless nursing homes in my home state of Nevada. During these visits, I have always been impressed by the compassion and dedication of the staff. Most nurse aides and health care workers are professional, honest, and dedicated. Unfortunately, it only takes one abusive staff member to terrorize the lives of the residents. That is why we must work to wed our the `bad apples' who do not have the best interest of the patient in mind. I urge you join Senator Kohl and me in our efforts to provide greater protections for all nursing home residents.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, Clark County has seen phenomenal growth over the past ten years, and is the fastest growing county in the nation. This influx of new residents has put great pressure on the infrastructure of the region, and also the recreational assets. While no one thing can solve all the problems associated with the burgeoning growth rate that has occurred, we can take steps to control and manage it. The Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act has a long history and can trace its genesis back to Congressman Jim Santini, author of the Santini-Burton Act. Former Congressman Jim Bilbray continued this initiative with the public lands task force, a process which Senator Bryan and I continued. It is from these efforts that the bill before us has evolved, with the input of Congressmen Gibbons and Ensign. 
This bill takes important steps by providing for the orderly disposal of public lands in southern Nevada, providing for the acquisition of environmentally sensitive lands in the state, and providing a mechanism for local governments to offset the costs associated with development of disposed federal lands. The distribution of the proceeds from federal land sales will give the federal government 85% for the acquisition of environmentally sensitive lands in Nevada. The State will use its 5% share for general education programs, while the remaining 10% will benefit the Las Vegas Valley water treatment programs, water infrastructure development, parks, and trails. 
Mr. President, as we approach the 21st century, we have to be cognizant of our future generations and the legacy that we will leave them. Any growth that occurs in a community must have coordinated planning and this measure will greatly assist with this process by providing for local government involvement. It allows state, county and city governments to manage the costs associated with the development of these lands by adding to the state education fund, as well as assisting with the future development of the southern Nevada water system and airport infrastructure. It will also assist us in protecting and preserving wild and scenic places for future generations, which are of value not just to the residents of Clark County, but to all taxpayers. 
This bill has the bipartisan support of the Nevada Congressional delegation, enjoys broad-based support in Clark County, and support throughout the State. It means a great deal to me personally and I believe it will be of enormous benefit to the State of Nevada.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, this last week the Conference on the Energy and Water Development Appropriations concluded and has provided $21,332,135 for the programs, projects and activities of the Department of Energy, Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and other independent agencies. I would like to say that I generally support the Conference Report which Chairman Domenici recommend to the Senate today. 
Just as a balanced bill cannot accommodate all the priorities and projects of Members of Congress, neither could this conference report. Nevertheless, it is because of the scope of this bill, providing vital services of the Department of Energy and the many water projects around the nation that the Senate needs to support the Conference Report. 
For instance, the Department of Energy's breadth of responsibilities range from activities in nonproliferation to fissile materials disposition and from the projects in solar and renewable resources to the clean up of defense facilities such as Savannah River, Oak Ridge and Hanford. 
Specifically, in the Defense part of the bill, we were told that the Stockpile Stewardship Management, the program that provides safety and reliability of the nuclear stockpile, needed $4.5 billion, yet even as we are providing it $4.4 billion we are increasing our oversight of construction projects to prevent waste and mismanagement. Without the Stockpile Stewardship program we would not have the ability to be able to verify to the President that the nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable and we would be living under continued testing of nuclear weapons. 
In the Nondefense work at the Department of Energy, the Office of Science (formerly known as Energy Research) has facilitated many projects in science that will have practical impacts on the future of our society including the treatment of cancer, the isolation of diseased genes, and the tracing of contaminants in soils. I would note the vast research effort being made in the Fusion Energy Sciences. The Department has tried to cover its bases by funding different types of fusion energy research, but it eventually will have to make choices to focus on the most feasible technologies and the Conferees have provided this research almost $230 million. 
We, as a subcommittee and Conference, were placed in an impossible dilemma regarding the funding of water projects and, in particular, the construction projects of the Corps of Engineers. The Conferees recognize the value of the civil works program in protecting lives and property throughout the United States and in preserving commercial trade in our ports and harbors; but we simply were not given the funds to reflect the importance of the Corps projects. Consequently, while the Conferees provided $1.429 billion in Corps Construction, there were many construction projects that could not receive the funding that they needed. This is unfortunate since the Corps has many projects around the United States that will now be hindered by uncertain schedules and planning that may become useless. On the other hand, projects such as the Chicago Shoreline, the Kill Van Kull Channel in New York and New Jersey, Charleston Harbor and Virginia Beach, among many others, were able to receive enough to address their emergency circumstances. The dredging of the ports and harbors along both the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines as well as the harbors in the Gulf of Mexico is no small task and responsibility for the Corps. On an annual basis, the U.S. ports and harbors handle an estimated $600 billion in international cargo generating over $150 billion in tax revenue. There are small navigation projects totaling $6 million; but there are larger projects that require an even greater commitment. It is unfortunate that, because of the funding dilemmas that we faced, water projects that are vital to communities and industries around the nation will now be stalled and mired in uncertainty. The administration should take note of the many criticisms of the budget request for the Army Corps of Engineers and recognize the essential role it has throughout the nation. 
Another major agency under the jurisdiction of this appropriation is the Bureau of Reclamation, whose historical responsibility to manage the precious waters in the West extends back to the Newland Project in Nevada. I will not subscribe to any notion that the Bureau is obsolete or unneeded and will oppose any effort to minimize the Bureau's role in water preservation. It's responsibility of reclaiming water and reusing it in communities is as needed now as ever. In the first half of the century, dams were built in managing the water systems, now we must be focusing on other reuse methods like desalination systems. 
Throughout the arid West the Bureau has assisted in the use and management of water and has even facilitated the cooperation of community interests such as the CALFED Bay Delta Project in California which received $75 million to continue its management of the Delta system which means that agriculture, environmental, and industry are cooperating in unprecedented ways. There are reclamation and water supply projects from Arizona to Idaho and from Washington to New Mexico. The communities benefit from new sources of water such as the community in Montana that will no longer have to haul their water for miles in pickup trucks so that their homes can have water. This was the goal of the Bureau of Reclamation when it was founded: to provide the homes and communities throughout the West with water and it remains the goal today. 
Mr. President, this conference report does not satisfy everybody, nor does it do justice to the many water projects that need our support, but it is the best the conference could arrive at with the funding allocations that we were given. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to support this Conference Report. And I thank the staff of the Energy and Water Subcommittee for their hard work and diligence throughout the process: Alex Flint, David Gwaltney, Gregory Daines, Lashwanda Leftwich, Elizabeth Blevins and Bob Perret on my personal staff.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation which will help alleviate a tax burden for senior citizens with modest incomes. 
Until 1984, Federal taxes were not imposed on social security benefits. People pay taxes their whole working life for social security benefits and I do not believe that these payments should be taxed when they retire. 
This legislation will help those single persons, widows and widowers with moderate incomes to keep more of their own money in their own pockets. When you responsibly plan for your retirement, you should be able to count on your government to meet its obligations under the contract you've made with social security. 
Under current law, there is first, a calculation to determine whether any of your social security benefits are taxable. The base amount is $25,000 for singles and $32,000 for married persons. This base amount is figured by taking one-half of your social security benefits and adding in your other income. If you are single and the result is under $25,000, you don't pay taxes on your social security benefit. If the amount is over this base amount, then a further calculation is done to figure what portion of your social security benefit is taxable. 
This further calculation determines how much of a person's benefit is taxed and the answer depends on the total amount of a person's social security benefit and their other income. Right now, if the total of one-half of your benefits and all your other income is more than $34,000 for a single person and $44,000 for married persons, up to 85% of your benefits could be taxable. My legislation increases the single amount to $44,000. 
Let me give you an example of the effect my law would have. A widow has $37,000 total income consisting of $10,000 in social security benefits and $27,000 in other income. So for this widow, she adds half of her social security benefit which is $5,000 and her other income of $27,000 for a total of $32,000. Under the current law, since she has over $25,000 total income, she does the next calculation. The result is that she has to include $3,500 of her social security benefits in her adjusted gross income. Under my legislation, none of her social security benefits would be taxable. 
While I realize that this may be considered a small step in removing an unfair tax burden, it is also an important first step to those seniors who have made America the greatest country in the world. I encourage the committee to give favorable consideration to our legislation.

Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota and I have been wondering for a couple of years. We have offered legislation time and time again to have the Federal Reserve System audited, like every other Government entity in this country. But no. In fact, we asked for a General Accounting Office study to find out a little bit about the inner workings of the Federal Reserve System, and we found, among other things, they have what we refer to as a `slush fund,' what they refer to as a `rainy day fund' that they have kept there for 80 years, or thereabouts, 70-some-odd years. It is billions of dollars that they just keep there. 
That money, we believe, should be taken out of the Federal Reserve System and applied toward the deficit to take down the debt that we owe. But no, they keep hanging on to that money year after year. 
I appreciate, very much, this amendment having been offered by the Senator from Iowa, because, if nothing else, it allows me the opportunity to ask the Senator from Iowa a question: Shouldn't we audit the Federal Reserve System? The American public thinks so, but here the message is without response. We cannot get people to support us on that.

Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Iowa, I do not think the Senator from Iowa realizes, in the GAO report we also found that the governors of the Federal Reserve System, some of them fly first class, some of them fly whatever class they want. We found the most interesting things there, how they have no rules or guidance, how they travel, how their expenses are determined. 
I recommend to my friend from Iowa, and everyone within the sound of our voices, that we need to take a better look at the Federal Reserve System. I commend and applaud the Senator from Iowa for bringing this amendment here today because it gives us a chance to focus, as you have said, on a creature we created. Congress created this. And we have statements here: `Hey, we can't suggest to the Federal Reserve System because it might hurt us internationally.' Congress created the Federal Reserve System. Can't we do a little bit about it, for example, to see how they spend their money? The answer to this point is no.

Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Utah through the Senator from Iowa that I think this is something that really deserves a debate. I hope that when our bill is offered on a subsequent occasion that the Banking Committee will at least give us a hearing on this. 
I say to my friend from Utah, yes, there is a document that they call an audit, but it is a self-audit. You cannot audit yourself. That is, in effect, what has happened. We think there should be oversight by the Congress of the United States which created the Federal Reserve System. They shouldn't be able to hire whoever they want to look at their books. They may do a great job, but from a perception standpoint it doesn't look great. 
When the General Accounting Office tried to get the information requested by the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from North Dakota, it was extremely difficult to get. The Federal Reserve System is an island to itself. They don't like to be messed with, bothered, or give information.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to call the attention of my colleagues to a subject that many of us, especially men, do not like to discuss publicly--prostate cancer. However, as one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in the country, prostate cancer is a subject that we cannot afford to ignore. 
In my home state of Nevada, it is estimated that 1,100 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year alone. Nationwide, 200,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1998. This deadly disease will take the lives of 40,000 American men this year alone. Prostate cancer kills as many Americans yearly as AIDS or breast cancer. 
The increase in regular screenings for prostate cancer over the past few years is encouraging. Last year, I had the opportunity to participate in the Senate Special Committee on Aging's hearing on prostate cancer. Nevada's Governor Bob Miller, along with former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, NFL Hall of Famer Len Dawson and General Manager of the New York Yankees, Bob Watson all testified about their personal experiences with prostate cancer. These men shared a common message that was clear and urgent: get tested for prostate cancer as early as possible, because early detection increases survival rates tremendously. 
While the importance of early detection through regular screenings cannot be overstated, we can and we must do more. In each of the last two fiscal years, Congress has appropriated $40 million for new, cutting-edge peer-reviewed research at the Department of Defense. In instituting the program, the DOD found it necessary to combine the funds from both years to meet the needs of the grant proposals received in the first cycle. Consequently, the President announced the first cycle of prostate cancer research grants--releasing $60 million in June and July for peer-reviewed research. 
In this year's Defense Appropriations Bill, we have provided $40 million for prostate cancer research. The House bill has only allocated $10 million for this purpose. These numbers fall short of what is needed to fund crucial research initiatives. I hope that when the Defense Appropriations Bill is in Conference this week, funding levels for prostate cancer research will be increased. Without adequate resources, promising research into causes and treatments for prostate cancer will go unfunded. For lack of research, millions of men and their families will face critical unanswered questions about screening, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and cures for prostate cancer. 
Yesterday, 110 American men died of prostate cancer. That same number will die today, tomorrow, and every day until research identifies a cure. I hope that my colleagues will make more funds available for the prostate cancer research program at the Department of Defense so that we may offer hope to the millions affected by this deadly disease.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Hispanic Americans, as we begin to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. Events will occur throughout the Nation during this month--which extends from September 15th to October 15th--to applaud the achievements of Hispanics everywhere. 
The diverse contributions of Hispanics to society, culture, academics, and the economy of our Nation have greatly enriched America. For example, the first two Hispanic Americans to win the Nobel Prize, biochemist Severo Ochoa and physicist Luis Alvarez, in their gain of worldwide acclaim, added to America's greatness in their respective fields. Dr. Ochoa of New York, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1959 for his discovery of ribonucleic acid (RNA). According to a New York Times article of November 3, 1993, Dr. Arthur Kornberg shared the Nobel Prize with Dr. Ochoa and said upon his death that Dr. Ochoa was `a fine teacher, a person of great enthusiasm and optimism.' The Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Dr. Alvarez in 1968 for discovering a subatomic particle that can exist for only fraction of a second. He was born in California and later died in Berkeley, California in 1968. 
Another great American, Franklin Chang-Diaz, became the first Hispanic American in space when he flew on a 1986 space shuttle Columbia mission. Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic female astronaut when NASA selected her for that duty in 1990, after receiving her Masters and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University. These Americans have presented themselves as ideal role models for other Hispanic Americans aspiring to excel in science and technical fields. 
Our country's Armed Forces have also been proud to have Hispanics serve to protect America's freedom and liberty. The U.S. Congressional Medal of Honor Society has so far presented 38 Hispanic Americans with the distinguished Medal of Honor for their valor and great bravery. Without the integrity and spirit exemplified by these individuals, Americans everywhere would be facing a less secure world. Latinos have been with us through the Revolution, expansion to the West, and every conflict we have faced as a Nation; more than 400,000 Hispanics served the U.S. during World War II, and nearly 25,000 served during the Persian Gulf War. 
The leadership of this country is augmented by the voices of our Hispanic elected officials, many who have joined forces in the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. The Caucus has been working very hard to advance relevant legislation and educate their colleagues about the needs of the Hispanic community. As we review Congressional history, we discover that the first Latino to serve in Congress, Joseph Marion Hernandez, entered our halls as a Delegate from Florida in 1822. Our body welcomed Octaviano Larrazolo as the first Hispanic U.S. Senator in 1928. Currently, I am honored to have the only Hispanic Chief of Staff in the U.S. Senate, my good friend Reynaldo Martinez. I feel that we should see more of these success stories as we reach the next millennium. 
In the state of Nevada, Hispanics have shown their influence in all areas, especially in education, business, and politics. Nevada continues to be the fastest-growing state in the Nation, and Nevada's Hispanics have increased from 124,408 people out of 1.2 million in 1990, to 253,329 people out of 1.7 million in 1997, according to Census Bureau figures released last week. This is a large increase from 10.4 percent of the state population in 1990 to 15.1 percent in 1997. 
Hispanics have been the largest minority in Nevada for years and will become the largest minority in the rest of the country in 2005. Overall in the U.S., Hispanics number more than 30 million people. Along with some of my colleagues, I worked to address urgent needs of this quickly growing segment of our U.S. population, forging inroads with various Hispanic organizations through our Senate Hispanic Working Group. The Working Group has met regularly throughout the past year, encouraging a two-way learning process in which we have come to better understand important concerns that Hispanic Americans have, while expressing to the Hispanic community our earnest desire to address these concerns. The group has forged ties with Hispanic organizations such as the National Council of La Raza, League of United Latin American Citizens, National Association of Latino Elected Officials, American GI Forum, Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, National Latino Children's Institute and MANA A National Latina Organization. I am very pleased that our Leader, Senator Daschle, asked me to work with Senator Bingaman and Senator John Kerry in this effort. 
Practical, everyday issues Democrats have worked to address for Hispanic Americans are many in number and quite varied. For instance, we united to pass an amendment to the education IRA bill which I offered, along with my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, to help reduce the alarming number of high school dropouts in this country. Although the amendment was added to the bill, it was regrettably stripped in conference. 
This effort was particularly aimed at addressing the disproportionately high rate of Hispanic high school dropouts--a rate which has hovered at 30 percent. This is by far the highest rate compared to all other racial and ethnic minority groups--a rate that is simply unacceptable. Nevada has also seen dropout rates among Hispanics of more than 16 percent. We must continue to find out why these students are left behind, and eventually feel compelled to curtail their learning opportunities. These are opportunities that could help these disenfranchised young people begin a career, support their families now and in the future, and make something of their lives. 
My own life was transformed by the power of education. My father never received an education higher than elementary school and my mother never graduated from high school. But because I was lucky enough to have access to educational opportunities, the support of good teachers, and a supportive community, I was able to accomplish what my parents had 
dreamed for me. Democrats want to make sure that every American has the opportunity to obtain a good education and realize their full potential. 
We have also been trying very hard to reform our health care system. Millions of Americans worry every day about health care as they fight all manner of illness and disease, or care for a loved one who is sick. Many Americans, including Hispanic Americans who make up almost one in every four uninsured individuals in the U.S., wonder about how they will obtain the care they need when they need it, how they will pay for it, whether or not the care is quality care, and how much control they will have over their own health care decisions. We have managed to elevate on the national level one comprehensive solution to many families' health care worries in Patients' Bill of Rights legislation. We did this because people want to change the way managed care works, or more accurately, doesn't work. Regrettably, partisans have fought against full consideration of managed care reform in the Patients' Bill of Rights that would address issues at the heart of Americans' health care concerns. Democrats will continue pushing to increase patient protections for all Americans. 
We have also, time after time, come to this floor to talk about strengthening retirement security for current and future generations. I hear our young people's anxiety about their retirement--that nothing will be available to help them when it's time to leave the workforce. Unfortunately for Hispanics, out of the one in ten who are part of the workforce, only one in three or 32 percent of the 13.2 million working Hispanic Americans participate in employee pension plans. The participation rate for other minorities is 44 percent and for white Americans, 51 percent. The situation is bleaker for Hispanic women, who earn on average only 57 cents for every dollar earned by men and are thus unable to build savings or save for retirement. 
Our solution is the Retirement Accessibility, Security, and Portability Act of 1998, a comprehensive pension bill that includes a wide range of proposals designed to help Americans prepare for a secure retirement. This legislation would expand pension coverage, strengthen pension security, promote pension portability, and increase equity for women. We are also working to save Social Security--a program that has succeeded in keeping millions of older Americans out of poverty, helping people who don't have pension plans or inadequate pensions, and serving as a necessary safety net. Americans shouldn't face great anxiety in their golden years and should rather be free to enjoy their grandchildren, second or third careers, and as active a lifestyle as they desire. 
We have accomplished other things with the support of Hispanic Americans during this Congress, such as halting an assault on the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program. During Senate consideration of ISTEA II, the comprehensive highway funding bill, Democrats succeeded in protecting the DBE program which helps to ensure that minority- and women-owned small businesses have a fair opportunity to compete for Federal-aid highway and transit construction projects. In my state, $26.6 million or 11 percent of 1997 contracting dollars coming into Nevada went to minority- and women-owned businesses. In 1996, the DBE program brought in $4.2 million for minority-owned firms, or 7.3 percent of Federal contracting funds. It is imperative that we continue our diligence in helping these businesses fight against discrimination and flourish in their respective industries. 
This year, we fought for a restoration of Food Stamps to legal immigrants who unfairly lost their benefits. As my colleagues recall, the Republican welfare bill in 1996 introduced several provisions harmful to legal immigrants, including a prohibition that cut 935,000 individuals from the Food Stamp program alone. Although eligibility later was restored in 1997 for certain immigrants in selected Federal assistance programs, many others remained ineligible for necessary benefits in the Federal safety net that helps poorer families. We included a partial, $818 million restoration in the agricultural research bill conference report, defeating a motion to recommit the conference report with instructions stating that Food Stamp benefits be restored only to refugees and asylees who were lawfully residing in the U.S. on August 22, 1996. Immigrants were inequitably subjected to an arbitrary cutoff of benefits that hurt them dearly and took food out of the mouths of young children. We made sure that at least part of this injustice was reversed. 
I hope that a similar range of issues will be addressed in a statewide Hispanic Leadership Summit--the second one in a series--which will take place in Nevada this October. The first Hispanic summit I helped arrange in 1997 served as a catalyst for discussions in issue forums on education, health care, crime and community health, business and employment, and political awareness, and this year's summit will spur discussion on the same issues. In addition to identifying Nevadans to serve in leadership roles for the community in these areas, summit participants proposed solutions to various problems, such as educational programs to address high school dropout rates, alternatives to gangs, improved adult education and bilingual education/English as a Second Language programs, and better access to higher education. I encourage my colleagues to hold events such as this one in their own states, as a way to further encourage solidarity and real progress as the Nevada summits did for the Hispanic community in my state. 
Many accomplishments of Hispanic Americans came to light at the summit, and Hispanic Heritage Month presents us a terrific opportunity to celebrate those accomplishments once again. For example, as Hispanic consumers grow in number and purchasing power, producers, retailers and advertisers are recognizing Hispanics' strong economic muscle and finding selective marketing to Hispanics increasingly important. The Hispanic share of total buying power in my state grew from 6.4 percent in 1990 to 8.2 percent in 1997--an increase from $1.38 billion to $3.17 billion in less than a decade. Nationally, Hispanic buying power rose from 5.2 percent or $210 billion in 1990 to 6.1 percent and $348 billion in 1997, according to the Selig Center for Economic Growth at the University of Georgia. Hispanic Americans are helping to grow the economy. 
Hispanic entrepreneurs are also becoming a significant force in Nevada's economy, and the U.S. as a whole. Nevada's 3,900 Hispanic-owned firms earned $484 million in sales and receipts in 1992--double the number of firms existing in 1987 (1,767 businesses) and triple the sales and receipts logged in 1997 ($142 million), according to the Census Bureau. As of 1996, there were an estimated greater than one million Hispanic-owned businesses in the U.S. Also growing in number around the country are Hispanic Chambers of Commerce--which numbered 169 in 31 states in 1995, according to Hispanic Business, Inc. This included the Latin Chamber of Commerce of Nevada in Las Vegas and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in Reno. I am encouraged to see that these businesses have come a long way and that they are projected to grow even more dramatically in the next five to ten years. 
In closing, Hispanic Americans have much to celebrate this month. I feel there is no better occasion than now to personally congratulate a few winners who have made the Silver State quite proud. The Latin Energy Dancers of Carson City, Nevada are being recognized this week by the National Latino Children's Institute--my warm congratulations go out to this group on being declared as one of the institute's La Promesa Award Winners 1998. Congratulations to Father Omar Botia for being this year's recipient of the Humanitarian of the Year `Adelante' Award. Father Omar, my friend, has contributed much to the Hispanic community in Reno, not only in the spiritual realm, but also in recognizing the need for improvement of their temporal situations. Also, MANA, A Latina Organization recently opened a new chapter in my state in Las Vegas--I wish them the best in their new endeavor. Let this month be a celebration for achievements and honors like these, through which the Hispanic community will continue to grow and flourish. Hispanic Heritage Month will be a time for us to remember the contributions that the Hispanic community has shared with us and has given to this, only adding to its greatness. We are reminded this month that the United States is a country of true diversity, which revels in the differences of its individuals, and rejoices in the common strains that unite us as Americans.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I use the time delegated to the Senator from Alaska. 
Mr. President, my friend from Arkansas and my friend from Louisiana are in some kind of a dream world. The fact of the matter is that the statistics they talk about, for example, 300,000 acres damaged--the State of Nevada alone has 75 million acres. The Western United States is a vast area that still has areas in need of development. The mining industry has the best blue-collar jobs in America. The price of gold is at a 19-year low. Companies are filing bankruptcy. People are being laid off. 
The mining industry creates a favorable balance of trade for gold. The problems that they talk about are all problems that went on decades and decades ago. What we are talking about here is there are some regulations that the Secretary of the Interior who can't legislate--they have tried, they can't legislate anything--so he said, `We're going to get to you anyway, Mr. and Mrs. Mining Company; we're going to do this through regulations. We're going to show you if we can't legislate, we will regulate.' 
What we are saying is, Mr. Secretary of the Interior, if you want to regulate, let's have the National Academy of Sciences, an impartial, unbiased, very recognized, sound scientific body look at these regulations to see if they need to be changed. We are willing to abide by what they come up with. This is not some antienvironmental rider that is going to turn present regulations upside down. This is simply saying let's take the regulations and have the scientists look at them, not Secretary Babbitt who has been so unfair to mining. 
Mr. President, they are looking for a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. The Western Governors' Association said: 
States already have effective environmental and reclamation programs in place and operating. These programs ensure that national criteria, where they exist in current law, are met and allow state and site-specific flexibility for the remaining issues. 
That is all we want, is fairness. The Interior bill is a good bill. This provision which calls for a study by the National Academy of Sciences is the right way to go. This amendment should be defeated overwhelmingly.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Enzi amendment which restricts the Secretary of Interior's ability to move forward with a rule that would supplant a state's ability to decide what types of gaming activities would be permissible on Indian lands. 
The proposed rule, announced by the Secretary in January, circumvents Congress' role in deciding the framework for regulating Indian gaming. 
Congress is the best body to lay out the process for establishing the balanced framework for tribal state negotiations over Indian gaming. 
The proposed rule would upset the necessary balance and invest in the Secretary an exceptional amount of authority in deciding the outcome of these negotiations. Its effect would be the expansion of Indian Gaming notwithstanding the objections of a state. 
This Enzi amendment is simple and fair. It simply restricts the Interior Secretary from promulgating as final regulations a rule that would allow him to decide whether a state is negotiating with a tribe in good faith; and which types of gaming activities a state must accept on tribal lands. 
There is a long history to this issue and it is something that the Governors feel quite strongly about. 
In fact, on July 23, the National Governor's Association wrote Senators Lott and Daschle encouraging the Senate to support passage of the Enzi amendment. 
As the letter states: 
The nation's governors strongly believe that no statute or court decision provides the Secretary . . . with authority to intervene in disputes over compacts between Indian tribes and states about casino gambling on Indian lands. Such action would constitute an attempt by the Secretary to preempt states' authority under existing laws and recent court decisions and would create a incentive for tribes to avoid negotiating gambling compacts with states. 
What this issue is about is states rights and whether this Congress is going to give the Secretary of Interior--who has fiduciary and trust responsibilities to the tribes--the authority to dictate to states which gaming activities they must accept. 
I do not believe we are prepared for the unfettered proliferation of Indian gaming. 
The Supreme Court, in the Seminole decision, did great harm to what we sought to do when we enacted IGRA. 
The courts have made a mess of the compacting process we put in place in 1986. 
The result is that we are now faced with the dilemma of (1) who must decide whether or not a state is negotiating in good faith; and (2), what types of gaming activities is a state required to negotiate over. 
As the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs said in his April 1st testimony before the Indian Affairs Committee: `Any attempts [to decide] this issue administratively is certain to draw court challenges and for that reason, we would prefer legislation. 
Secretary Gover is right, a decision of this import should not be left entirely in the hands of a federal official who is statutorily biased against a state. 
The Department of Interior is responsible for administering IGRA--not reauthorizing it. 
Last year's Interior Appropriation's bill--which the President signed--included a similar provision that prevented the Secretary from approving class III (casino styled) compacts. 
The Secretary's decision in January evidenced the Department's intent to disregard the clear congressional intent of last year's bill. 
This issue should be resolved legislatively and the Enzi amendment will ensure that solution. It will do so in a manner that is respectful of state's rights.

Mr. REID. Madam President, let's put this in proper perspective. Gold prices are at the lowest level in 19 years as of just last week. The mining industry has seen layoffs. Some of the companies have filed bankruptcy. This seems like a very inopportune time to come in and attack the mining industry. It is an industry which creates the best blue-collar jobs in America. I repeat, the best blue-collar jobs in America come from mining. 
Here is the Senator from Arkansas, again, as he does every year, attacking the mining industry. This year the attack is at a very inopportune time. I repeat, the mining industry is going through some very difficult times. 
In spite of paying the highest wages in blue-collar industry in America, the mining industry in America is the best in the world. The costs of production are extremely low. They are lower than Australia or any other country. We are competitive. But it has been very difficult. 
Now, having said that, we also have to recognize that the gold industry is a very important industry for the United States. We are a net exporter of gold. It is one of the few things that we do that creates a favorable balance of trade in America. 
With that as the setting for this amendment, let me say this amendment is attempting to strike from the bill language that is very, very reasonable. The Secretary of Interior is attempting to do by regulation what he can't do by legislation. What right does he have to overrule what the will of the Congress is? He has no right to do that. He has tried very hard. I am not making this up. He said in 1994 when his legislative efforts failed, 
We will explore the full range of regulatory authority we now possess. 
Since that comment, with a vengeance, the Secretary has gotten busy on the regulatory side while making no attempt to work with Congress to reform the mining law bill. If we had had support from the Secretary's office in the past 2 months, we may be here today talking about mining law reform rather than hacking away at this Interior bill. 
The Governors, at their meeting in Medora, ND, in June of 1997, pointed out in a resolution that the current State programs, as far as they are concerned, are working well, and attempts to duplicate them should be avoided. 
What we have here is, again, something we like to talk about, but not do much about, and that is talk about States rights. States rights are very important to our framework of government. We have here a number of States which are saying we are willing to work within the Federal concept and all the laws that we pass in Washington that affect mining, but let us regulate from the State level. This amendment is attempting to take that away. 
The Secretary of Interior has proceeded undaunted with his rulemaking in spite of how the Governors feel. This led to language being included in last year's Interior bill that precluded the Secretary from expending funds to rewrite 309. As the chairman of the full committee said a few minutes ago, showing absolute disrespect for Congress, the Secretary, 3 days after the President signed the Interior bill--we stuck language in the bill saying he had to confer with Governors--3 days after signing that bill, he sent a letter saying that they had conferred and complied with the requirement to consult with the Governors. Let's be realistic--within 3 days? This was, as chairman of the full committee said, an in-your-face remark to Congress from the Secretary of Interior's office saying, `We don't have to consult with you.' 
After numerous Governors, both individually and collectively, pleaded with the Department not to forge ahead on rulemaking without bringing them in the process, he continued. Only after months of letterwriting and handwringing did the Secretary send his task force out with a draft proposal. After the draft proposal was received, the Governor said, `We have seen it; we have looked at it. What are you trying to do?' 
It doesn't make any sense. The chairman of the full committee, the junior Senator from Alaska, held a hearing. At the hearing, the Governors testified, `Where is the demonstrated need to rewrite the 309 service management regulations?' There was no response as to why it was necessary. 
Madam President, understand that this isn't something that we have dreamed up. This isn't some anti-environmental piece of the Interior bill. In fact, what this is, is a clear demonstration that the mining industry, the Governors from the States where mining is important, and the rest of the country where mining is important, are simply saying what they want to do is have an independent, unbiased, competent body take a look at the present regulations to see if they are OK. We have assigned the National Academy of Sciences, one of the foremost scientific bodies in the world, to take a look at this. That doesn't sound unreasonable to any reasonable person. 
This language is not an anti-environmental rider that would somehow gut existing regulations. We don't touch existing regulations. We are simply saying that it is within the purview and jurisdiction of Congress because it is something that we feel will add to a good resolution of this issue. 
The Secretary has proceeded in a cavalier fashion for an outcome that would seriously jeopardize the State's role as coregulators with the Federal Government in mining. There is talk about the atrocities toward the environment in mining. I come from a family where my father was a hard rock miner. I have worked in the mines. I went with my dad when I was a little boy into the mines. I have to acknowledge that many years ago there were a lot of environmental degradations as a result of mining. The tailings from the mill just ran out wherever, and the dumps were just not located in any specific place. 
In short, the legacy that went on before bears no resemblance to the current practices in the mining industry, nor the States' ability to regulate mining. They do a good job now. In the past two, two and a half decades, tremendous work has been done. I am really tired of hearing all the time that the 1872 mining law needs to be revamped. It has been over 100 years and we have done nothing. That is a bunch of hogwash.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to advise the Senator when he has 5 minutes left of his 20 minutes. 
There has been a lot of talk about how terrible things are in the mining industry. Yet, the Bureau of Land Management, a Government agency that I have great respect for, that is doing its best, controls most of the Federal lands in the State of Nevada. 
The Bureau of Land Management has put out a brochure. This isn't from the State of Nevada, the State of Alaska, or the State of Colorado. This is from the Federal Government. This applies to Nevada. It says on the front, `BLM, Mining Reclamation, You'd Be Surprised.' My friend from Arkansas talked at great length about how bad cyanide is. Let me read from this brochure that is now being put out to everybody who wants a copy in the State of Nevada and the other Western States: 
Cyanide is a toxic chemical which is used in most gold and silver mining operations. BLM, again in cooperation with Nevada's State agencies, such as Nevada Department of Wildlife and Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, require that mining operations using cyanide do so in an environmentally sound manner. 
All new ponds containing lethal concentrations of cyanide must be netted or detoxified to prevent wildlife deaths. 
Birds do not die as a result of cyanide: 
All operations using cyanide are inspected at least quarterly by BLM reclamation/compliance specialists. 
Gold or silver ore leached with cyanide must be rinsed to reduce levels to safe standards upon abandonment. Leach facilities are engineered to prevent any ground or surface water contamination. 
All exploration, mine and reclamation plans must be reviewed under the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act. 
This brochure goes on to show the great things done with reclamation in mining. It shows the equipment that is doing this. It is amazing what they have done to reclaim the land to its former state. 
There is a mine near my hometown of Searchlight, NV, that is desert. When they pull out the Joshua trees, yuccas, and all the others, they have a nursery for those. And when that land is reclaimed, they have all those plants that they have taken out of the land and they put them back in. These aren't a bunch of environmental bandits out there tearing up the land. 
The Federal Government agrees. My friend from Arkansas should read what the Federal Government wants. I suggest that my friend, the Secretary of the Interior, read the publication put out by his own agency. I say that about the Secretary of the Interior. He hasn't been fair to mining. I respect the work he has done as Secretary of the Interior in all areas except for mining, where he hasn't done a very good job. He is opposed to mining. He makes big shows when a land patent is issued and issues a big check saying it is not fair that we have to give this land to some miner. Remember these mining companies pay an average of a quarter of a million dollars every time a patent is issued. In short, the Secretary should read his own literature. The BLM and mining operations are continually looking for the best way to revegetate and reclaim mining lands. It shows pictures of it. It shows final reclamation at the Pinson Mine.

Mr. REID. This brochure indicates also that mining companies, one of which is pictured here, have received an award for excellence in mining reclamation. 
Mr. President, the State of Nevada is totally different from the State of Alaska. The State of Nevada is the most mountainous State in the Union, except for Alaska. We have lots of mountains, over 11,000 feet high--32 to be exact. Alaska has a lot of water. We don't have a lot of water. Mining regulations in the State of Alaska should be different than those in the State of Nevada. The State of Alaska should have some control in setting the standards for mining reclamation, mining bonding and other such things. The State of Nevada should have different standards because we live in a desert in Nevada. That is the point. 
Each State is subject to different water quality conditions, air-related issues, issues that stem from local climate conditions, disposal criteria, and other issues that are distinct from State to State. That is something the Federal Government must recognize, and the agency does. The BLM recognizes that because they have different standards in each State. That is why the present regulations are working pretty well. 
Also, Mr. President, understand this. We have asked the National Academy of Sciences to study this. We don't tell them what result to reach. We will accept what they come up with. Why shouldn't those who want these regulations changed not accept it also? We are not asking for some predisposed venue. We are not asking for some agency that is going to rule in a certain way. We have asked the finest science body in the world to look at these regulations and find out if they make sense. 
Mr. President, I will offer a number of exhibits here. One is a Western Governors' Conference resolution that indicates there is no need for what the Secretary of the Interior is trying to do. 
We have a series of letters from Governors from all over the United States talking about why the Secretary is wrong.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, what we have to realize here is that this is an effort to be fair. The language in the bill calls for a study by the National Academy of Sciences. I repeat. We have not asked them to find in any certain way. Whatever they come up with is what we will go along with. 
I think that we owe the American people an honest debate about the current regulations for hard rock mining and all the disasters that have gone on in the past. There are a number of Superfund sites. That is one reason Superfund was passed--because of environmental degradation that had taken place in the years gone by. Mining was part of that. We are not part of that anymore. I think that is good. 
We owe the American people an honest debate about the current regulations of hard rock mining. We owe them the opportunity to know about mining, and for the first time the truth about the environmental practices employed by modern-day mining--not what went on 30 years, 40 years, 50 years, or 100 years ago. We owe the tens of thousands of Americans who make a living at mining--or some occupation that relies on mining--to know that certainly their jobs will be there when they show up in the morning. 
I say to everyone within the sound of my voice mining affects more than the people that go down in the Earth or into the open pits. It affects more than them because we have industries all over America that rely on mining. These huge trucks that haul the ore out of the open pit operations cost over $2 million. To replace the tires on one of those trucks costs over $25,000 each. Underground operations are very expensive. That equipment comes from other parts of the United States other than the western part of the United States. 
This industry is important to the economic viability of this country. There is no one in this body, the Department of the Interior, or the mining industry that can predict the outcome of the review conducted by the National Academy of Sciences. I can almost assure you the results will be fair. That is all we are asking. 
But let me say that I think we should approach this on a nonemotional basis. When the study is completed, we will go forward as indicated in the language that is in this bill with whatever they recommend. 
Mr. President, it is important that this amendment fail. It is not good legislation. It is something we have debated time and time again--just in a different setting. 
I ask my colleagues to join in doing what is right for an industry that is very important to the economic viability of this country.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mrs. Verlie Doing, an outstanding woman who will receive a distinguished honor when she is named Searchlight, Nevada's, Woman of the Decade in October. This particular tribute is one I hold especially dear, as it is being given to a woman who has helped make my hometown the unique community it is today. 
Founded by those in search of gold, Searchlight began as a mining town. It is a strangely quiet place, not really mentioned in the tales of Nevada history. However, this is my home, and Verlie Doing has helped to establish it as a beating heart in the once silent land found south of Las Vegas. 
Mrs. Doing relocated to Searchlight with her husband, Warren, in 1967. Since that time, she has been active in organizing community activities as well as providing employment for the majority of families living in the area. Upon settling in Searchlight, Mrs. Doing assumed a position on the Searchlight Town Advisory Board and began her legacy of work. She is an original member of the town's Emergency Medical Treatment team, as well as the Searchlight Museum Guild. She has served on the Clark County Parks and Recreation Board since 1970, establishing areas for children and adults alike to not only enjoy the many splendors of Nevada's scenery, but to partake of beneficial recreation programs. 
As a member of the Parks and Recreation Board, Verlie has seen first hand the need for centers where people can participate in community activities. For this reason, she and her husband donated to the city the land for the Searchlight Senior Citizen Center. Currently, this center offers seniors an opportunity to socialize and continue their education through arts and crafts and exercise. Day care and food programs are among the most important offered at the center and provide assistance to those seniors who may otherwise be institutionalized. 
Not only has Mrs. Doing been energetically involved in community activities, she has also helped to foster Searchlight's business community. Currently, Mrs. Doing is serving as the sole owner of the Searchlight Nugget Casino, the largest employer in the city. Established in 1979, the Nugget has increased not only employment, but has aided in boosting the economy. She has employed hundreds of Searchlight residents, providing many families with incomes where, without the casino, there would be none. It is this entrepreneurial spirit that has brought vitality into both the business community and the entire town. 
Most of all, my family and I have been friends of Verlie, her late husband, Warren, and their son, Riley, for more than thirty years. The Doings have made not only Searchlight a better place, but Nevada and our great country as well. 
I commend Verlie on her significant contributions to my hometown. Without her enthusiasm, energy and love for her home, Searchlight would be much less. It is for these reasons that I proudly support the decision of the Searchlight Celebration Committee in their selection of Mrs. Verlie Doing as Searchlight's Woman of the Decade.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Reno, Nevada's Little Flower Catholic Church, which will soon be marking its fiftieth anniversary. This amazing church has truly been a blessing for the people of northern Nevada, as it has become a pillar of strength, inspiration, and hope for the thousands who have passed through its doors. 
Little Flower has truly blossomed since its first mass was celebrated on October 17, 1948. Senator Patrick McCarran, Representive Walter Baring and area religious leaders of all denominations were just a few of those who filled the church's 200 seats on that special day. But the time Father Robert Bowling became pastor in 1974, facilities has expanded and the parish had grown to several hundred people. And, during the following year, the parish actually doubled in size. Today, under Father Bowling's continued stewardship, the church ministers to almost four thousand families, reflecting an extraordinary increase--particularly over the last twenty-five years. Moreover, each month, a Little Flower worship service is taped and later aired on local television for the benefit of those who would like to attend mass but are too infirm to do so. 
In celebrating this anniversary, I am reminded of the well-known biblical passage that refers to our duty as our brother's keeper. This message is clearly not lost on the Little Flower congregation. While the church is by no means what one would consider wealthy, its parishioners' generosity is boundless. In addition to monthly donations to St. Vincent's shelter, the Little Flower distributes food vouchers to the hungry on a daily basis. A local supermarket honors the certificates and then bills the church at the end of each month. Likewise, gas vouchers are provided to stranded motorists. Bus fare is available for runaways looking to return home and for others caught in similarly difficult straits. Even money for medicine is given to the uninsured poor. Little Flower's policy holds that nobody in need is turned away, and no questions are ever asked. 
Yet, Little Flower Catholic Church is not just about worship and charity; it's also a garden of personal and community development. The church operates a school that enrolls three hundred youngsters, providing top-notch religious and academic instruction. In addition, the church sponsors countless organizations such as a Mom's Group, Altar Society, Knights of Columbus, as well as Filipino, Hispanic, and youth-centered choirs. Of course, standard Marriage, Baptism and Sunday school classes are also included in the Little Flower's crowded slate of activities. Sometime I think that if a book could be written about the church's history, it may well be called the Little Flower That Could. 
Father Omar, one of the parish priests, is a more recent example of Little Flower's devotion to its parishioners. Born in Colombia, with a heart big enough to fill the world, Father Omar today sets the standard for spirituality and community activism. He is truly a man for others. 
Hanging over the entrance of the church chapel is a sign declaring that `love is spoken here.' Indeed, it's a language the folks at Little Flower Catholic Church have clearly mastered. The church has embraced newcomers, comforted and cheered the downtrodden, and is one of those special places that brings out the best in all of us. While its history is grand, Little Flower Catholic Church's future promises to be equally as rosy. Congratulations on the approaching fiftieth anniversary to Reno Bishop Phillip Straling, Father Bowling, the church's chapter members, and all of the parishioners that have made it such a sanctuary of unconditional love.

Mr. REID. Madam President, this amendment will help to create gender equity in health care, will provide for healthier mothers and children, will lower the rate of abortion and it will cost the government nothing--in fact it may save money. 
We can do all of this requiring the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) plans to cover prescription contraception just as they cover other prescriptions. 
Currently, women of reproductive age spending 68 percent more in out of pocket health costs than men. 
The proposed amendment would require FEHB plans to treat prescription contraceptives the same as all other cover drugs. In so doing, it would help to achieve parity between the benefits offered to male participants in FEHB plans and those offered to female participants, there by narrowing the gender gap in insurance coverage. 
The vast majority of FEHB plans offer prescription drug coverage, but fail to cover the full range of prescription contraceptions. 
I have said it many times now, but I believe if men were the ones who needed prescription contraceptives, I have no doubt they would have been covered by insurance years ago. 
the FEHB Program should be the model for private plans. the United States Government, as an employer, should provide basic health benefits for women and families insured through FEHB. 
Eight-one percent of FEHB plans do not cover all five leading reversible methods of contraception. (Oral contraceptives, diaphram, IUD's, Norplant and Depo-Provera) 
Ten percent of FEHB plans have no coverage of contraceptives--they do not cover any of the five leading methods. 
Women should be receiving health care coverage equal to the coverage that every man receives from the federal employee health care benefits plan--which is probably a majority of the male Senators in this chamber. 
Contraceptive services also help to promote healthy pregnancies and healthy birth outcomes. A study of 45,000 women suggests that women who used family planning services in the 2 years before conception were more likely to receive early and adequate prenatal care. 
The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality estimated that 10 percent of infant deaths could be prevented if all pregnancies were planned; in 1989 alone, 4000 infant lives could have been saved. 
Now, we have all gone through the long abortion debates on this floor. they are heated passionate debates. 
Senator Snowe and I come from opposite sides of that debate. I am pro-life. Senator Snowe is pro-choice. But we have one thing in common regarding this issue: We both believe that abortions are to be avoided and that the number that occur in this country every year needs to be reduced. 
How do we reduce the number of abortions? We reduce the number of unintended pregnancies by providing women with the means to acquire birth control. 
Contraceptive help couples plan wanted pregnancies and reduce the need for abortion. There are 3.6 million unintended pregnancies in this Nation each year--about 60 percent of all pregnancies. And almost half of these unintended pregnancies end in abortion. 
I have a chart here that shows as the unintended pregnancy rate drops, so does the number of abortions. 
From 1981 to 1987 the unintended pregnancy rate dropped by about 1 percent and the abortion rate also slightly dropped. the unintended pregnancy rate dropped 8.8 percent from 1987 to 1994, and the abortion rate per 1000 women during those years dropped from 24 to 20. Given this trend, I think it would be wise to do whatever we can to speed up the drop in unintended pregnancies. 
The cost effectiveness of family planning is well documented. Studies indicate that in the private sector, for every dollar invested in family planning, between $4 and $14 are saved in health care and pregnancy related costs. 
CBO has estimated that this amendment will cost less than $500,000. Under CBO's practice of scoring bills to the nearest million dollars this provision would have no effect on the budget total in fiscal year 1999.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I introduce today a bill to authorize the Truckee River Watershed Reclamation Project. The water in Nevada is a precious resource that should not be wasted and we need to reuse what we can of this commodity. The Title XVI program in the Bureau of Reclamation is aimed at reclaiming the water for use within the community. The projects that are within this watershed project will in fact be utilized in multiple municipal functions throughout the Truckee River Basin communities. 
Specifically, the North Valleys Reuse Project would be to reclaim the wastewater from Reno and Sparks and convey that water to subdivisions extending to the north of Reno for irrigation purposes so that the groundwater can be preserved for domestic and other potable uses. Once the new effluent reuse system is operational, groundwater currently used for irrigation can then be a reliable source in a region with limited resources. Additionally, the Spanish Springs Valley Reuse Project would use treated wastewater with excessive total dissolved solids to be channeled for irrigation and environmental watering. The treated wastewater would be returned to the valley where numerous parks, golf courses, pastures could be irrigated with effluent reducing the quantity of groundwater pumped and improving the quality of the aquifer. Another aspect of this reclamation effort is the protection of the scarce resource during emergency conditions, increases the reliability of domestic water supply in the event of a toxic spill into the Truckee River through a series of optional programs in cooperation with the regional and community resource planners. When this project is authorized and appropriated for the counties can begin their feasibility studies of their projects and programs within its Regional Water Management Plan. 
Mr. President, as the ranking member on the Energy and Water Development Appropriations, I have the opportunity to examine closely the Bureau of Reclamation's programs and I appreciate the assistance the Bureau gives to communities throughout the arid west. The first project initiated by the Bureau of Reclamation was in Nevada called the Newlands Project and Nevada communities have benefited from the Federal assistance in water management. Now, the Bureau of Reclamation Title XVI program can be of immeasurable value to the communities in the Truckee River Watershed to preserve and reclaim some of this precious resource.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Las Vegas institution. No, I am not referring to the `Strip' and the neon lights, but to a cultural organization that has provided Las Vegans many years of enjoyment, the Desert Chorale. I have had the pleasure of listening to their incredible range of talent for the past 16 years. This spectacular choir made up of volunteers has provided Nevada music lovers countless hours of enjoyment. While Las Vegas and Southern Nevada may be known for big head-liners like Siegfried and Roy, Liberace and Elvis, I can personally attest that thousands of Nevadans have flocked the Desert Chorale's concerts over the years. From the patriotic to the spiritually uplifting, the sheer beauty of the music they make touches and inspires their audiences. 
Now, this great choir from the Silver State will be sharing their talent with a slice of the world audience. The Desert Chorale has been recognized for their musical achievements and have been invited to participate in the Boris Brott Music Festival in Canada. The festival is entering into it's twelfth year and their contributions to Canada's and the world's cultural scene has been highly praised. Not only does the choir have the honor of being invited to this festival, but they were also chosen as the first musical organization of its kind to represent the Western United States. I stand here on behalf of the great state of Nevada, as that state's senior senator, and the United States of America, to congratulate the Desert Chorale on taking part in this prestigious tradition. The Desert Chorale will be an excellent addition to the festival. I am confident from the previous performances I have attended, that they will do a superb job in representing the great heritage of both the state of Nevada and the United States of America.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, America is a great country. It is not perfect, but it is a great country. It is a country where the voice of the people is usually heard. That is what this is all about today. The American public, for some time, has been upset about the way their tax collector has been handling a very important aspect of the business of this country. Today we are dealing with something that is very important to the American people. 
I also must say that this IRS restructuring and reform bill would not have been possible but for the senior Senator from Nebraska. The senior Senator from Nebraska has worked long and hard on this issue. Even before this legislation was introduced, as he has just briefly outlined, when he was a member of the Appropriations Committee and a member of the subcommittee that had jurisdiction over the IRS, he started this legislation. It seems it was only yesterday, even though it was much longer. It was last year that Senators Grassley, Kerrey, and I stood to introduce this legislation. 
When we introduced this legislation, we didn't have a lot of people who wanted to help us. There was a sparse group of people from the Senate supporting us--Senator Kerrey, from Nebraska, Senator Pryor, from Arkansas, and Senator Grassley, from Iowa. But I commend and applaud the Senator from Nebraska for his vision and, most of all, for his tenacity on this legislation. I am glad we are finally at a point now where we can pass this because this IRS restructuring and reform bill is important. 
Mr. President, when I first came to the Congress, I came with the feeling that something had to be done about the IRS. I was elected in 1982. During that period of time, the State of Nevada was going through some very difficult times with the Internal Revenue Service. The reason for that is that the resort industry had been in a battle that had gone on for several decades as to whether people in the gambling business, when they received a gratuity from somebody who was playing cards or dice, could treat that gratuity as a gift, or whether it was taxable by the Internal Revenue Service. 
This battle was taken to the court structure and the courts determined that this was taxable income. It took several decades to do this. After the decision was made by the courts, many of the people in the resort field owed money to the IRS. They acknowledged their debt, and made arrangements with the Internal Revenue Service, saying I owe $20,000 or I owe $4,000, whatever the amount might be, and they would repay it at whatever rate they could work out with the IRS agent, for example, $200 a month or $600 a month. The problem was, the IRS would keep reneging on their deals. A new IRS agent would come along and say, `You are not going to pay $200 a month, you have to pay $400 a month.' They would say, `We already made an arrangement with you to pay at $200 a month.' The IRS agent would say, `I'm a new agent; I will make the deal with you that I think is appropriate.' 
This went on and on. The people in the resort business had their property seized and their bank accounts levied. It was a very chaotic situation. As a result of this experience, when I came to the Congress, I introduced a bill in the House called the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 
On the day I introduced that legislation, I appeared on the `Charlie Rose' show. At that time, Charlie Rose came on at 2 o clock in the morning. I thought the legislation I introduced had impact only on the people of the State of Nevada. I was surprised, amazed, and impressed to learn that it was not only a Nevada problem. After I appeared on this TV program that aired at 2 a.m., I came to the office the next day and to find hundreds of telegrams. The phone wouldn't stop ringing. This problem was a problem throughout our country, not just in the State of Nevada. All over the country the IRS had not been treating people appropriately. 
I was not able to move the legislation in the House for 
various reasons. The chairman of the subcommittee in the House liked the IRS more than he liked my legislation. I was elected in 1986 to the Senate. My maiden speech in the Senate related to the same Taxpayer Bill of Rights that I introduced in the House and that I said I was going to introduce here. Very fortunately for me, and I hope for the country--I feel confident that is true--presiding over the Senate that day was the subcommittee chair of the Finance Committee subcommittee that had jurisdiction over the Internal Revenue Service, David Pryor, from Arkansas. Senator Pryor sent a note to me by a page, after I finished my speech, saying: I like what you have said. I want to work with you on this. 
Also, that same day, Charles Grassley, a Republican Senator from Iowa, made contact with me saying: I want to work with you on the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. So I had two very senior Members of the Senate who wanted to work with a brand new Senator's legislation that we now call the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. We conducted hearings and we learned some amazing things. 
I would relate to the chairman of the Finance Committee, even back then we had some very courageous people who were the beginning of some of the people who came forward in the latest round of hearings relating to the IRS restructuring reform bill. For example, we had one IRS employee from Los Angeles who put his job at risk, because the IRS testified that they did not promote people on the basis of how much money they collected. This IRS employee came in and said, `That's not true.' He said, `In our office there were big glass windows in the inner offices and there were big pieces of paper there saying: `Seizure fever, catch it.' That was a message to all the IRS agents that they should go out and seize all the property they could. That would get them promotions. We therefore outlawed promotions on the basis of how much money was collected and we outlawed quotas. 
The Taxpayer Bill of Rights passed, and on November 10, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Taxpayer Bill of Rights that I had written. But I acknowledge I could not have gotten that done without the tremendous support from Senators Pryor and Grassley. They were champions. They were on the Finance Committee, and they were the ones who were responsible for working with me and moving that legislation. 
The Taxpayer Bill of Rights, signed by President Reagan, really did create new rights that taxpayers had never had before. For the first time in the history of the country, the taxpayer was put on a more equal footing with the tax collector. Note I say `on a more equal footing with the tax collector.' The tax collector still had some serious advantages. Because of that, Senators Pryor, Grassley, and I moved forward with the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2. 
We had some difficulty with that. It was vetoed on a couple of different occasions, not because of the substantive nature of our bill, but because it was part of a tax bill. It was part of partisan wrangling which took place here, and President Bush vetoed the bill twice. Included in that bill was our Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2. 
However, in July of 1996, we achieved a crucial milestone on the road to IRS reform when President Clinton signed the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 as Public Law 104-168. 
I underline and underscore, President Bush did not oppose our bill when he vetoed the tax bill. I repeat, it was part of an overall tax problem that caused him to veto the whole tax package. So we had Taxpayer Bill of Rights 1 and 2. They both did things to help the taxpayer versus the tax collector. 
I served as an appointed member, by then-Leader George Mitchell, on the Entitlement Commission. I served there with Senator Kerrey and others. I came to the realization at that time that the IRS, even though we had Taxpayer Bill of Rights 1 and 2, still needed significant work, principally because of how much money it cost the American taxpayer and the government to collect the taxes. It was estimated during the entitlement hearings that it cost about $500 billion a year just to collect the income tax of this country. 
In the autumn of 1997, Senator Grassley, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and I introduced the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1997. I was happy to join in that. Someone asked me in an interview, `The President doesn't support this; why are you out on front on this?' I said, `I believe he is going to have to get out of the way or the steamroller is going to run over him,' and, in fact, that was true. Within a few weeks, the President and many others joined in this legislation which initially had very little support. 
The bill we introduced was referred to the Ways and Means Committee, and the chairman of the Finance Committee in the Senate, the senior Senator from Delaware--I say through the Chair to my friend, the chairman of the committee, as a matter of information, are you the senior Senator from Delaware? Yes, he is. Both Senators have served a long time, and I wasn't certain which one was the senior member. 
The chairman of the Finance Committee, the senior Senator from Delaware, held some hearings that I thought were very probative, very important to get the American people behind this legislation. The witnesses were carefully chosen. I thought the timing of those hearings was very good to add impetus to this legislation. 
In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton challenged the Congress to pass the IRS reform bill as its first order of business. I am glad it is one of the things that we have worked on very quickly. 
This bill has been outlined on several occasions today. It shifts the burden of proof; it expands IRS authority to award administration and litigation costs; it expands current law to allow taxpayers to sue the Federal Government; it requires the IRS to fire an employee for misconduct relating to the employee's official duties; it creates an oversight board to watch over IRS administration, management and conduct; and it does something that I think is so important--it creates confidentiality between the tax preparer and the taxpayer. I think that is very important. 
The bill also contains a provision addressing the meals tax. As a matter of good-faith bargaining between an employer and employee, if they say that an employee should have a meal on the premises, that meal is not going to be taxed by the IRS. 
Also, there is something I call the `rewards for rats' program, where private citizens are encouraged to turn in those who they believe are not paying their fair share of taxes. The IRS is directed to examine the conduct of this program. It is important to find ways to prevent such things from taking place. 
It also does very important work related to an innocent spouses. The other issues that are covered here have been elaborated upon in some detail, but innocent spouse status I want to talk about a little bit. 
My daughter--I have one daughter and four boys--my daughter had a wonderful teacher. She was a second grade teacher who had moved from the Midwest to the Las Vegas area and had recently gone through a divorce. Her husband had been a bank officer, and had embezzled huge amounts of money. Totally unaware of this was the second grade schoolteacher in Las Vegas. 
The fact of the matter is, though, the IRS--and I won't talk about the woman's name--were relentless in going after this woman's wages. She was a schoolteacher. She had no money other than her limited salary from teaching, and they just harassed and badgered this poor soul unbelievably. At the time I said, some day I hope I have an opportunity to prevent further acts against people like Mrs: I won't mention her name. And we are doing that today. 
In the future, innocent spouses will have an opportunity to explain their situation as innocent spouses. This is important legislation. Why should somebody who steals huge amounts of money from a bank, as in this example, shift the burden of proof to an innocent spouse? It is not fair, and this legislation will 
solve that problem. 
I believe Congress works best when it works together. This legislation is bipartisan legislation. This legislation is a testimony to the power of bipartisanship and how we need to act together to focus on the problems that relate to the American public. 
This legislation is legislation the American public wants. It is legislation in which this Congress has joined together in a bipartisan fashion under the leadership of the chairman of the Finance Committee. I am a member of the other party from this Senator, but I say publicly that under his leadership, this legislation has moved along to a point where we are now passing a bill. 
I am sure the senior Senator from Delaware has many things that he is proud of having done in his long legislative career, but I hope today's resolution of this very important issue will be near the top of his legislative list of accomplishments. I am very happy with having worked with him, with the senior Senator from Nebraska, and with Senator Grassley from Iowa, to the point that the legislation which we introduced a year or so ago is now going to become law. I also want to recognize the essential role played by my good friend the ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan. 
I, again think this legislation is reflective of how our country works when the people of this country speak out loud enough for us to get the message. We have gotten the message. Hopefully, we have answered the concerns of the American public. I am confident that we have.  
Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, all Senators in this body who have a military installation in their States should be concerned if my amendment does not pass because, in effect, what this language that I am trying to have stricken today does is guarantee the future of Mountain Home Air Base. That is what this is all about. This enlargement is simply to stop there being a further round of closures that affects Mountain Home Air Base. 
This amendment would prevent the unnecessary expansion of Mountain Home Air Base. This is a training range, an Air Force range in Idaho. Since 1991--in fact, since the early 1980s, the Air Force has sought to expand the training areas used by pilots operating from Mountain Home Air Base in southern Idaho. 
These training areas are made up of the airspace over the Owyhee Canyon lands and range from southern Idaho to eastern Oregon and northern Nevada. 
First of all, let me talk a little bit about the Owyhee Indian Reservation. This is a Shoshone Paiute Tribe consisting of a little over 2,000 members. The area that they were placed by the Federal Government is an area that is beautiful, but very stark and cold. Many times during the winter, you will find the coldest place in the United States is the Wild Horse Reservoir located some 20 miles below the reservation. This is a very cold place. But in spite of it being cold about 9 months out of the year, it is a beautiful place. 
The Owyhee--O-W-Y-H-E-E--Reservation also has running through it the Owyhee River. This is one of the most beautiful areas anyplace in the United States. 
How did the name Owyhee originate? If you ask one of the Indians from the reservation, they will tell you it is very simple. Last century, some trappers from Hawaii came to trap on the river in the area. They were never heard from again. No one knows what happened to them. From that time forward, this whole area has been known as Owyhee, a derivation of a Hawaiian name--O-W-Y-H-E-E--Canyon. The lands range from southern Idaho, eastern Oregon, northern Nevada. 
The Air Force is saying this will improve their ability to train at this range. They are saying it is inconvenient for them to have to fly to Utah, to Oregon and Nevada to train. That is just a way of trying to establish an air base that won't be taken away in the future. There is no reason to enlarge this air base; none whatsoever. The longest flight they have to take now to do their training in Nevada, Utah or one of the other bases in the area is about 40 minutes. It doesn't seem like a very long time. If, in fact, we are able to have our amendment adopted by this body, they will still have to fly to these areas. So this does not take away the necessity of having to have their pilots fly to other areas to train. 
Why is this language in the defense authorization bill which will expand the training range and associated airspace? It is not about training and readiness. That is taken care of. This is about base realignment and closure. This is about something we call BRAC. This is about almost $32 million being used to buy BRAC insurance for Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. 
It seems somewhat unusual to me that in this bill we are fighting to have money for projects that are extremely important for the readiness of the military. It seems real unusual to me and most everyone else who looks at this as to why we have to spend $32 million of money that we don't have and can't afford to enlarge a base that shouldn't be expanded. 
It is about trying to make Mountain Home too attractive to close, while other bases in other parts of this country are closing. It should come as no surprise that this range expansion is not needed and is a waste of taxpayers' money. 
Mr. President, let me read from an Air Force audit report. This is an audit report of the inspector general of the Department of Defense verbatim:  
The Air Force has not . . . proved why existing training ranges cannot continue to provide composite force training. Establishing the Idaho Training Range would be an exception to the overall DOD attempt to downsize infrastructure. 
I continue the quote: 
The Assistant Secretary asserted that Saylor Creek can support day-to-day training performed by the composite wing. In summary, the Utah, Nellis and Fallon ranges are suitable for composite force training and the ranges have the required airspace and ground areas. During our audit, the 336th wing officials-- 
That's Mountain Home---- stated that all the training requirements were being met with the Saylor Creek range and the Utah, Nellis and Fallon ranges. Our review showed that the capabilities of the Utah range satisfy the currently described training quality attributes applicable to the 366th. The Air Force chief of staff, plans and operations, has acknowledged that the ITR was not necessary for composite force training. The deputy chief of staff stated that using existing assets, the wing has trained adequately and has become combat ready. It seems very clear and unambiguous. 
Mr. President, further, a draft audit from the inspector general went on to say: 
The Air Force's proposed Idaho Training Range is an unwarranted duplication of existing DOD tactical training ranges. Also, the Air Force cost-benefit analysis to justify the Idaho Training Range is not valid. We attributed these conditions to the State of Idaho's efforts to influence the fiscal year 1995 base closure selection process and an eagerness by both Air Force and Idaho officials to establish the training range. 
Therefore, the Air Force and the Idaho Air National Guard will unnecessarily spend $35.4 million. 
Which has been cut down a few million. 
Further, Mr. President, a Department of the Air Force memorandum from assistant inspector general of auditing a couple years ago states: 
The draft report is largely devoted to establishing what the Air Force has long acknowledged--the State's proposed Idaho Training Range is not a necessity for composite wing training in Idaho. 
That is really it. There is no reason to have it. There is no request for it. The reasons haven't changed since the inspector general made his report. 
In this same audit, the Secretary of Defense asserted that the existing range can support the day-to-day activities that are necessary. Even the Air Force stated that the `Air Force has long acknowledged the State's proposed Idaho Training Range is not a necessity. . ..' 
What does this unwarranted duplication of existing assets cost? Almost $32 million for an expansion the Air Force admits is not necessary, even as the Secretary of Defense calls for another round of base closures just to make ends meet. 
We also have another very unique land policy issue, and that is, there is a cowboy whose statements I have read. He doesn't want to leave his ranch and is not going to have to leave his ranch. But about 5 percent of his many thousands of acres are going to be taken by the Air Force. 
In compensation for this, he is going to get anywhere from $250,000 to $1 million. I must say, Mr. President, this is the first time that the land managers are aware of ever paying anybody for a privilege. That is, people who have grazing lands have the privilege of grazing cattle on those lands. Why should we pay somebody for that privilege? It seems it should be the other way around. 
In addition to that, this gentleman is being compensated for water lines that he has put in, fencing he has put in and also he is going to be guaranteed makeup for the grazing lands that are taken from him. It seems like a pretty good deal to me, that he, in effect, loses nothing but makes anywhere from a quarter of a million to a million dollars. 
The Bureau of Land Management does not recognize these lands as being available for sale or in need of compensation. 
This is simply wrong. 
Let's talk about the environment, the wildlife and also about Native Americans. There are many reasons to oppose it. I have outlined a number of them already. It is an unnecessary expansion of the base because the Air Force doesn't need it. It is unnecessary compensation to a rancher, a cowboy in the area. But, these Owyhee lands are far more than just a target for Air Force bombers or a dumping ground for Air Force chaff. 
The Owyhee Canyon lands provides some of the most pristine, rugged and spectacular country in the West. Let me show you some of the areas along the Owyhee. It is a beautiful area. It is called the next Grand Canyon or the `Grand Canyon of the North.' It is just picturesque any time of the year, and this is going to be impacted significantly as a result of the language that is in this bill. 
Recently described as the `other Grand Canyon' in a prominent western magazine, the Owyhee Canyon lands are a vast network of river canyons, plateaus; this is the largest undeveloped area in the lower 48 States. 
This is a mecca for those who seek to escape the daily clutter of civilization. I repeat, these canyonlands are the largest undeveloped area in the lower 48 States. And, Mr. President, these canyonlands offer an unmolested remnant of nature. This is what it is like. Tens of thousands of people go there every year--41,000, to be exact, the last count that we had. And they are going to be devastated as a result of this area being used for low-level bombing by airplanes, low-level training by airplanes. 
Mr. President, Owyhee is the traditional homeland for the tribes of the Shoshone-Paiute. They have significant religious and cultural interests which must be protected from encroachment and desecration. Here, Mr. President, is some of the petroglyphs that are existing. They are all over this area. 
To us, the ashes of our ancestors are sacred, and their resting places are hallowed ground. Our religion is in the traditions of our ancestors, the dreams of our old men given them in solemn hours by night, by the Great Spirit, and the visions of our chiefs. And it is written in the hearts of our people. 
Chief Seattle is the one who said that. 
Mr. President, shouldn't the Native Americans have been part of this deal? Do they deserve to be ignored? They live in a very remote part of the United States, one of the most remotely settled areas in the entire United States. And they have been ignored. 
And as one newspaper reported, it seems rather unusual that there would be so much attention spent--and I quote--`It is one thing when it's a white rancher who is a significant contributor. But if it's the Native Americans who are not involved in a commercial relationship with the Federal Government, too bad for you.' 
That is from a newspaper article today, an intermountain feature exchange from the Idaho Statesman. 
It seems to me that I have no problem with this rancher caring a lot about his land. I think what I have heard about him --he has been on that land, his family has been on that land since 1880. Mr. President, those Indians have been there a lot longer than that. They deserve at least the right of somebody to consult with them. And they have been ignored. They have written a letter saying they have been ignored, they are not part of this concern, and they should have been. 
The canyonlands, Mr. President, offer a safe haven for the California bighorn sheep, the pronghorn antelope, elk, deer, and numerous plants that will require our attention if they are to survive in the future. 
Here is a picture, Mr. President, of the California bighorn sheep--one of the most magnificent animals there is. Average life expectancy of one of these animals--7 years. In that 7 years, they become a majestic animal and can do all kinds of things. They can do all kinds of athletic things that are beyond belief. We should do something to protect them. And we are not. 
These are lands which are both part of our Western heritage and part of our American future. People of the West deserve a voice in how that heritage is used and what the future is going to be. 
Today, the people of Idaho, Oregon, and Nevada have been allowed to add their voice to the chorus of those opposed to further range expansion. 
Mr. President, I think it says a lot when we understand that groups are opposed to this. They talk about an environmental impact statement, and they have a comment period. The comments were 6-1 opposed to this--opposed to this. 
Groups opposed to Mountain Home range expansion are: the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes, Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, the Idaho Wildlife Federation, Owyhee Canyonlands Coalition, Foundation for North American Wild Sheep, U.S. Public Interest Group, the National Wildlife Federation, the Nevada Wildlife Federation, the Idaho Conservation League, Friends of the Earth, The Rural Alliance for Military Accountability, the Oregon Natural Resources Council, the Idaho Whitewater Association, the Idaho Rivers United, the Committee for Idaho's High Desert, the Oregon Natural Desert Association, and the Friends of the West. 
The newspapers that are opposed to it, to name a few, are the Idaho Statesman, the Idaho Falls Post Register, the Wood River Journal News, and the Times-News. 
So I am somewhat concerned that this is in the bill. We recognize it is always much more difficult to take something out of a bill than to put something in. But we are going to proceed on that basis. 
What is being done here is simply wrong. The act bends the process. It fails to address the concerns of the tribe. We have 41,000 annual canyonland visitors a year. The agreement is not a product of public comment. The public has spoken and has clearly said they do not want the range. 
Only yesterday the Idaho Statesman, the leading paper in Idaho, reported that `Congress has a wide variety of reasons to reject the proposed training range for Mountain Home Air Base. 
It should pick one and vote no.' 
There are lots of reasons. We only need one of those reasons. There are a multitude of reasons. The fact is, the citizens of Idaho oppose this expansion 6-1, as I have said before. 
This agreement is the result of an unpleasant compromise forced on the BLM as part of a shotgun wedding with the Air Force. For the BLM, it was either the language accepted earlier this afternoon, or the even more odious agreement which was originally in the bill. And all so Mountain Home can enjoy BRAC insurance. This is not the way to craft an agreement for the public interest. 
As I have said, Mr. President, the environmental impact statement is supposed to protect all parties. It does not. The Shoshone Tribe said yesterday:  
The EIS does not even begin to account for tribal concerns and was absolutely insufficient for the purpose of making a decision regarding tribal interests. In fact, the EIS process was detrimental to Tribal archaeological resources because significant vandalism has resulted from the lack of confidentiality provisions in this part of the EIS process. 
That is why the majority of the people in the States of Nevada, Idaho, and Oregon oppose this language. The language in the agreement which addresses the tribe's sacred sites was never shown to them. Their opinion, in this end game, was never asked. 
Consistent with this approach, they are excluded from every decision in the process that has been acquired here. This, Mr. President, is wrong. 
I am a strong supporter of the men and women in our military. And as much as any American, I want to make sure that they have everything they need to be prepared to defend our Nation's interests and return home safely. 
Mr. President, over half of Nevada's airspace is dedicated to the military. Over 50 percent of the airspace over the State of Nevada is dedicated to the military. But they want more. They are gluttons, Mr. President. They cannot get enough. Over half of the airspace of the State of Nevada is already dedicated to the military. And I see no reason that there must be more given, more taken. 
The Air Force has not justified its need to spend $32 million. And they do not need more airspace. Remember, if they get more airspace, they are still going to go to Oregon, still going to go to Utah, still going to go to Nevada. 
Mr. President, they are going to come on and say, well, we are only going to fly so high or so low. Who is going to enforce that? Who are the air police? They do not have them. Anyone who has flown an airplane in the military knows those rules are not enforced. 
Look what took place in Italy just a short time ago. That was in force because they hit a cable on a gondola at a ski operation. But to say we are only going to fly this high or this low is ridiculous. Everybody knows there is no way to enforce that. 
The agreement in this bill is stealth legislation. I believe in stealth in the military, but not in the legislative process. 
Mr. President, we have numerous letters. I would ask the Chair, how much time has the Senator from Nevada used of the 1 hour?

Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are numerous newspaper articles from all over the country. But let us just focus on a few. Let us talk about a newspaper article from Idaho Falls where they talked in the Post Register. `The U.S. Air Force keeps trying to build a new bombing range at its Mountain Home base--but it still hasn't got it right.' 
They acknowledge that this is `the most spectacular canyonlands left in North America.' They talk about certain concessions the military has attempted to make. 
But these concessions are irrelevant [though, says the newspaper] when placed next to what the Air Force has in mind. It wants to fly thousands of bombing missions, hammering the countryside. This activity would occur in a countryside where solitude recreation is becoming increasingly popular. 
And it is the home of rare California bighorn sheep, not to mention a rich spectrum of high desert wildlife. Biologists will tell you that bighorn sheep don't schedule their lambing to suit the air force bombing runs. They haven't addressed [the newspaper article goes on to say] the 500 archaeological sites in the Owyhee Canyon lands. Some of these sites are the most important to the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe. 
They go on to say, recently as late at 1995, 1996, the Air Force said they didn't need the land. 
The Idaho Falls Post Register, again, says, `You would expect something this important'--talking about this legislation--`would warrant a separate piece of legislation.' They go on to say, `No, it is sneaked into an appropriations bill.' There will be no public hearings. The voices of thousands of Idahoans who overwhelmingly opposed the Air Force bombing range during a series of forums will be silenced. Idahoans won't be able to talk about the loss of solitude in an area so popular with fishermen, hikers, and ranchers, and Native Americans won't be able to express their concerns, and no Idahoan will be allowed to tell the Congress that building a bombing range for pilots who already can fly to the ranges in nearby Utah is wasting taxpayers' dollars. 
Mr. President, they go on to say `the politically contrived pack is silent about how the Air Force will respect areas in the Duck Valley Reservation.' It gives the Air Force the right to fly twice a month at 500 feet. The Air Force promises to alert the public in advance--as if everybody is standing at attention for this announcement. 
The Twin Falls newspaper says: Why is this training range necessary? It is not. It is not as if the new lean and mean Air Force doesn't have other options to the west for the composite wing station. At Mountain Home, the Owyhee Canyon lands is a convenience, not a necessity. They go on to say it is just that in an era where the Federal Government is supposed to be trimmed down and subcompact, the proposed Owyhee training range seems to be more like a Cadillac hood ornament. 
The Twin Falls newspaper, the Times News: The real issue is, will the military be allowed to lock up this irreplaceable gem of God's creation for the sake of a shorter commute? Eight years into this debate and we still haven't heard a convincing explanation why it should. This is how the people of Idaho, the people of Nevada, how the people of Oregon feel about this. That is why the groups I have listed--Oregon Natural Resources Counsel, the Rural Alliance for Military Accountability, Friends of Earth, and dozens of other groups--think this idea is scatter-brained and not very wise. 
Mr. President, we have numerous articles. I also state that yesterday there was a statement made when there was a perfecting amendment--there was, in fact, a photo shown, but the Owyhee Canyon lands photo is a photo of the Tules and East Fork of the Owyhee River. The area is not covered by altitude restrictions described by the person moving the amendment. The restrictions extend upriver to Battle Creek. The Tules area is east of this. 
Now public comments. The movement of the perfecting amendment yesterday failed to disclose that of the thousands of comments submitted, the substance of the comments--I repeat, 6-1, 86 percent are opposed to this deal; 86 percent are opposed to the Air Force proposal. 
The tribes weren't at the table; the tribes weren't present at the meetings of any of the Senators who moved the amendments. Tribal concerns have not been met. The tribes remain opposed. One completed study, funded by the Air Force, shows irreversible harm to tribal culture by this proposal. 
Mr. President, there is no reason to do this. Rancher Brackett will not go out of business as a result of this proposal. The impact of the allotment represents 5 percent of his total operation. The intention of the amendment, very graciously, is to compensate the rancher for loss of grazing allotments and then find replacement allotments of equal value. Brackett has an agreement with BLM to commence an environmental assessment, confer over 3,000 temporary AUMs--animal unit months--to the Juniper area, which would require compensation. It seems unfair and unwise. 
Mr. President, training will continue. It is not going to change. This is for the benefit of the Air Force, to give them BRAC insurance. There is no other reason for this. It is a range of convenience. It is detrimental to the environment. If we look to the future, this training range is not futuristic, it is something that is looking to the past. And certainly, with our constrained budget, and attempting to balance the budget, it is unwise. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, to delete this language from the bill, save the taxpayers a huge amount of money today and large amounts of money in the future. 
I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Idaho indicates that he wants to make sure that the pilots don't fly in harm's 
way. The pilots who fly out of Mountain Home are treated fairly. They have all they need to be the best that they can be. 
I refer to what the Air Force said themselves. I quote the Air Force deputy chief of staff. He acknowledged that `the Idaho training range was not strictly necessary for composite force training.' The deputy chief of staff said, `The division already met training needs using the existing range at Saylor Creek, as well as the ranges in Idaho and Nevada.' 
Here is what General Ken Peck had to say, the wing commander: `We are the most combat capable unit anywhere in the world right now.' 
So I don't think we can stretch this by saying that if this amendment does not pass, the Air Force pilots are going to be flying in harm's way. Quite to the contrary. According to the commander of the 336th Wing, `We are the most combat capable unit anywhere in the world right now.' Why? Because they fly, at the most, 40 minutes to do training. They can train at Mountain Home, but at the most, 40 minutes. 
Mr. President, let me also say that I have mentioned a number of the environmental groups. Everyone should understand that they haven't had many environmental votes this year. This is one of them. The League of Conservation Voters feels very strongly about this. They have written letters. They have done telephone calls. They have sent e-mail. They sent faxes. This is something the League of Conservation Voters are going to look at very closely. 
Mr. President, has the training of the last 7 years been sufficient or inadequate? The Air Force can disagree, as I have already indicated from the commander of the base. We must focus on the justification for the proliferation of more Air Force space. It is simply unneeded. Is it necessary to spend $32 million? The answer is no. We are trying to save money, not spend it unnecessarily. As I have said before, this is BRAC insurance for Mountain Home Air Base. 
What does the new tribal council say about the sites? They say that they have people come to the reservation on many occasions but, of course, have not consulted with the tribe. They have come through and told the tribe what they are going to do, and that is indicated. It is important to do that. They have been ignored. 
The picture that has been shown by my friend from Idaho shows this desert area. Mr. President, what do you fly over to get to that? You fly over this to get to that. You fly over this land. That is the problem. We admit they are not going to be strafing and dropping bombs in this area. But they are going to be flying over this to get to the other area. 
I repeat: Who is going to be the air police? Are we going to have helicopters up there 500 feet, and, if you go below that, you hit a helicopter? The answer is no. There is no air police. The airspace is violated continually. Anyone who has an airbase in their State knows that. These pilots do their best. Sometimes their best is not good enough. They must fly over these wilderness areas, these pristine areas, to get to the area in the picture my friend showed. 
Mr. President, who called them about the agreement on the sacred sites in this bill? The answer is no one. Everybody was shut out over the site. The Air Force didn't like what was being said. Remember, we talk about thousands, or more, comments--1,000 or more comments, and 86 percent of them were opposed to it. You can go around and get all the comments you want, if you are going to ignore them. That is what was done here. 
I admit that taking taxpayer money and spending it unnecessarily is a bipartisan objective around here. I agree with my friend from Idaho. Money is spent unnecessarily by Democrats and Republicans, and that is what is being done here. 
It seems funny, as reported in the Idaho press, that the only person being compensated is a caucasian farmer. The Indians who have their tribal lands violated, their sacred sites violated, their life disturbed, are not getting 5 cents. 
They will be able to fly over Jack's Creek, an area that BLM didn't want to give up--270 square miles of pristine land. 
Mr. President, I think the most impressive thing here is how the Federal Government has attempted to get insurance. It is not on the market in most places. In Congress it is. They can come in here and buy BRAC insurance so that next time we do base closings--everybody knows Mountain Home just barely made it last time. This is an effort to assure that Mountain Home won't close next time. 
I want to make sure, because they are never represented in the halls of Congress, or rarely so, and certainly the Owyhee Indians are not represented--I want everyone to understand that they feel they have been had, that they have not been treated fairly, and they feel their lands have been taken from them this time and in the past. In the past, we can't do much about that, but we certainly can do something about this time. 
This amendment should pass. It is a fair thing to do. It is the right thing to do. It is the good thing to do for the military of this country. 
And it is the best thing we could possibly do for the taxpayers of this country. Right off the bat, we would save $32 million. 
I reserve the remainder of my time. 
I say to the chairman of the committee, the manager of the bill, that I only have one Senator I know who has indicated he wants to come and speak on this issue, and we are making a call. If he does not want to come, maybe we can yield back our time.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Oregon was coming to the floor to speak, but there is an illness in his family, and he will be unable to come. 
What we have to understand is why, if the previous information that they had given to the Senate regarding the audit was not accurate, why wasn't another audit done? 
The electronic range that is being talked about here is essentially the same, although it has shifted a little to the east. Both proposals feature supersonic operations, low-level flight, flare and chaff and composite force exercises over vast areas of public lands. 
The generic components of the electronic battlefield and bombing range have been juggled around geographically in the airspace, but have remained essentially the same and are designed to support the same kind of training which has been judged to be redundant by the Department of Defense inspector general in the audit report. 
There has been some talk that the tribe has been consulted many times. This is what the tribe says: 
The EIS does not even begin to account for tribal concerns and was absolutely insufficient for the purpose of making a decision regarding tribal interests. In fact, the EIS process was detrimental to Tribal archeological resources because significant vandalism has resulted from the lack of confidentiality provisions in this part of the EIS process. 
The tribe doesn't like this deal. They don't like it in one respect, two respects; they don't like it in any respects. 
My friend, the senior Senator from Idaho, says this has nothing to do with BRAC insurance. I only refer to the junior Senator from Idaho in a speech where he said, it was reported in the Mountain Home News earlier this year: 
The range will be a great insurance policy for Mountain Home Air Force Base. 
That is a quote. `The range will be a great insurance policy for Mountain Home Air Force Base,' Mountain Home News, February 25, 1998. 
The Owyhee Canyon Lands Coalition, speaking for all the environmental groups, said: 
We have always considered the electronic warfare range to be at least as objectionable as the Juniper Butte target site. 
We have heard talk on the floor that there is no compensation involved. All you have to do is read from the language of the bill that we are trying to have stricken: 
The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized and directed upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary considers just to conclude and implement agreements with the permittees-- 
Of course, there is only one-- to provide appropriate consideration. 
I have not practiced law in a number of years. I am a lawyer, and I know consideration means compensation. That is what the bill says. 
I talked about the Air Force really having quite an appetite. They have about 50 percent of the land in the State of Nevada. Here is what they have in the State of Utah, which 
is 175 miles from Mountain Home. How long does it take those jets to go 175 miles? You can figure it out. Not very long. Ten minutes? Fifteen minutes? Half hour? The north range is about 175 miles from Mountain Home and consists of 350,000 acres of land for exclusive DOD use. They are begging for business. They want Mountain Home to come and fly there. It has all kinds of great craters and a helicopter air-to-ground complex. It has everything they need for this composite wing in Utah. 
They have Nellis, a large base. I say to my friend from Idaho, the senior Senator, the Nellis Air Force Base range is one of the best in the world, if not the best, but Nellis Air Force Base is right in the middle of town. It is not rural Nevada. It is right in the middle of Las Vegas. You can fly from there over the great range. They can go over to Fallon, a great training facility which they use all the time. 
The extension of this base is unnecessary. Based upon the statements made by Commanding General Ken Peck who is, remember, the commander of the 336th: `We are the most capable combat unit anywhere in the world right now.' It doesn't mean after they get these additional acres. It means they are the most efficient, the most capable combat unit anywhere in the world right now. 
I say to my colleagues, this legislation is important. This amendment is important. This is what the taxpayers put us here to do: to save money. By voting yes on this amendment--no on the motion to table--you will be saving this Government $32 million to begin with, and allowing in the future the necessary consideration to go forward as to whether or not this base should be closed. This is fair to the Native Americans who have been ignored in this process. It is fair to the taxpayers, and certainly fair to the environment and the people who support the environment. This is a vote that will be scored by a number of environmental organizations, as well it should be. This is an important environmental vote. It is an environmental vote, I think, for setting the tone for this Congress. 
I say to the manager of the bill, I don't know if my two friends from Idaho have more to say. Otherwise, I will be happy to yield back time.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is an amendment sponsored by Senators Reid, Bryan, Inouye, Wyden, Kerrey of Nebraska, Durbin, Murray and Feingold. 
What this is all about is inserted in this bill is something called BRAC insurance to prevent the Mountain Home Air Base from in the future being closed. That is all this is. 
It will cost the Government $32 million unnecessarily. You compensate a rancher for the first time in the history of this country for having a privilege. The Government is paying somebody for using our land, in effect. Environmentally, every group in America is opposed to what is in this bill that we are attempting to take out. 
The Indians' rights have been stomped upon. There are environmental impact statements out there--86 percent of the respondents were opposed to this. Every newspaper in the State of Idaho is opposed to what they are trying to accomplish; Oregon, Nevada is against it. This is something that is unnecessary. It is a range of convenience. 
I read from the Idaho Statesman newspaper: 
So the question is: Should taxpayers spend $30 million to build another range and risk losing more high desert wilderness so the Air Force can save a few million in fuel, maintenance and operations costs for training out of the state? 
The answer is no. It's not an acceptable trade-off. The area is far more valuable for its natural resources--especially since the Air Force has shown its range proposal to be only convenient, rather than undeniably essential for national security or pilot safety. 
To show how unnecessary this is, I refer to General Ken Peck, the commander of the 366th Wing, which is this Mountain Home Air Base commander. `We are the most combat-capable unit anywhere in the world right now.' 
This is not needed. I ask my colleagues to oppose this motion to table for the taxpayers of this country.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the `Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act of 1998' (RMRA). This legislation repeals a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA 97) that imposes a $1500 annual per beneficiary cap on Medicare outpatient rehabilitation services. RMRA directs the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to develop and implement an alternative payment system that is based on individual diagnosis and prior therapy in both inpatient and outpatient facilities by January 1, 2000. 
The BBA created annual caps for two categories of therapy provided to beneficiaries under Medicare Part B: a $1500 annual cap on physical therapy and speech language combined; and a separate cap for occupational therapy. These arbitrary limits on rehabilitation therapy were hastily included in the BBA without the benefit of Congressional hearings or thorough review by HCFA. As a result, the $1500 limits bear no relation to the medical condition of the patient, or the health outcomes of the rehabilitative services. 
The $1500 cap would create serious access and quality problems for Medicare's oldest and sickest beneficiaries. Senior citizens who suffer from common conditions such as stroke, hip fracture, and coronary artery disease, will not be able to obtain the rehabilitative services they need to resume normal activities of daily living. A stroke patient typically requires more than $3,000 in physical therapy alone. Rehabilitation therapy for a patient suffering from Multiple Sclerosis or ALS costs even more. Without access to outpatient therapy, patients must remain in institutional settings longer, be transferred to a higher cost hospital facility, or in some cases, just go without necessary services. 
Coverage for rehabilitative therapy should be based on medically necessary treatment, not arbitrary spending limits that ignore a patient's clinical needs. I urge you to join me in protecting Medicare's most vulnerable beneficiaries by supporting the `Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act of 1998'.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday the chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee and I came to the floor with this bill, the fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill, for the programs, projects, and activities of the Department of Energy, Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, and other independent agencies. I support this $21 billion bill. It is not a perfect bill, but it is a very good bill. We worked under very extreme conditions in order to get the bill to the point that we have. This is a balanced bill. We did our best to accommodate everyone's priorities and projects. 
Mr. President, on the way back to my office yesterday evening I was with some of the staff, and I asked one of the staff, `What is that you're carrying?' And I am not exaggerating, it was a folder, a big looseleaf notebook. And he said they were the requests from Members for projects in this bill. 
We did our best. We did not make everyone happy. We tried to make sure that we had a balanced approach so that States could meet their needs. 
We did not get all the cooperation that I would like to have had from the administration. They cut $1.5 billion from water projects. This left us with projects unfinished, left us with projects that simply needed to go forward. So we had to rearrange this pot to the point we are now here. 
So I recommend this bill to my colleagues. This is a bill that includes about $21 billion for essential services in the Department of Energy and the construction and maintenance of water projects around the Nation. 
I hope that, as my friend from Washington has said, Members will come forward and offer amendments. We have a limited amount of time. And I would suggest that if we do not get some amendments coming soon--this a very important appropriations bill--that we should move to third reading and move on to something else.

As we have said earlier, the administration recommended a higher level for this particular program--solar and renewable. The movers of this amendment have also recommended that this body move higher with solar and renewable. I think that their efforts are certainly to be congratulated. 
It is a very difficult bill, as we have explained on other occasions. There is a limited amount of money to do a number of different things. The Senator from Vermont has done a very good job of explaining the importance of renewable energy in this country. Of course, he mentioned a number of programs in Nevada that are important. We have geothermal. We have solar that we are working on. So we certainly look forward to working with him on this amendment.

I believe in these programs. I think it would be to everyone's interest that we go ahead on that basis. I don't think it would serve anyone's interest, after we have agreed to accept this amendment, to now have a full debate on it. If, in fact, my friend from Vermont wants one, we can do that. There are things in the program we can all talk about that I think would be better left for a later time. 
But I will do my share with the chairman of the subcommittee, with those of us on this side of the aisle in the conference, to do everything we can to raise the number as high as we can.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, we would like to go to third reading early this afternoon. I say, also, to elaborate on what my friend from New Mexico says, there has been a lot of partisan rancor on this floor the last several weeks. 
But as I said when we introduced this bill yesterday, there are times on this Senate floor--a lot more often than people are led to believe--when things move along very well, in a bipartisan fashion. There is no better example of that than every year when we get to the appropriations bills. Sometimes we have partisan problems, but not often. I think the two leaders of this Appropriations Committee, the senior Senator from Alaska and the senior Senator from West Virginia, have set a very good tone as to how we should move on these bills. They work very well together, and they have for many years. The Senator from New Mexico and I have worked together for a number of years on this bill. 
This is a good bill, a very important bill for this country, not only for domestic purposes, water projects, but also for the security of this Nation. Much of what is in this $21 billion appropriations bill deals with security of this Nation, our nuclear arsenal--the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. 
So I say to my friends in the Senate that not everything we do is partisan in nature. There are certain things that rise above that. This bill is one of those times when partisanship should have no bearing, as it hasn't in the last several years. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, today an announcement was made by the President that we are going to have a new Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, a former Congressman from the State of New Mexico, now our ambassador to the United Nations. 
In 1982, I came to the Congress with Bill Richardson. We were both in the class of 1982. He had a long and distinguished career in the House where he served honorably on a number of committees, including Commerce. Of course, during the time he was a Member of the House of Representatives, he did some very unusual but very important diplomatic maneuvers--freeing various people held as political prisoners, and other efforts, which were extremely important, not only to this country but for world peace. The President had recognized that and he selected Bill Richardson to be our ambassador to the United Nations, where he has served honorably. 
The need for former Congressman Richardson, now Ambassador Richardson, to return to Washington has been noticed by the President. As a result of Secretary Pena retiring, we now have a tremendous need for someone who understands Washington, and certainly Bill Richardson does that; someone who understands Government, and certainly Bill Richardson does understand Government; someone who has an understanding of the importance of the Energy Department, and Bill Richardson has that understanding based upon his being from New Mexico where so much dealing with things nuclear have taken place for the last 60 years. 
So, Mr. President, I am elated and enthused about the new Secretary Richardson. He has big shoes to fill, as Secretary Pena has done an outstanding job. Secretary Pena has approached his job in a bipartisan fashion. Even though he is part of this administration, he has reached out to Chairman Domenici and the ranking member of this subcommittee in trying to be fair and reasonable in his approach to issues that are so important to this country and to the world. 
I applaud and commend the administration for selecting Bill Richardson to be the next Secretary of Energy. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I say this with the greatest respect for my friend from Indiana, we have not only received calls from the New Jersey delegation, but have received calls from Illinois, Montana, Connecticut. Some people may not have a concern with this bill but have one of their own dealing with the transportation of waste, trash. I just have told them to stay in their offices until we see if we can get this worked out. I am really concerned about this kind of bogging things down, for lack of a better description. 
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can also elaborate on what my friend, the manager of the bill, has said, there is no Senator in this body who has been more diligent on an issue than has the Senator from Indiana been on this issue of transportation of waste. He has rendered a great service not only to the people of the State of Indiana, but this country. I join in his appreciation for the Senator from Indiana allowing this bill to move forward.

Mr. REID. The Department of Energy is negotiating a contract involving the Nevada Test Site and the Western Area Power Administration to purchase 5 to 10 megawatts of solar energy on behalf of the Nevada Test Site. A single bidder; the Corporation for Solar Technologies and Renewable Resources, has been selected through a competitive process and the Department is in the process of determining on what terms it should enter into such a contract.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to take just a minute to express my appreciation for the work of the chairman of the subcommittee. We have worked hard to get the bill passed. It is now passed. 
I also have expressed on the record on a number of occasions what a pleasant arrangement the senior Senator from New Mexico and I have on this legislation. I reiterate that. I also want to express my appreciation for the hard work done by Senator Domenici's staff, Alex Flint, the majority clerk, David Gwaltney, who handled the water project, which is very large and significant in this bill. They are very professional and work very hard. The taxpayers get more than their money's worth from these gentlemen. 
I also express publicly my appreciation for Greg Daines, minority clerk, who worked very hard on this legislation for months, getting it to the point where we now are. I have a very important congressional fellow who has worked with me on this legislation and others, Bob Perret, who has done an outstanding job. 
Also, I want to express my appreciation to Lashawnda Leftwich, who is the staff assistant to Mr. Flint, the majority clerk in this matter, and also Liz Blevins, the staff assistant to the minority clerk. We have, I think, a good team, a good group of people here who have worked very hard together. Again, I express my appreciation to the chairman of the subcommittee.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, as ranking member of this subcommittee, I recommend this bill to my colleagues. 
I first of all want to say that we hear so much in the press about the partisan nature of this Congress. And there is, I think, in the minds of most everyone too much partisanship. But I think the Appropriations Committee is a place to look to see bipartisanship, to see a model as to how we can get along to make progress. This bill is a bill that was done on a bipartisan basis. The ranking member, I, and the chairman of the subcommittee, the senior Senator from New Mexico, have worked very hard to come up with a bill that is the most just and fair bill we could come up with. 
This is a very important bill. It deals with many different aspects of our society. We realize the importance of this legislation. The chairman and the ranking member, as a result of that, have worked very closely together. We have a harmonious relationship between ourselves and our staffs. 
I repeat, the two Members operate this subcommittee. I extend my arm of friendship to my senior colleague, the chairman of this subcommittee, who has been very forthright. I have been included in all the meetings with Cabinet officials and others to come up with this bill. 
But I also say to the administration that we have a constitutional form of government. We have to protect the legislative aspect of this separation of powers document. The administration did not, in my opinion, treat us fairly with this bill. As a result of this, because we have broad and equal say in what goes on in this country as a legislative branch, we step forth and rearrange the priorities of this bill. We did it in a way that protects ongoing projects that are essential to various parts of this country. 
We feel that we have come up with something that is fair 
and that is reasonable. There are programs that have been itemized for projects and activities of the Department of Energy, the Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and other independent agencies. 
I repeat that I support the approximately $21 billion in appropriations to this Senate. I recommend this to the Senate as a whole. 
I can't overemphasize the fiscal tension between these programs that we worked to make a balance. The Department of Energy, the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation recognize some of it. 
On the defense side of this bill, there is a very close, important relationship that we have with the security of this country. Some of these programs are relatively nondiscretionary, since we must provide for the stockpile stewardship management program, defense environmental management, and the naval reactor program. 
I repeat, the chairman and I have worked very hard to find a balance in this bill and recognize this bill is far from perfect, but it is the best that two human beings could do to balance the separate interests--the hundreds and hundreds of requests that we get from the 98 other Senators. So we have not accommodated everyone's priorities--not every State's priorities or the projects--but we have done the very best that we could. 
Mr. President, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation: 
It is no secret that the budget request sent to us by the President would have increased some solar and renewable activities while devastating the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation projects. But everyone should understand that we did an excellent job, in my opinion, with solar and renewable. We are willing to bring at the right time solar-renewable up to last year's limit. That will be very difficult to do. But we will do that. But we have taken pretty good care of other programs. We have done a good job of increasing the hydrogen aspect. That is very important. We have done a good job with wind energy. 
So I don't really apologize to anyone for the work that we have done in this bill. I don't apologize for what we have done with the tools we have with solar-renewable activities. 
Mr. President, we hear a lot about water projects as if there is something wrong with a water project because the term `project' is connected to it. But let's talk about some. I am going to pick at random some of the water projects in this bill and indicate to this body and to anyone within the sound of my voice why these projects are important. 
Take a place in North Dakota. Mr. President, North Dakota doesn't have a lot of people. I don't know if it is the State with the smallest number of people in it in this Union or not. But, if not, it is one of the smallest. North Dakota doesn't come to us with a large congressional delegation, but we felt, in fairness to the people of that small State, that we should do something about an act of nature that devastated a place called Devil's Lake. That certainly is a name that is appropriate because that lake is unending in spreading out over that part of the country. We have put money into this for flood control projects in North Dakota. We have, for example, $8 million for construction of another outlet on Devil's Lake. This is important because that lake just continues to grow. Never in recorded history has this lake been the size that it is, wiping out highways, people's farms, people's homes. 
That is one of the projects in this bill. 
In the Mississippi delta region, Davis Pond, LA, this is a pond that diverts fresh water from the Mississippi to the coastal bays and marshes, but also mitigates any negative environmental impacts of freshwater diversion. It is a large project, $16 million, essential to that very important part of that country. 
Mr. President, I have traveled in California to look at the California bay-delta. I didn't do a very good job of looking at it because El NinAE6o got in the way. The rains were torrential, and I wasn't able to see very much. 
The State of California has 33 million people. This project, which we were very generous in funding last year, and this will be the second year, is said by most people to be the most important environmental project in this country ongoing today. This bill has $65 million it added to some $85 million we put in last year. I think that was the number. But it is so important to that massive State to try to get things under control out there. We have environmental interests. We have agricultural interests. We have big cities. We have little cities, many different problems that we have there, and these people are all sitting down and talking about it. This is our recognition that progress is being made. 
There is something in here that I am sure some of the press will focus on--what could this be--aquatic plant control. This is a strange-sounding name. Why should there be any money put in this? I wish we could appropriate ten times more money than the $4 million we put in this because it is badly needed. This $4 million is so important because we have aquatic plants which can and do hinder navigation. They undermine flood-control efforts. They threaten agriculture and public health. 
Now, you have, for example, in Lake Champlain, VT, a problem with something called the water chestnut and Eurasian Milfoil. State and local governments are desperate for help because these plants are invasive. They are interfering with the lives of the people of Vermont and that part of the country. 
We have in the western part of the United States a tree that was imported to stop the erosion of banks and rivers and streams. These things, called salt cedar trees or tamarisks, are literally ruining streams, agricultural ponds, rivers. We in Nevada, for example, have very few rivers, and they are not powerful rivers. The only real powerful river we have is the Colorado, but on some of these smaller streams this plant is devastating, ruining agriculture. So I wish we could put a lot more money into this to help places like Lake Champlain and others throughout the United States. 
Dredging of ports and harbors along the Atlantic and Pacific coastlines, as well as the harbors in the Gulf of Mexico, no small task for the Corps of Engineers. On an annual basis, U.S. ports and harbors handle an estimated $600 billion in international cargo, generating over $150 million in tax revenue. So that is part of the responsibility in our bill, to make sure the ports in the Atlantic and Pacific and Gulf of Mexico can handle their small navigation projects, totaling less than $10 million, but they are large navigation projects. 
As an example, the New York and New Jersey channels need to be deepened, dredging and other corps operations to permit commercial navigation traffic through the complex river-harbor system they have. These projects are funded in this bill at 
over $50 million. They are important to the literal survival of the commerce of New Jersey and New York. 
There are things in this bill on which we have to go forward, and it is not fair, in my opinion, that the administration cut back on these ongoing projects. We just could not stop the projects. 
So these kinds of projects have been priorities of Members and funded through nondefense dollars. This bill is as important as the defense authorization bill and the defense appropriations bill which will come up for the security of this Nation. No question about that in my mind. While the allocations provided the subcommittee for the Army Corps of Engineers was higher than the President's request, it was still over $200 million less than last year's level. 
Now, I want to say one other thing that I think is important, and again I express my appreciation to the chairman of the subcommittee. The subcommittee mark has a section in the bill that reports and addresses the concerns about the management and regulatory oversight at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. As I stated in the markup before the full committee, Senators Chafee and Baucus, who are the authorizing full committee leaders of Environment and Public Works, do a good job, and we have requested and they have accepted the responsibility of taking a look at some of the things going on at the NRC. 
Again, I express my appreciation to the chairman of the subcommittee for cooperating on this issue. We have a responsibility as the appropriators to make sure that the taxpayers' dollars that we appropriate are used fairly. I have a very, very strong feeling that it is topheavy at the NRC. I have talked to people there who believe it is topheavy, too much management. We need to make sure there is an examination of this commission so that there are more people to do the work at the lower levels, and we do a good job of limiting management. 
I thank the junior Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, for working with us and whose efforts on behalf of the employees living in Maryland were of great value as we reexamined the funding levels and language. There are people who work there who need to make sure they are still there able to do the work and we relieve a little of the dead weight, frankly, at the higher levels. This is something we need to revisit next year if this isn't resolved during this coming year. 
Mr. President, we have the responsibility for the Nation's nuclear stockpile. I am not going to spend a lot of time on that tonight other than to say the Senate has to realize that this is an awesome responsibility we have, the chairman and the ranking member, to make sure there is adequate money to take care of our nuclear stockpile. We have to make sure the nuclear stockpile we have is safe and reliable. We no longer do underground testing, but we still have as large a responsibility as we ever had to make sure our stockpile is safe and reliable. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is something that this country adheres to, but we go one step further than most countries; we make sure the stockpile we have, I repeat, is safe and is reliable. That is what we are trying to do with this bill, and $4.5 billion a year is barely enough to do it. We can't have that cut down at all, or we will have some significant problems in this country. 
We can't put the nuclear genie back in the bottle. It is open. It is there, as indicated in the actions that have been taken by the countries of India and Pakistan. We have a responsibility, however, to make sure that we safeguard our nuclear stockpile. 
So I think we have done that in this bill. We have good teamwork between the laboratories and the Nevada Test Site. We have tried to make a good balance there. I think we are looking at, also, some great science that is being conducted in those national laboratories, which are a jewel this country has. These laboratories do the finest raw science of any place in the world, and their job is only going to become more difficult now that we have stopped underground nuclear testing. 
It is going to become more difficult because they have to do it in ways that only great scientific minds can do it. They are doing great things right now with subcritical testing. That is, they will start a device and before it gets critical they stop it and, through computerization and the other means they have at their disposal, they give us information as to what would have happened had that nuclear reaction gone critical. There are other things they are doing because of the need for further evaluation of these tests. Computerization is going to increase from present models as much as 1,000 times. So there is great science taking place as generated in this bill. 
Again, I say this bill provides for some very important things for this country, in the defense field and the domestic field. I repeat, it is not a perfect bill, but we did the best we could with the tools we were given, and I recommend to the Members that we approve this just as quickly as possible. This will be the first appropriation bill in the cycle and we should get it to the President as quickly as possible. It is the first and, I think, if not the most important, one of the two or three most important appropriations bills that we have.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with the Senator from North Dakota to introduce legislation which we believe will improve fiscal management within the Federal Reserve System and will allow private-sector competitors to compete fairly in `priced services.' We assure you that nothing in this bill affects monetary policy of the Federal Reserve. 
Back in September 1993, Senator Dorgan and I requested a GAO investigation of the operations and management of the Federal Reserve System. We were concerned because no close examination of the Fed's operations had ever been conducted before. The GAO report that was issued in 1996 raised serious questions about management within the Fed which this bill will address. 
One of the most astonishing findings in the 1996 report was the Fed had squirreled-away $3.7 billion in taxpayer money in a slush fund. As of January 1998, this amount has now grown to $5.2 billion. This money could be used for deficit reduction. The Fed claims the slush fund is needed to cover system losses. Since it was created in 1913, however, the Fed has never operated at a loss. This bill prohibits maintenance of surplus accounts and the surplus funds must be sent to Treasury. 
The bill requires the Comptroller General of U.S. and the Fed Board of Governors to identify the functions and activities of the Board and each Fed bank which relate to U.S. monetary policy. After six months after enactment, all non-monetary policy expenses of Federal Reserve System, will be subject to congressional appropriations. The Fed will now have to justify its use of operating expenses. 
Because of the Fed's self-financing nature, its operating costs have escaped public investigation. In order to be fiscally responsible, all activities regarding government finances need to be scrutinized. Surprisingly, the GAO study was the very first look into the internal operations of the Fed. We think that oversight is needed on the workings of this large and influential public entity. While the rest of Federal government has tightened its belt and down-sized, the Fed enjoyed enormous growth in its operating costs and questionable growth in its staffing. 
Clearly, the Fed could do much more to increase its fiscal responsibility, particularly as it urges frugal practices for other agencies. The picture the GAO report painted of the internal management of the Fed is one of conflicting policies, questionable spending, erratic personnel treatment, and favoritism in procurement and contracting policies. 
To date, there has never been an annual, independent audit of the nation's central banking system. This bill provides for annual independent audits of the banks, the Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve System. The detection of any possible illegal acts must be reported to the Comptroller General. The bill requires an annual audit of each Federal reserve bank, the Federal reserve board of governors and in turn, an audit of the Federal reserve system. This Auditor must be a certified public accountant who is totally independent of the Fed. An annual audit is fiscally sound policy which would instill greater public confidence in our banking system. 
This bill would also would reform the pricing practices of Federal Reserve System so that fair competition with private businesses would exist. It will eliminate the possibility of accusations of favoritism and conflict of interest in procurement and contracting. This examination will ensure that the Federal Reserve is competing fairly with its private-sector competitors. This matter of fairness becomes very important when the agency both competes with the private sector and also regulates their competitors. 
The Federal Reserve operates several lines of business, which compete with the private sector. These businesses are referred to as `priced services.' This legislation will ensure that the Federal Reserve is accountable for the manner in which these businesses are run and how the prices for these services are calculated. The Federal Reserve is required by the Monetary Control Act of 1980 to match its revenues with its costs so that the prices for services it sells are not subsidized. 
We want to make sure that no accounting or pricing policy hides any subsidy. This legislation will benefit anyone who cashes a check in this country because it promotes a fair and competitive market place for those who provide the many services necessary to process the collection of checks. Costs should be fully recovered in the Federal Reserve's pricing. These annual audits will ensure that they are recovered and will level the playing field for those who can offer competitive services 
We usually think of the Federal Reserve in the terms of monetary policy, of setting interest rates. I want to make it very clear, I'm not attempting to interfere with, or impugn, the monetary policy of the Fed. I am simply seeking greater accountability in the operating expenses and internal management of one of our most influential institutions. I believe that the Federal Reserve could do more to increase its cost consciousness and to operate as efficiently as possible. This bill will ensure that this happens and I look forward to greater discussion of this issue by Congress. I encourage the committee to give favorable consideration to our legislation.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my congratulations to Coach Dwaine Knight, Assistant Coach Dwayne Whalen, and the entire University of Nevada-Las Vegas golf team for capturing its first-ever NCAA national championship. 
The UNLV Rebels secured the title after fending off rival Clemson to win the NCAA tournament, which was held in the final week of May at the University of Mexico's Championship Golf Course. UNLV easily set a team tournament record by shooting a sizzling 34 under (72-hole) par of 1,118. The previous mark was 23 under par. 
Prospects for winning the title appeared dim at the beginning of the season. Despite high rankings, the team failed to qualify for the tournament in 1997, and lost key players to graduation and the professional ranks. Some in the media speculated that UNLV could not win the big tournaments. The team has clearly proved its doubters wrong. 
It is interesting to note, however, that the Rebels came in a disappointing 10th in the season's first match and fell dramatically in the rankings. Undeterred, the squad, which includes only one senior, bounced back to win seven contests, an NCAA record. 
Importantly, instead of being laden with highly recruited stars and overblown egos that are the trademarks of so many top amateur sports programs, the 1998 Rebels featured a handful of student-athletes with tremendous heart and determination. Coach Knight has rightfully stated that the mark of this year's team was its will to do battle. Indeed, the group's desire to persevere and overachieve should be an inspiration to all who follow the sport. 
Bob Hope once said that if you watch a game, it's fun. If you play it, it's recreation. If you work at it, it's golf. Plain and simple, the Rebels' tremendous success can be traced to their commitment to hard work. And, I might add, their hard work doesn't stop on the greens. In fact, the team is comprised of model student-athletes, young men who understand their first priority is academics. Their commitment to the sport is matched only by their commitment to the classroom. 
I am particularly proud to report that the team earned a very respectable grade point average of 3.1 in the fall semester and 3.4 in the spring term. Moreover, they are true sportsmen in the sense that they represent themselves with class and good character. 
The Rebels' success is something in which Nevadans can take great pride. In fact in southern Nevada, where the population increases by a thousand a week, where a new, spectacular course seems to open every month, and where the sun shines bright 300 hundred days a year, golf has emerged as nothing short of a sensation. The success of the UNLV team certainly contributes to the sport's popularity in southern Nevada. 
Today, I applaud team members Jeremy Anderson, Chris Berry, Daron Dorsey, Charley Hoffman, Scott Lander, Bill Lunde, Christian Thornley, Morten Vidhoj, Scott Wingfield, the coaching staff, as well as the loyal fans, supportive community and UNLV, on the squad's amazing success. The UNLV golf team's hard work and great accomplishments have made Nevadans very proud, and I wish team members continued success in all their endeavors.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Northeastern Nevada Public Lands Transfer. This Act provides for the transfer of Federal land to the Cities of Wendover, Carlin, and Wells and the Town of Jackpot, all in Elko County, Nevada. 
Mr. President, the rural communities in northeastern Nevada, are growing. For example, in 1997, the City of West Wendover was certified as Nevada's fastest growing city. These communities are surrounded by Federal lands, with every little private land available for expansion and growth. In addition, because over 71 percent of the land in Elko County is in Federal ownership, these local governments do not have the resources to just go out and buy more land. 
Mr. President, the property being conveyed in this Act has been determined to be important to the industrial, commercial, residential, infrastructure, and recreational needs of the citizens of Elko County. Conveying these lands in one transaction provides the county certainty about its future, which will allow it to diversify its economy and develop these properties in a planned and orderly manner. 
Mr. President, Elko County has valid concerns about its future. The gaming and tourism industry is the primary employer, and every indication is that it will remain healthy. However, an economy, based on a single industry, bears an inherent risk of failure. 
Mr. President, the City of West Wendover, in conjunction with the North Eastern Development Authority, has recently completed a countywide Economic Development Plan, which emphasizes the importance of economic diversification as its primary goal. This plan promotes quality development which enhances the quality of life for Elko County residents. West Wendover, Nevada has currently spent $100,000 for the Environmental Assessment and the Baseline Assessment, an Air Force prerequisite for land conveyance. In addition, the West Wendover City Council and the Nevada Rural Development Authority have indicated that they are committed to working together to ensure that economic development in the area is accomplished through a logical, well considered development plan.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. President, this Congress, especially the House of Representatives, has been referred to as the `do-nothing House,' or the `do-nothing Congress.' Today, this debate will only add to the fact that it is a do-nothing Congress; it is a do-nothing House of Representatives. 
The House is rarely in session. They vote sparingly and very pointedly. Campaign finance was only brought up following the culmination of a campaign to have a discharge petition filed, which forced action on that issue. This issue here today is part of the aura of a do-nothing Congress. We have the fact that this legislation--interim storage of nuclear waste--is an absolute waste of everyone's time. The President has said on numerous occasions that he will veto this legislation. We have had votes on this Senate floor that indicate, without any reservation or hesitation, that we have sufficient votes to make sure that the President's veto is sustained. 
In addition, we have the incomprehensible development that the Speaker of the House of Representatives has stated that nuclear waste is dead in this Congress, that he won't touch nuclear waste. Well, I say, what are we doing? The President has said that he will veto this legislation. The Speaker of the House of Representatives has said that he won't allow nuclear waste legislation to move in the House of Representatives this year. It seems very difficult to me why we are moving forward on this. I finally figured out a reason; I am told--tobacco. Are we moving forward on this legislation so that there will be nothing happening with the tobacco bill? I seem to have hit the 
nail on the head. 
The fact that this legislation stands absolutely no chance is because the President said he will veto it and there are enough votes, as proven on the Senator floor, that the veto will be sustained. Only yesterday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives said that nuclear waste is dead. Then there must be a reason. That reason is there is a movement to stop tobacco legislation. 
Mr. President, this is a rip-off, this is a payoff for the tobacco industry. They simply want to continue having kids smoke. They know that every day 3,000 kids are locked in and addicted to cigarettes--3,000 every day. Every day we waste in this Congress on something other than tobacco, we are addicting 3,000 children. Should we not be investing in public health research and programs to help smokers quit and protect tobacco farmers and their communities? Obviously, Mr. President, that issue has taken second fiddle to the big stall. Kids are most vulnerable to tobacco company tactics, and we all know that. We know that tobacco companies have, for decades, targeted kids because they are the most vulnerable to nicotine addiction and the most easily affected by the slick advertising and promotional ploys. Joe Camel just didn't show up in the middle of the night. This was done in the boardrooms of the tobacco industry. `What can we do to addict children, kids? We will come up with something that will be as noticeable and identifiable as Bugs Bunny or Mickey Mouse.' And they have done it. Joe Camel is more noticeable than those. 
So the evidence is overwhelming that smoking is a pediatric disease; it is a disease that affects kids. Almost 90 percent--that is a slight exaggeration--89 percent of all people who try a cigarette try one by age 18. Virtually nobody starts smoking during adulthood--no one. Of the people who have ever smoked on a daily basis, 71 percent were smoking by the age of 18. Now, if Joe Camel isn't enough identification, realize that almost 37 percent of children in high schools throughout America smoke cigarettes. Don't we have an obligation to move forward on this legislation? The answer is yes. I repeat, 3,000 kids start smoking every day. Is this a pediatric disease? Of course it is. Mr. President, it is extremely important that everyone understand that this is nothing more than a transparent effort to kill the tobacco bill. 
Today, the majority is setting out to reward two very powerful industries--big tobacco and nuclear utilities. I think there are other parties we should be concerned about. Why should we not be rewarding children--3,000 children a day? That seems to be a little better motive. But, no, the majority is setting out today to reward big tobacco and the nuclear utility lobby. 
By invoking cloture on the motion to proceed, the Senate is taking the anti-teen-smoking bill off the floor, period. We must not vote to invoke cloture. Literally, without being overdramatic, Mr. President, by voting to invoke cloture we are signing the death warrants for kids in America. Adults don't start smoking, kids start smoking; the tobacco companies know that. For every day we stall this legislation, we have signed death warrants for kids. 
Mr. President, a number of years ago, my wife was in a hospital. She had been there for quite a long period of time. Finally, we had no alternative, and she had to have some very extensive surgery. The surgery took a lot longer than we thought it was going to take or should have taken. We were very worried. We were waiting in the room where loved ones wait while these traumatic things go on. A physician walked into the room--somebody we had never seen before--and he said, `I am a cardiologist. During surgery, your wife's heart malfunctioned.' Then, without a second breath, he said, `but we are not worried because she is not a smoker.' Doesn't that say it all? Why don't we in this body vote for the children of America and not invoke cloture? 
Mr. President, we are talking about terrorism sweeping this country. Today, this is legislative terrorism. We are being asked to support big tobacco and nuclear utilities and, in effect, voting against kids. 
When it is all over and done with, I think we are not going to find people voting with big tobacco and utilities. 
Now, we do not have a lot of time, Mr. President, in the presentation that we have, to get into a lot of the merits of this legislation, that is, the underlying legislation. We will have ample time to do that, and everyone knows that if cloture is not invoked, the Senators from Nevada will be involved in their own legislative terrorism; that is, we feel so strongly about this, as does the environmental community of America, that we are going to do everything we can to protect the health and safety of people in this country--not only the people of the State of Nevada but the people of this country. 
Let me just close this part of my presentation by saying that the Energy and Water Subcommittee held a hearing. I, frankly, was involved in other things. And the Senator, the senior Senator from New Mexico, spent a great deal of time working on setting up this very interesting set of hearings. Testimony took place last month, the middle of last month. We had a number of very important people testifying on nuclear technology but, interestingly enough, they all said that spent nuclear fuel--that is what we are talking about here--should be stored on-site. 
For example, Dr. Richard Wilson was one of those who testified. He is a professor of physics at Harvard University. He is the lead physics professor at Harvard University. I have a direct quote: 
There is no doubt in my mind that the waste from a power plant is much safer than operating a power plant, and you can put it next to a power plant as we are doing in some places without appreciably increasing any risk to anybody. 
I had that confirmed on a number of other occasions during that hearing that took place. 
Mr. President, in short, we cannot, today, reward tobacco and the nuclear utilities. They have a cabal here to defeat tobacco legislation, recognizing that nuclear waste legislation is all through anyway; the President has said he will veto it. We have enough votes to sustain the veto. The Speaker of the House has said that he is not going to move that legislation. It seems pretty clear to me today's issue here before this body is a gesture in futility. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. REID. Before yielding to my colleague from Nevada, I would like to ask my friend, the junior Senator from Alaska, do you disagree with Dr. Richard Wilson, professor of physics, Harvard University, who testified before the Energy and Water Subcommittee 2 weeks ago, recognizing this man is one of the foremost experts on things physics and nuclear power in this country, when he said, `And you can put it [nuclear waste] next to a power plant, as we are doing * * *, without appreciably increasing any risk to anybody'?

Mr. REID. I would say, of course, my friend from Alaska did not answer the question because the answer is so obvious. We have here one of the most eminent scientists in America dealing with nuclear waste, with things nuclear. He said, `And you can put it next to a power plant [nuclear waste], as we are doing * * *, without appreciably increasing any risk to anybody.' 
I also say to those within the sound of my voice, it is cheaper to have dry cast storage containment. It only costs about $5 million to establish one on-site. 
It would seem to me that this is so clear that it is easy to see through the transparency of what the nuclear utilities are trying to do. They are trying to wash their hands of this terribly deadly waste that they produced; namely, plutonium, wash their hands of it and give the responsibility to somebody else. 
Otherwise we would go for the cheaper, safer version that has been underscored as being safe by Dr. Richard Wilson, professor of physics, Harvard University. 
I yield to my colleague from the State of Nevada whatever time he may consume.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope my friend from Idaho would review the comments that he made. I, of course, recognize that a child who begins smoking today doesn't die today. No, that is true. As the Senator from Idaho said, that person doesn't die today. That person dies later, an agonizing death from lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease. No, they don't die today. They die later. 
Also, I think my friend should go back and look at the statement he made about those who are not teenagers who are foolish enough to continue smoking. The tobacco legislation is about addiction. The tobacco companies addict our children. Mr. President, 3,000 children a day are addicted to tobacco. It is not something they can just stop when they turn 19, something they can stop when they turn 32. They are addicted to a substance that causes them to want this product. They pay huge amounts for it. Why? Because they are addicted to it. They are addicted--when? They are addicted, 90 percent of them, when they are teenagers. 
So, for my friend from Idaho to say, `if they are foolish enough to continue smoking'--I think the facts should be reassessed, as, I submit, should be a number of the other facts stated by my friend from Idaho. For example, he agrees with Dr. Wilson. He said that storing nuclear waste at a repository next to the nuclear generating facility is safe. The problem is with the logic that he carries forward, that it is also safe if you put it 3,000 miles away. We lose track of the fact that this has to be hauled 3,000 miles away or 2,000 miles away or whatever the distance. The logic is not there. His review of Dr. Wilson's statement is simply without foundation. 
Dr. Wilson said, `And you can put it next to a power plant, as we are doing sometimes, without appreciably increasing any risk to anybody.' Dr. Wilson does not say you can haul it 3,000 miles and it will be safe. 
Also, I am amazed that my friend from Idaho does not understand a basic truth--that nuclear bombs aren't hauled through Nevada and then set off in the desert. There are components, separate components, like a puzzle, none of which standing alone will cause any damage to anyone, that are brought to the Nevada test site. Many of the parts are shipped by air to the Test Site landing strip. And these components are then assembled. We have an assembly facility out there that cost almost $1 billion. That is where they are assembled. So, for someone to say these have been hauled through the highways of Nevada or the city of Las Vegas for years is baseless, without foundation. 
This is a debate on tobacco. This is a subterfuge to stop us from going to tobacco. I could talk about tobacco all day, and I will talk about it a little while longer. But I just want to mention a little bit about where my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--and I am sorry to say, I do say this `on the other side of the aisle,' because this has become a partisan issue. There are matters passed out, `Senate vote analysis,' passed out on everyone's desk, compiled and written by the staff of the Republican Policy Committee. This is not a bipartisan issue. This is being pushed by the leadership of the House and the leadership of the Senate. 
I also say, however, if we go to this partisan issue that wants to put the above-ground storage at the Nevada test site--I show you this chart. It has on it information, not gathered by the Senators from the State of Nevada, but from the Council of National Seismic System Composite Catalog. It shows earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 and greater in the vicinity of the repository right here, the above-ground repository. This area is loaded with earthquakes. Not one, not two, not three--there are so many of them you cannot count, right on-site. These are earthquakes that have already taken place in the last 20 years. Don't you think it would be nice if this issue were debated in committee, that they hold some hearings on this? 
This is stealth legislation. 
We are proceeding on a bill that came from the House. Anyone would consider this legislation an environmental abomination. I should not say `anyone.' But the vast majority of the people of this country would. The bills that have passed the House and Senate cannot be reconciled. With time running out, the nuclear utilities are furiously working behind closed doors to come up with a final bill. No one has any idea what they are going to come up with. Maybe the nuclear industry does. I wouldn't be surprised if they wrote it. But the final surprise bill is going to be proposed and sprung upon us at a later time, yet this body is voting to proceed to this measure. That should be reason enough not to proceed. 
It is important to keep in mind that the President of the United States has already promised to veto this legislation, not once, not twice, but numerous times. I would say scores of times. He doesn't like this legislation. It is unfair. We should stick with what has been talked about, and that is whether or not there should be a deep repository at Yucca Mountain. Let the scientists go ahead and work on that. But that is not good enough for the very powerful, greedy nuclear utilities. That is not good enough for them. What they want is to short-circuit the system, go to the Nevada test site where we have all of these earthquakes, and pour a big cement pad on top of the ground and dump the canisters on top of the ground. It is easy. It is out of their hair. Even though my friend from Idaho agrees it is safe if they leave it where it is, why should we worry about transporting it all those miles? Why? Because the nuclear utilities want to get rid of it. They created the most poisonous substance known to man. They created it. 
So, is it any wonder that this has been decried as a do-nothing Congress? The President said he will veto it. The Speaker of the House of Representatives said, `I'm not going to touch nuclear waste.' Yet, we are marching forward on this legislation. Why? Why? Because, if the motion to invoke cloture prevails, we will go to nuclear waste and tobacco is history. 
There seems to be an unhealthy obsession with satisfying the legislative interests of the nuclear waste industry. Are we satisfying them at the expense of a bill designed to curb teenage smoking, a goal that many publicly support. But secretly, do some want this legislation, tobacco legislation, to go away? 
Preventing teenage smoking is something that is important. This room is not big enough to put in 3,000 kids. If they did, they would be jammed in pretty tight, on top of each other. Three thousand kids a day become addicted to tobacco smoking. And, no, they don't die today. But many, many of them are going to die because of one thing, tobacco, inhaling tobacco. 
In the State of Nevada, almost 20 percent of high school kids chew tobacco, smokeless tobacco--18 percent. 
We may have our differences over the best way of bringing about the cessation of teenage smoking and other forms of tobacco abuse, but I hope we don't disagree on the goal. 
The two Senators from Nevada, I want it spread across the Record of this Senate, will exercise every right that we have as Senators today, tomorrow, next week, the week after. We will make sure this issue is considered fully and fairly; that if cloture is invoked on this very inopportune legislation, we are going to do everything we can to make sure that our message is heard. 
This is the wrong time to bring up legislation that has been guaranteed a veto by the President, and the Speaker of the House has said he will not move forward on it. We are prepared to spend as much time as possible debating this measure, even at the expense of other business that is important to this Senate. 
There is a lot to go over on this legislation. We are voting to proceed to either a House bill that is an unacceptable environmental disaster or a substitute measure that has been written by the nuclear industry and seen by very few. I haven't seen the substitute. I assume the nuclear industry has. I haven't seen it. It has not been the subject of any hearings. It has not been given the opportunity to be marked up. It is not enjoying the benefit of public scrutiny and input from other interests. 
Yet, the proponents of this measure are getting ready to spring this on this body and file cloture on it. That is the way they do it, because they know the longer it is subject to the light of day, the more warts will be revealed. Environmental groups will rip this substitute apart. Proponents would have you believe they are sweetening the pot to broaden their support. Nuclear waste is a witches' brew that is unacceptable and cannot be made palatable. 
I urge all Members--Democrats and Senators of good will--recognizing the importance of tobacco, to vote against cloture. We need to get back to the problems of addressing teenage smoking. We don't need to be wasting this body's time on a measure that the President said he will veto and just yesterday the Speaker of the House said, `We're not going to touch nuclear waste.' 
I ask the Chair how much time the Senators from Nevada have remaining?

Mr. REID. Madam President, let's assume that you are a mother, you have a 6-year-old child, you have recently been divorced, and you go to pick the child up from school and he is not there. You wonder what happened to your child. You call the police; the police have no knowledge of his whereabouts. No one seems to know what happened to your child. But as things are pieced together, you learn that your husband, who you recently divorced, has taken the child from school and to Croatia. 
This happens during the time of the Balkans war. What as a mother are you to do? Your child is in Croatia. You were married to a Croatian. 
This is a situation that 1,000 parents face every year in our country. Over 1,000 children are taken from this country, normally as a result of the mother and father not getting along, or recently divorced, and they are taken many times to a country where one of the parents was born. Sometimes the parent just takes off to a country they are familiar with. They want to get away from the wife or husband, recognizing that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to get the baby back. 
The tragedy is of a thousand stories a year; there are many thousands of stories I could retell. 
The Las Vegas Review Journal reported about a woman by whose name is Lilly Waken. Her two daughters left home for a party. The children never came back. Frantically, she called the police. She called the hospitals. She learned that her husband had taken them away and had bought three one-way tickets to Damascus, Syria. That was 18 months ago. She hasn't seen her children since. 
My amendment is all about fairness and prevention. It is about preventing a problem that plagues this country, the international children's abduction problem. As I have indicated, 1,000 or more children are abducted every year in our country. These children, as I have indicated, are abducted during or shortly after a contentious divorce, sometimes even by an abusive parent, at a time when these children are most vulnerable and uncertain about their future. They are then snatched from custody of one parent and hauled over to a foreign country. 
In the case that I first spoke of, a young boy by the name of Mikey Kale from Las Vegas was taken to Croatia. His mother worked for months and months, and was finally able, after spending a tremendous amount of money trying to get the return of her son--remember, this is in a country that was Mikey Kale Passport and Notification Amendment at war--she was able to get her child back. 
I am proposing this legislation, the Mikey Kale Passport Notification Amendment, after this young boy taken to Croatia, Mikey Kale. This amendment is very simple. It will require that parents who are married must both sign for a passport for their child. If there has been a divorce, the one with primary custody must sign for the child to obtain a passport. We have a provision in this bill so that, under extreme circumstances, the Secretary of State can waive the requirements if the Secretary determines that the circumstances do not permit the obtaining of the signatures of both parents. 
Madam President, this legislation was passed before in this body. It went to the House where it was knocked out in conference. Why? For the same reason that the State Department indicated in a recent article in Parade Magazine, it is going to create too much paperwork. I say, Madam President, that is too much baloney. It may be too much paperwork for them. But for the parents and the children involved in this, it is better to spend a little extra time when someone comes to get a passport to make sure that the passport is obtained properly. It is not asking too much of the State Department to insure that people who are going to get a passport for a child to check out that the child is, in effect, not being kidnaped. 
The aim of the amendment is prevention. It prevents parental abductors from obtaining U.S. passports for their minor children. One of the best ways to prevent international parental abductions is to make it more difficult for the abductors to obtain a passport. 
Madam President, prior to coming to this body I practiced law and did divorce work, among other things. When Mikey Kale's mother came to me, it flooded memories back to my mind about a case that I had where there was a contested divorce. I represented a police officer from Henderson, NV. Suddenly, my client picked up the two children and went to Mexico. He called me from Mexico, and 
said, `I'm not coming back until I get what I asked for from my wife.' So I called the opposing counsel and told him what had happened. My client stayed down in Mexico for years until finally the mother of the two children, in effect, gave him what he wanted. It was a difficult situation. The children were never in school during that period of time. 
Madam President, this is a very serious problem. We who are parents and grandparents know that we are the ones who are looked upon as protectors of our children. But those who should be protecting children are doing the worst for the child by taking them to a strange country, recognizing that the standards and customs in that country are much different from ours, and that it is going to be difficult, if not impossible, to get that child back. 
It is reported that the State Department has had thousands and thousands of these reported kidnapings, and that they just write them off after a year or two, closing 80 percent of their files. 
This amendment is a simple legislative solution which will implement a system of checks prior to the issuance of a minor child's passport thereby protecting both parental rights and the rights of the child. 
Two years ago the same amendment passed. The State Department and their lobbyists prevailed upon those in conference to remove this provision. In the meantime, 2,000 children in this country have been abducted to other countries--2,000 children. Think of the grief that has been caused to those children and to the parents of those children. This, Madam President, should stop. We should not listen to what the State Department says, that because they are understaffed and don't want to go into the details of who has custody, they cannot implement this preventive measure. I say let's save some pain and suffering of these little children, and also of one of the parents. 
This problem is more common than one would think. As I stated earlier, 1,000 children are abducted every year. Here in the United States missing and abducted children are counted meticulously, in some countries they keep no records whatsoever. Forty-five nations have signed a Hague treaty designed to resolve international child custody disputes. Most countries have not. 
Finding a missing child is very difficult. This problem is no better illustrated, as I have indicated, than that of Mikey Kale for whom this amendment is named. 
Let me repeat. On Valentine's Day in 1993, Mikey was abducted by the ex-husband of Barbara Spierer and taken to Croatia--kidnaped, for lack of a better description. As I have said, after tremendous emotional and financial efforts, Barbara was one of the lucky ones. She got her baby boy back. 
Regardless of the number of cases--whether it is 1,000 cases, which it is, or 10 cases a year, which it isn't--one case of abduction is one too many. My amendment seeks to prevent even that one tragedy from occurring. One of the most difficult and frustrating elements for parents of internationally abducted children is that the U.S. laws and court orders are usually ignored in a foreign country. If they are not ignored, the possible pain and expense of legal representation in that country are unbearable. 
Many of these cases involve parents who have relatively no assets. So the one who is, in effect, left behind, when the child has been kidnaped, can do nothing. 
One country alone has 45 cases of American children being abducted. Letters to that foreign head of state have had no effect, and none of the 45 have been voluntarily returned. 
An inconceivable, irrefutable fact is that once a child is abducted from the United States, it is almost impossible to get the child back. 
Madam President, once again, the aim of this amendment is prevention--prevention of anguish to families, prevention of parental rights being violated, prevention of a child being abducted. 
Until more can be done, I believe a simple, cost-effective legislative solution to protect our children's rights is essential, and I ask my colleagues to join me. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday's USA Today headline: `Viagra heightens insurance hopes for comfort care.' The first paragraph says: 
While health insurers try to decide whether to pay for the impotence drug Viagra, a poll shows half of Americans think men should pay for it themselves. 
Mr. President, I will bet those half are women. Women have really been treated unfairly in this. Senator Olympia Snowe and I introduced legislation last May, the Equity in Prescription and Contraception Coverage Act, which in effect said that health care providers that provide prescription drugs should also provide contraceptives. 
We have waited a year. We have not been able to even get a hearing on this. The reason I am here today is to speak for American women who have been treated so unfairly by male-dominated legislatures for the last many decades. 
Women pay about 70 percent more for their health care than do men, mostly related to reproductive problems. We have a situation where we have 3.6 million unintended pregnancies in this country every year. And 45 percent of them wind up in abortions. We find these insurance companies, these health care providers, will pay for a tubal ligation, they will pay for abortions, they will pay for a vasectomy, but they will not provide money for the pill. 
An average pregnancy, unintended pregnancy, in this country costs an average of about $1,700. I say, why can't we talk about something other than what helps men? Viagra is in all the newspapers, trying to make a decision as to whether or not insurance companies should pay for this. Why don't we talk about why insurance companies shouldn't pay for contraceptives, health care providers shouldn't pay for contraceptives? It seems that would be a step in the right direction. Over half of the insurance companies, health care providers, do not cover this. 
Our legislation, that of the senior Senator from Maine and me, would require insurers, HMOs, and employee health benefit plans that offer prescription drug benefits to cover contraceptive drugs approved by the FDA. This is long overdue. 
I am just telling everyone here that if we do not have the benefit of some hearings on this--the senior Senator from Maine and I have written letters, and we have asked people, and we cannot get the benefit of a hearing. This should not be. It would seem to me we should have a hearing with the Labor and Human Resources Committee. 
I have had the benefit of speaking to the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, who has been very concerned about issues like this in the past. And at last resort, we will go to the Appropriations Committee and have a hearing there. We should not have it there, but at last resort we will have it there. I do not think it is appropriate that we have to legislate on appropriations bills, but as a member of the Appropriations 
Committee, on this, I am going to offer an amendment on the appropriate bill if we do not get some action by the proper authorizing committee. This is simply unfair--unfair--what is going on. 
The same newspaper yesterday, in a different article, said:  
Health insurers that cover the new impotence drug Viagra but don't pay for female contraception are guilty of `gender bias,' says the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists today. 
`Pregnancy is a medical condition, just like impotence. And the cost benefit of preventing pregnancy is much greater than treating impotence,' says ACOG spokeswoman Luella Klein of Emory University. 
Mr. President, it simply is unfair. Over this last decade, we have moved forward a little bit with the help of the junior Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski. She and I have worked together. We now have a program at the National Institutes of Health that deals with women's conditions. 
But, Mr. President, over the years diseases that afflict women have been ignored. Interstitial cystitis--it is a disease that afflicts 500,000 women in America, a very serious disease of the bladder--until 8 years ago, there was not a penny spent on it for research. They said it was in a woman's head. They learned that is not the case. Now, as a result of work done at the National Institutes of Health, they have a drug that cures the effects of this on 40 percent of the women. 
Multiple sclerosis, intercervical and ovarian cancer, and breast cancer, and lupus--these diseases, for research, are basically ignored because they are diseases basically related to women principally. 
I am saying here, this is really unfair what is going on here. We are spending so much time with all kinds of jokes on all the talk radio programs, all the TV programs, about Viagra. But it is not a joke that we have over 3.6 million unintended pregnancies, with 44 percent ending in abortion, in this country. And a lot of them are caused simply--in fact, the majority of them--simply because women cannot afford things like the pill. 
We have to do something. Not only does it affect that, Mr. President, but a reduction in unintended pregnancies will lead to a reduction in infant mortality, low-birth-weight babies, and maternal morbidity. In fact, the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality determined that, `Infant mortality could be reduced by [more than] 10 percent if all women not desiring pregnancy used contraception.' 
So I think it is, again, unfair that tubal ligation, abortion, vasectomies, are covered and the pill, contraceptives, and contraceptive devices are not covered. In my opinion, we need to move this forward. We have the support of approximately 35 Senators in this body. We need a hearing, and we need to have this legislation passed. 
I express my appreciation to the Senator from New York for allowing me to go before him.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 1995, we passed the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act or PSLRA, as it became known. Our intent was to prevent abusive filings by a group of trial attorneys who were using a loophole in our laws. These lawsuits were often entirely without merit and really amounted to strong-arm efforts to get money out of small start-up companies. Our legislation was aimed at putting an end to these strike suits and to a large extent it has succeeded. 
Many of these companies could take the capital they were expending on litigation and settlement costs and invest in research in development. They could provide greater returns to their shareholders. They could create more jobs. 
Unfortunately, the small group of attorneys who were involved in this loophole found another way to get their frivolous strike suits heard in court. They shifted their efforts to state courts. 
The SEC has noted this development saying that this `apparent shift to state court may be the most significant development in securities litigation' since the '95 legislation was enacted. Before the '95 Act, few, if any, securities class actions were filed in state court. Since it's enactment, the number of state claims has exploded. 
A study by Price Waterhouse found that the average number of state court securities class actions filed in 1996 grew 355 percent over the 1991-1995 average. In 1997, filings were 150 percent greater than the 1991-1995 average. While the number of state court filings dropped slightly in 1997 compared to 1996 it is believed this is due to a strategic desire by plaintiffs' lawyers to undercut the underlying legislation. 
According to Stanford Law School official Michael Perino: 
It is possible that plaintiffs' attorneys may simply have strategically chosen not to pursue a significant number of state cases in order to decrease the apparent necessity for Congress to pass a federal preemption statute. Past experience * * * indicates that plaintiffs respond strategically to legislative initiatives that might alter the costs and benefits of securities litigation. 
The State court litigation is a loophole around the PSLRA. This is undermining the bipartisan efforts we made in passing the PSLRA to give companies the ability to disclose more information to investors without the fear of being sued. But the threat of being sued in 50 states chills the disclosure of company information to investors. 
People are understandably reluctant to make disclosures under the Federal law's `safe harbor' provision when their statements can be used against them in state court. According to the SEC, fear of state court liability for forward looking statements was inhibiting the use of the PSLRA's safe harbor. 
The time to act on this is now. Delay undermines one of the main policy goals of the PSLRA--greater information flow to investors. Delays will cause a proliferation of litigation in state courts. Delay forces all parties to spend millions of dollars arguing about matters that uniform standards legislation can put to rest. 
As time goes on, states will reach different legislative and judicial results--this just furthers the confusion. As President Clinton wrote last year, `the proliferation of multiple and inconsistent standards could undermine national law.' 
We need to prevent this confusion by putting a stop to this end run around Congress. A patchwork system of securities laws undermines America's capital markets. Capital formation is inhibited by overlapping the duplicative legal rules governing securities litigation. Uniform standards legislation ensures that purchasers and sellers of nationally traded securities have similar remedies in securities lawsuits regardless of their state of residence. 
It is time to close this loophole and put an end to this high priced extortion that seems to be benefitting only a few trial attorneys.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Patient Safety Act of 1998. This legislation focuses on the major safety, quality, and workforce issues for nurses employed by health care institutions and the patients who receive care in these facilities. The Patient Safety Act establishes guidelines for hospital participation in Medicare in order to protect both health care consumers and workers. 
Health care consumers need access to information about health care institutions in order to make informed decisions about where they receive care. This legislation would require health care institutions to publicly disclose specified information on staffing levels, mix and patient outcomes. At minimum, health care institutions would have to make public: the number of registered nurses providing direct care; numbers of unlicensed personnel utilized to provide direct patient care; average number of patients per registered nurse providing direct patient care; patient mortality rate; incidence of adverse patient care incidents; and methods used for determining and adjusting staffing levels and patient care needs. 
Nurses should be able to voice their concerns about dangerous patient care conditions without the fear of retribution from their employers. The Patient Safety Act of 1998 would add whistleblower protections to Medicare law. A violation of this provision would make an institution ineligible for Medicare participation. 
Finally, the Patient Safety Act of 1998 would direct the Department of Health and Human Services to review mergers and acquisitions of hospitals to determine their long-term effects on the well-being of patients, the community and employees. 
The Patient Safety Act of 1998 is a valuable information resource for consumers. This legislation will ensure that the public has the data necessary to make informed decisions about their health care providers.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Health Care Worker Protection Act of 1998. This legislation would reduce the number of health care workers who are accidentally exposed to potentially contaminated, infectious blood via a needle stick injury. 
The Health Care Worker Protection Act of 1998 would make the use of safe needle devices, as determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a condition of participation for Medicare. The bill would call for the FDA to create an Advisory Council to establish safety standards for hollow bore devices. The Advisory Council would be composed of consumers, health care providers and technical experts. Finally, the Department of Health and Human Services would be authorized $5 million to establish education and training programs for the use of the safe devices identified by the FDA. 
Approximately eighty percent of all reported occupational exposures result from needle stick injuries, making this the most common cause of health care worker-related exposure to blood borne pathogens. More than twenty pathogens can be transmitted through small amounts of blood including HIV, syphilis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, varicella-zoster, malaria, Hepatitis B and C, along with other forms of hepatitis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American health care workers report more than 800,000 needle sticks and sharps injuries each year. 
The Health Worker Protection Act of 1998 is designed to reduce the risks to health care workers from these accidents. This legislation will ensure that the necessary tools--better information and better medical devices--are made available to front-line health care workers in order to reduce the injury and death that have resulted from needle sticks.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2040 the Senior Citizens Protection Act introduced by Senator Baucus earlier this morning. 
I am pleased to be an original cosponsor on this important legislation. 
There are 47 federally certified Medicaid Fraud Control Units across the country. Since the program began in 1978, more than 8,000 cases have been prosecuted. They do an excellent job. 
Millions of dollars have been returned as a result of their work. 
The `Senior Citizens Protection Act of 1998' makes two very simple changes to Medicaid Fraud Control Unit authority. 
First it gives MFCU's the authority to investigate violations in our federal health programs--primarily Medicare in addition to their current authority to investigate violations in Medicaid. 
Secondly, the bill would enable MFCU's to investigate patient abuse and neglect in residential health care facilities that do not receive Medicaid reimbursement. 
In short the bill has two goals: to stop health care fraud and to protect vulnerable seniors. 
As the face of long-term care changes, local authorities need the resources to investigate claims of patient and elder abuse. 
Rather than create new bureaucracies, this bill allows us to build upon the expertise of an existing entity--the state Medicaid Fraud Control Units. 
During two Aging Committee field hearings that I held in Las Vegas and Reno in January 1998, I heard first hand from the Nevada Attorney General, Frankie Sue Del Papa, how important this legislation was. 
She made it very clear to me that her Medicaid Fraud Control Unit has the expertise to investigate these cases. They simply need the authority. 
The MFCU's have the know how and experience to protect seniors in residential health care facilities. They merely lack the authority to get involved in non-Medicaid cases. 
This legislation will give them the needed authority. That is why this bill is endorsed by the National Association of Attorneys General, the Department of Justice, the American Association of Retired Persons and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General. 
Simply put, it is the right thing to do. 
It is unfortunate that when MFCU investigators involved in a case of Medicaid fraud discover evidence that this fraud may also be happening in the Medicare program, or other federally funded health care programs, they are restricted from taking action. This bill will change that. 
Under current law, the MFCU can only investigate patient abuse in medical facilities which receive Medicaid funds. 
In 1996 and 1997, the Nevada MFCU received 120 referrals but only opened 20 investigations due in part to limited jurisdiction. 
Although many of these cases are referred to local law enforcement, they may never be criminally investigated or prosecuted due to lack of expertise or available resources. 
State MFCUs are able to conduct these investigations and this bill will give them the needed authority. 
In Nevada 47 nursing homes and 54 adult group homes receive Medicaid funding. 
When abuse or neglect occurs in such facilities, the state MFCU can investigate. 
However, we also have approximately 265 residential facilities for groups and 321 registered homes which could fall within the definition of `board and care facilities' set forth in this bill. 
With the passage of this bill, seniors and other residents in these facilities would be protected regardless of whether the facility receives Medicaid funding or not. 
This bill would give the state MFCU the authority to investigate allegations of abuse and neglect in these facilities. 
As we collectively strive to reduce fraud and abuse in our Medicare and Medicaid programs, we cannot overlook any opportunity to make a difference. 
This bill is a welcome weapon in our arsenal to fight abuse. 
I commend Senators Baucus of Montana and Graham of Florida for their sponsorship of this bill and Senators Mikulski, Grassley, Johnson, and Breaux for their original cosponsorship of this important legislation. 
We need all the ammunition possible in the war against health care fraud and in assuring the protection of our nation's most vulnerable seniors in the spectrum of long-term care facilities. 
The bill introduced by my colleagues today is a major step in the right direction. 
I am pleased to join them in sponsoring this important legislation.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, as Members of this body know, I have worked long and hard with other Members of this body to change how the IRS functions. The first speech I gave on the Senate floor after being elected in 1986, was on the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. As I presented my remarks that day, presiding was Senator David Pryor of Arkansas. At the time, he was chairman of the Subcommittee on Finance that dealt with the Internal Revenue Service. Also, that same day in the Chamber was Charles Grassley of Iowa, a longtime proponent of changes within the Internal Revenue Service. 
I received a note from Senator Pryor after I finished my remarks that a page delivered to me, indicating he wanted to work with me on the legislation that I talked about. That same day, I received word from Senator Grassley he wanted to work with me. 
This was bipartisan legislation. The bill that I wrote, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights--because of these two Senators; the Senator from Arkansas, the Senator from Iowa; a Democrat and a Republican--we were able to move this bill through the Senate. It passed in 1988 and became law. It was really a significant change. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights changed the way the taxpayers dealt with the tax collectors. It put the taxpayer on a more equal footing with the tax collector. It was the beginning of some major changes in the way we deal with the Internal Revenue Service. 
The Taxpayer Bill of Rights No. 2, in 1996, was also a change. But we are here now because of H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1997. I say to the chairman of the full committee, the senior Senator from Delaware, I appreciate his working hard on this issue. I think the hearings have been informative to the American public and indicate that we need to do more. The Taxpayer Bill of Rights No. 1 and No. 2 were important, but we need to go further. 
I was one of those initial sponsors of this legislation in the Senate. Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Grassley of Iowa, and I held a press conference where we talked about this legislation. 
At that time we didn't have a lot of support. But the support has built, and now we have support from the administration, and it is once again bipartisan legislation. 
I look forward to the opportunity to speak in favor of the speedy passage of this much needed and long overdue reform. 
What I want to talk about today in my amendment is one of the things that leads to the bad press, the bad feelings that the American public has about the IRS. What I want to prohibit the IRS from doing in the future is continuing with a program that I refer to as the `Reward for Rats Program.' This is a program where the IRS, in effect, has a contingent fee, much like a lawyer gets in a personal injury case. They say, `If you have somebody who will snitch on a neighbor, an ex-wife, or business partner, and this will lead to our collecting money, then we will give you part of that money.' 
I believe anyone who owes money to the Internal Revenue Service should pay it. But I think it should be collected in a way that is in keeping with the American system, not go into people's personal lives, where you have a wife--former wife or former husband who just completed a long divorce, and the IRS contacts one of them and says, `Hey, if you can give us a little information on your ex-spouse, then we will give you part of the money we collect.' 
I think this is wrong, and I think we should stop it. There is nothing specifically in the statute which allows this. The problem is, there is nothing that disallows it. That is what this amendment would do. It is a practice which, if it isn't corrected, will be permitted under this legislation now before the body. 
Last week, the Senate Finance Committee, under the leadership of the senior Senator from Delaware, conducted hearings in the cases of abusive practices by employees of the IRS. Witnesses before that committee provided testimony which describes an organization prepared, I am sorry to say, to use virtually any means to collect this Nation's taxes. 
Again, I think the taxes should be collected but it should be in a fair way. An organization apparently prepared to take advantage of individual greed or desire for revenge to identify, rightly or wrongly, citizens who have failed to pay their taxes is something we need to do away with. 
Last week, we learned of a restaurant owner whose life was ruined on the basis of no more than a tip from a vengeful informant. As recently reported in the press, we learned of a tax accountant who snitched on a client, motivated only by the expectation of payment for betraying a confidential relationship. In both cases that I have just provided, the information was false. 
Such informants, most of the time, are not acting in some sense of civic duty. They don't act from a selfless interest in the Nation's well-being. They act against friends, relatives, employers, and associates because the IRS pays them to do so. 
Under section 7623 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, they are authorized to pay sums, as required, to informants in order to bring to trial violators of Internal Revenue laws. In plain English, the IRS pays snitches to act against associates, employers, relatives, and others--whether motivated by greed or revenge--in order to collect taxes. I find this activity unseemly, distasteful, and just wrong. 
Under the current IRS program, these informants are paid up to 15 percent of the money recovered as a result of their tips, 
but no less than $100. In a recent change to the so-called Snitch Program, the Service increased the maximum allowable reward to $2 million--a powerful incentive to anyone interested in becoming rich at the expense of a neighbor, former business associates or business associate, former wife, former husband. 
As if the desire for revenge alone hasn't been responsible enough for ruined lives, the Service has a $2 million jackpot to sweeten the payoff. For the nosy neighbor, the alienated spouse, or the wronged partner, the odds of seeing that payday may appear better than anything the State can offer. This program is unethical, it is contrary to taxpayer privacy, and inconsistent with the spirit of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. 
Let's assume that someone comes to an accountant with a tax problem--under the present law, there is no confidentiality; we are trying to change that, of course--comes to an accountant with a tax problem, thinking, of course, you have to get this thing worked out with your accountant; and the accountant walks out after the meeting and calls the IRS and says, `I have somebody you can get a real good chunk of money from, but of course I get 15 percent of it.' 
I think that is wrong. It is contrary to taxpayer privacy and inconsistent with the spirit of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights which was passed previously. 
The IRS would have you believe that these programs--this snitch program is warranted because of the millions of dollars it is able to collect through the snitches. This simply demonstrates that the IRS is relying upon others to do its work. It shouldn't be up to friends, families, coworkers, and neighbors to ensure taxes are being paid; it is up to the IRS. We should not be paying private citizens to perform the job the IRS employees are expected to carry out. 
I think this program should come to an end. To that purpose, I propose this amendment, which will eliminate the payments for detection of underpayment and fraud. The amendment to eliminate the reward of greed and invasive action against honest taxpayers should pass. 
I propose that in the process of reforming and restructuring the Internal Revenue Service, we join together to eliminate the `Reward for Rats Program.' It is time that this snitch program be eliminated and that we restore greater civic order to the manner in which the IRS conducts itself. 
The amendment is considered important because it reforms the IRS, it fundamentally overhauls the manner in which they conduct business, and it serves the customers and also allows a more orderly way of collecting money. This amendment addresses an unethical and destructive program employed by the IRS in the collection of revenues. In that the amendment eliminates the program, it must be considered consistent with the spirit of this bill.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nebraska that I appreciate the kind comments about my work on the Internal Revenue Service tax issues generally in the past. I also want to say that but for the Senator from Nebraska, we would not be on the floor today. The people of Nebraska should understand, as I am sure they do, the tenaciousness of the senior Senator from Nebraska. The work that he has done on this issue--when the history books are written about tax reform in this country, one of the chapters has to be dedicated to him. I personally appreciate, on behalf of my constituents from the State of Nevada, the work that you have done on this issue. I also think the work done on the underlying legislation, giving the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service the power to do some things for a change will allow the commissioner to take a good look at this program and make some suggestions, which in the past fell on deaf ears because he had no power and authority to do anything. So I think we have a good commissioner. I am willing to have my amendment modified. I think it is a step in the right direction. There may be some things that I don't understand having only gotten----

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am happy to talk a little louder. I say to my friend from Delaware that this has always been one of my habits. I can remember when I first started trying case, there was a judge named Marshall--and Las Vegas only had 3 or 4 judges at the time--and he was hard of hearing. I would get up and talk to the jury and he could not hear what I was saying, so he would get upset at me. He thought I was saying things I didn't want him to hear. That wasn't the case then and it's not the case now. I will try to be more direct to the Senator from Delaware. 
What I was saying is that I think this underlying legislation gives the commissioner of the IRS power he didn't have before, which is good. One of the problems we have had in the past is that the commissioner of the IRS has had no power to 
make changes in the way the Service operates. This legislation certainly gives him power to do that. 
So, as I said to my friend from Nebraska, and I say again, I am willing for my amendment to be modified to have the commissioner report back to us within a reasonable time as to whether or not this program should be terminated in its entirety, or whether it should be modified. There may be instances when there may be a need for some type of a contingent fee. I am not aware of any, but there may be. I have enough confidence in the underlying legislation, which will be in effect in a few weeks, we hope, and in the commissioner of the IRS that I am willing to allow my amendment to be modified.

So I would be happy to modify this amendment so that the commissioner could report back to us within a reasonable period of time.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to extend my appreciation to every Member of this Senate for unanimously passing a resolution that dedicates today to be National Eating Disorder Awareness Day. 
The purpose is to raise awareness and educate others so that we can end the silence that has shrouded eating disorders for so long. The reason this is important is, this affects 8 million people. Eight million people in this country have eating disorders; the vast majority of them are women. 
A recent study of a group of fourth graders reveals that 50 percent of these little students believed they were overweight. Eighty-one percent of the girls in the same group reported that they had already been on diets. These are 9-year-old kids. 
Today, younger and younger children are adopting restrictive eating procedures and patterns. What begins as abnormal behavior toward food and weight control may develop into anorexia, bulimia, and other forms of disordered eating. 
As with any illness, I believe it is wise to invest in resources and programs working toward prevention. By heightening awareness and increasing education, we can save many young children before they become trapped in a life-threatening cycle of an eating disorder. 
I extend my appreciation to the entire Senate for allowing this resolution to pass. It sends a message to the country that we care about the 8 million people who have eating disorders.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Working Meals Fairness Act for myself and Senator Bryan, which provides for the exemption of meals from consideration as taxable income when provided as a benefit to employees of the service sector. 
Mr. President, during the past few days the Finance Committee has conducted hearings in which victims of IRS injustice have provided poignant testimony of their experiences at the hands of overzealous IRS agents. Their testimony has made us all aware that the time has come to overhaul the manner in which the IRS deals with the honest law-abiding citizens of this country. This overhaul will require a fundamental restructuring of the IRS customer service organization and a fresh look at what constitutes fairness. 
Mr. President, as part of this fresh look, I am joining Senator Bryan today in introducing legislation to remedy an unquestionably unfair tax policy resulting from a recent tax court decision. It was a decision in support of the IRS' position which is going to have widespread effect on the working men and women who are employed by our hotels, restaurants and resorts. In short, this decision eliminated the deduction for meals provided to service industry employees by their employer. Our legislation would reform the manner in which gratuitous meals are treated as taxable income under current IRS code. 
Mr. President, all across this country, workers are going to be asked to pay taxes to the IRS for the meal they receive while on duty in the service industry. These workers often work more than one job, while raising a family, and for all intents and purposes play by the rules. It isn't enough that these same workers pay transportation costs and child care costs to hold these jobs. Now we must tax the hand that feeds them. These meals are often provided for the convenience of both the employer and employee in order to provide the enhanced customer service which has become the hallmark of the service sector in this country. 
Mr. President, our legislation, simply put, would exempt any meal, provided as a benefit of employment to an employee during their shift of duty, from being treated as taxable income. 
Mr. President, this nation depends heavily on the vital contributions of the service industry. It is an industry characterized by high employee turnover, low wages and in many cases, poor benefits. In order to recruit and retain the quality worker that the industry depends upon, and we as consumers have come to expect, the provision of a meal is the least we can offer. To tax this meal is going a bit too far in my judgement. Isn't it ironic that we maintain a policy which costs the average service worker $300 a year in additional taxes? Isn't it ironic . . . we often tax those who can least afford to pay? 
Mr. President, my job in this body is to stand up for the workers of Nevada. I ask my colleagues to stand with me on this matter on behalf of workers in their state. Because of policies like this, the average American is justified in their perception that the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. I therefore ask my colleagues in this body to join with me in taking another step on behalf of the American worker who sent us here to represent their interests. 
Mr. President, it is time we all ask the IRS to leave the service workers of America alone. They are already paying their fair share.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would correct a problem which plagues a special group of older Americans. I am speaking on behalf of those affected by the Social Security notch. 
For my colleagues who may not be aware, the Social Security notch causes 11 million Americans born between the years 1917-1926 to receive less in Social Security benefits than Americans born outside the notch years due to changes made in the 1977 Social Security benefit formula. 
I have felt compelled over the years to speak out about this issue and the injustice it imposes on millions of Americans. The notch issue has been debated and debated, studied and studied, yet to date, no solution to it has been found. Because of this, many older Americans born during this period must scrimp to afford the most basic of necessities. 
Mr. President, I am the first to acknowledge that with any projected budget surplus we must save Social Security. In many ways, my legislation does just this. It restores confidence to the many notch victims around the country and will show them that we in Congress will accept responsibility for any error that was made. We should not ask them to accept less as a result of our mistake. While we must save Social Security for the future, we have an obligation to those, who through no fault of their own, receive less than those that were fortunate enough to be born just days before or after the notch period. 
I believe we owe a debt to notch babies. Like any American family, we must first pay the bills before we invest in the future. With a surplus projected for this fiscal year, we have the resources to make good on our debt to notch babies. We should come forward and honor our commitment. 
Mr. President, the `notch' situation had its origins in 1972, when Congress decided to create automatic cost-of-living adjustments to help Social Security benefits keep pace with inflation. Previously, each adjustment had to await legislation, causing beneficiaries' monthly payments to lag behind inflation. When Congress took this action, it was acting under the best of intentions. 
Unfortunately, this new benefit adjustment method was flawed. To function properly, it required that the economy behave in much the same fashion that it had in the 1950s and 1960s, with annual wage increases outpacing prices, and inflation remaining relatively low. As we all know, that did not happen. The rapid inflation and high unemployment of the 1970s generated increases in benefits. In an effort to end this problem, in 1977 Congress revised the way that benefits were computed. In making its 
revisions, Congress decided that it was not proper to reduce benefits for persons already receiving them; it did, however, decide that benefits for all future retirees should be reduced. As a result, those born after January 1, 1917 would, by design, receive benefits that were, in many cases, far less. In an attempt to ease the transition to the new, lower benefit levels, Congress designed a special `transitional computation method' for use by beneficiaries born between 1917 and 1921. 
Mr. President, we have an obligation to convey to our constituents that Social Security is a fair system. In town hall meetings back home in Nevada, I have a hard time trying to tell that to a notch victim. They feel slighted by their government and if I were in their situation I would too. Through no fault of their own, they receive less, sometimes as much as $200 less, than their neighbors. 
The legislation I am offering today is my proposal to right the wrong. I propose using any projected budget surplus to pay the lump sum benefit to notch babies. While we have a surplus, let's fix the notch problem once and for all and restore the confidence of the ten million notch babies across this land. 
Government has an obligation to be fair. I don't think we have been in the case of notch babies. My support of notch babies is longstanding. I introduced the only notch amendment in April 1991 that ever passed in Congress as part of the fiscal year 1992 Budget Resolution. Unfortunately, it did not become the law of the land as it was dropped in Conference with the House of Representatives. I have cosponsored numerous pieces of legislation over the years to address this issue. With this legislation, my effort continues. 
Mr. President, it is unfortunate that these measures have not seen the light of day. Many who have written to me think Congress is waiting for notch babies to die rather than honor this debt. I must tell you it concerns me when our constituents have this perception of their elected representatives. Unfortunately, the truth is that today a number of notch babies will die. We will not have to worry about those notch babies, or honor our debt to them. This is the wrong approach. 
Each day a grave injustice is perpetrated when these people pass away. We have to do something to make sure Americans believe that Social Security is a fair system. Passage of my legislation provides us that chance. I invite members to join me in cosponsoring this important legislation. 
I acknowledge that the battle for notch reform suffered a major setback when on December 31, 1994, the Commission on the Social Security `Notch' issue released its final report. It 
concluded that the `benefits paid to those in the `Notch' years are equitable, and no remedial legislation is in order.' The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare strongly disagreed with the Committee's methodology and conclusions. Although they have stopped advocating for this issue due to the political and fiscal climate, their disagreement with the outcome is nonetheless significant. 
The Commission's report also stated `in retrospect' Congress `Probably should have' limited the benefits of those who were grandfathered, but that it is too late now to do so given their advanced age. Since we did not do the right thing then, I propose that we do the right thing now. Let's show we have the courage to correct a mistake when we have made one. The Commission report provided political cover for those who were opposed to notch reform legislation. I have long opposed `political' solutions to problems such as this. 
My legislation is intended to make good on what this government should have done long ago. I propose that workers who attain the age of 65 after 1981 and before 1992 be allowed to choose either lump sum payment over four years totaling $5,000 or an improved benefit computation formula under a new 10-year rule governing the transition to the changes in benefit computation rules enacted in the Social Security Amendments of 1977. 
As of December 1996, there were 11,637,390 recipients born between 1917 and 1926 who were receiving Social Security retirement benefits. By providing each with a $5,000 lump sum payment or an improved benefit computation formula, maximum costs would be $60 billion spread over four years or $15 billion annually. 
There are some who would say there are `bigger fish to fry' such as Social Security solvency and Medicare's long term solvency. While I am in full agreement that these are very important issues that I intend to work on, we should include in our discussion concerning uses of any budget surplus, to repair the damage that has been done as a result of notch. Living on a fixed income is not easy. Many notch babies have difficulty making ends meet. This one time lump sum payment would provide much needed financial support for some of this nation's most needy citizens. 
Mr. President, it is time to return these dollars to the hands of those who earned them. It is time to show our support for notch reform. All of our offices have staff to help us answer the mail. We tell our constituents what bills have been offered and that we will lend our support if their issue comes to a vote. 
Well, here is our change. I am introducing this legislation because actions speak louder than words. The `Notch Fairness Act of 1998' that I am introducing on behalf of notch victims today, is intended to put my words into action. I ask all my colleagues to join me in support of this important and long overdue legislation.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I underline and underscore every word said by my colleague from New Mexico. This is a serious problem. The little amount of money that we want to spend on this will save inordinate amounts of money in welfare costs, costs to our criminal justice system and in our education system. This amendment, in my opinion, is the most important aspect of the legislation with which we have dealt. If we are going to do something about education, we have to slow down and, if possible, stop the dropout rate in our schools. 
High school dropouts: Mr. President, unemployment rates of high school dropouts are more than twice those of high school graduates. The probability of falling into poverty is three times higher for high school dropouts than for students who have finished high school. 
The median personal income of high school graduates during prime earning years, 25 years to 54 years, is nearly twice that of high school dropouts. That figure is startling. 
The future of high school dropouts: What is the future? They may have a job making a lot of money in lawn maintenance or working in a service station. The median personal income of college graduates is more than three times that of high school dropouts. 
Among prisoners in the United States, 82 percent of the prisoners in the United States never finished high school. That should send a message to this body loud and clear. 
The children of dropouts have a much greater chance of dropping out of school. 
The demographics of the State of Nevada and many Western States are changing rapidly. In the State of Nevada, the Hispanic population is rising very rapidly, adding a great deal to the culture of the State of Nevada, which is named after Hispanics--Nevada, snow-cap; Las Vegas, the meadows. 
The dropout rate among Hispanic students is 30 percent compared to an overall rate of 11 percent, about three times higher than any other group of people. The Hispanic unemployment rate is 11.3 percent compared to 7.3 percent for non-Hispanics. 
In 1991, Mr. President, 49 percent of all persons living in Hispanic households received some type of assistance. This is much, much higher than any other group of people in the United States. This cries out for doing something about dropouts, when the dropout rate is 30 percent, three times higher than any other group. 
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Hispanic Americans will make up nearly 20 percent of the U.S. population by the year 2030. This bill is not directed toward Hispanics, but Hispanics will benefit significantly from this legislation. 
Mr. President, we need to make these changes. I congratulate and applaud the leadership of the Senator from New Mexico. 
Dropouts in high school are a problem we must address. We must do it soon. The aim of our legislation is to encourage the type of innovative thinking that is working other places, adopt and use those programs that work well. Each school would receive a little bit of money, because we found it only takes a little bit to make a great deal of difference. I ask all my colleagues to join in supporting this most important amendment.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Transfer Act for myself and Senator Bryan, which provides for the sale of public lands in the Ivanpah Valley, Nevada, to the Clark County Department of Aviation. 
Mr. President, Las Vegas Valley has the fastest growing population in the United States. Fifty percent of the visitors to Las Vegas come through McCarran Airport. This percentage is increasing as Las Vegas grows and increases in importance as an international travel destination. 
Mr. President, Las Vegas Valley needs to begin developing other airports to accommodate passenger, air cargo, and charter flights. It is inevitable that McCarran Airport is reaching its capacity. 
Mr. President, Las Vegas Valley has a unique opportunity to combine 6,650 acres of public land with up to $400 million in private capital to provide a new publicly-owned and operated airport for Clark County. The Ivanpah Valley Airport site is located about 30 miles south of Las Vegas and would provide a secondary, southern gateway to the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Of the total acreage, about 2,000 acres will be developed for the airport and the balance will be developed as an industrial center. The Ivanpah Valley Airport will be integrated into a global air cargo distribution network. 
Mr. President, let me assure you that this is not a giveaway of public lands. My bill requires Clark County to pay fair market value for the land. Additionally, even though private dollars will be used to help develop this complex, the airport will remain publicly-owned and managed.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, Johnnie B. Rawlinson was born in Concord, North Carolina on December 16, 1952. The fourth of seven children, Johnnie grew up in Kannapolis, North Carolina where she attended public school and was a member of the first integrated class at A.L. Brown High School in Kannapolis. Upon graduation, Johnnie received a full scholarship to attend North Carolina A&T University in Greensboro, North Carolina. She majored in psychology and graduated Summa Cum Laude with a Bachelor's of Science degree in 1974. 
Johnnie met Dwight Rawlinson, her husband of 21 years, while they were both juniors at A&T. They married in 1976 and moved to California where Dwight, an officer in the Air Force, had been transferred. Johnnie enrolled at the University of the Pacific's McGeorge School of Law where she had been granted a full academic scholarship. In November of 1977, at the beginning of her second year of law school, Dwight was transferred to Nellis Air Force Base. Pregnant with their first child, Johnnie stayed in California to finish up her schooling. In 1978, Dwight joined her for spring break and together they celebrated the birth of their daughter Monica. Since Nevada has no law school, Dwight and Johnnie decided that Johnnie and Monica would return to California for her third and final year of law school. Monica attended classes with her mother and they both returned to Nellis for long weekends and summers. In 1979, Johnnie B. Rawlinson graduated in the top ten percent of her law school class, the first attorney in her family. 
Johnnie was admitted to the California Bar in 1979 and the Nevada Bar in 1980. While she was waiting to find out her Bar results, she worked as a law clerk for John O'Reilly, former Chair of the Nevada Gaming Commission. In June of 1980, she went to work as a staff attorney for Nevada Legal Services, where she worked on landlord-tenant disputes and unemployment compensation. After four months of work for Legal Services, in October of 1980, she was hired as Deputy District Attorney by Nevada Governor Bob Miller, who was then serving as Clark County DA. 
For the past 17 years, Rawlinson has moved steadily up the ladder at the District Attorney's office. She served for nine years as a Deputy District Attorney, developing expertise in the areas of Arbitration, Collection Law, Hospital Law, Local Government Purchasing, Employment Law, Labor Law, Civil Litigation and Workers Compensation. In September 1989, she was promoted to Chief Deputy District Attorney and in January of 1995, Clark County DA Stewart Bell promoted her to Assistant District Attorney. In her current position, she supervises the Civil, Family Support, and Administration Divisions of the office. She presents evidence at Coroner's Inquests and is the Chair of the Professional Hiring Committee. 
In the mid 1980s, Governor Richard Bryan appointed Rawlinson to the Welfare Board where she served until 1991. In 1991, she made it to the final round of the interview process for an open position as U.S. Magistrate in Nevada District Court. When another Magistrate position opened up in Northern Nevada, she was named to the Magistrate Judge Selection Committee. 
A past member of the State of Nevada Board of Governors and a past board member of the Clark County Bar Association, the Southern Nevada Association of Women Attorneys, and the Las Vegas Chapter of the National Bar Association, Rawlinson plays an active role in Nevada legal affairs. She currently serves on the State Bar of Nevada Board of Bar Examiners and is Chair of the Lawyer Referral Services Committee. She has also served as a lawyer representative to the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference and currently serves as a member of Judge Phillip Pro's Civil Justice Reform Act Advisory Group. A frequent lecturer to the Lorman Business Institute, Rawlinson has also served as an Adjunct Professor of Hospital Law at the College of St. Francis and as an adjunct Professor of Employment Law at the Community College of Southern Nevada. 
Today, Johnnie and Dwight Rawlinson are the proud parents of three children: Monica, a graduate of Western High, received her own full academic scholarship to South Carolina State University where she is in her sophomore year studying pre-med; Traci is entering the ninth grade at Western High and David is a second grader at Howard Wasdenn Elementary School. 
Residents of Clark County for close to twenty years, the Rawlinsons enjoy spending time with their family and friends from church. An active member of the Church of Christ in North Las Vegas, Johnnie served as Secretary of the Church for 10 years and taught Sunday school as well. 
In late August 1997, I sent Rawlinson's name to the President as my nominee for Federal District Court Judge for the District of Nevada. On January 27, 1998, President Clinton formally nominated her for a seat on the federal bench. She was unanimously reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 26, 1998. Tonight she was confirmed by the Senate. Johnnie B. Rawlinson will be the first African American and the first woman to serve as a Nevada Federal District Court Judge.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, schools are helped every day by mining. Mining pays taxes that provide all types of things for education. It takes millions and millions of dollars to find the minerals that are hidden in the ground. You don't just walk out and say, here, I am going to dig a gold mine or find copper here. It takes millions to find these minerals. 
The United States is a net exporter of gold. It was only 10 or 12 years ago we were here on the Senate floor and throughout the country telling people we need to do things so that we can become a net exporter, especially of minerals. At that time we were depending on South Africa, which was in deep trouble in the world, and the former Soviet Union. We are now an exporter of many of the minerals we weren't just a few years ago. That is good. 
I want to show you some recent Nevada newspaper headlines, many from the same day. `Getchell loses $29.4 million in '94.' `Echo Bay Mines loses $240 million in 1997.' `Placer Dome loses $249 million in 1997.' `Meridian Gold loses $69.2 million in 1997,' a small company. It is very, very difficult. `Vista Gold to lay off 135 workers.' Small company, big layoffs. `Newmont lays off 155 at Carlin, 460 total.' `Layoffs Reach Beyond the Mining Industry.' 
Mr. President, it is not only Nevada experiencing these headlines. Yesterday, in the paper--I wish it were an April Fools' joke; it isn't--`487 Arizonans Lose Their Jobs as Copper Prices Fall.' The United States mineral industry is suffering significantly and when the minerals industry suffers so does the rest of the economy. 
Here is from one newspaper's AP story. `And the ripple effect of layoffs at Newmont Gold has spread to Carlin. Even some of the service industries are starting layoffs at this time.' 
Another newspaper article. `Homestake Mining Reports '97 Loss of $168.9 million. Homestake laid off its nearly 900 strong work force while restructuring is under way and still isn't saying how many of those will be rehired according to spokesperson Steeves.' 
The minerals industry is suffering significantly. They are doing their best to hang on to maintain employment. The best paying blue-collar jobs in the entire Western United States are mining jobs. Thousands of people are being laid off. Gold prices are at an 18-year low. And now we are being told that they are pigs, that they are using all of these tax benefits. The fact is thousands of people have good jobs because of mining.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment that has been offered by Senator Reid and Senator Bryan is supported by all environmental groups in the country. It is supported by the Counsel for Environmental Quality and the Secretary of the Interior. The Endangered Species Act is an important act. We have worked very hard to come up with a compromise. We must have a source of funding that is realistic. This is not. This is a quick fix that will fail just as quickly. It is unrealistic to sell public lands basically from the State of Nevada for a national project. 
The amendment we have offered says that the landowner, instead of programs included in the Endangered Species Recovery Act, should be financed from a dedicated source of funding, and the public lands should not be sold to fund the Landowner Incentive Program of the Endangered Species Recovery Act. 
This amendment should be passed. It is the fair thing to do.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Kyl amendment. I do so because I am not convinced that a private contracting provision is necessary in the first place. This amendment is presented in the name of freedom of choice when in fact it has a potentially devastating effect on the Medicare program and the health care costs paid by America's senior citizens. Seniors today have a choice in their health care options. They have the ability to privately contract for care not covered by Medicare as they always have. They also have payment protection in terms of how much they can be charged for Medicare covered services. Under the Kyl amendment these protections are removed and seniors who engage in private contracting would be responsible for 100% of the cost of their care. Even if this care is for Medicare covered services. Medicare would not pay for these services under private contract nor would supplemental policies pay as well. Seniors would be 100% responsible for these costs. 
Today, 92% of Medicare beneficiaries are satisfied with Medicare. Under this amendment, the potential for significant out of pocket costs for seniors becomes a reality. When seniors already pay 21% of their health care costs out of pocket, any amendment to raise these costs should be closely scrutinized. The potential for fraudulent activity is also significantly increased under this amendment. While I have faith in our physician community and don't believe they are waiting in the wings to defraud our Medicare system, the potential for the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to monitor claims that might be submitted while a private contracting relationship has been established is questionable. We have a responsibility to minimize any scenario that might lead to fraudulent activity and under this amendment, those guarantees to do not exist. The Congressional Budget Office reports that the HCFAs efforts to screen inappropriate or fraudulent claims could be significantly compromised. There is no system is a place that would allow HCFA to determine which patients are paying for their care out of pocket from those whose physician is submitting claims to Medicare for these same services. It is for this reason that the private contracting clause in the balanced budget Act of 1997 has a 2-year exemption clause which would require physician's who participate in private contracting to see no other Medicare patients during this period. This would enable HCFA to ensure that no double payments are being made. This is the only way HCFA at this time could preclude possible fraudulent activity. 
Prior to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 few of us in Congress had ever heard about private contracting in Medicare. This is because our senior constituents were not concerned about this issue and our physician constituents had never surfaced the issue either. My sense is that the truth of the matter is that they would not be concerned about this issue now as well had it not surfaced during the balanced budget debate. The cost protections afforded by Medicare are valuable to seniors and the peace of mind that is achieved knowing out of pocket costs will be limited means a great deal to those on fixed incomes. In that 96 percent of physicians participate in Medicare, there were no signs of their dissatisfaction or a call for change. Perhaps rather than voting on this amendment which is framed in the name of freedom of choice, the better approach would be to remove the private contracting choice provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and return to the way things were. I do not believe that this debate is about freedom of choice for seniors nor do I believe that physicians are standing in line to defraud our Medicare system. What I do believe is that we are debating an issue that before we learned what it meant seven months ago, few of us, constituents included, were even aware of. I submit that change for change sake is a mistake. We have a strong Medicare Program with protections in place to protect beneficiaries from high out of pocket costs and one that is committed to removing the potential for fraudulent activity from the system. We must be very cautious before we take steps to destroy the success of this program and the many protections this program provides to the 38 million beneficiaries who count on it for their day to day health care. In my view, the Kyl amendment does not pass the test to ensure payment protection for beneficiaries nor does it ensure the potential for fraudulent activity is removed. As such, I must oppose this amendment.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment is important because I think what we are doing here is setting some very important public policy. That public policy is that we should not auction off Federal land to take care of the Endangered Species Act. 
In short, this sense-of-the-Senate resolution I have presented to the Senate deals with the budget resolution and its report concerning the sale of excess public lands. The provision in question calls for financing of certain landowner incentive programs through the sale of excess BLM land. What this means, in layman's language, is that the Environment and Public Works Committee came up with an endangered species reauthorization compromise. It came out of the committee by a vote of 16-3 and received bipartisan support in the committee. 
The problems that have arisen since we reported that bill are relatively minor in nature. However, one of the problems that has been talked about is some permanent means of financing the programs in the new Endangered Species Act. I support the new Endangered Species Act, but I know that there must be some form of financing for that. I am convinced this is not the way to finance it. As someone who has been involved in the negotiations on the reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act, I am aware of the need to provide a dedicated source of funding for these programs. These programs assist private landowners in carrying out the purpose, the intention, the aim of the Endangered Species Act. That is basically protection and recovery of threatened and endangered species. 
I am supportive of providing the landowners with incentive for proactive efforts to conserve endangered species. However, the Federal Government's responsibility in assisting landowners carrying out this act should not be borne by Western States, and principally one Western State, at this time because the real estate market is so hot in the southern Nevada area. This responsibility should not be borne basically by one State. The Endangered Species Act covers the whole country. In that it does cover the whole country, the whole country should be involved in solving the details of it, especially the financing. It is not fair that States like Colorado, Arizona, Idaho, Nevada, and New Mexico be the cash cow for the Endangered Species Act. 
The Endangered Species Act and requirements apply to all 50 States. It is a national Federal law because, Mr. President, there is a national Federal interest in the protection and conservation of endangered species. We shouldn't turn our Federal lands into a land bank that finances this important act. 
I understand the importance of Federal land. The State of Nevada is 87 percent owned by the Federal Government. I repeat, 87 percent of the State of Nevada is owned by the Federal Government; 13 percent of that land is owned by private parties. We want to get more of that land in the public sector into the private sector, but we want to do it in an orderly fashion, and we have done that in the soon-to-be second largest city in Nevada. Henderson, NV, is the place where I went to high school. At that time, it was a community of about 10,000 people. It is now approaching 200,000 people and growing very rapidly--the most rapidly growing city in all of Nevada; in 
fact, one of the most rapidly growing communities in all of America. 
Now, the reason it has been allowed to grow is because we have added Federal land to the land base of the city of Henderson. It has had a very orderly growth. We have some planned communities. One of the most important planned communities anywhere in the country is a place called Green Valley. It is a beautiful community. Mr. President, that has been done in an orderly fashion. It hasn't been forced upon anyone. It wasn't done at auction. That, in effect, is what we are talking about here. They are public lands that belong to the public for their enjoyment. 
Not only has Henderson received the benefit of public lands, but other places throughout the State of Nevada, like Mesquite, Carlin, NV. We could go on with many other examples. These are public lands and they belong to the public for their enjoyment. 
Are we going to auction off all the nice places in Nevada and then only people of wealth who can buy those lands will be able to use those nice places in Nevada? I hope not. That is in effect what they are doing here. They are mandating in this budget resolution the sale of public lands to meet the needs of the Endangered Species Act. Mandating the sale and using the proceeds to fund programs outside the State where the land is would be patently unfair. 
This body should reject this misguided proposal and support this amendment. It is surprising to me that any Western Senator could support the underlying provision in this budget resolution saying we are going to auction off Federal lands the purpose of which is to carry out the intent of the Endangered Species Act. 
Apart from the regional States' specific bias, the amendment should also be rejected on environmental grounds. This will be one of the key environmental votes of this Congress, or any Congress. 
Opponents of this provision in the budget resolution are Friends of the Earth, American Oceans Campaign, Center for Marine Conservation, Defenders of Wildlife Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, Environmental Defense Fund, Grassroots Environmental Effectiveness Network, Izaak Walton League of America, National Audubon Society, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resource Defense Council, Trout Unlimited, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Western Ancient Forest Campaign, the Wilderness Society, the World Wildlife Fund, and many others. 
The League of Conservation Voters is looking at this very closely, I am told, as they should. 
We have worked closely with these groups over the past years in coming up with the Endangered Species Act. One of their strongest concerns in this period of time is to ensure that we put in place a long-term mechanism to finance these programs. The proposal included in this resolution funds these important programs only for limited times and only for the one-time revenue scheme. As a matter of public policy, this doesn't make sense. The demand to participate in the program and additional obligation to maintain incentives over time is going to create a tremendous pressure to sell additional public lands. 
That isn't how we should get rid of public lands, how we should get public lands into the private sector. We should not do it on a forced sale. It should be done in an orderly process, certainly not an auction so that we need money this year because we have three endangered species listed in Florida, two in Colorado, one in Nevada, and three in Hawaii. That isn't the way it should be. 
To show you how disingenuous those who are pushing this proposal are, the Bureau of Land Management sells an average of 5,000 acres per year for about $2.5 million. It is interesting to note that Congress Daily quotes an unnamed BLM official as saying the Budget Committee estimates $350 million revenue from this proposal. Absurd. It is impossible. 
Mr. President, there are a number of appropriate justifications for disposal of public lands. I have talked about the city of Henderson, the city of Carlin, the city of Mesquite, and other places in Nevada. I have also worked closely with Senator Bryan and my two colleagues from the House on the Nevada Public Lands Act, which provides for the disposal of certain public lands in Nevada--a good piece of legislation. We are going to have a hearing in May on this matter before the committee of the senior Senator from Alaska, who is the chairman of the committee. We have confidence that he will report that bill out favorably and that it will pass. 
Now, why in the world would they--whoever `they' are pushing this budget resolution--want to undermine something that is working well? We have general support from the committee--I spoke to the chairman myself--on the Nevada Public Lands Act. And it applies not only to Nevada, but to the entire West. It would allow lands to be auctioned, and those moneys would stay in the State from where the land is sold for environmental concerns. There may be a special piece of land that the Federal Government wants. There may be some things that the Federal Government needs, and auctioning off these 
lands would allow them to do that. 
For example, we have a number of things in the State of Nevada for which the Federal Government wants these lands. They do not want the land to be subdivided. It is a special place to be used for a park or recreational purposes. So these lands would be auctioned off, and you could purchase that land to put it in the public sector or the private sector. 
So I think it is important that some of the lands we identified in our legislation--the Nevada Public Lands Act--would, of course, be used now for this legislation, the budget resolution. That is not the way it should be. I am very concerned. I have worked long and hard on the Endangered Species Act, but I am not about to be part of an Endangered Species Act if it has this as a source of funding. I think there is probably some concern about why this is put in the budget resolution. I guess it is kind of like a fire auction. You get the best you can with what you have. I think what they have in this instance is a hot real estate market in the State of Nevada, southern Nevada particularly, and they are going to sell this land as quickly as they can. I think that is wrong. The amount of public lands in Las Vegas would be the only likely source today of a significant amount of money to fund these proposed programs. Tomorrow, it may be the outskirts of Denver. Next year, it may be the outskirts of Albuquerque. These would be places they would go to raise as much money as they could as quickly as they can--fire sales to fund the Endangered Species Act. Funds would then be made available for incentives throughout the country, not just in Nevada. This is a conflict with the legislation that I have talked about earlier that is now before the Energy Committee. The resolution puts in place a public lands disposal policy that is entirely driven by the need to sell excess lands. But unlike the meritorious programs they will fund, which are temporary, the disposal of public lands is permanent. 
Mr. President, I have said that this proposal is a poison pill. I believe it is intended to kill reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. We have been negotiating the reauthorization of this monumental act for 2 years or more, along with Senators Baucus, Chafee, Kempthorne, and the administration. We sought to secure a dedicated source of funding for these private land programs. This is not it. While I can't speak for the administration, I repeat that we were never consulted on this proposal. Frankly, I don't like it. I think it is a poison pill. If our amendment is defeated, as far as I am concerned, it is the death of the Endangered Species Act. I could not agree to supporting a bill which so unfairly exploits the value of Nevada public lands and undermines the legislation. It has been more than a year in the making, the Nevada Public Lands Act.

Mr. REID. Madam President, I appreciate very much the leadership of the Senator from Wyoming on this issue. It is an important issue, and it is bipartisan. 
We hear a lot in this body about States rights. But where the illustration is clearly defined is this in States rights. I was part of the Indian Affairs Committee when we drew up legislation under the Indian Control Act, and, of course, the purpose of that act was to allow Indians to do anything in a State that non-Indians could do relating to gaming. 
For various reasons, the courts have interposed themselves, and now there is controversy as to really what the act stands for. But one thing we do know is that the clear intent of the Gaming Control Act was that Indians could not do more in a State related to gaming than non-Indians, and that is, in effect, what the Secretary is trying to do with the proposed rule--to have him be the arbiter of what goes on regarding gaming, no matter how the State might feel. It certainly would be unfair, and it would be in derogation of the intent of the original law. 
It has already been explained here that clearly the Secretary has a conflict of interest in this regard. He is someone who has as one of his main obligations the obligation to look out for Indians in regard to the trust responsibility. How can someone who has this obligation also say that he is going to be the interpreter of whether or not the State is dealing in a fair fashion in good faith? It is clear he cannot, and that is the reason for this amendment. 
Last year's Interior appropriations bill included language prohibiting the Secretary from approving Class III gaming compacts through September 30, 1998. This was done to address a problem created as the result of the Supreme Court's decision in Seminole v. Florida. Our concern was that after Seminole, tribes would immediately seek assistance from the Secretary in those situations where the tribe believed the state was not negotiating in good faith. 
It is important to recognize that Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) does not permit secretarial intervention without a finding that a State has negotiated with a tribe in bad faith. The Secretary now proposes that he make that finding himself. There is nothing in IGRA that gives the Secretary this broad authority. Indeed, this authority is vested in the Federal courts. 
I state clearly and without any qualification that I would be very happy to work as closely and as quickly as possible with the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, the senior Senator from Colorado, and the ranking senior Senator from Hawaii, to come up with statutory authority to work out this problem. But, the way the law now stands, it is up to the courts to do this. Certainly, there would never be legislation that would give the Secretary the authority to determine whether or not the State was acting in good faith. 
The consequences of permitting an appointed federal official to permit gambling on Indian lands based on tribal allegations of a State's bargaining position raises troubling federalism questions about the sovereign prerogatives of a State. 
By announcing a proposed Rulemaking on this issue in January, the Secretary seeks to disregard what this body affirmatively stated last year. 
This proposal makes no sense. 
By inviting the tribes to seek resolution with Secretary, the states, and the Governors, are placed at a severe disadvantage. 
We can not expect the Secretary of Interior to be able to arbitrate these types of contentious disputes over Indian gaming. 
I repeat, as I have said earlier. The Secretary has a fiduciary and trust responsibility to the tribe and thus can not fairly arbitrate these types of disagreements. 
The Secretary's decision in January to propose regulations on this issue circumvents the intent of what we sought to do on last year's Interior Bill. 
Essentially, the Secretary announced his intention to do everything but promulgate a final rule on this issue. 
My amendment is very simple. 
It prevents the Secretary from promulgating as final regulations the proposed regulations he published on January 22, 1998 (63 Fed. Reg. 3289). 
Additionally, he cannot issue a proposed rulemaking, or promulgate, any similar regulations to provide for procedures for gaming activities under IGRA in any case in which a state asserts a defense of sovereign immunity to a lawsuit brought by an Indian tribe in Federal court to compel the State to participate in compact negotaitions for Class III gaming. 
I believe any effort by Interior on this issue would be opposed by the states and the governors. 
The Western Governors' Association has already weighed in in opposition to this proposed rule. 
This is an issue involving states rights. 
The states and the governors should be able to negotiate with the tribes without duress. 
They should not be placed on an uneven playing field in these negotiations. 
How can they reasonably expect to get an impartial hearing from an arbiter who has a fiduciary and trust obligation to the tribes? 
With all of the problems we are now experiencing with Indian Gaming, the Secretary should not be undertaking action that will promote its expansion to the detriment of states rights. 
I repeat. I would be very happy to work as a member of the Indian Affairs Committee with the chairman and the ranking member to come up with statutory authority to work up a way out of this so it doesn't have to be determined in the courts. But the courts are a better place to determine what is good or bad faith, and the Secretary is in absolute conflict of interest.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the early days of World War II, General MacArthur withdrew his forces from Luzon to the Bataan Peninsula. These forces were responsible for delaying the Japanese timetable for conquest by four months and for keeping the Japanese forces tied up in the Philippines. After four months of fighting, the combined American and Filipino forces were forced to surrender. Many perished in the fight, those that survived were in poor health or were wounded. 
Following the surrender of forces in April 1942, the Japanese marched the 70,000 prisoners the length of the Bataan peninsula to prisoner of war camps. It is estimated that more than 10,000 perished during the Death March. 
The tragedy and horror of the Death March is almost impossible to imagine. The prisoners were marched with little food and water from the southern end of the Bataan Peninsula to San Fernando, a total of 55 miles. From San Fernando, the prisoners were taken by rail to Capas where they were marched the final eight miles to Camp O'Donnell. Many of the prisoners were weakened from disease and from months of fighting. Those that fell behind were beaten badly by the Japanese troops--a prisoner unable to get up was often executed on the spot. Two out of every three Americans who fought at Battan failed to return home, having either died in battle, during the Death March, or in prison camps. 
This week, 80 survivors of the Bataan Death March are meeting in Reno, Nevada for the American Defenders of Bataan & Corregidor Western Chapter Convention. I want to take this opportunity to recognize some of the heroic veterans who were part of MacArthur's army which held off the numerically superior Japanese forces on the Bataan Peninsula for four long months. These heroes not only survived the horrific battle and the subsequent Death March, but also endured internment in POW camps in the Philippines, Manchuria, Korea, and Japan. 
Several of the Bataan Death March survivors attending the convention are from my home state of Nevada. I'd like to recognize these veterans in the Record: Arthur Bartholf, Bill R. Black, John Bowler, Richard Breslin, Raymond Cavellaro, Chesley H. Irvin, Ralph Levenberg Donald McDougall, Patrick E. Morris, Manuel Navarez, Douglas Northam, Tomas Pagaliluan, John D. Pasini, John Perkowski, Steve Rogers, George Small, Karl D. Tobey. There will also be survivors from California, Arizona, Oregon and Washington at the convention this week. 
Mr. President, I speak for myself, for everyone here in the Senate, and for all Nevada citizens, I am deeply appreciative for the sacrifices these heroic men made who survived such horrific circumstances surrounding the Bataan Death March. I know this is a debt which we can never completely repay, but nonetheless it is so important to say--Thank you for your dedication and devotion to protecting our freedom and liberty.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, Wendell H. Ford tomorrow will surpass the tenure for all Senators from the State of Kentucky as having served the longest period of time. Wendell Ford is Kentucky through and through--born in Daviess County, KY, went to the University of Kentucky, served in the U.S. Army during the Second World War. Wendell Ford is someone who has contributed to this body second to none. I rise today to join with others in recognizing the contributions of one of the Senate's finest Members and someone I consider a friend. 
As I have said, Mr. President, on March 14 Senator Wendell Ford will become Kentucky's longest-serving Senator, surpassing the tenure of the legendary Alben Barkley. Senator Ford will have served 8,478 days in the Senate from the State of Kentucky. 
In preparing these remarks, we were looking through the Courier-Journal, an editorial which said: 
Senator Wendell Ford likes to refer to himself as a dumb country boy with dirt between his toes. 
Don't believe that for a second. 
The newspaper goes on to say that it was a long road from our colleague's hometown of Yellow Creek, KY, to Capitol Hill and an even longer one from the job of Senator to the Senate's assistant leader to the Senate's whip. 
It goes on: 
Only a smart, disciplined person could negotiate such passages without losing touch with who he really is. 
The newspaper concludes by saying: 
Senator Ford has done that. 
That is, he has negotiated these difficult passages and he has not lost touch with the people of the State of Kentucky. 
Those of us who know Wendell Ford can attest to his honor and to his sincerity. His rise from the Kentucky State Senate to Lieutenant Governor to the 49th Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky to now a U.S. Senator and the assistant leader of the Senate has never distracted the person Wendell Ford from the man he is--his own man, someone who has never forgotten his roots. 
In our Senate Democratic leadership meetings, Senator Ford is one who can always bring the discussion back to where we should be. His commonsense approach to legislation and politics is refreshing to me and should be reassuring not only to the people of Kentucky but to this country. 
Wendell Ford can be compassionate because, Mr. President, he is a compassionate man. He can be very tough because, Mr. President, he is a tough man. He can be very sincere because he is, Mr. President, a sincere man. Wendell Ford has in his quiver many arrows. Yes, compassion, toughness, and sincerity, but I think the arrow that he carries around that we all rely on is the wisdom that has developed in the person of Wendell Ford. 
Wendell Ford is truly one of the Senate's great talents, but one of his great talents is in the finest traditions of the Senate Chamber: his mastery of the negotiation of compromise. He is able to do this because he is respected, he is trusted, and, as I already indicated, he is honorable. 
This Senate will be lesser when Wendell Ford returns to his native Kentucky, but his quarter century of service to his State and to the Nation will stand as a legacy to be remembered and honored. 
Mr. President, I am grateful to have served with Wendell Ford. My wife Landra and I appreciate Jean, his lovely wife, and their--Wendell's and Jean's--love of their family and their love of the Senate family. I personally honor his wisdom, his humor, and his compassion. In an age of cynicism, I really appreciate Wendell Ford's down-home sincerity. It has inspired me. And it should inspire us all.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, during a much earlier stage in my life, I was a police officer. It was a different time. Police officers were treated much differently then than now. One of the things I did not have to worry about was wearing any type of bulletproof vest or body armor. That is not the case today. Things are much different than when I was a police officer. 
Now all law enforcement officers in the United States, sadly, must be concerned about being shot or in some way harmed as a result of their being a police officer. Because of that, Mr. President, I am very happy to commend this body for the passage of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act, which was passed last night by unanimous consent in this body. I commend Senators Leahy, Campbell and Hatch for working on this legislation with this Senator and others. We ask that this matter be acted on very quickly by the House and sent to the President as soon as possible. 
This bipartisan legislation creates a $25 million fund and a 50 percent matching grant program within the Department of Justice to help State and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor and bulletproof vests. The State of Nevada will receive at least $200,000 each year for this. 
According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 30 percent of the approximately 1,200 police officers who have been killed by firearms since 1980--30 percent, I repeat--would have had their lives saved if they had been wearing bulletproof vests or body armor of some kind. 
The FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing these body protectors is almost 14 times higher than those wearing such body protection. We hear all the time about police officers who do not have the same protection that criminals have. And that is the truth. It is a sad state of affairs when criminals many times are better protected on our streets than our law enforcement officials are. 
We cannot allow the criminal element to have the upper hand. One thing we can do is what we are doing in this legislation to protect law enforcement officers all over the country, including the State of Nevada, who put their lives on the line every day to protect us--our property and our person. 
Boulder City Police Officer David Mullin, who acts as the chief of police of Boulder City said: 
These vests are real life savers. They not only help protect officers from attacks involving guns and knives, they have [even] saved many officers from major injuries or death in traffic accidents. Unfortunately, [he goes on to say] there is a real difficulty in meeting purchasing and replacement [costs of these instruments]. 
These body-protection elements will go a long way in helping law enforcement in Nevada. Bulletproof vests can cost $1,000. They cost that much money. Nevada Highway Patrol Col. Michael E. Hood recently recounted a story about Maj. Dan Hammack, of the Nevada Highway Patrol. He stopped someone. The person immediately got out of the car--this is a routine traffic stop --and shot Major Hammack in the stomach. Had he been wearing this armor, he would not have been injured at all. 
Unfortunately, the accounts of Chief David Mullin and Highway Patrol Col. Michael Hood are stories that are heard all over the country on a daily basis. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act will ensure that all our law enforcement officials will have the ability to be equipped and protected for their jobs. I think this legislation should move as quickly as possible in the House so we can save the lives of police officers on a daily basis in this country. 
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Virginia, the law enforcement officials in Virginia have the same difficulty as the law enforcement officials in Nevada and the rest of the country. As we come home late at night, I see, along the parkway going to my home in Virginia, police officers have pulled somebody over. It is dark at night and they are out there alone. That is a frightening thing. Think of how that man or woman who has to do that feels in the dead of night, pulling over somebody, and they don't know for sure who is in the car. They know something is wrong or they wouldn't pull the car over. 
What this legislation does is give them an even break. They have some protection if this person, in their cowardly manner, gets out and shoots them. These body protectors will stop a bullet from killing them. It will still hurt, but it will stop the bullet from killing them. 
I express my appreciation to the senior Senator from Virginia for his kind comments and his usually fine advocacy on behalf of the people of Virginia and this country.

Mr. REID. My colleague, Senator Bryan, and I rise today to describe and elaborate on language that was accepted as an amendment to the Senate's reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. 
Last week, our colleagues agreed to create a Metropolitan Planning Organization for the Lake Tahoe Basin between Nevada and California. In addition to being one of the most beautiful places on Earth, the Lake Tahoe Basin is also one of the most environmentally sensitive. Locals within the Basin, the Washoe Indian Tribe, and the State Governments of Nevada and California have long recognized the unique status of Lake Tahoe. 
The Lake is the 3rd deepest in North America and the 10th deepest in the World. At its deepest point the Lake is 1,645 feet deep and averages about 1000 feet. Stretching 22 miles in length by 12 miles in width, the Lake has 72 miles of beautiful shore line that has beckoned millions of visitors over the years. 
For years, the many competing interests in the Basin have found ways to work together to protect the famed water quality of the Lake. Environmentalists, small businessmen, resorts and gaming interests, and private property owners have all long recognized that Lake Tahoe is a national treasure and must be preserved. 
The partnerships they have developed are unique and have proved the notion that it is not necessary to harm the economy to improve the environment. This has not been easy. The Basin consists of 4 different counties and one city located in two different states. There are portions of three separate National Forests in the Basin. The largest property owner, by far, is the United States Forest Service, which owns over 70 percent of the land. With so many competing stakeholders, it is amazing that so much has been accomplished. 
To assist in their efforts, Congress passed Public law 96-551, the Lake Tahoe Bi-State Compact, which established a locally-based planning 
process for Nevada and California. This compact recognized the unique nature of Tahoe and requires the region to meet or exceed a multitude of stringent state and federal transportation and air quality requirements. 
Last Summer, President Clinton hosted an environmental forum at Lake Tahoe to address the interrelated transportation, forest health, and water quality concerns that face the Basin. Transportation was identified as one of the key areas where improvements to infrastructure could also yield key environmental benefits. 
To enhance the ability of the residents of the Tahoe Basin to solve these transportation problems, my colleagues Senator Bryan, Senator Boxer and Senator Feinstein and I have asked the other members of the Senate to confer Metropolitan Planning Organization status on the Basin. Our colleagues have graciously granted our request, so Senator Bryan and I wanted to take several minutes to discuss what this status does (and does not mean) to Lake Tahoe. 
Is it not true that Metropolitan Planning Organization status for Lake Tahoe is merely designed to enhance the ability of the community's within the Basin to compete for federal transportation planning funds?

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend and perhaps the most recognizable Nevadan the world-over, Wayne Newton, for reaching his incredible fiftieth year in show business. 
Wayne Newton has reached amazing goals in an industry in which success can be short lived. Before most Americans had heard of Elvis Presley or the Beatles, Wayne Newton released a best-selling record, sung for the President of the United States, and toured with the Grand Old Opry road show. 
In a half-century, Wayne Newton has performed live for an astonishing fifteen million people and that number continues to grow each year. Tens of millions around the world have also enjoyed his talents through the radio, television, and movies. 
Wayne's musical genius was recognized early in life. At the age of six, the precocious youngster was already dazzling audiences as the star of a radio show, which aired before he went to school each morning. During his adolescent years, he entertained us through the new medium of television, performing regularly on our favorite variety shows. Americans quickly discovered Wayne's irresistible stage presence, enchanting voice, and charming smile. 
While still a teenager, he headlined a Las Vegas show and became one of the area's most popular attractions. Indeed, over the years, millions of tourists flocked to the Silver State to enjoy the sunny climate, scrumptious buffets, spectacular lights, magnificent resorts, and, to be sure, the singular magic of Wayne Newton. Wayne's nickname, Mr. Las Vegas, is richly deserved, and, as his career has grown and met with amazing success, so has that great city. 
At the age of 21, his single `Danke Schoen' made music history. Many of his songs have topped the charts, and there are too many to mention here, but some of my favorites include `Heart,' `Summer Wind,' and `Red Roses for a Blue Lady.' 
Wayne Newton's gifts extend well beyond his extraordinary showmanship and musical talent. For example, he has distinguished himself as a skilled actor, having been featured in ten films, and countless television and cable programs. 
Many Americans are aware that Wayne Newton has earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, but how many know that he has been awarded the Medal for Distinguished Public Service, Founder's Award of St Jude's hospital, the VFW's Hall of Fame Award, the American Legion's Exceptional Citizen Award and the Humanitarian Award of the American Cancer Society's Research Center--just to name a few? After fifty years before the public eye, Wayne Newton has become one of the world's most prolific entertainers, but he has always found time and energy to devote to scores of worthy causes. 
Wayne Newton's career is the stuff of legend. I am confident there will be many more years in which visitors to Las Vegas will be mesmerized by this amazing performer. It is hard to imagine anyone reaching greater heights of success, but certainly, if anyone could, it's Mr. Las Vegas. However, to me the greatest attribute of Wayne Newton is the quality of his friendship. He is above all my good friend.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to an amendment offered by my friend, the senior Senator from the State of Arizona, concerning what he refers to as `demonstration projects.' 
I rise as someone who has served both in the House of Representatives and in this body, and am aware of demonstration projects that have been initiated in both the House of Representatives and in this body. 
First of all, we must acknowledge that the House is going to have demonstration projects in their bill. There is no question about that. They have had them in the past. They will have them in the future. As long as there is a House of Representatives, there will be demonstration projects. There is no chance that the House will pass a transportation bill--an ISTEA bill--without earmarks of individual Members' projects. 
The Senate, in its wisdom, has refused at the committee level to adopt such a procedure for the consideration of demonstration projects. I have stated in those committee meetings that I thought they were wrong. But I accept the will of the majority of the committee and have not talked at great length about that. But I don't think that we should merely defer to the House on this matter. It would appear that we will, before this procedure is all over, have in the Senate version of the bill projects that are referred to as `demonstration projects.' 
The House has a procedure. These aren't just willy-nilly thrown into the bill. The House committee of jurisdiction required a 14-point checklist. They are filled out for each demonstration project before they would even consider it. Only a very few projects on that list in the House will ultimately be accepted for funding. If the original ISTEA legislation is any indication, well under 10 percent of the final dollar amount in the House will be earmarked for demonstration projects. 
I also say to my friend from Arizona, for whom I have the greatest respect--and we have worked very closely on a lot of different issues--that I don't think that referring to these matters as `glorified pork' is doing anything to add any stature to this body or the other body. 
For example, in the State of Nevada--we are the fastest growing State in the Union--we have tremendous problems in the Las Vegas area. We have 300 new people, approximately, moving in there every day. We have all kinds of traffic problems because of that tremendous growth. 
I say to my friend from Arizona, and others within the sound of my voice, take for example, Hoover Dam. Hoover Dam is built over the Colorado River, which separates the States of Arizona and Nevada. The traffic that travels from Arizona into Nevada has to go over the bridge. For decades, they have said that is a security risk to this country and should be replaced. It has only gotten worse as years have gone by. We have now often times 5 to 7 miles of backups of cars waiting to get over that bridge. It is not only dangerous and unsafe but also, because of the national importance of this dam, it is very insecure for purposes of terrorist attacks. We have authorized, Mr. President, a new bridge over the river to alleviate that traffic. That is going to have to come in some type of an earmark. It is going to cost $150 million. Somehow, because of the need to move commerce--not to Las Vegas but throughout the country--we are going to have to have something done about heavy traffic coming over that river. Commerce is being held up there, interstate commerce--trucks hauling goods from all over the country. We need to do something with the bridge over the river. 
Take, for example, what we refer to as the `spaghetti bowl' in Las Vegas, on I-15 and U.S. Highway 95 from Salt Lake to Reno, to the bridge, and to Boulder City. I have already indicated that we are the fastest growing State in the United States. This spaghetti bowl is holding up interstate commerce. Large trucks hauling all kinds of products simply can't move through that area because it is clogged. We have been very fortunate in that this interchange is going to be rebuilt. It is going to be rebuilt with earmarked funds. 
Now, maybe someday we would have done that anyway, but how many lives would have been lost and what would be the loss to productivity in not being able to move people through that part of the country? So it is good that we went ahead and did this. 
Carson City, NV, remains one of only a handful of State capitals in the United States that are not linked to an interstate system. An earmark in the original ISTEA bill funded the first leg of this critical link. 
Finally, we have a real problem bringing people between the States of California and Nevada. This used to be just a Nevada problem, until California came to the realization that commerce from California simply could not move through southern Nevada because it was clogged on I-15. We worked out a cooperative project with the States of California, Nevada, and Arizona. This interchange that sends traffic to all three States is now beginning to be replaced. This, again, was done with an earmark. There is certainly nothing wrong with that, something that benefits the country. It doesn't benefit Arizona more than Nevada, or California more than Nevada, or Arizona more than California. It benefits all three States. There is terrible congestion there. There is a lot more work that needs to be done on I-15 and along its entire route. 
As I have indicated, at some time, perhaps, these projects would have been funded. But what tragedies would have occurred had these projects not gone forward? In a State that is experiencing growth like Nevada or California, we have been able to move ahead on some of these projects more rapidly than we would have normally. Delivering critical needs and services promptly is what the people of this country expect. It has nothing to do with glorified pork. 
Not surprisingly, this year's list of House requests is filled with far more projects such as the ones that I have just described than some of the unusual projects described by my colleague from Arizona. We are talking about a relatively small amount of money here, and the projects that are funded in this manner are frequently of critical importance to the States or they would not be earmarked. 
Regarding the notion that these projects should count against the State's obligation limit, I would ask three questions: 
First, would the House ever agree with that? The answer is, obviously, no. We spoke today with the House Surface Transportation Committee. To say they reacted coolly, coldly, is an understatement. Instead of preparing for the inevitable day when demonstration projects both exist and are outside the obligation limit, we are, once again, hiding behind some type of rhetoric that has nothing to do with effectively preparing the conference's bill for the Senators. 
Second, how are we defining a demonstration project under this amendment? I feel very confident that the Senators from Maryland and Virginia are not eager to have the Woodrow Wilson Bridge count against their State's obligation limit. The bridge is federally owned, just like the bridge at Hoover Dam. Perhaps the State should be held harmless. I believe that is the case. But that argument can be made about any number of federally owned facilities; as example, Hoover Dam. The bridge between Nevada and Arizona has to be built. Should Nevada or Arizona be penalized as a result of that? Obviously, the answer is no. 
Third, we have to give our colleagues some credit. The members of the conference committee are charged with doing what they can to hammer out a bill that is acceptable to both bodies. This is a key point. Obviously, a State that gets a disproportionate share of demonstration projects is going to get less in the final bill. Is it always dollar for dollar? Of course not. But it needs to get past both Houses. Spreading largess one way or another is frequently the way we get a bill. We have to look at the process we have used to get the bill this close to completion. It is a tedious process, but it has worked well. 
Finally, I suggest to my friend from Arizona that if the Senate would be realistic, and we usually are, and we will be when the conference is completed, there will be demonstration projects. 
I suggest this amendment should not be something we just accept. I think we should vote against it. I know people are going to say, Why should I vote this way? Usually we knock it out in conference anyway. But I do not think we should be doing that. I think we should recognize this is not a good amendment. It is something unrealistic, for the points I mentioned, and they are that conference committee members will do their best to come up with a good bill, demonstration projects, by definition, are very difficult to come by--for example, the Hoover Dam Bridge and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge are two good examples--and, last, the House is never going to agree to this. So I think we should vote the right way and vote against this amendment. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution that would set aside December 13, 1998 as the National Children's Memorial Day to remember all the children who die in the United States each year. While I realize the families of these children deal with the grief of their loss every day, I would like to commemorate the lives of these children with a special day as well. 
I have had many constituents share their heart wrenching stories with me about the death of their son or daughter. I have heard heroic stories of kids battling cancer or diabetes, and tragic stories of car accidents and drownings. Each of these families has had their own experience, but they must all continue with their lives and deal with the incredible pain of losing a child. 
The death of a child at any age is a shattering experience for a family. By establishing a day to remember children that have passed away, bereaved families from all over the country will be encouraged and supported in the positive resolution of their grief. It is important to families who have suffered such a loss to know that they are not alone. To commemorate the lives of these children with a special day would pay them an honor and would help to bring comfort to the hearts of their bereaved families.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment is offered on my behalf and that of Senators Bryan, Boxer and Feinstein. It has the support of the State governments of both California and Nevada, and it is an amendment that is very simple. It grants Metropolitan Planning Organization status for the Lake Tahoe basin on the border between California and Nevada. 
Not only is Lake Tahoe the most beautiful place on the Earth, and it has been deemed to be such since the time Mark Twain first looked at it and said it was the `fairest place on all the Earth,' locals within the basin, the Washoe Indian Tribe, and the State governments of Nevada and California, have long recognized the unique status of Lake Tahoe. But, in addition to its beauty, it is certainly one of the most fragile environments anyplace in the world. For many years the competing interests in the basin have found ways to work together to protect the famed water quality of the lake. These partnerships have been developed and are unique and have proved the notion that it is not necessary to harm the economy to improve the environment. 
Mr. President, last summer President Clinton convened a Summit. He and Vice President Gore and five Cabinet officers came to Lake Tahoe and spent 2 days. They addressed the related transportation, forest health and water quality concerns that face the Basin. Transportation was identified as one of the key areas where improvements in infrastructure could also yield key environmental benefits. MPO status recognizes the unique bi-State nature of the Tahoe basin and enhances the ability of local residents to compete for transportation planning funding. 
I appreciate very much the consideration of both sides and would ask that this amendment be accepted.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor and very strong supporter of S. 1173, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act. Both S. 1173 and the amendment adding an additional $26 billion to the bill passed unanimously out of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, a committee I have served on very proudly for my years in the U.S. Senate. 
I want to also say, and spread across the Record of this Senate, what a tremendously fine job has been done by the chairman of this committee and the ranking member of this committee to allow this bill to be where it is today. It has been very hard work. Frankly, it would have been nice if we had done it last year, but we didn't. The reason we are where we are today is because of the work of the chairman of the full committee and the work of the ranking member of the committee. The States of Rhode Island and Montana have many reasons to be proud of the two Senators who are managing this bill, but for no reason should they be more proud of their Senators than the work they have done on this bill. Their committee work has been outstanding and is certainly something that everybody in this country, not only the people from the States of Rhode Island and Montana, should feel very good about, what is happening on this floor. 
Every person who is a Member of the U.S. Senate or the House of Representatives has a stake in a national transportation system that is second to none, one that meets the present and future needs of the American people. This bill is not perfect, but it is a tremendously strong bill. Moving people and goods quickly and efficiently throughout the Nation is one of the most important things we can do to maintain a strong economy. Far too much time and productivity is lost waiting in traffic. 
I give an example to all. People in southern California are connected with the people of southern Nevada by I-15. I-15 is a tremendously burdened road. The chairman of the committee came to Nevada and heard testimony regarding the importance of this legislation. He heard firsthand about the tremendous difficulty we have moving people to and from southern Nevada and southern California. 
Mr. President, it is no longer a question of having people come to Las Vegas for purposes of tourism. The problem is that the road is clogging interstate commerce. Vehicles, trucks moving produce, cannot move on this road. It is too crowded. This is only an example of what is happening in other parts of the country, although the problem of I-15 is magnified because of how old it is and how much repair needs to be done on it. 
The original ISTEA legislation in 1991 was really the brain child of the committee chair at that time, Senator Pat Moynihan from the State of New York. He did very good work. He was visionary in this bill. It changed the thrust of legislation dealing with surface transportation that had been in effect since the Second World War. The legislation in 1991 was one of the most far-reaching and innovative pieces of legislation ever produced by Congress. It laid out a road map for transportation for the entire 21st century. 
Rather than focusing upon the completion of the Interstate System, ISTEA focused on connecting different modes of transportation to meet the needs of the future. I enjoyed very much working on that legislation as a Member of this committee, and I think it is some of the most rewarding work that I have done since I have been a Member of Congress. 
With the exception of the Department of Defense authorization bill, ISTEA is going to be the largest money bill that Congress will take up this year. I also say, although I do not see him on the floor of the Senate today, the subcommittee chair of the Transportation Subcommittee, Senator John Warner, is a fine Senator. 
I had the pleasure of serving with him when I was chairman of a subcommittee and he was ranking member. Coincidentally, I was talking with someone this morning who is a friend of Senator Warner. We talked with some affection about the work that the Senator from Virginia does generally, but especially in this committee and this subcommittee. I commend and applaud the work of Senator Warner in this legislation. 
We have to recognize, with the exception of the defense authorization bill this year, ISTEA II is going to be the largest money bill Congress will take up this year. As such, we have a tremendous responsibility to get it right. Our economy is utterly dependent upon having a strong and vital system of transportation. The creation of this intermodal system will require all the innovative and creative thinking we can muster at the Federal, State, regional and, yes, local levels. The State of Nevada has a tremendous need for adequate highways, I say second to none. 
The State of Nevada is the most mountainous State in the Union, except for the State of Alaska. We have 314 mountain ranges. We have 32 mountains that are over 11,000 feet high. We have tremendous growth in the State of Nevada. Just to give you one illustration, in Clark County, where Las Vegas is located, we need to build more than one elementary school each month to keep up with the growth of students in that area. So we have real problems. 
Also, we have a State that is extremely large. Within its borders, you could place the States of New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire and Delaware, and then still have some left over. None of these States would touch one another, and there would still be, as I have indicated, plenty of room to cut up Virginia and use it to fill in the gaps joining all these States. 
We have the additional problem that 87 percent of the State of Nevada is owned by the Federal Government. We lead the Nation in Federal ownership of land. 
Nevada is also a bridge State. Hundreds of thousands of tons of goods travel across Nevada through Utah, Arizona, and to and from California. The CANAMEX route, one of the NAFTA corridors, traverses Nevada, crossing over the top of the Hoover Dam bridge. When I say the Hoover Dam bridge, that is really a misnomer. You cross right over Hoover Dam. One of the greatest bottlenecks in the country is over Hoover Dam. Traffic is lined up sometimes 5 to 10 miles trying to get over that dam, and to think of the safety involved in not having adequate transportation moving over that dam--it is unsafe. If there were an accident of some kind, it would really do extreme damage to the water supplies of southern California and the small areas below Hoover Dam. We have to do something about that also. 
In southern Nevada, thousands and thousands of new people move in each month. In fact, almost 300 people a day move into Las Vegas alone. So we have rapid growth. In 1970, there were fewer than 500,000 residents in the whole State of Nevada. By the year 2000, there will be 2 million. That is the growth that is taking place in Nevada. 
In 1970, there were 2.2 billion vehicle miles traveled in Nevada. By the year 2000, there will be over 12.5 billion vehicle miles traveled in Nevada. Accommodation of such growth requires innovative thinking and creative planning on the part of the State and local transportation people. 
Again, talking about the State of Nevada and all that growth, I have indicated that it takes a lot of innovative thinking on the part of the State to make sure that this all works out well. It also necessitates imposing one of the stiffest State and local taxes in the Nation. We have done that. We have done it willingly, because we recognize that if we are going to meet the demands of the traffic problems in Nevada, we cannot depend only on the Federal Government. We have done our share and more. 
In spite of that, Nevada needs a strong, effective Federal level of effort, and that is what this bill does. As written, ISTEA II provides a total of $173 billion for highways, highway safety, and other surface transportation programs over the next 5 1/2 years. 
I hope that as soon as this bill passes out of this Chamber, the House of Representatives will take it up and get a bill back to us, so we can go to conference and get this very important bill worked out so that the departments of transportation in the 50 States know what is ahead of them. They can do their bidding, they can let their contracts prior to the bad weather happening, and go ahead and have a smooth transition. We badly need to do that. 
Overall, this bill represents a 40-percent increase in funding over the original ISTEA bill some 6 years ago. With the completion of the Interstate Highway System, it is vital we turn our attention to developing multimodal transportation policies that will allow us to not only maintain the excellent infrastructure we have, but also to move forward to meet the demands of a new century. 
In many ways, transportation issues of the future will be vastly more difficult than the ones of yesterday. We live in an increasingly diverse Nation, one that is no longer able to be solely dependent upon the automobile. Even in a State as vast as Nevada, a bridge State, where we desperately need more roads, we are also seriously looking at the role monorails, magnetic levitation, and other high-speed rail systems can play in our future transportation infrastructure. 
I think one of the finest parts of this bill is something that Senator Moynihan and I have worked on, and that is the part of the bill that deals with magnetic levitation. Yesterday, Senator Moynihan brought a box that contained a model of a maglev train to the committee. In his statement, he made a plea for funding to design and implement a magnetic levitation system. We need to do that. 
Mr. President, our airports are clogged all over the country; our highways are clogged all over the country. We need a way of moving people for relatively short distances, up to 300 miles. The only way we can do that rapidly and efficiently with the technology we now have is with magnetic levitation. 
In the 1960s, two scientists were stuck in traffic in New York. They were MIT professors. They said, `This is ridiculous that we are stuck in traffic; let's do something about it.' They went back to the laboratories and invented magnetic levitation. 
We, as a country, helped at the Federal level. We provided moneys for research and development of this very unique mode of transportation. We did it for a few years and dropped it. As soon as we dropped it, Germany and Japan picked it up, and they are now way ahead of us with this. It is too bad. We are the ones who should be in the forefront of developing this mode of transportation. We need to get on board. 
This bill contains an authorization of $1 billion for magnetic levitation, and it actually provides funds, up to $30 million, for some grants that will get this program going. This is very, very important, and I express my appreciation to Senator Moynihan for his good work in this area. 
The money that is in the bill is a modest amount to move this project forward, but it is an amount; it is more than we have ever done. There is tremendous funding in the bill for all our individual States and other areas, and I am happy we do have some for magnetic levitation. As I indicated before, this bill is not 
perfect. But I am proud of the progress we have made. The bill is good for all States. It is tremendously important. It is a great product for the country. 
The bill before us does a fine job of balancing many of our Nation's competing priorities for transportation while giving the States the flexibility they need to expend dollars in ways that make sense, given the many regional differences we have in our country. I am supportive of the congestion mitigation and air quality improvement program and the transportation enhancement program. The additional money and increased flexibility are very positive developments. A national transportation system that does not address environmental issues is one that would not be living up to the expectations of the American people. 
Other important programs, such as the intelligent transportation system program, have both a positive impact on the environment and also improve the efficiency of the highways. It is a dual track. I held, as I indicated earlier, a field hearing in Las Vegas last year focused on intelligent transportation systems, and the response was tremendous. Local governments around Las Vegas and Reno have all begun to put innovative high-tech transportation programs into place, and they are very pleased with the initial results. 
I am also supportive of a strong Federal Lands Highway Program. As a Senator from a Western State--and remember, I said earlier 87 percent of the State of Nevada is owned by the Federal Government--so as a Senator from a Western State with a huge amount of public land, it is impossible to overstate how important is the vital lifeline that these road and highway funds provide to rural Americans. 
I want to say a few words on safety. I support the efforts of my friend, Senator McCain from Arizona, to develop a safety title for inclusion in the overall authorization. I have a strong record on safety, and in this legislation, I am very happy to support this title. 
I want to spend a couple minutes discussing a safety issue that we are not addressing in nearly enough detail in this reauthorization. As the chairman and ranking member know, I have opposed triple-trailer trucks. I believe they are both intimidating and unsafe. I have, since offering my amendment on this issue--talking about moving forward on this--I have received scores and scores of letters from all over the country from people who are afraid of these trucks. I believe they are incompatible with our obligation to provide a safe network of roads and highways. 
I do appreciate the input that I have received from the trucking industry. But my fear of these triple-trailer trucks is not something that I bear alone. I recognize that for a variety of reasons, though, this is not a majority view. I have been in the Congress long enough, I have served in legislative bodies long enough, to know when I have enough votes. I do not have enough votes to have my amendment adopted. 
I am not going to go forward with my amendment because, I repeat, I do not have the votes to pass it. 
Many of my colleagues argue there is just not enough accurate data available to make an educated decision on this issue. Although I would counter that mere common sense should dictate that triple-trailer trucks do not belong on the same roads as a passenger car, I agree that there is an appalling lack of data available on this subject. Information given out by the trucking industry is unreliable and people cannot underscore the validity of it because it is put out by the trucking industry. What we need is the Department of Transportation to do some work on this and get some real facts to determine the accident rate and what these big trucks do to our roads and make a decision as to: Is the length of the truck an important element or is it how much these trucks weigh? We have to get more information on this. There is a lack of data available on this subject. 
Mr. President, in an attempt to remedy this deficiency, I have been working with many, including the American Trucking Association, for months to try to forge an agreement that would allow us to better study the safety, environmental, and infrastructure impacts of all classes of longer-combination vehicles. I have been doing this since last fall when we first introduced this legislation. 
Obviously, the American Trucking Association disagrees with me that triples and others of these long vehicles are unsafe, but they acknowledge that there is a public perception problem, and they have been willing to work with me, which I appreciate. Unfortunately, though, I found that there is little common ground between the safety community and the American Trucking Association on what are the acceptable bounds for a comprehensive study of size, weight, and other trucking issues. No matter what model we came up with, various parties certainly would not agree with what we should do. As a result, I am unable to come up with a compromise on this subject right now. I would ask the Secretary of Transportation to take a look at this issue. It is a very important issue in the 16 States where we have these triple-trailer trucks. 
It is extremely frustrating to me and is a situation we, as a body, should not allow to continue. There is an overwhelming lack of useful data available to the U.S. Senate concerning longer-combination vehicles. So I call upon the trucking industry, all of the safety groups, and the U.S. Department of Transportation, to work it out, not in a combative fashion, but to sit down and work together to come up with valid information, which we do not have. It is not acceptable for the mistrust that exists between these groups to continue to stand in the way of a comprehensive, complete, and objective study of these longer-combination vehicles. As I have indicated, I am not offering my amendment today, but the Senate dialogue on the subject is just beginning. 
I want to also say, as I see in the Chamber today the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, the former majority and minority leader of the Senate, that we are to the point on this bill where we are as a result of the work done by the Senator from West Virginia. Others of us joined in the original amendment, but I think everyone recognizes it has been the tenacious nature of the Senator from West Virginia to move forward on this legislation that has us at a point where we are today with a bill with $26 billion more actual real dollars in it than we would have had. We have a bill that we are going to get out of this Senate within the next week or 10 days, and it is all, I believe, as a result of the work done by the Senator from West Virginia, which the Senator from Nevada very much appreciates.

Mr. REID. Finally, although we are not yet discussing the transit title, let me say a few words about public transportation. 
Las Vegas is the fastest growing city in the Nation. There is some debate as to whether it is Las Vegas or the suburb of 
Henderson, where I graduated from high school. But that area of the country is growing extremely rapidly, as I have already explained. Yet before 1992, it had, at best, a very weak mass transit system. In 1992, the Citizens Area Transit--we call it CAT--owned by the Regional Transportation Commission, and operated on a contract basis, began a fixed-route bus system for Las Vegas. 
The response has been tremendous. The Las Vegas community has truly embraced CAT. In less than 5 years, ridership on CAT has grown from 14.9 million annual riders to over 35 million in 1996, a total ridership growth of 134 percent, and going up each day. 
The fare box recovery ratio is high. Most of the system's costs are recovered without requiring a huge subsidy. The bus fleet is 100-percent compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
So impressive has been CAT's ability to grow efficiently and effectively, that the American Public Transit Association last year awarded its Outstanding Achievement Award to CAT in the hardest-to-win midsized system category. This is a tremendous feat for such a young system. After all, Mr. President, this system does not rely on much in the way of Federal funds. The dollars that the Federal Transit Administration has provided has been very timely and useful to this bus system. For that reason, I would oppose efforts to change transit formulas to provide a minimum allocation to States without or with only minimal transportation systems. 
Let me conclude today, Mr. President, by saying that I join with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in saying that the fuels taxes paid into the highway trust fund each year will support significantly higher spending on transportation, and I am very happy that Congress is now moving in that direction. 
These are trust fund moneys. Every time you go buy a tank of gas at the service station, the money that is collected there, a portion of it, goes into the highway trust fund. Those moneys should be used for that purpose, and that purpose only. To do otherwise would be a violation of the enormous trust the American people have sent us to Washington to uphold. 
Our Nation's infrastructure represents the lifeline that fuels our economy. When we neglect to adequately provide for the health of this lifeline, all of us suffer. Whether it is unsafe and degraded roads or pollution caused from overcongestion, all of us are affected. The price is not only the inconvenience of traversing a dilapidated infrastructure. Indeed, the real price is the increased costs all of us pay for goods and services because of the burdens placed on a steady flow of the stream of commerce. It is similar to a cholesterol buildup, I guess, in the arteries, Mr. President. Eventually there is a steep price to pay. 
Again, I congratulate my colleagues, Senators Chafee, Baucus, Warner, and Byrd, on a job well done. I look forward to working with all my fellow Senators in passing this strong, vital 6-year bill as quickly as possible, and then urging the House to move forward just as quickly so we can get the bill to the President for his signature. 
Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the State of Nevada is a large State, one of the largest in the Union, 74 million acres. Nevada is also the most mountainous State in the Union except for Alaska. We have 314 separate mountain ranges. We have 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. We also have vast extremes in weather. In the southern part of the State it is not unusual for places such as Laughlin, NV, in the southern tip of the State to reach temperatures of 120 degrees. In the northern part of the State we at times have the coldest place in the Nation, temperatures far below zero that remain for days at a time. 
The State of Nevada is also the fastest growing State in the Nation; we also have the fastest growing city and the fastest growing county: the city of Las Vegas city and Clark County. Every month, 7,800 new residents move into Clark County. So we have an unusual State. 
The reason I lay this on the Record today is that the State of Nevada desperately needs a highway bill. We desperately need a surface transportation bill brought before this body and debated and resolved. The ISTEA legislation, as we call it, was a good piece of legislation when it passed in 1991. I was fortunate to be on the subcommittee that drafted that legislation. I was fortunate to be able to work on that committee with the chairman of the committee, Senator Moynihan, and the ranking member, now the chairman of the committee, Senator Chafee. 
We did some unique things with that ISTEA legislation. We allowed more spending but more of that spending power went to the individual States. That was the main goal of the ISTEA legislation that passed in 1991: turning more spending power and authority over to the States and localities while maintaining a strong national transportation system. And during the 6 years this legislation has been in effect it has worked well. 
We have made progress in returning more authority to local jurisdictions. I believe, when we are able to take up the bill that came out of the committee, the bill which is now before this body, we will continue along the same lines. 
I rise today to say that I think we are breaking faith with the American people by not having this legislation in the Chamber today. I have outlined the problems we have in the State of Nevada. Because of the mountains we have around the State, because of the extremes we have in weather around the State of Nevada, we badly need these highway funds. All of this is compounded by the tremendous growth we are having in the State of Nevada. 
The President came to Lake Tahoe last summer with the Vice President and five Cabinet officers. A commitment was made by the States of California and Nevada to do something about Lake Tahoe because it is being degraded environmentally. Everyone agrees--Republicans, Democrats, conservatives, liberals, environmentalists, nonenvironmentalists--that the lake needs to be saved, and a commitment was made at that time to save that lake. Part of the salvation of the lake comes in the form of transportation improvements in the ISTEA bill that should be before this body. 
Mr. President, the money that we are talking about spending is not new tax dollars. We are not spending money that does not 
exist. Every time an individual goes to a service station to buy gas, they put gas in their car and automatically, because of legislation that has been passed here, the money that comes from that purchase goes into a trust fund. That money is set aside for highway construction and surface transportation. And so we are not here today demanding that we spend new taxes for these roads that are badly needed in Nevada and around the country. What we are saying is let's spend the money that is in the trust fund. That is all we are asking. Let's spend the money. There has been a commitment made that those moneys that have been collected should be spent on our surface transportation. The first step is to get the highway bill done (and the sooner the better). 
Mr. President, when I practiced law, we would set up trust funds for our clients, and it could be as a result of a contract that you were dealing with for your client, trying to resolve contractual differences; it could be for the sale of a piece of real estate; it could be for a personal injury case. This money was put into a trust fund for the client. If in fact we used those trust fund moneys for anything else, to pay rent, to purchase a car, or to do something that wasn't in keeping with our client's wishes, we could be disbarred and in fact criminally prosecuted. 
I cannot imagine that we are using these trust fund moneys for these highways for some other purpose. If we did that in the private sector, we would be subject, if we were a lawyer, to disbarment; if you were not a lawyer, maybe to criminal prosecution and, in fact, if you were a lawyer to criminal prosecution. 
So these highway trust fund moneys should be spent for the purpose for which they were collected and no other purpose. Not for offsetting the deficit, not for a fancy new spending program in some other place. This money should be used for surface transportation. I cannot understand why we are not bringing this bill before this body immediately. 
When Congress was unable last year to complete its work on the long-term reauthorization program, I was a strong proponent of the notion that we needed to pass a short-term extension. The Presiding Officer at this moment serves on the Environment and Public Works Committee with this Senator. He, too, helped move the bill out of the committee, and we agreed that there should be a short-term extension to ensure continuity in State programs and to live up to our obligation to the American people to provide a world-class--in fact, the best--transportation system. 
That is what these trust fund moneys are all about. I supported this short-term approach as a last resort. But I was under the assumption that leadership here would allow us to move the surface transportation bill to the floor so that we could begin working on it as soon as we returned from the recess. This has to happen. It was supposed to be one of the first things we brought up when we got back here. 
The surface transportation bill made the States partners with the Federal Government. With this highway bill, we had more of a partnership than we had ever had before. The partnership was to build a stronger transportation system and to maintain a stronger transportation system. We are leaving the departments of transportation in all States in the lurch by putting off work for months now. This is no way to treat a partner. If we are truly partners with the States, their departments of transportation, then certainly we should be moving this legislation. 
State transportation programs are continuing for the moment, but let's not kid ourselves. These programs are dying. They are on life support, but they are dying. We designed the short-term extension in a way that we would, in effect, force ourselves to work on this legislation after we came back after the first of the year. We are not following through on that. Our goal was to allow the States to spend unallocated balances for a couple of months to prevent a lapse in the programs. We didn't build an extra quarter or 6 months into that idle time. 
I congratulate and I applaud Senator Byrd, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, who has been on this floor and steadfastly and continually and very effectively has brought to the attention of this body and the people of this country the need that we move to (and pass) the surface transportation bill. The closer we get to the election the harder it is going to be to do the right thing in regard to this legislation. If we wait until April, April is going to become July, and then July will become October. We should do this now. We should move this bill as quickly as possible. 
There are some States, including the State of Nevada, where we are limited in terms of the amount of funds we can allocate because of bid-letting procedures. There are only certain times that we can let these contracts--sometimes because of weather in parts of the State of Nevada. As I have already described, because of the weather extremes, you cannot do work all year round in the State of Nevada. So we need to let these bids take place. As I have indicated, there are many parts of Nevada, in the high Sierras and other parts of the State of Nevada, where the construction season is extremely short. Delays in reauthorization are going to lead to delays in roadbuilding and maintenance soon. A delay of several months can easily lead to a delay of a year or more in the colder climates of our State. 
This applies all over the country. Nevada is currently the fastest growing State in the Nation. As I indicated, about 8,000 people moved to Clark County last month--that's the Las Vegas area. In order to address our long-term growth-related infrastructure needs, we need a 6-year bill; not a 3-month bill, not a 6-month bill. Six-month bills do not allow us to adequately plan for the future. It is unfair of this body, this Congress, to arbitrarily wreck the planning processes of 50 States and tens of thousands of highway construction workers and contractors whose livelihood depends on the timely and consistent flow of these highway funds. We must move forward. To not do so is simply unfair. It is unfair for the Congress of this country to hold up the gas taxes that the people pay every time they fill up their tanks at a service station while we continue collecting these huge sums of money every day to go into this trust fund. We are not being fair to the American public by not spending these trust funds. 
We spend a lot of time in this body talking about States rights. Let's demonstrate our commitment to States by passing this highway bill. It is important we do it. It is important we do it tomorrow, not next month or the month after that. Let's get to work on reauthorization today.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will shortly be called upon to vote on an amendment that I offered yesterday with Senator Torricelli to change the name of the J. Edgar Hoover FBI Building, in effect to take his name off the building and have it referred to as the FBI Building. 
That underlying amendment is really about how we honor those who undertake the profession of public service. The amendment is about those who serve the public and also contrasting that with those who abused its trust and violated the rights of thousands of public and private citizens. 
Mr. President, we dishonor our undisputed reputation as the greatest defender of civil liberties in the world by maintaining the name of J. Edgar Hoover on the FBI's headquarters. This amendment will remove one of the last vestiges of McCarthyism still on display in Washington. 
Yesterday, Mr. President, I talked about some of the things that he did. I talked about some of the people he abused, such as Joe Louis. 
Today, I am going to talk about a few more people whose civil rights he violated. Irving Berlin, the man who wrote `God Bless America,' and `White Christmas' and hundreds of other songs, was a person that J. Edgar Hoover investigated endlessly for years. Irving Berlin did not die until he was 101 years old, but he was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover for most of his life. 
He conducted surveillance on Albert Einstein, Wernher Von Braun, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable, Rock Hudson, Elvis Presley, Senator John Tower, Cesar Chavez. 
Mr. President, in Chavez's case, the FBI seemed omnipresent, tuning in to the Reverend Jesse Jackson's radio broadcasts dealing with Cesar Chavez when Jesse Jackson was simply appealing for support for the farm workers. Chavez created so much concern by J. Edgar Hoover that they had many FBI agents keeping tabs on a Valentine's Day dance at Grand Rapids Junior College in Michigan where there was literature being distributed about a grape boycott. He even had investigators following people who were on a 12-man march dealing with the grape boycott. 
We simply do not honor the historical record of this country by maintaining this man's name on Bureau headquarters. 
Mr. President, in a biography that I talked about yesterday, written by Curt Gentry, which he spent 10 years writing, Gentry says that Hoover used his FBI files to advance the careers of numerous politicians he liked, including President Nixon, and against those he did not like, including the Kennedys, Estes Kefauver and Adlai Stevenson. 
Gentry further said that extensive records were maintained on the suspected amorous adventures of President Kennedy. And Hoover ordered the bugging of the entire Justice Department during Bobby Kennedy's tenure as Attorney General. Gentry isn't saying that he maintained wiretaps of various places in the Justice Department, but everything was wiretapped in the Justice Department. 
So the list is endless of people who this man thought was suspicious. There is no question in my mind that he is the greatest violator of human rights during this century in this country. That says a lot. I hope that my colleagues will remove from that building something that is and should be an embarrassment to all people who believe in human rights. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. REID. My friend from Connecticut indicated that any amendment that was offered to this bill was rejected. I have not heard that. I have not heard a single person come forward and speak against the amendment I have offered. I suggest that this amendment would not hold up this bill one bit; that anyone voting against this amendment is voting against good Government. There is not an organization in this country that is concerned about human rights or civil rights that wants J. Edgar Hoover's name on the FBI building. This is a building that houses officials sworn to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States, our civil liberties, the liberties of all Americans. No official in the history of this country has done more to violate the rights of people than J. Edgar Hoover. Consider going after Irving Berlin, the man who wrote God Bless America. He is one of scores of people I have talked about these last few days. 
I think we should honor those who work in that building by removing this man's name from the building. It is one of the most popular places to visit by visitors that come to this Nation's Capital, and they should not be subjected to a building with this man's name on it. 
Mr. President, Ronald Reagan stands for what is good about this country. J. Edgar Hoover stands for what is bad about this country. This small man violated the rights of hundreds, if not thousands, of people, famous and not so famous. He was a vindictive, petty man who harassed and abused untold thousands during his entire 48 years as the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We should remove the last segment of the McCarthy era by deleting his name from one of the most important buildings in this city.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Utah and others who voted to table this amendment that I think it was a bad vote. The fact of the matter is, when the name was placed on this building, J. Edgar Hoover's record was not clear to the American public. It was not clear that he conducted investigations of Irving Berlin and hundreds and hundreds of other people. 
I say without any qualification, there is no one this century who has violated the human rights and civil rights of America's citizens more than J. Edgar Hoover. 
I have the greatest respect for the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my good friend, but on this issue, I think he is flat wrong, and I think we missed an opportunity to take a person's name off a building that should be an embarrassment and is an embarrassment to the people who work inside that building, as reflected in private conversations with an FBI agent today.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just say briefly to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I support renaming the airport after President Reagan, but using the logic of my friend from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he said you should not change the name of existing buildings. I assume that should also apply to airports. So if that logic is carried through, I would think everybody on the other side of the aisle would vote against renaming this airport for the President.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will shortly send an amendment to the desk to delete the name J. Edgar Hoover from the FBI building. 
Let me preface my remarks by saying how much I respect and admire President Reagan. When I served in the House of Representatives, I, on a number of occasions, sided with the President on a number of issues that I felt were important to the country and to the State of Nevada. President Reagan was a good friend of the State of Nevada. His No. 1 adviser and counselor was the Senator from Nevada, Paul Laxalt, for whom I also have great respect. I wouldn't do anything to withhold this measure from passing in time for his 87th birthday. This is not something I am going to talk a long time about. It is just something that I have been looking, for more than a year, for an 
opportunity, for a vehicle to remove Mr. Hoover's name from the Federal Bureau of Investigation building. 
I say to the sponsor of this bill that I commend and applaud him for being as tenacious as he has been in making sure this is done prior to the President's 87th birthday, which I understand is this Friday. I hope that the President, even though he is ill, will understand what an important act of Congress this is. It is one of many things that is going to be done to honor President Reagan's name. We, of course, have the largest Federal building in Washington, DC proper that will be named after him in Federal Triangle. There is going to be an aircraft carrier named after him, the largest in the Nimitz class that will be named after President Reagan. All of these honors are appropriate. 
I want to make sure that I stress in my statement here today that my amendment has nothing to do with any attempt to take away the naming of the building for President Reagan. I hope that my friends on the other side of the aisle will support this amendment. 
Let's look at J. Edgar Hoover. When I first became interested in this, I would show a book, `J. Edgar Hoover, A Man and His Secrets,' by Curt Gentry. Curt Gentry is a personal friend of mine. Curt and I have worked together for many years on a number of different things. I have the greatest respect for him. It took him 10 years to write this book, the most thorough research ever done on J. Edgar Hoover by Curt Gentry. It is a fine book. It is very readable. As you all know, he also wrote the book on Charles Manson called `Helter-Skelter,' which was also a best-seller. 
I became convinced that we needed to do something to take the name off that building when I learned that, among other things, J. Edgar Hoover had a longstanding secret investigation of Quentin Burdick from North Dakota. Try that one on for size. Quentin Burdick from North Dakota was investigated by J. Edgar Hoover for his subservience. I would suggest to everyone that all of us who served with Burdick would suggest he was nothing other than a patriot. 
Among other things, when J. Edgar Hoover died, his secretary had all of his personal records taken out of the FBI building and taken to his home. These were files on people. We will never know the full extent of the investigation this man did over the five decades that he was involved with the FBI. We know that it took, on a daily basis, working the longest and as hard as people could, 2 1/2 months to shred the personal files which he had on people. We have learned in years past--and this is one--that he conducted investigations of many, many people. We could go through a long list of people he conducted investigations on. The index of this book that I have before me goes over names of people who are fine Americans who he had secret investigations done on. 
We all know of the work that he did to cause all the problems he could to the person from Georgia, Dr. Martin Luther King. And the things he did alone to Dr. Martin Luther King was about as un-American as anything could be. 
J. Edgar Hoover's name on the FBI building is a stain on the building. Arguably there is no other public official of this century who did so much to undermine the civil liberties as did J. Edgar Hoover. That says a lot because we have had many people who have been involved in going after people's civil rights and civil liberties, and I would say Hoover was at the top of the list. This was engaged in while he was head of the FBI. We have learned since he died that he did many different things. 
Because the sponsor of the bill is from Georgia, I hope that he will join me in this effort. 
Twenty-five separate actions were taken against Dr. Martin Luther King in the 1960s by J. Edgar Hoover that had no statutory basis--none. By the FBI's own admission, the allegations of `Communist' that flew over Dr. King were never proved nor established. There was a concerted undercover campaign of continuous wiretapping of his home, his office, and travel accommodations for over 3 years. The FBI Director himself approved of an attempt to disrupt Dr. King's marriage. The FBI launched an aggressive campaign intended to, among other objectives, replace Dr. King with a civil rights leader more acceptable to J. Edgar Hoover. When Dr. Martin Luther King received the Nobel Peace Prize, the FBI sent a thinly veiled recommendation in a letter to Dr. King himself that Dr. King kill himself before accepting the prize. 
J. Edgar Hoover went to extraordinary lengths to pursue a vicious vendetta against Dr. King, and I don't think I need to dwell on that anymore. Dr. Martin Luther King did not need this aggravation, this intrusive interference with this person's life. 
The reason I mention Dr. King is because he is a very prominent figure. This happened to prominent and not-so-prominent people, anybody that J. Edgar Hoover felt needed to be looked at, and he did so in spite of what the law might have been because he was the law in his own mind. 
Under his direction, the FBI continued to harass activists, 
or protesters, or any political movement. They didn't have to be in the civil rights movement--any political movement. He moved in with his minions, harassed, and did whatever he could to disrupt people. This was carried out by intimidation, slander, and threatening to disrupt their marriages, force them out of jobs, and smear them in the eyes of parents and teachers. Letters were used to incite violence between rival black groups, counting on contracts to be placed on certain leaders' lives in each group. Additional letters were forged over local Communist Party leaders' signatures to attack the employment practices of Mafia-owned businesses in order to intensify further animosity between these organizations. 
The full extent of the FBI involvement will never be known because, as I have indicated, most all the records of relevant and highly pertinent Bureau documents were destroyed after he died in 1972. 
So now that Americans have the real story on this demagoguery, we might be shamed into a more appropriate name for the FBI headquarters. I say to my friend from Georgia that my original intent was to take the name off the building and insert some other President's name--President Eisenhower, President Bush, or President Truman. But I do not want to make this a political debate. I think we should go ahead and name the airport after President Reagan and get Hoover's name off the FBI building. Then I am happy to work with my friends from the other side of aisle to come up with an appropriate name for the FBI building. But I don't think it does this country any good to have this man's name affixed to the FBI building. Here is a person who spent his entire life taking away people's rights. 
So I hope this does not become a partisan issue. As I have indicated to my friend from Georgia, I hope there is a large vote for the Reagan bill from this side of the aisle. But I also hope there is a vote on the other side of the aisle to get this man's name off the Federal Bureau of Investigation building. I have so much respect for that organization and the people who work in it. I have spoken to FBI agents who really do not want his name on the building. The more time that goes by and the less people who worked under his influence, the more this happens all the time. The FBI is known today as an entity that protects people's rights, not take rights away. 
So I hope that the message has been made. I only use one example. That is Dr. King. If anyone wants more information, I can certainly spread across this Senate the records of hundreds of people who were treated the same way that Dr. King was treated.

Mr. REID. I extend my appreciation to the Senator. I want to complete anything I have on this legislation prior to our automatic 5 o'clock break, and I want to say a couple things. 
First of all, just so the record is clear, there were a number of things written about J. Edgar Hoover but one of the most telling things was written on the day of his death when a local columnist wrote about some of the things they were beginning to discover in some detail, the files he had kept on people. And this one columnist indicated he had reviewed the titillating tidbits about such diverse figures as Marlon Brando, Harry Belafonte, athletes like Joe Namath, Lance Rentzel, Joe Louis, Muhammad Ali, and, of course, he was always hard on all black leaders. Included in this article was Ralph Abernathy and Roy Ennis. After Dr. King was assassinated, he continued his work going after his widow. It wasn't good enough that he had attempted to vilify this man; he went after the widow. 
And then I guess it is all summed up by a note that President Nixon sent to John Dean when he said, and I quote, `He's got files on everybody,' which I guess is true. I deleted some swear words in the note from Nixon to Dean. 
So I hope that we could get this part of the history at least off the FBI building. It is a great institution. Whenever I can do anything legislatively to help the FBI, I have done that. I think they are a great organization that today we should be proud of, and in spite of J. Edgar Hoover the FBI I think has a great reputation. 
Mr. President, let me just say, since I see my friend from Arizona in the Chamber, and I know we have a 5 o'clock break, a couple words to extend my appreciation to the majority leader for setting a time certain that we can take up the IRS bill, which certainly is one of the most important things that we can do, the restructuring of the Internal Revenue Service. It passed the House widely last year. We should have passed it ourselves last year. I think it is important that we move forward on this as quickly as we can. It is important legislation to, among other things, change the burden of proof in a tax case from the taxpayer to the tax collector. Certainly it seems that would be an appropriate thing to do. It needs to be restructured. It will pass overwhelmingly when we get to it. I hope that Chairman Roth will move forward with hearings as quickly as possible so that we can have all that done. There is no excuse we cannot move forward with this on the date in March the majority leader has selected.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, there may be some who feel that Ronald Reagan was not the greatest President. I have already laid across this Record how I feel about Ronald Reagan. But everyone would say that Ronald Reagan's heart was in the right place. He was a true American patriot who did what he thought was best for this country. 
The direct opposite is applicable to J. Edgar Hoover. He didn't do things that were good for this country. His heart was not in the right place. He was a vicious, mean-spirited man, and his name should be taken from the building that houses the Federal Bureau of Investigation the very same moment we rename National Airport for President Ronald Reagan.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Nevadan whose dedication, foresight and work on behalf of women and minorities has profoundly changed the face of the Silver State. Jean Ford can be called a role model and an inspiration for generations to come, not only in Nevada but across our great Nation. Time and again she has given of herself to better the lives of those around her and she has created a legacy that will long endure in the history of Nevada. 
Jean Ford has been a State legislator, an educator, a successful businesswoman and I am proud to say a true friend to me and my family. Over the years we worked together on a great many projects, and I have come to deeply admire Jean's compassion for all people, and her devotion to protecting and preserving Nevada's natural beauty. 
I first met Jean Ford more than 25 years ago when she was elected to Nevada's State Assembly. Jean quickly rose to become a driving force for women's equality in Nevada, introducing the equal rights amendment in our State and working to end sex discrimination and break down long standing gender barriers. Through the years, her work in the legislature also carried over to other minority groups who found in Jean a voice, and a visionary willing to lead them on what was often a long, hard struggle for equal treatment under the law. Senior citizens, the disabled, single mothers, they were all important to Jean, and in turn, she helped make them important to each of us. 
It was through working with Jean that I came to realize the importance of many of the issues that I have taken on in my own legislative career. Women's health, child care, the environment, equal rights, protecting our seniors and the list goes on. I also owe her a great deal of thanks for bringing to my attention the need for involvement by women at every level of the political spectrum. From the State legislature where Jean and I both cut our political teeth, to this very body I stand before today. Diversity of opinion is the lifeblood that feeds democracy and I am grateful that people like Jean Ford helped break down the walls that once kept all but a privileged few out of the political realm. 
For her work in opening these doors, Jean has been honored dozens of times by groups throughout Nevada, including being named ` Outstanding Woman of the year' by the Nevada Women's Political Caucus, and `Civil Libertarian of the year' by the ACLU. Jean's legacy also encompasses several political organizations which she helped co-found including the National Women's Legislator's Network, and the Nevada Elected Women's Network. 
More recently, Jean has dedicated herself to helping future Nevadans through her work in the classroom. Since 1991, Jean has been an instructor at the University of Nevada--Reno, where she served as acting director of the Women's Studies Program. She has also been an instructor of History and Political Science, and helped developed the Nevada Women's archives through the University library system. It is only fitting that Jean is also the current State coordinator for the Nevada Women's History Project. 
But In spite of all that she has endeavored to create, the magnificent achievements of Jean Ford are truly overshadowed by the warmth and graciousness which she has exhibited through the many years that I have known her. I am sure if you could count them, her friends would number in the thousands, and her admirers would number even more. That is the true testament to a life long list of accomplishments. 
I ask all my colleagues to join with me today to recognize a true pioneer who changed her world for the better, and whose efforts have touched not only those who call Nevada home, but the hearts and minds of all who have had the pleasure and the honor to know my friend Jean Ford.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the last several years a virtual cottage industry has sprung up in this city to promote the privatization of this Nation's Social Security system. 
Phase out, partially privatize, or dismantle Social Security entirely, say the privatization advocates, and let each American citizen invest their payroll tax on Wall Street and become a millionaire by retirement. With Social Security requiring adjustments to maintain its long-term solvency, and the Dow Jones until recent days seeming to hit stratospheric highs almost every day, the notion of letting the private markets provide for retirement has had a certain appeal for privatizers. 
Now a thoughtful and extremely sobering new economic analysis is warning us to plant our feet back on solid ground and take a hard look at the very considerable and too-little discussed risks of privatizing Social Security. 
On October 21, 1997 I was pleased to sponsor a congressional staff briefing which unveiled a report written by economist John Mueller of the Lehrman, Bell, Mueller, Cannon, Inc. market-forecasting firm on behalf of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. 
It is worth pointing out that this report is not the product of some anti-Wall Street or pro-big government partisan. John Mueller is a conservative, supply-side Republican who served for a number of years as the chief economist for Jack Kemp and the U.S. House Republican caucus. 
After putting aside the usual optimistic rhetoric about privatization and actually examining the numbers, here's what John Mueller found: 
That Social Security provides a measurably higher real return than all types of financial assets--including the stock market--when traditional calculations of risk are considered. In fact, financial asset returns, under the same economic conditions, are lower than the average return on a steady-state, pay-as-you-go Social Security system. 
Social Security will be even more attractive, not less, than private investments in financial assets during the next 75 years, when actuarial projections contend that the U.S. economy is likely to slow to a 1.4 percent growth rate. The same economic and demographic factors that drove average, real stockmarket returns up by 10 percent annually in the past 20 years will drive Wall Street returns down to about 1.5 percent in the next 20 years. 
Social Security, by financing a huge investment in human capital, has been an enormous engine for the growth of the U.S. economy. Privatization would result in lower investment, slower growth, and a smaller economy; the loss well could reach $3 trillion and cost the economy at least 4 percent in lost growth during the next 75 years. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to obtain a copy and read John Mueller's report: Three New Papers on `Privatizing' Social Security, One Conclusion: Bad Idea. I would be pleased to provide a copy to any colleague who may be interested.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend yielding. I have another matter to attend to in a short period of time. I wanted to come to the floor and spread on the Record of this Senate that the Senator from Nebraska should be commended and applauded for the work that he has done on this issue. He chaired the Entitlement Commission, of which I had the good fortune to serve as a member. It was a tremendous experience. One of the things I will never forget is the testimony that was taken during those hearings about the Internal Revenue Service. 
We have heard figures that it costs at least $200 billion a year just for people to fill out their forms. That is only part of it. We had testimony during those hearings that the cost of the Internal Revenue Code itself is up to $400 billion. It is lots of money, we recognize that. 
I worked hard to write the taxpayer bill of rights. It is now the law. It was a help, but it didn't go far enough. We need to do better. 
What this legislation will do--which has received the almost unanimous support of the House of Representatives, 426 to 4, and the President of the United States supports this legislation--this legislation would give the Internal Revenue Service some meaning. The employees of the Internal Revenue Service support this legislation, former Commissioners of the Internal Revenue Service support this legislation. The Senator from Nebraska has done the right thing by moving beyond the Entitlement Commission, to the Kerrey-Portman Commission which studied specifically the Internal Revenue Service, and now is responsible for the bill having passed the House and now in the Senate where it should pass. 
This is good, elementary legislation. It is legislation that will make the American people feel good about an important institution of Government, the Internal Revenue Service, which 
is now a hiss and a byword. People should not feel that way about the Internal Revenue Service, even though they do. This legislation, which should be passed by unanimous consent, would allow the American public to feel better about the Internal Revenue Service. 
So I say to my friend from Nebraska, you are on the right track again with this legislation. This is something that is necessary, it is important, it is important because it creates this oversight board. It is important because it allows recovery of attorneys fees. It allows recovery of damages. There is a toll free number to register complaints. It improves the operation of the Taxpayer Advocate Office. It is good legislation. I do hope the Senator will go through this legislation and explain to the American public why it is so important we pass it and pass it now.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I served on the Committee on Environment and Public Works when the original ISTEA bill was written. I believe ISTEA has been one of the most important, innovative pieces of legislation ever to pass the United States Congress. Our stated goal was to turn over more spending power and authority to the states and localities while maintaining a strong national transportation system. 
In the last 6 years we have made great progress and, when we are finally able to pass a bill, I feel confident that ISTEA II will carry us further in the same direction. Until we get to that point, the Congress must must pass a short-term measure that ensures that the state programs remain stable while we are finishing work on the reauthorization. 
ISTEA made the states partners with the federal government in building and maintaining a strong transportation system. Leaving them in the lurch now would be no way to treat a partner. I believe the Congress needs to pass a short-term extension to ISTEA to ensure continuity in the state programs and to live up to our obligation to the American people to provide a world-class transportation system. 
I am delighted that the Senate passed this short term extension by unanimous consent last night, putting aside regional differences over formula funding. I am hopeful that the House will respond quickly and that we will be able to go home knowing that we have done the right thing for the states and the American people. 
Senator Bond, the primary author of this approach, takes care of our short term needs and he deserves our praise for developing it and selling it to all of his colleagues while under tremendous time pressures. State programs will continue, but we keep the pressure on 
ourselves to get the 6 year reauthorization done. 
Several of my colleagues have came to the Floor last night to explain how the bill works and I will not repeat their effort. However, I do want to offer high praise to Senator Chafee, Senator Bond, Senator Baucus, and Senator Warner for developing a measure that will work and has the support of the Senate. 
Additionally, I would like to offer thanks to key members of their staff for their hard work and late hours, not only this week but throughout the year, Kathy Ruffalo of Senator Baucus' staff, Dan Corbett of Mr. Chafee's staff, and Ann Loomis of Senator Warner's staff have put in tremendous hours of hard work this year developing a 6 year reauthorization of ISTEA, a bill that passed the Committee on Environment and Public Works unanimously. 
Additionally, Tracy Henke of Senator Bond's staff did top notch work in putting together the Senate's short term extension bill and I am grateful for her efforts. 
In particular I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for accommodating my request to include the Federal Lands Highway Programs in the bill. For states, such as mine, that have vast holdings of public lands, the Federal Lands Highways Programs are a vital part of our transportation network. 
There are three programs that make up the Federal Lands Highway Program: 
Public Lands Highway Program for roads and maintenance on federal lands. Eighty-seven percent of Nevada is federally-owned; 
Indian Reservation Roads Program for roads and maintenance on Indian reservations; and 
Parkways and Park Highways Program that funds roads and maintenance within National Parks. 
These programs serve as a transportation lifeline for the vast rural, federally-owned areas that blanket the Western United States. The federal government has a duty and obligation to build and maintain roads on federal lands. It would be unreasonable for the federal government to ignore the needs of citizens living in these areas. 
If the goal of today's action is to keep the state highway programs running until we complete work on the reauthorization of ISTEA, then it is critical that the Federal Lands Highway Program be included. 
Nevada has become the most urbanized state in the Union; a higher percentage of our population lives in urban areas than in any other state. Coupled with the dramatic growth Nevada is experiencing, it is difficult for the rural areas to get the attention they need and deserve without these programs. They are an absolutely essential piece of Nevada's state program. 
Again, I thank my colleagues for recognizing the unique needs of Nevada and other vast public lands states and for including funding for the Federal Lands Highway Programs in this bill. 
We still have a long ways to go in reaching a short-term compromise with the House, but after the Senate's actions last night, I am confident that we will get there.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to two Nevadans whose lives serve as an inspiration not only to all Nevadans but to this Nation and to this distinguished body. Fifteen years ago, Julian and Lillian Wallace founded an advocacy group in Las Vegas called Seniors United. Their mission was to tap into the unmined and undiscovered potential of Nevada's small but growing senior population and ensure that Nevada retirees were informed and had a voice in the political process on all levels of government. Each month for the past 15 years they have put together a informative newsletter and a monthly briefing for Nevada seniors. They stood as some of my strongest allies in the fight to stop the unfair source tax which allowed States to go after the pension incomes of former residents. As Nevada has grown and changed and the number of seniors and retirees has increased, Seniors United has become one of the most formidable groups in the State. Lillian and Julian's success with Seniors United comes from a simple idea-- empowerment. They believe that an informed democracy is a powerful democracy. They never hesitate to hold their elected officials feet to the fire and demonstrate on a daily basis that an active and involved citizenry is definitely not a function of age. Perhaps their greatest assets are those attributes which have helped them stay married for 50 years: compassion, patience, love, and loyalty. On January 17, 1998, Lillian and Julian Wallace will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. I ask all my colleagues to join with me today to recognize these two Nevadans for their dedication and devotion not only to their marriage but also to making this country better for all citizens.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Nevadan, my friend, the late Judge Addeliar `Dell' Guy III, who died last year. This extraordinary individual will receive a permanent honor in my State on February 5, 1998. A local school, to be named the Addeliar Guy Middle School, will serve as a lasting tribute to this remarkable man. 
In addition to serving as Nevada's first African-American judge, Addeliar Guy's legacy includes his role as a devoted husband, father and grandfather, decorated soldier, concerned citizen, community leader, talented litigator, and until his retirement, as an elected judge for the Eight District Court of Clarke County, where he served for 20 years. 
Judge Guy served in the Coast Guard in World War II, followed by active duty in the United States Army through the Korean war. While in the Army, Dell had the chance to act as counsel for one of his fellow sergeants, sparking his interest in the exercise of justice. He later continued his military service in the Illinois and Nevada National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve. 
His extraordinary display of American patriotism has earned him another prominent memorial in our State. On July 2, my colleagues and I in the Nevada congressional delegation 
presided over the dedication of the new Las Vegas Ambulatory Care Center for Veterans, which was named in his honor. The judge's many military credentials include the Purple Heart, Meritorious Award Medal, Korean Service Medal with two battle stars, and a Combat Infantryman's Badge. 
Upon leaving the Army, Dell looked for work in the private sector, and although he had a wide range of aspirations and his experience as an officer qualified him for many professional jobs, those opportunities were closed off to him because of race. Fortunately for Nevada, he decided to dedicate his life to the law and received his law degree from Chicago's Loyola University in 1957, where in his second year, he set his sights on achieving what would seem to many an impossible goal, earning a judgeship. 
Although he once said that he would never leave Chicago, after attending a Young Democrats meeting in Las Vegas, he was persuaded to join the District Attorney's Office when he was denied a judgeship he was expecting in Illinois. Addeliar Guy became the first African-American licensed to practice law in my State, and, in 1967, was officially admitted to the Nevada bar. In his two decades on the State bench, he served as Alternate Justice of the Supreme Court and in 1975 was appointed by then Governor O'Callaghan to the newly created eighth judicial district. 
He truly believed in the law, as a fellow officer of the court and U.S. Senator, I counted on Judge Guy's trademark intelligence and honesty, as well as his ability to astutely assess the character and behavior of young Nevadans, potential nominees seeking to lead our Armed Forces. 
Much of my admiration for Judge Guy stems from his continued enduring commitment to people of the Silver State. Judge Guy's values are reflected not only in the way he lived his life, but in the many organizations he belonged to and served. Until his passing, he worked every day as a citizen-soldier, contributing to groups like the NAACP, the Bar Association, my Academy Board and local youth agencies. Judge Guy also served as a motivating force for Nevada's kids, promoting education through the A.D. Guy Scholarship Fund and the Nevada Spirit of Art Contest. 
The Honorable Addeliar Guy's lifetime of achievement is truly an inspiration, and he serves as an incredible role model for judicial prudence/stewardship of justice and legal acumen. I am confident that Nevadans will remember Judge Guy for his distinguished career, and I hope that the children passing through his namesake will be inspired by his phenomenal record of accomplishment and lifelong service to the State of Nevada.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have to applaud the opponents of campaign finance reform. They have done a great job. They set out to confuse and distract from the real issue of campaign reform, and they have succeeded. They have diverted attention from the fact that raising money becomes one of the essential items and activities of those of us who serve in Congress just to remain competitive. They have done this by focusing on extraneous matters like who made phone calls, where did they make them from? 
We have not focused, as we should, on the continued increased cost of the media in campaigns. Consultants have become more controlling. Self-financing has become the norm. Opponents, Mr. President, of real campaign finance reform are focused on anything to divert attention from the fact that campaigns are very expensive and too long. The Governmental Affairs Committee hearing has clearly shown, at least in this Senator's opinion, that both parties need more constraints, more controls, and more attention. 
We must bring attention back to what the real issues are in campaign finance--that is, the fact that Senators and Representatives spend large amounts of their time and their efforts simply raising money in order to pay for escalating media costs. As I have said, we have the never-ending, it seems, self-financing of candidates. Take a small State like the State of Nevada or one like the Presiding Officer's State of Arizona, $4 million, which has a relatively small campaign fund in this modern era, sadly. To raise that much money, you have to raise about $13,000 or $14,000 a week every year. You don't take a week off for Christmas. If you do, you have to raise more money. If you do that 52 weeks a year for 6 years, you can raise enough to be competitive in a race; you will raise about $4 million. As we know, in some States it takes a lot more money. In those States, you have to raise twice that much or three times or four times that much. Instead of raising $13,000 or $14,000 a week, people have to raise $50,000 a week. That is what we should be focusing on, Mr. President--the fact that these campaigns are very expensive. 
Eleven years ago, I came to the Senate floor and talked about 
this campaign I had been through, a campaign where corporate money was used. Complaints had been filed with the Federal Election Commission. It is 11 years now, and a number of those complaints have still never been disposed of by the Federal Election Commission. They are still pending. I thought to myself, I can't believe there would be another election with the same rules in effect. We haven't had one election since then; we have had six since then where the same rules applied to Members of Congress. I, personally, will begin my third campaign using these same rules. In fact, I have to say they are not identical rules; they are worse, because in the early part of this century Congress decided it wasn't appropriate to have corporate money used in campaigns. The Supreme Court came back last year and said, oh, well, you can use corporate money in campaigns. State parties can virtually use the money any way they want. So corporate money is now back into elections for the first time in 85 or 90 years. Now corporate money is important. 
I guess we have to be satisfied that there is a debate. I extend my appreciation to the majority leader for allowing this debate to take place; a debate about campaign financing. I have to say, though, Mr. President, that we started out saying, well, McCain-Feingold doesn't do it all, but it is not a bad bill. That is why I joined as a sponsor of that legislation. But now we are here before the Senate, the original McCain-Feingold is long gone, and we are now talking about a mini McCain-Feingold, which we are now happy that we have, that even though the original bill was lacking in many elements, now we are congratulating ourselves for going with a slimmed-down version of McCain-Feingold, which we probably won't get a chance to vote on because of all the extracurricular, extraneous matters being debated in this. 
This watered-down version, I hope, can be passed. But because opponents of campaign finance reform have taken it upon themselves to expand a Supreme Court decision, the Beck case, I am not sure we are going to be able to. I have come to the floor today to remind my colleagues that we are not debating campaign finance reform to find out if the President had made phone calls from an inappropriate place or whether he should have gone to his home. Think about that; he could not do that because that is on Federal property. Maybe he should have taken Secret Service agents with him and found a pay phone to make those calls. 
The fact is, we should be debating that campaigns take too much time and campaigns are far too long and take too much money. Since 1992, we have had a $900 million election cycle. In 1996, there was a 70-percent increase, in just those 4 years. In the last 20 years, congressional races have increased their spending by some 700 percent. Both political parties, Democrats and Republicans, know that the cost of campaigns is the problem. So I think we should bring back the focus on the real issue of campaign finance reform, which is that there is too much money being spent and campaigns are too long. 
I see my friend from Kentucky on the floor. I have to say to him that I appreciate his honesty in this campaign debate. From the very first time that he took this as a campaign issue, he hasn't minced any words. He has said basically that he is opposed to it. We have a lot of people, Mr. President, who don't have the--I won't say courage, but that is a decent word--ability to get up and call things the way he sees them. I disagree with my friend from Kentucky, but he is willing to debate the issues as they stand. He has been willing to do this from the first time it was brought up when Senator Byrd was majority leader and when Senator Mitchell was majority leader. He doesn't hide how he feels about campaign finance reform. I appreciate his approach. Many people are hiding between the nuances of campaign finance reform and side issues. I say to my friend from Kentucky that I appreciate his approach. He says he is against campaign finance reform, and he has never hidden that fact; he has spoken out openly and has been very candid about it. I appreciate his approach to it. 
I do say, however, that I wish that there were others like my friend from Kentucky who would stand up and debate the issue. McCain-Feingold, for example, let's debate it, and if there are enough votes to pass it, fine. If not, let's go on to another issue. We don't need filibusters on either side. We need to debate whether or not we need campaign finance reform. We need to go forward. 
I personally believe that campaigns, I repeat, are too long, too costly, and we owe an obligation to the American public to do something about that.

But I would say to the Senate, and anyone who is in the sound of my voice, that these are seven projects out of hundreds and hundreds of projects. He complains that this bill is a $21 billion bill. And we should waste no Government money--not a single penny. But I have to say that in picking seven relatively small projects out of a $21 billion bill I think the Senator from New Mexico and I in managing this bill did a pretty good job. This bill provides many different things. 
I would also say before leaving that subject that the Senator from Arizona, my good friend, also talks about things being done without authorization. The House is very, very tough on making sure that things are authorized. Congressman McDade, chairman of the subcommittee on the House side, has been very strict on that. However, I want to make sure that everyone understands that this bill provides a number of dollars for many different projects. 
Let's take, for example--I will not take any of the things in Nevada for obvious reasons. But let's take the sister State of California: $6 million to dredge and deepen Long Beach Harbor. This deepening will significantly improve sea trade up and down the west coast, and in the Asia-Pacific basin. It will even reduce the transportation costs of oil that is being brought down from Alaska. That is one example for $6 million. 
The bill also provides $10 million to restore the sensitive Everglades ecosystem which has been damaged for decades by agricultural production. 
Those are only two examples. There are numerous flood control projects throughout the country that will prevent significant personal and economic loss. 
This is of particular importance in light of El Nino which may bring unusually heavy rains, as it already has to the western part of the United States. 
These floods projects are important. It is a relatively small part of the bill. But they are important projects. 
Madam President, the Corps of Engineers is one of the last great bastions of infrastructure development in this country. You can just take the bill itself and look at some of the flood control projects. You can look at them in Arkansas at a place called American River Watershed; in Colorado, at a place called Alamosa; you can look at Florida and many different places, including the Everglades that we have already talked about; Hawaii, at a place called Wailupe Stream; in Illinois, Reno Lake; Indiana, the Fort Wayne metropolitan area; you can talk about Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana. All through this country there are flood control projects that are going to save lives and property. That is one of the main parts of this bill. 
I am somewhat concerned that someone would indicate that this bill is fluffed. It is far from that, Madam President. 
I would like at this time to make sure that the Record is spread with the fact that this is a bill that has reached the Senate floor as a result of bipartisanship. The chairman of the subcommittee, the senior Senator from New Mexico, and I worked hand in glove this past 10 months to arrive at the point where 
we are now asking the Senate to approve this conference report. 
So I want to extend my appreciation to the Senator from New Mexico, and also extend my appreciation to my clerk, Greg Daines, and Liz Blevins on the minority side for the work that they have done day after day, week after week, month after month, arriving at this point. 
I also say publicly that Alex Flint, David Gwaltney, and Lashawnda Leftwich on the majority side, have set an example of how congressional staffs should work together to arrive at a goal that is good for this country. 
Madam President, this bill has, as the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, many different items dealing with the sciences. For example, one of the things that I am extremely happy about is that we have provided money for desalinization. Personally I don't think it is nearly enough because I think in the years to come desalinization is going to be the watchword for not only water in this country but all over the world. We need to do much more than what we have done. 
Senator Paul Simon, the Senator, just retired, from Illinois, is writing a book on water. I had the good fortune to read the book before it went to the publisher. It is a wonderful book. He points out how important desalinization is. And I acknowledge that and agree with him. There is desalinization in this bill that I think is very important. 
We have done things with hydrogen fuel development. We have done things with the other renewable programs--solar; and programs that are going to take the place someday of fossil fuel. It is not enough certainly in this bill, but I am proud of the fact that it is in this legislation. 
I would like to also point out another California project called the California Bay-Delta ecosystem restoration project. 
I say this because this is one of the first times in the history of this country that parties with dissimilar and often opposing interests have sat down and are working together for an equitable resolution to a significant problem in the State of California dealing with water. 
I think this very big project--for which there is a lot of money in this bill to get this started--is going to set the pattern all over the country. Now parties with dissimilar interests have to sit down and work toward a common goal as they have done. 
I am very proud of this bill. I think we have done a good job. We have done a good job in making sure that we have not only done the projects that the Senator from New Mexico and I have talked about but also, Madam President, we have done a good job in making sure that our nuclear deterrent is safe and reliable. 
When I was in the House of Representatives, I supported a nuclear freeze. I support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. And I do it with so much more anticipation now because of what we have in this bill because we have enough money to provide for stockpile stewardship so that the people who we are going to call upon to certify that our stockpile is safe and reliable can do it. 
So, in short, this is a good bill. And I hope that it passes the Senate as it did on the initial go-around unanimously.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, my amendment to the bill is straightforward and simple. 
It will prohibit the use of appropriated dollars to begin a rulemaking process by the National Indian Gaming Commission that runs contrary to congressional intent. 
Nine years ago, the Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to regulate what was even then a rapid spread of gaming activity in Indian Country. 
The act established a three-member Commission to promulgate regulations to control and oversee tribal gaming activities. 
These regulations were intended to ensure the integrity of the games and to give States an assurance that gaming activities that were not available to non-Indians similarly did not occur on tribal lands. 
These regulations were four years in the making and have sustained legal challenges all the way to the Supreme Court. 
In essence, the regulations serve to classify and define the different types of games allowed under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. 
Games such as blackjack, craps, and roulette fall under the category of class III, basically casino gambling. 
Games such as slot machines and video poker machines--the largest revenue generators of gaming--also fall under the class III category. 
Games such as bingo and traditional tribal gambling games fall under class II and class I respectively. 
For years these regulations have worked well. Electronic devices that clearly are class III, or slot-machine-type devices, have been regulated under class III gaming. 
This is significant because class III, or casino-type gaming requires States and tribals to enter into a compact and to regulate it. 
Needless to say, unregulated casino gaming would be bad for consumers, bad for States and bad for tribes. 
Even so, for years, some tribes and manufacturers of gaming devices have sought class II designation for devices that clearly are slot machines or video poker-like devices from the National Indian Gaming Commission. 
These efforts have failed because of the strict convention of the existing regulations. 
But now, this Commission has initiated an open-ended rulesmaking process that would seek to redefine what constitutes an electronic gaming device. 
The lawyers at the Commission who initiated this process will tell you that they simply want to clarify the definition of electronic or mechanical devices that are not games of chance but are vague under the existing regulations. 
They will tell you that they are simply clearing up confusion. 
If that is the case, then why is their advance notice of proposed rulemaking so broad in nature? The solicitation in this notice, published in the Federal Register, states that the Commission is seeking public comment--quote--`in its evaluation of the decision to amend its current definition regulations' end quote. 
I would like to know how this decision was made. Who made this decision to amend the definitions? How was it accomplished? 
It certainly was done without any notification to a number of us who are familiar with this issue and interested in it. 
Perhaps most importantly, Mr. President, I would remind the Senate that the very same Commission that is now seeking to embark on an extensive rulemaking process is the one that only two months ago was beseeching the Appropriations Committee to change current law so it could collect more fees from tribes. 
Why? Because this same Commission said it didn't have enough money to fulfill its legal mandate to regulate gaming. 
Interestingly enough, less than half the tribes conducting gaming across this country are in compliance with the existing regulations. 
Mr. President, this Commission has been wracked with controversy. Its previous chairman left under a cloud of alleged mismanagement. 
This Commission needs to get its act together before it embarks on any rulemaking process, let alone one that undermines existing and good regulations and violates congressional intent. 
We need, at least, Mr. President, some time for the committees of jurisdiction of this Congress to have hearings on such a significant change that could occur with the rewriting of these regulations. 
This amendment will allow Congress time to be informed by this Commission about such a significant action.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to someone I knew and cared a great deal about. 
I had the good fortune to consider Red Skelton a friend. I first met Red Skelton when I was Lieutenant Governor of the State of Nevada. He and I went to a rodeo together. At that time I found him to be jovial, a real gentleman, and not taken with his celebrity status. 
He has been tremendous to the State of Nevada. He has performed in the north and the south. He has been involved in many charitable functions. We in Nevada consider Red Skelton part of Nevada. 
Charlie Chaplin once said, `I remain just one thing, and one thing only--and that is a clown. It places me on a far higher plane than any politician.' 
This morning on public radio, Mr. President, Red Skelton was heard again. I heard from one of his prior performances. In that broadcast he talked about why he felt being a clown was something that he always wanted to be remembered as--being a clown. He proceeded to tell everyone there how important it was that we remain, in many respects, in our childlike status--lots of energy, trusting other people. 
So today I rise to ask politicians all over America and especially in this body to pay tribute to America's favorite clown, Richard Bernard Skelton, better known to us as Red Skelton. He passed away yesterday at age 84. 
He was the son of a grocer, who later became a circus clown. Mr. Skelton died 2 months before his son Red was born. His widowed mother worked as a cleaning woman and elevator operator to support her four sons. 
Red Skelton started being a professional clown at age 10. So for almost 75 years--three-quarters of a century--he has been making people laugh. 
He did not ask people to laugh. You had to laugh at Red Skelton. He became part of a traveling medicine show where he picked up vaudeville skills which served him so well for the rest of his life. His debut on radio was in 1937, and Broadway the same year. His first movie was in 1938 entitled `Having a Wonderful Time.' He became a Hollywood star appearing in almost 50 films over the course of his life. 
Skeleton often said that he was a `man whose destiny caught up with him at an early age.' 
His destiny, Mr. President, was to make America laugh. 
`I don't want to be called `the greatest' or `one of the greatest.' Let other guys claim to be the best. I just want to be known as a clown,' Red said, `because to me, that's the height of my profession. It means you can do everything--sing, dance, and above all, make people laugh.' 
Mr. President, last March I went to Palm Springs to present Red Skelton a Presidential commendation. We had a date set that the President of the United States was going to give that to him in the White House. But his ill-health prevented him from flying, so I proceeded to Palm Springs on behalf of the President to give Red Skelton this commendation from the President. 
It was a wonderful luncheon that we had. He was very weak of body but alert of mind. For example, at that time even though he was confined to a wheelchair, he wrote seven stories every week, and he would pick the best out of the seven and put it in a book, and every year he produced 52 short stories. That was Red Skelton up to the time he died. 
We had a wonderful time that day in March. I will never forget it. We were able to videotape that. He cracked jokes, and we had a great time. He is somebody that I will remember, the people of Nevada will remember, and this country will remember. 
Let me repeat the words of President Clinton, who honored Red Skleton with a Presidential certificate commendation, signed on April 1, 1996, in fitting tribute to America's favorite clown.  
A natural-born comic who got his first laugh from an audience at the age of 10, Red Skelton has devoted a long and productive life to entertaining people of all ages. Moving from the vaudeville stage to radio, the movies and television, he became America's favorite clown, creating characters like Clem Kadiddlehopper and Freddie the Freeloader, whom generations of Americans looked forward to seeing every week. Red Skelton served his country well. From his days in World War II and Korea as a soldier and an entertainer for the troops, to his many years on the large screen and small, he has given to all those lucky enough to see him perform the gift of laughter and joy. 
When I walked into the room to present Red with this certificate, he still remembered me from our days attending rodeos together in southern Nevada. He was deeply touched by this honor because more than anything, Red Skelton loved his country. 
Red Skelton could have never been America's favorite clown if he wasn't already one of America's greatest patriots. Red fought for his country in World War II and Korea. 
His definition of the true meaning of the Pledge of Allegiance will always remain with me. I would like to repeat it for you today: 
I, me, an individual, a committee of one. 
Pledge, dedicate all my worldly goods to give without self pity. 
Allegiance--my love and devotion. 
To the Flag--our standard, Old Glory, a symbol of freedom. Wherever she waves, there is respect because your loyalty has given her a dignity that shouts freedom is everybody's job. 
of the United--that means that we have all come together. 
States--individual communities that have unites into 50 great states. 50 individual communities with pride and dignity and purpose, all divided with imaginary boundaries, yet united to a common purpose, and that's love for country. 
of America 
and to the Republic--A state in which sovereign power is invested in representatives chosen by the people to govern. And a government is the people and it's from the people to the leaders, not from the leaders to the people. 
for Which It Stands. 
One Nation--Meaning, so blessed by God. 
Indivisible--Incapable of being divided. 
With Liberty--Which is freedom and the right of power to live one's own life without threats or fear or some sort of retaliation. 
and Justice--The principle or quality of dealing fairly with others. 
for All--Which means it's as much your country as it is mine. 
Red Skelton always signed off every shown `Goodnight and God Bless,' Yesterday Milton Berle, Red's closest friend told his old friend `Farewell and God Bless.' 
Mr. President, on behalf of the citizens of Nevada, Red's wife, Lothian, Red's family and friends, I say farewell, Red, and God bless. 
I am grateful that the Senate of the United States is paying tribute to America's favorite clown. 
Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.

Mr. REID. I hope that we can resolve this issue. It is quite clear that it does violate the Constitution of the United States. That is by taking the Senator's own statement during the time he was debating his amendment. It is clear from his own statement that it is a violation of the Constitution. 
I say to my friends who are listening to this debate, Members of the Senate, that we would vote on this issue and if this issue prevails, of course, the amendment falls. But I would also say that we should look at this on the legal aspect. If this stays in this bill, the bill is gone. There is no question that it is unconstitutional and we should vote based on the constitutionality of this amendment, not on the merits of the amendment. 
I say to my friends that we have voted on some aspect of an amendment like this on other occasions. My friend from Arkansas has framed it differently this time. Therefore, we have raised this point of order. I ask that we dispose of this. It is getting late into the night. I repeat, if this constitutional point of order is upheld, the amendment falls.

<TEXT>
Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Arkansas has stated there has been a fine distinction point raised. That fine distinction point is the Constitution of the United States. I think that is something that we should be concerned about. This country has been in existence for more than 200 years, and this body has been in existence for more than 200 years. I think if we are anything of significance, which I believe we are, we are a country that is bound by the constitutional dictates set up by our Founding Fathers. The constitutional point of order lies. 
Now, I also think, prior to voting on this, that we have to understand that much of what the Senator from Arkansas says, throwing these numbers around, talking about 30-second spots, these are a figment of someone's imagination. You cannot get out of here and talk about billions of dollars in cleanup and all the problems caused by mining. The fact of the matter is that with rare, rare exception, all of the cases he has talked about are cases involving mines that have long since been depleted, old mines where we had no reclamation laws, we had no environmental laws. That is why the Superfund is attempting to go clean them up. Under modern day reclamation and mining in the Western United States, we have good laws. He talks about leach mining, where you lay down a plastic pad and what if it leaks. Well, it doesn't leak. 
We have stringent controls that guarantees that. 
I would also say, Mr. President, that I understand the feelings of the Senator from Arkansas about mining--I believe it is a very important industry in this country--when he says--and he said this before--`If you do not like what we are doing to you in the United States, adios.' And he waves. 
Let me talk about two of the States that are small States populationwise. Let's talk about the State of North Dakota and see how important mining is to North Dakota. 
The value of minerals mined in North Dakota for the year 1995 was almost $308 million; directly contribution to Federal Government revenues, $21 million is what the Federal government gains from the mining in a tiny State of North Dakota; total jobs gained directly and indirectly in North Dakota, 13,000 jobs. 
Take another very small State, the State of Wyoming, the smallest State populationwise, or maybe Alaska is, but one of the smaller two States. The value of minerals in the State of Wyoming, over $2.5 billion; jobs in Wyoming, 41,000. 
The point is that mining is important. We are a net exporter of gold. This has only happened during the last 10 years. 
We talk about a favorable balance of trade. We have one in mining, which is very significant and important to this country. The price of gold has dropped significantly this past year. It was over $400 an ounce, and now it is barely $320 an ounce. Mining companies are having trouble making it. 
So, I say also to my friend from Arkansas that every battle that he fights on the Senate floor is the most important battle that he fights. We have heard him on a number of issues that he talks strenuously and very passionately about. On every one, he tells us that it is the most important. I have great respect and admiration for his ability to debate. But the fact is, sometimes we are debating facts that are not at issue. 
The issue before this body today is a constitutional issue as to whether or not the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas violates the Constitution. He has stated it does. I do not know if he wants a rollcall vote on it, or whether we should do it by voice vote. 
I say through the Chair to my friend from Arkansas, I have a question for my friend from Arkansas. He has acknowledged that his amendment violates the Constitution.

Mr. REID. So, in short, Mr. President, there has been an acknowledgment, even by the proponent of the amendment--the Record speaks for itself--that this amendment violates the Constitution. 
I want everyone walking over here to vote to understand that we said--`we,' those of us who have talked for years against the amendments offered by my friend from Arkansas; and I will not describe the amendments--we have said that we would offer mining law reform, and we have done that. We have done that. This is a good bill. It calls for a royalty, reforms the patenting process, 
and reclamation. It is a good bill. We have done that. We have kept faith. 
I also want everyone to understand, especially on the Democratic side, this constitutional issue, or the underlying amendment, has nothing do with the regulation that we disposed of here yesterday on the Senate floor. This has nothing to do with the issue--some controversy between the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from Nevada--within the Democratic conference. This is a separate issue dealing with a tax, a tax that has been established with not a single hearing, with no debate whatsoever prior to getting here. It was thrown upon us here, on the Senate floor, this morning. 
So I say we should go forward with this constitutional point of order. 
In closing, let me say that the taxpayers of this country, the hundreds of thousands of people that work in mining, do care about mining. Their jobs come from mines. They pay taxes. And they provide for one of the finest industries that we have in the Western part of the United States. 
I also say that we talk about environmental laws. I invite my friend from Arkansas, and anyone else that wants to see good reclamation, come and see what mining companies do in the modern-day West. Joshua trees are not torn up in a mining process. They must be saved so that when the mining is completed they can be replanted. 
The mining company not far from my hometown, Searchlight, NV--they have a mining operation that has also a farming operation. They save all of the trees that have been uprooted from the mining. When that particular part of the mine is closed, they have to replant the Joshua trees. 
So mining companies have contributed a lot environmentally to this country. 
I think we have to understand that the passionate arguments of my friend from Arkansas are based little on fact and much on passion.

First of all, again, with all due respect to my friend from Arkansas, it is somewhat misleading to say they get $2.50 an acre for land.

<DOCNO>105-reid-nv-12-19970918</DOCNO>

Mr. REID. Let me finish my answer. 
To develop that piece of land costs them tens of millions of dollars. You don't simply go out in the deserts of Nevada or any place in the West and locate a claim and start scooping out the gold. I am not saying millions of dollars. I am saying tens of millions of dollars. 
In addition to that, the unique situation that the Senator has raised, they also purchased next to their mine a ranch. 
And the reason they purchased the ranch originally was so their mining operations would not interfere with the ranch property. They bought that ranch so their trucks could go through the property on their roads. They found on that land some mineral value. Since they owned the ranch, and they found some gold. And the reason they were willing to do that, and pay the fee on land that they already had, is because they had an ongoing operation. They had already developed and they discovered gold there, and it was the profitable thing for them to do. They didn't do it, just to go out and then somebody said, `You start paying us 18 percent royalty.' They already had a huge mining operation in the immediate vicinity of the property they agreed to lease.

<DOCNO>105-reid-nv-13-19970918</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. REID. First of all, these lands started being patented a long time ago. If you look at Carson City, which was before the 1872 mining law, they had a different way of patenting claims than started in 1872. Claims in Nevada have been patented for many years as they have in the Western part of the United States. I can't give you the genealogy of the claim about which the Senator speaks, but assuming my friend from Arkansas is right, that it was originally patented by someone else and then they purchased it, I say this. 
First of all, the reason that Newmont Mining Co. or any other mining company would be willing to pay extra on it is because we live in a system of free enterprise where people pay what they feel they can pay in order to make a profit. And surrounding this piece of land is land that they have spent tens of millions of dollars developing. The land that they are leasing from another individual, this company, is land that has already been patented. Newmont didn't have to spend a single penny to get the patents. That is very, very difficult. It didn't used to be very tough but now it is very difficult to patent.

<TEXT>
Mr. REID. No, I would not agree at all. For example, under the 1872 mining law, you don't have to patent land. You can go out and locate land any place you want. In the town where I was born, a guy in 1898, walking through there--the 1872 mining law was in effect--found some gold. It didn't cost anything to develop it. They started mining it. 
But under modern law it is very difficult to patent a claim. That is why I talk about companies spending millions of dollars. 
Around the area where I was born and raised, in Searchlight, we only have one mine, which is right over the line in the State of California, owned by the Viceroy Mining Co. That relatively small mine cost $70 million before they took an ounce of gold out of the ground, $70 million. So, I mean, we talk about $2.50 an acre and it was patented land.

Mr. REID. Absolutely not; because as you know--maybe the Senator from Arkansas didn't understand my answer. Maybe he did not want to understand the answer. The fact is, as I have explained, the area of land where they have the lease and are paying royalties on land that was patented a long time ago. They didn't have to spend any money to develop that. It was right there. They did not have to spend money to get a patent. It was already patented. 
In modern-day mining it costs a lot of money to patent a claim. It didn't use to. It does now.

Mr. REID. I say respectfully to my friend from Arkansas, I do not understand the question. The fact of the matter is the profit motive governs mining companies, ranchers, as it does those who own clothing stores, automobile dealerships, and mining companies that are trying to make money to pay the wages of people who work for them. I acknowledge that.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am very happy today to welcome to the Senate and Washington, DC, Rabbi Mell Hecht. I do this on my behalf and that of Senator Bryan from Nevada. 
I have been in the presence of Rabbi Hecht on joyous occasions, bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs, and also sad occasions where he has spoken at funerals. Rabbi Hecht is truly one of the spiritual leaders of the Greater Las Vegas area and the State of Nevada. That is why I was very happy to be responsible for his giving the prayer to open this session of the Senate. 
Rabbi Mell Hecht is really a community builder. He is an active leader in our religious community and as a result of his being active in our religious community with his spiritual leadership this has certainly flowed over into the rest of the community. He is deeply concerned about the community of man. He is an outspoken advocate for human rights. He has worked for peace in many different aspects of our society. 
Rabbi Hecht has a great academic background. He has a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Miami in Florida. He has done some of his undergraduate work at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel. He completed his bachelor of Hebrew letters and master of Hebrew letters at the Cincinnati Union College where he was ordained a rabbi. He has been an Army chaplain and race relations officer in Germany. He served as chairman of the Humana Sunrise Pastoral Care Council, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, Nevada Clergy Against Drug and Alcohol Abuse, and the Jewish Federation Community Relations Committee. He has been on the boards of numerous civic and charitable organizations. He has recently received his doctor of divinity degree from Hebrew Union College in California. 
Mr. President, again, it is with a great deal of honor and pleasure that I welcome one of Nevada's spiritual leaders, Rabbi Mell Hecht, to the Senate.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered on my behalf and that of the Senator from California deals with a serious problem. The city of Henderson, NV, where I went to high school, has been in existence since the Second World War. Henderson, NV, was developed as a result of the war effort during World War II. It is Nevada's only industrial city. 
At one time, that was the whole city. Everything in that town supplied a job related to what we called the basic magnesium complex, BMI. So for more than 50 years, Henderson has been supplying products for our war effort--the Second World War, Korea, Vietnam, the cold war. 
During the cold war, the biggest use of products out of the complex, at least one part of the complex, was providing the fuel to send spaceships into the air, a product called ammonium perchlorate. 
We, it is said, take our water for granted, especially the water we drink. Those of us in the western part of the United States are very concerned about water, as we should be, because we have so little of it. Just in the last 30 days, there are people in California and Nevada who are concerned about the safety of the water. We have been told that the water in Lake Mead is safe, and I am hopeful and confident that it is. But as people in this body know, water is an enormous issue for those of us from the West. The scarcity of water and its availability requires us to be extremely careful in how we apportion and use this most basic natural resource. 
In the Las Vegas area, for example, Mr. President, the annual rainfall is less than 4 inches a year. We get very, very little water in the Las Vegas area. Henderson is a suburb of Las Vegas. 
Because of this, we do everything we can to make sure that the water is protected. This is no easy task. The problem that we address in this amendment deals with something called ammonium perchlorate. It is an interstate problem. It involves not only the State of Nevada, but also the States of California and Arizona. Why? Because we share water out of the Colorado River and the lakes that are up and down the Colorado River. 
Over the August recess, it was reported that perchlorate was turning up in certain samples they were doing of the water at Lake Mead, southern Nevada's primary drinking water source. Perchlorate is also being detected, at really low levels, in Los Angeles, in the water they think they get from the Colorado River. It has been detected in California in over 70 drinking water wells throughout that State. 
As I mentioned, Mr. President, perchlorate is a common ingredient in the manufacture of rocket fuel--especially rocket fuel--munitions, and fireworks. Forms of perchlorate are ammonium perchlorate, which we manufacture in southern Nevada, potassium perchlorate, sodium perchlorate, and perchloric acid. Currently, the only treatment for that is reverse osmosis and ion exchange. 
Mr. President, perchlorate is not a compound that is regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Why? Because all the tests in previous years showed that there was no reason to be concerned. There are some scientists who say that it could be dangerous to pregnant women and to children. We do not know. That is what this amendment is all about. 
We want to make sure that in the State of California and the States of Nevada and Arizona the water is safe. The only State that has set a limit as to how much perchlorate is allowed to be in the water is California. They set a limit. We want to make sure we comply with that limit, as does everyone in Arizona and California. 
In the 70 wells that they have tested in California where they found perchlorate, about 18 of those wells exceeded the level that they had set. But the question is, what does that really mean? That is the purpose of this amendment. We have asked the National Institutes of Health to run some studies during the next 9 months and report back to us to determine whether or not perchlorate in drinking water is unsafe for children and pregnant women. Perchlorate is not listed as a RCRA or Superfund hazardous substance. 
We are in relatively new ground at this time, Mr. President. As I indicated, the primary health concern related to perchlorate is it can interfere with the thyroid gland's ability to use iodine to produce certain hormones. In a hormone-deficient condition, normal metabolism, growth and development can be affected. We don't know that perchlorate does that, but we need to find out. 
In very high doses, perchlorate has been used as a medicine to treat a thyroid disease called Graves' disease in which excessive amounts of a thyroid hormone are produced. However, in thousands of parts per billion, it can disrupt growth and bodily functions because of its effect on the thyroid gland, some people think. As I have indicated, those people who are particularly vulnerable to unsafe consumption would include pregnant women, children, and sometimes the elderly. 
The problem, however, is there is no hard science on the health and safety risks that perchlorate may pose to human beings. We need to better understand the potential health consequences of this compound on human beings. 
The amendment that I have offered on my behalf and that of the Senator from California I believe should be accepted by this body. All of us can appreciate the necessity of ensuring that the water that we consume is safe. We have been assured by the head of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, Pat Mulroy, that the water is safe. I am confident and very, very hopeful that it is. But we need to make sure that that is the case. 
I support this research and am pushing for its inclusion in this legislation. I also believe that because it has been detected 
in wells in the West, we need to understand why it is there. In particular, we need to understand the potential health risks. Nevada has a large population with elderly, children, pregnant women, as does certainly California and Arizona. 
So we want this body to accept this. We think it is sound legislation. We have been in contact with the National Institutes of Health. They can do this. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, approximately 1 year ago I asked President Clinton to convene a summit on the environmental problems facing Lake Tahoe. He did convene a summit in Lake Tahoe this past Friday and Saturday. Vice President Gore and President Clinton both came to Lake Tahoe. 
Mr. President, Mark Twain said that Lake Tahoe is `the fairest picture the whole Earth affords.' I think Mark Twain was right. That beautiful lake, that is shared by the States of Nevada and California, is the fairest place in all the Earth. 
That beautiful piece of real estate is also shared with the Federal Government because the Federal Government owns about 75 percent of the land mass within the Tahoe basin. 
The reason, Mr. President, that the President was asked to come to Lake Tahoe is because that beautiful resource is in distress. Approximately 50 percent of the trees in the basin are dead or dying. Erosion is taking away the beautiful clarity of that lake. The clarity of that lake is leaving at the rate of over a foot a year because of erosion and pollutants going into that lake. Additionally, we have tremendous fear, through the whole basin, of forest fires. 
Lake Tahoe is clearly the crown jewel of our national treasures and it must be preserved. 
Mr. President, we should all be proud of what took place there these past several months. The planning and execution of the summit involved over 1,000 local people. We had four Cabinet officers who came to the area on more than one occasion. The workshops and the forums that were held prepared the Vice President and the President for their visits. It was not the result of the President coming and saying, `Here's what we are going to do.' 
In fact, what the President decided to do was based upon what the thousand people said should be done. It was not possible to determine who was speaking, whether it was an environmentalist, an owner of a business in the area, or a local government official. They were all speaking as if they were singing from the same sheet of music. 
In fact, the President said that one of the most remarkable things is that this summit, this Presidential forum set the pattern of how disputes should be resolved all around the world, not only in our own country, because he felt that people joined together for a common cause and decided that the environment could be taken care of and the economy could still grow. The people said that unanimously. At Lake Tahoe, there is no false choice between the economy and the environment. Each depends upon the other. 
The people of the Tahoe Basin and the States of California and Nevada agree that something must be done. They asked for a partnership with the Federal Government, and they got that partnership. 
Holding such a forum at this time is critical: If we continue our current path for another 10 years, the damage already done would become irreversible. If we continue on our current path for 30 years, Lake Tahoe will be no better than any other lake. It will be just an average lake. This would be devastating to the people of this country. 
Lake Tahoe is not just another lake and we must not let it become one. 
We have tens of millions of visitors each year that visit the lake. We can no longer let the lake be treated the way it has been in the past. History will not be kind to us if we let this jewel slip away. We have been given a gift, and we must provide adequate stewardship over this gift. 
I have indicated that 75 percent of the land in the basin is federally owned. There is a Federal responsibility to do our share. 
Mr. President, when the President came, he not only acknowledged that there was a problem with the lake, but this was more than a photo opportunity. The President came and signed an Executive order indicating that all Federal agencies would have to work together to save the lake. 
The first chairman of the Federal task force is Secretary Glickman. The first work being done as a result of the President's visit started yesterday. Some of the things being done I think are significant. I am not going to mention the 28 different action items that the President initiated that have dollar signs attached to them, but it is about $50 million worth over two years, a doubling of the current effort. 
One of the things that so impressed me is that the President said that this year 29 miles of old logging roads will be obliterated. Some of the roads have been in existence for more than 100 years going back to the days of the Comstock when they took away all the forests in the area to satisfy the voracious appetite of the mines in the Virginia City area. After 10 years, all the old roads will be gone. These roads have added significantly to the erosion that has taken place in that lake over these many years. 
In addition to that, Mr. President, there will be work done on watershed assessments so that people will understand what we are dealing with there. Two million dollars will be used to clear dead brush and deadwood from the more than 3,500 federally owned lots. These lots have been purchased as a result of Federal lands being sold 500 miles away in the Las Vegas area. These lots now need to be cleaned up. As a result of the action of the President, they will be cleaned up. 
The Forest Service also, Mr. President, will begin a program immediately of prescribed burns. We spend about $1 billion a year fighting fires in this Nation. We are now going to spend part of these moneys starting controlled fires. It is the only way that that forest around Lake Tahoe can be regenerated and made safe. In the past we have burned about 100 to 200 acres a year. This will be an increase of up to 1,000 acres a year which will be burned carefully and on purpose. 
The Forest Service will also use prescribed fires, and other means, to reduce fuels on another 4,000 acres per year. This will be 4,000 acres a year that will become a much better, safer place. 
Mr. President, the work that was done these past 3 months is something that I think we should all be proud of. It shows that the Federal Government can work with State and local governments in a nonadversarial way. I think what took place here is an indication of what can take place in the future in other areas around the country. 
It is possible, I repeat, that you can grow the economy and protect and preserve the environment, as indicated with the work that has taken place in the Lake Tahoe area during the last 3 months. Lake Tahoe and the area around there is only 26 percent registered Democrats. But it was impossible to determine, these past 3 months, who was a Democrat and who was a Republican. Everyone joined together to recognize that this great lake is in trouble and that we all need to work together--a Democratic President and a Republican Congress. 
I hope, Mr. President, that the American people realize that we can work together, as indicated by the budget agreement that has been worked out around here these past few weeks, and that we can work together on difficult problems, not only environmental problems, but economic problems. 
So, I'm very happy that the President accepted my invitation to come to Lake Tahoe. I think that his coming there was a home run for the economy and the environment and government in general.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, if a litigant in the ninth circuit, which covers the areas that have already been spoken of, has a case heard before a Federal district judge or a bankruptcy court and they are displeased with how the case turns out, they have a right to appeal that case. Under the framework of the courts that we have now in this country, that is appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. 
That is what we are talking about here today--what happens when a case is appealed from a lower Federal court to the ninth circuit, which is an intermediary step before it goes to the U.S. Supreme Court. That is what we are talking about. It is extremely important if you are involved in the judicial process. There isn't a court that is more important than a circuit court, a Federal circuit court of appeals. 
We are very fortunate in the ninth circuit to have the chief judge of the ninth circuit, not only one of the distinguished jurists of this country but also a graduate of Stanford Law School with a great academic record, but, most important for this Senator, is a Nevadan, born in Nevada, went to school in Nevada until he got into law school. We didn't have a law school. 
I have spent a lot of time with Judge Hug learning about the ninth circuit. I would ask the Members of this body to reflect upon what the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee said. The ninth circuit is doing an excellent job. They are reducing caseload. In fact, even with nine vacancies, which the distinguished ranking member, the senior Senator from Vermont, established, the ninth circuit caseload is decreasing--not increasing, decreasing. They have increased their termination of cases by almost 1,000 from March 1996 to March 1997. They are doing a good job even though they are handicapped because the Senate won't confirm the vacancies that they now have. 
I, first of all, want to thank the distinguished Senator on the subcommittee, Senator Gregg, for taking into account my concerns about the split. I very much want this study to go forward, the amendment that is now before this body. But if it doesn't go forward, it is important that the State of Nevada recognize people--recognize, as the chairman of the subcommittee recognized, that the State of Nevada is now the most urban State in America. Ninety percent of the people live in the metropolitan areas of Reno and Las Vegas. We have tremendously difficult judicial problems. Frankly, the way the State has changed populationwise is we have a great deal in common with the more populated areas of America. 
We feel that it would be unfair to have the split any other way than it now is. There may be other and better ways to split this court. That is why this study is so important. That is why the U.S. Senate last year passed a study saying let's take a look at all the circuit courts before a decision is made as to how you are going to split the ninth circuit. We all have a feeling that the ninth circuit is large. It is larger than most all of the other circuits. But the fact of the matter is, how can we determine how it should be split under the terms that it is now being done; that is, before the Appropriations Committee? 
It is being done for reasons that are not legal in nature. They are political in nature. 
Judge Hug said, `By adding a circuit-split provision as a rider to an appropriations bill, it would completely bypass the Judiciary Committee and would seek to impose a new judicial structure on nine Western States and the Pacific territories without appropriate hearings, public comment, or independent research subsequent of such action.' 
Let's, in effect, have the experts take a look at what we should do. The House passed a compromise very comparable to what we did last year. The House passed a bill that says let's have the Chief Justice, the President of the United States, and the minority and majority leaders of the House and Senate pick people to serve on this 10-member commission and to report back to us in 18 months as to what should be done. 
I think it would even be better, while all of this is going on, to fill the nine vacancies in the ninth circuit. People are really concerned about the administration of justice. Let's have the majority move those people through this body as quickly as possible. 
The fifth circuit, the most recently split circuit, has only 1,000 fewer cases than the ninth circuit, and the eleventh circuit, the other half of the most recently split circuit, is the slowest circuit for filing the disposition. It is not the ninth circuit, even though we are hamstrung and are short a significant number of judges. If you look at the eleventh circuit, which has 1,000 fewer cases than the ninth circuit, it takes them longer to dispose of a case than the ninth circuit. 
So the ninth circuit should be commended for the good work they are doing with the limited resources they have. 
Mr. President, there are some who say, `Well, it is important that we do this because California takes up so much of the ninth circuit.' 
Another misstatement of fact: California doesn't do as much work in the ninth circuit as, for example, the second circuit. The second circuit, New York, has 86 percent of the filings; the ninth circuit, only has 55 percent. The fifth circuit takes up 72 percent of the filings; and the eleventh circuit, Florida, takes up 55 percent of the cases. 
So, Mr. President, California is not the glutton that people have alleged it to be. They don't take up as many of the case filings as other circuits. 
I would compare the qualifications of the ninth circuit judges--those appointed by Republican Presidents and those appointed by Democratic Presidents--with any other circuit. From the finest law schools in America are the judges who serve on the ninth circuit. Five of the senior judges in the ninth circuit were appointed by Republican Presidents; four by Democratic Presidents. 
There has been a lot of talk in this body about the Hruska Commission. The Hruska Commission said, in 1974, you should split the circuits. But let's listen to what the experts said about that. I have a letter here dated July 17, 1997, from Arthur Helman, Professor of Law at the University of Pittsburgh. I will read parts of this letter. This is written to the president of the California State Bar Association.  
Again, as the Deputy Executive Director of the Hruska Commission, and as a scholar who has studied the ninth circuit extensively during the intervening period, I am in as good a position as anyone to shed light on this matter. My conclusion is unequivocal. Such speculation is baseless. 
Mr. President, this isn't some lawyer from California or some professor from California or anyone in the ninth circuit. This is the professor in the School of Law at the University of Pittsburgh. 
My conclusion is unequivocal. Such speculation is baseless. The circumstances that led to the Hruska Commission are no longer present, and there is absolutely no reason to think that a new commission would endorse such a proposal. Let me be more specific. The Hruska Commission recommendation was driven primarily by a single factor. The commission believes that `no circuit should be created which would immediately require more than nine active judges.' That was a realistic possibility 25 years ago. Today it is not. In fact, of existing circuits, all but one have more than nine active judges. With the nine-judge circuit a relic of the past, a new commission would have no reason to recommend a division of California. A second consideration is also relevant. The Hruska Commission held hearings in the ninth circuit, and, although there was no consensus, several prominent California judges expressed support for the idea of dividing California between Federal judicial circuits. 
I know that sounds implausible, but that only underscores how much things have changed since the Hruska Commission carried out its work 25 years ago. Plainly, no such support would be forthcoming today without a record such as the one of the Hruska Commission and with overwhelming opposition from the California bar, no commission would recommend a division of California. For all these reasons the speculation you referred to is totally without foundation. Whatever recommendations the new commission might make, I am confident that dividing California into circuits will not be among them. 
Mr. President, in short, we should do the right thing. The right thing calls for having experts report back to us in a reasonable period of time. If they want to do it in a year, even though it would put a tremendous amount of work on them, I would accept that so that next year at this time we could take appropriate action. But to go forward the way we have done in the Appropriations Committee is bad. It is bad legislation and makes this body look bad, and it is bad legislation because it makes our judicial system look real bad. It has never ever happened before that we have divided a circuit court the way we are about to do it now. The lives of people depend on what we do today. Cases that are appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court come from these circuits. I suggest we follow the recommendation of the amendment that is now before this body.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today in support of a bill I introduced on Monday to designate the new Federal courthouse in Las Vegas as the `Lloyd D. George United States Courthouse.' As the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, Lloyd George is considered to be one of the most distinguished jurists of the federal judiciary. There is no greater honor we could bestow on the new courthouse in Las Vegas than to name it after a man who has served our Nation with such distinction. 
Those who have the privilege of knowing Judge George, as I do, consider him to be a man of great integrity whose career has been marked by a constant commitment to justice. As an attorney. Judge George enjoyed a successful career practicing primarily in the area of commercial law. Prior to his appointment as a United States District Judge in May 1984, Judge George served on the United States Bankruptcy Bench for 10 years. Judge George is a graduate of Las Vegas High and Brigham Young University. He served as the student body president at both schools. He received his law degree from the University of California, Boalt Hall. Judge George was a pilot in the U.S. Air Force, attaining the rank of Captain. 
Throughout Judge George's professional life he has assumed many leadership responsibilities requiring countless hours of service work all in the pursuit of improving and preserving the best aspects of our judicial system. He has served on three--and been the chairman of two--United States Judicial Conference Committee. Currently, he serves as a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States. At the request of Chief Justice Rehnquist he serves as a member of the Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference and the International Judicial Relations Committee. He is also a member of the Judicial Council for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and has chaired the Executive Committee of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth Circuit. Additionally, he serves on the Advisory Board of the Central and East European Law Initiative, American Bar Association's Standing Committee of World Order Under Law, and is an Advisory Committee Member of the American Judicature Society. He frequently lectures in the U.S. and abroad on various legal topics and has published a number of articles in legal periodicals. His dedication to improving and promoting our judicial system is unparalleled. 
All of us are fortunate to live in a country where men like Judge Lloyd George serve as the arbiter's of our laws. He is truly a man of the highest integrity whose legal career has been guided by a keen, almost innate, sense of justice. On a personal note, I consider myself most fortunate to call Lloyd George my friend. 
I believe there is no better way to honor Judge George than to name this new courthouse the Lloyd D. George United States Courthouse. The proposed courthouse is an architectural wonder that will provide a state of the art judicial forum for generations of Nevadans. Judge George was instrumental in bringing this about. We honor his service to the judiciary and his commitment to the principle of equal justice under law by naming the new courthouse after him.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, that is correct. First, I am deeply concerned that increased consumption of refined petroleum products for transportation will continue to climb and the quality of the air we breath will continue to deteriorate. Additionally, our reliance on foreign oil can only aggravate our trade imbalance as well as jeopardize our national security. 
Therefore, I felt it to be vitally important that we begin to move forward and establish, at least, one location to allow the Department of Energy the ability to begin the precommercialization of hydrogen technologies. And the Department should provide to the committee a plan for the furthering of this center at the Nevada test site in future years. Hopefully, their fiscal year 1999 request will mirror the authorization of $30 million contained in the Hydrogen Future Act in order to fully implement the center. Full funding at the authorized levels are the only way that we can begin to bring this technology to the marketplace. Furthermore, it is my hope that the administration will view our increased funding of the hydrogen research program as a clear indication that there is support for this technology in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, this bill is the only one of the 13 appropriations bills that every dollar that is in the bill is discretionary funding. It is extremely important, every dollar that we have in this bill, that it go to the right source or sources. As the ranking member of this subcommittee, I have worked very closely with the chairman of the subcommittee. He has been very open, invited me to meetings with Cabinet officers, and this has been a joint venture, this legislation, as well it should be. 
I know the chairman of the subcommittee worked very closely for many, many years with the then chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Bennett Johnston, and then when the roles reversed, they also worked very closely together. This is a bill that cries out for bipartisanship. It is a bill that affects very important aspects of this, our Federal Government. 
The bill can be supported by the entire Senate because we 
have approached it on this basis. It has been a difficult bill, but I think what we have arrived at is equitable and good public policy, despite very difficult circumstances. One of the difficulties the subcommittee faced is one that cannot be solved easily and that is the significance of these water projects around the Nation. The Corps of Engineers programs, both general investigations and construction, received balanced increases over last year's budget while the operation and maintenance aspect of their program was reduced by some $200 million. 
The budget for the Bureau of Reclamation, which for western Senators is extremely important because the Bureau of Reclamation is principally responsible for the arid States of the West, increased by $2 million over last year despite the budget proposal that would reduce the program account. The Bureau of Reclamation's first project ever in this country was in Nevada. In 1902 that program started, named after a Nevada Congressman named Newlands, who eventually became a Senator. So we are very familiar in Nevada with the good that the Bureau of Reclamation does and the bad they have done in years gone by. 
During the process of their developing programs in this country, some of the things they did simply have not worked out very well. But it was not because there was any ulterior motive. It was simply the arid West they were trying to make blossom like a rose. In some places they did, in some places they didn't. 
Water projects are often maligned as excessive and unnecessary items in appropriations bills. Being from probably the most arid State in the United States, I disagree. Water projects are extremely important. If it were not for water projects, the city of Las Vegas, the county of Clark, simply would not be the most rapidly growing area in the Union. It is because of water programs sponsored by the Federal Government that that area has been able to grow the way it has, because of the Southern Nevada Water Project, funded by this Congress. 
Our country has been described as a fortress nation with two large coasts and waterways throughout the continent playing a role in commerce, recreation and education as well as other functions. Communities around the Nation are directly affected by water projects that do, in fact, have Federal interests. I have given one example. I want this Senate to know that what we have done has taken a great deal of thought, the expertise of our very good staffs, and a lot of time. 
Starting with the largest water concern in the Nation, I would like to direct the Members' attention to a section of this bill dealing with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers program entitled `Flood Control, Mississippi River and Tributaries.' This is a so-called earmark. I guess we could call it that. A lot of people deride this earmark. This is for almost $300 million. 
We know the Mississippi River is the most important waterway in this country and has been for more than a century. The Mississippi River has the third largest drainage basin in the world, draining over 41 percent of the United States and covering 1,245,000 square miles. 
The $289 million we have appropriated is probably not enough, but it's the best we could do. The Mississippi River has flooded over the years, but due to the flood control levee system as put in place by the Corps of Engineers, over $8 billion in flood damages were averted in the 1993 flood alone. So, I think, by anyone's estimate, we should receive a passing grade on a cost/benefit scale. This is an earmark, a huge one, that is important. 
Let's take a smaller earmark, what some people direct their attention to, the extensive coastline America has and other smaller drainage basins and locations such as Assateague Island in Maryland. We have recognized the importance of Assateague Island in Maryland, and since 1935, when a Federal navigation project was first started and disrupted natural sand distribution, the shoreline has been eroding. There is now a severe threat of unnatural erosion and accelerated shoreline migration. We have appropriated money in this bill to stop this damage from occurring. Because, if the damage occurred without Federal intervention, the bays, commercial routes, the recreational island and the mainland would be irreparably damaged. 
This is an earmark. It is important for one of the States of the Nation, and we have stepped forward and the Corps of Engineers has developed a comprehensive water resources investigation in this area, and we will complete the preconstruction engineer design recommendations for this project. This is important. 
There are numerous other projects just like this. Let me talk, though, about a number that are important, I think, in this bill. Because water is a precious commodity in the West, as I have already talked about, the use and study of water impacts every community. Water reclamation and desalinization projects, authorized in the last Congress, are of vital importance to lower Colorado River communities, the Columbia-Snake 
River area and to rural communities. 
We know that desalinization is important. Senator Paul Simon, who has recently retired, believed in this significantly. He asked me to make sure that we did not forget about the things that he tried to do in this Congress. I think we have done that in this bill. Desalinization is important. It is more than finding out if we can change the ocean water to fresh water. It is dealing with rivers that have become very polluted and have too much salt in them. So, this is important. 
We have done things dealing with desalinization in this bill. Of particular note in this legislation, the importance of funding for the CALFED Bay Delta Ecosystem Restoration Project, another earmark, $50 million, which is to assist California to understand the water systems and developing a balance to the uses of the vast California water system. 
But the State of California has stepped forward. They have a multiyear funding program that they are going to work on with us. Theirs is almost $1 billion, the voters of the State of California approved. We have an obligation to come forward, I believe, as does this committee, and help them with this project. So I appreciate the concerns expressed in the report language about the CALFED Project. I think the concerns are fair and constructive, and I hope the Bureau and many proponents recognize the necessity to design this project and activities so we can feel confident in the use of taxpayers' moneys. There is no mistake, this is important to California. I support the committee in their efforts to fund this. 
I have mentioned four or five projects in this bill. There are some who come and say, `Why do you earmark these?' We earmark them because that's our obligation. We have three separate but equal branches of Government. I think we would be foolhardy and it would not make our Founding Fathers smile if we just accepted everything that the administration wanted. We have our own voice, our own concerns, and they are expressed in this bill. 
I support the subcommittee in the work that has been done dealing with renewable projects. The chairman of the subcommittee has talked about some of them, but I want to repeat, we have an almost $15 million increase in this bill for solar energy--for solar energy. We have a $4 million increase for hydrogen energy development. We have almost $6 million for wind energy development. And we have geothermal energy development at a slight increase. Alternative fuels are the answer to the problem in the world to come in the United States. We have recognized that. 
I would have liked to give solar much, much more and hydrogen and wind and geothermal. 
But we have increased these in spite of a budget that is very spartan in nature. 
Before we go to the energy side of the bill, I would like to say, considering the many demands on the Corps and the Bureau, nobody received all the moneys they wanted or requested, but we tried to be evenhanded about the projects, as well as taking into consideration the position of the agencies themselves. 
The nondefense programs in the Department of Energy were also stretched due to the outlays and allocations, as well as the demands of the activities. 
The work at Yucca Mountain is continuing. I don't like Yucca Mountain. I wish it weren't there. But I felt in fairness and being a constructive member of this committee that we should continue the funding. I think, though, for example, the latest work they did there, building a 4 1/2 -mile tunnel through a mountain which cost $60,000 a foot, the subcommittee was very responsive in setting the workload that should take place with this facility at Yucca Mountain. 
The budget authority and outlays do not provide for the entire privatization effort but does support continued waste management and cleanup at a level that will maintain a scheduled cleanup of sites that have served the Nation in the past and now should be taken care of. 
The atomic energy defense activities of this bill is, I feel, a grave and momentous responsibility, and the chairman of the subcommittee and I have recognized that. We may talk of these amounts as dollars, but we recognize that literally the work we do here is the difference between having a safe and reliable nuclear arsenal and one that is more prone to accidental problems. We understand how important this is. 
So, Mr. President, this appropriations bill is important, because it provides a transition between a world in which we tested nuclear devices--we tested almost 1,000 nuclear devices at the Nevada test site. That program is over with, we hope. We hope that nothing occurs that the President will have to exercise his emergency powers to again start nuclear testing at the test site. What this bill has done is take into consideration that for 50 years of brinkmanship, we can now look at a world that is relatively safe. With these tens of thousands of nuclear warheads, we have to make sure that they are, I repeat, safe and reliable, and we have taken that into consideration with this legislation that is now before the Senate. 
The world still provides no safe haven from international conflict, and some of our potential enemies remain armed with the most destructive weapons in mankind's history. So we must remain ready and capable of responding to many threats from those or other weapons of mass destruction, not because we want or should wage war with these demonic weapons, but because we want to wage peace by deterring their use by any government forever. 
If we could put the nuclear genie back in the bottle, we would do it. But I am sure of one thing, and that is the nuclear threat still exists and will continue for an indefinite period. Experience has shown the best response to this threat is to remain so capable that no government will ever perceive any advantage from a nuclear attack. So we must retain indefinitely a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile. 
Although we must remain ready, we want to reduce the incentive for other countries to increase their arsenals. We want to stop the unending spiral of development of increasingly dangerous weapons by those nations that already have nuclear arsenals. I think this legislation does that. 
This country has advocated, through the President, a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to stop that developmental spiral and remove that incentive. 
So now, for the foreseeable future, our country must maintain its nuclear deterrent in a completely different way compared to past practice and experience. No longer can we test new designs for their safety and reliability. No longer can we test new designs of weapons, we can only test weapons for safety and reliability. That is important. 
No longer can we assure stockpile safety and reliability by replacing old designs and weapons with new ones. We must get along with what we have, and we have to make sure they are safe and reliable. We must rely on present designs and weapons in the stockpile, so we have to develop the understanding of how age will affect their safety and reliability, and we must acquire this knowledge while testing the weapons and designs. 
The Department of Energy, in consultation with its National Weapons Laboratories and with the Department of Defense, has concluded that the only assured way of certifying an aging stockpile without testing in the traditional fashion is to understand the science of weapons materials, components and systems, and, with that understanding, to use computer-based simulator performance to evaluate safety and reliability, and that is what this legislation which is now before the Senate does. 
This so-called Science Based Stockpile Stewardship Program 
has been reviewed completely by experts from inside and outside the program and experts both inside and outside the Government. These experts have conditionally agreed the science-based program can succeed. It can succeed provided appropriate investments are made in scientific research, in experimental facilities and in advance computational capabilities. These conditions are faithfully reflected by the atomic defense activities budget and in the energy and water development appropriations bill. 
When this program was originally conceived, its budget dimensions were estimated under a variety of assumptions, some of which have not been realized. For example, it was assumed that START II ratification by Russia would have been achieved. It hasn't. Failure to ratify START II has required greater investments in weapons surveillance and maintenance, causing unexpected costs for both the national laboratories and the plants. 
In addition, more weapons in the stockpile has accelerated the required schedule for tritium production which is one of the elements in a weapon that lasts a little over 10 years and must thereafter be replaced. So we must periodically look at this product in our active stockpile. 
Guaranteeing tritium production capability on this new schedule has required simultaneous exploration of two research options, neither of which is cheap. Furthermore, the greater maintenance load on our plants has delayed our planned progress toward downsizing and has required investments in plant infrastructure that we did not anticipate. 
Finally, reductions in administration costs by the Department of Energy has not been realized as quickly as expected. 
The future will be defined by progress toward ratification and implementation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and it depends critically on our confidence and reliability and safety of our enduring strategic nuclear stockpile. 
A principal discussion that has taken place is the role of the stockpile stewardship and the science activities that need to occur to maintain a certified state of readiness. Because we studied these defense issues closely, this subcommittee has provided sufficient funding for the national ignition facility as a cornerstone of the science-based stewardship, and we integrated the Nevada test site and national laboratories in the defense program to assure a certifiable stockpile. 
Mr. President, I wish it were possible for every Member of the U.S. Senate to take a tour through our national laboratories to find out how essential they are to the literal safety of this world. They do tremendous work with little fanfare. I have become a real fan of our national laboratories. 
This bill is fair and reasonable. I support the efforts of this bill to seek more efficiency within the Department of Energy.

Mr. REID. For example, at Lawrence Livermore, I spent some time with a Dr. Campbell, who is one of the leading experts in the world on lasers. Lasers were invented in 1917 by Albert Einstein. It took scientists 43 years, and it was finally proven at Lawrence Livermore that he was right, that the formula he came up with in 1917 dealing with laser technology, that he really knew what he was talking about. 
But for the work done in our laboratories, things like this, they may have come to be, but it would have been years in the future. If you talk about great scientific minds in the last 50 years, they have all worked in these laboratories.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arkansas that I think he has rendered service to the Senate and this country by coming here today and allowing us to speak about something that the manager of the bill and I feel is the most important obligation we have, and that is to make sure that our nuclear deterrent is safe and reliable. There is no better spokesperson for that than the senior Senator from Arkansas, who not only has, over his many years in the Senate, been concerned about the weapons system of this country, but also, I say, with the greatest respect, his wife Betty Bumpers has worldwide fame as a result of the organization she formed called Peace Links and has been involved for many, many years in making our world a more peaceful place. So I think it is very appropriate that the Senator would come and talk about this issue today. 
I say to my friend from Arkansas that the appropriations for atomic energy defense activities aren't driven by any parochial interests or State interests. These appropriations are driven by the program requirements to provide for the national and strategic security of our country. 
Mr. President, we have the stockpile. We are going to have it for the foreseeable future. We must continually study it and assess it for safety and reliability. The Senator from Arkansas said in his statement that when the moratorium came on underground nuclear testing, as we have known in the past, that he anticipated there would be other ways of testing. That is absolutely right. The scientists have come up with other ways than the underground testing that we had for so many years. 
The first such test was conducted in Nevada just a few weeks ago. It was called a sub-critical test. It is just as stated. They start conducting an experiment using nuclear materials, but the experiment is controlled so that a critical mass is never achieved. That means that no significant nuclear reaction, no nuclear chain reaction can occur. 
That is what Senator Domenici was talking about. The computers take over. There is no explosion, but they are able to determine, through the computers, what would have happened had the test gone critical. And the first test was extremely successful. They had 140 optical channels to acquire data from the experiment, and they were able to get information from 139 of those. 
The reason those tests are important, I say to my friend from Arkansas, is we have to manage the stockpile because it is continually changing as it gets older. We have to look at some of the nuclear materials that decay with time and need periodic replacement. Some of the bonding materials that hold the components together, or in place, change chemically over time and become less effective as bonding agents. Some of the products of chemical change inside the weapon are caustic and attack or corrode other materials and components. It's like when you go to a drugstore and you go to the pharmacist and you order a medication. Right now, many of the big drugstore chains are able to determine if you are taking other medication that might interact with the stuff that you are getting from the drugstore. Well, the same basic function is performed here. We need to know what happens when these chemicals react because this is one of the main aging effects that might make the weapon unsafe or unreliable. 
Some materials corrode from other effects, including exposure to the atmosphere and to radioactivity that is unavoidable in these kinds of terrible weapons of destruction. 
So the safety and reliability of the stockpile will change with time. Deterrence requires that we understand these processes and their consequences far better now because the stockpile will never again be tested under the new international agreements we have sponsored. 
When I first came to the House of Representatives, one of the first votes I cast was a very controversial vote for the Congressman from the State of Nevada, and that was regarding the nuclear freeze. I voted for that nuclear freeze when I was in the House of Representatives because I believe the problem in the world today is not nuclear testing, it's nuclear weapons; we have too many of them. The manager and I have worked on a way of reasonably testing these weapons. I refer the Senator from Arkansas, and everybody within the sound of my voice, to the report filed with this bill. I am not going to read all of the language in the report, but I am going to read a few things because I think it answers many of the questions that the Senator propounded.  
The second paragraph:  
The mission of defense programs is to maintain the safety, security, and reliability of the Nation's enduring nuclear weapons stockpile within the constraints of a comprehensive test ban, utilizing a science-based approach-- 
I repeat that: `a science-based approach' --to stockpile stewardship and management in a smaller, more efficient weapons complex infrastructure. The future weapons complex will rely on scientific understanding and expert judgment, rather than on underground nuclear testing and the development of new weapons, [We are not going to rely on that anymore] to predict, identify, and correct problems affecting the safety and reliability of the stockpile. Enhanced environmental capabilities, and new tools in computation, surveillance, and advanced manufacturing will become necessary to certify weapon safety performance and reliability without underground nuclear testing. 
That is what this money is for: 
Weapons will be maintained, modified, retired, and dismantled as needed to meet arms control objectives or remediate potential safety and reliability issues. As new tools are developed and validated, they will be incorporated into a smaller, more flexible and agile weapons complex infrastructure for the future. 
I think the Senator will agree that is a great goal for us to obtain: 
The Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program is a single, highly integrated technical program for maintaining the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile in an era without underground nuclear testing and without new nuclear weapons development . . . 
Skipping on, I say to my friend from Arkansas: 
There are three primary goals of the Stockpile Stewardship Management Program:

Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the chairman will yield. In response to the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator from New Mexico, these water projects are important because they save lives. Some of them are important--we tend to think that when they are written in the newspaper, they are projects that just look good at home and these are things people talk about as being pork. The fact of the matter is that we have projects in Nevada that have saved people's lives as a result of having them in the project. They have saved immense dollars in property that would have washed away. Even in an arid State like Nevada we have floods. They are not sustained floods like you have in other parts of the country, they are flash floods; but they can be very damaging to property and to people. 
So I commend the Senator from Mississippi in focusing attention on these very important projects. The Senator from New Mexico and I have had to deal with these for the last 7 or 8 months. It is very difficult to decide which ones should get money and how much they should get. Every one of them--I should not say every one--the vast majority of them are extremely important, and it is too bad we can't fund them all because it would be good for the country.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say with the greatest respect to my friend, who I consider one of the fine Members of this body, that we have worked very hard to make sure that there aren't some nameless, faceless bureaucrats making all of the decisions for this $21 billion of discretionary spending in this bill. The separation of powers gives us not only that right but that obligation. We have an obligation to maintain the power of the purse strings. That is what the legislative branch of Government was devised to do when the Framers of this Constitution established the Constitution. 
Projects that are in this bill serve people, communities, and States. I say that I think it is really unfair to this body, to the taxpayers of this country, and to the people of the State of Arizona to say that those things that we have earmarked here are wasteful, pork-barrel projects. 
For example, we have investigations going on with the Corps of Engineers in the State of Arizona that deal with significant projects. We have colonias along the United States-Mexican border, Arizona, and Texas. There we are spending $100,000. Corps of Engineers: Gila River, North Scottsdale, AZ, $400,000; Gila River, Santa Cruz River Basin, AZ, $400,000; Rio De Flag, Flagstaff, AZ, $325,000; Rio Salado Watershed Ecosystem, AZ, $550,000; Tres Rios, AZ, $400,000; Tucson Drainage Area, AZ, $825,000. 
We have for operations and maintenance, Corps of Engineers: Alamo Lake, AZ, $1.55 million for inspection of completed works, Arizona, $107,000; Painted Rock Dam, AZ, $2.293 million; scheduling reservoir operations, Arizona, $22,000; Whitlow Ranch Dam, AZ, $199,000. 
Mr. President, I think it is important that we made those decisions rather than some bureaucrat who the people of Arizona will never see, who would remain in an office back here someplace in Washington next to some computer rather than a human being. We made that decision along with many hundreds of thousands of hours of work by our staff. 
I will not go into a lot more detail other than to say that appropriations for the Bureau of Reclamation is done very similarly. We have made decisions in this bill that were important to the people of the State of Arizona. 
Yuma Area project is provided $1.67 million in this bill; West Salt River Valley, water management study, $475,000; Verde River Basin management study, Bureau of Reclamation, $475,000. 
I could go on for several more minutes reading off the things that this committee did in relation to the State of Arizona which were important decisions that we made. I think it is important that we make them. Again, I repeat, better that we make these decisions than some nameless, faceless bureaucrat who wouldn't even know where the State of Arizona is. The States of New Mexico and Nevada border on the State of Arizona. We feel an obligation to distribute this money in a way that we feel is fair. 
So I have great respect for my friend from the State of Arizona, but on this issue I think he is wrong.

Mr. REID. I am sorry the Senator from Arizona had to come back. Certainly as indicated on the Record, I only had positive things to say about the Senator from Arizona. 
I do say--and he and I have a disagreement on how bills like this should come to be--I believe that we as a legislative branch of Government have an obligation to make independent decisions separate and apart from the administration. I do not feel I have any obligation to follow what the bureaucrats say we should appropriate. 
The Senator from Arizona and I came to the Congress together. I have the greatest admiration for him, not only for what he has done in his professional life as a Member of Congress but, of course, what he did before he came here. 
So it has nothing to do with how I feel about the Senator from Arizona. It has to do with the basic difference in what I feel is an obligation a Member of Congress has. It is a legitimate difference. It has nothing to do on a personal basis, and I will continue to work as hard as I can with the Senator on campaign finance reform and also to fund projects for the State of Arizona as a member of this subcommittee, as long as I am ranking member, in a fair and impartial way, getting direction from the bureaucrats but not following necessarily what they have to say.

Mr. REID. Several years ago, I and a number of my colleagues took a trip. One of the places we went to was Angola. It was a beautiful country. It is a country that has been devastated by war. We did not see the wild animals roaming the plains as they did at one time. We did not see the oil fields pumping as well as they should have. What we did see were hundreds of people who had been injured by landmines. Their legs were gone, their arms were gone. We, of course, did not see the people who were killed on a daily basis in Angola from landmines. 
If Angola were the only place in the world that had been devastated by landmines, perhaps we should not take the time of this body by looking at it. But Angola is important, and where the antipersonnel landmines have ravaged the countryside, we in this body must be concerned. 
I rise today, having introduced an amendment to accelerate the removal of millions of abandoned antipersonnel landmines. This is just one more important step in the long and difficult job of stopping forever the killing and maiming of innocent men, women and children, by these useless relics of warfare and terrorism. 
Mr. President, I am appreciative of the work that has been done by Senator Pat Leahy on bringing to our attention the devastating problem of abandoned landmines. He has fought long and hard and spoken out on this issue, and I appreciate that. He has a long-time commitment to terminating this threat to innocent noncombatants. The whole world, and especially the developing world, owes Senator Leahy thanks for his leadership in forever banning these instruments of war. 
These landmines have limited military utility, with primary value found in the terror and timidity they incite in the enemy infantry. Modern military battles, though, are not won by the infantry. Victory may very well be sealed by the infantry, but the battle is won by the air, by the artillery and by the armored mechanized forces. 
My amendment responds to a terribly tragic situation in which an unnecessary weapon remains long after battle, and wreaks its terror and its death and destruction on innocent civilians. 
Mr. President, I am going to recite some statistics that are unbelievable, for lack of a better description. 
It is estimated that there are more than 100 million of these landmines buried and abandoned in 64 different countries. That is one landmine for every 50 people on this Earth. I have talked about Angola. The Angolan war lasted for much more than a decade. The country of Angola has 10 million people in it, but buried in the dirt in Angola are more than 20 million landmines, 2 landmines for every person in Angola. 
They are buried, they are unexploded, they are unrecovered, and they are waiting for women and children, principally, to step on them. Why women and children? Because the women are often the ones to work the fields and the children are the ones that often unknowingly stray into the abandoned minefields. 
In Angola, 120 people die every month from landmines. Four people a day in Angola are killed. This does not take into consideration the scores, the hundreds of people that I saw in Angola missing legs and arms. 
Every month in Cambodia, 300 Cambodians are casualties--10 casualties each and every day. 
Afghanistan, Mozambique, Croatia, Bosnia, Vietnam--in all these countries, and more, the toll mounts. 
We were in Bosnia a year or so ago. While we were there a call came over the commander's radio, a call reporting a landmine casualty. It was a Russian who had had a leg blown off by a landmine. These are occurrences that happen all the time. 
In the world, we have about 70 casualties a day, 500 each week, 30,000 a year. These casualties are unnecessary, and without action on our part--we cannot leave it to anyone else--they are going to continue to be unavoidable. 
Most of those killed and injured have not done anything but try to farm, walk to school, walk to the market, walk to a hospital, take a shortcut home. Some of the children are just playing in the fields around their homes. But, on this day, playing around their homes, their farms or their schools, a landmine goes off, killing or maiming the child. 
Think of it, Mr. President, every day not knowing whether any particular step you take is going to wind up in death or losing a limb or limbs. People should not have to live that way. 
We, as the most powerful Nation in the world, have an obligation, I believe, with the great scientific minds we have in this country, to figure out a way to better detect those mines and to remove them. 
Estimates from a year ago projected that about 100,000 landmines were being removed each year while about 2.5 million mines were being placed in the Earth each year. So what does this mean? Humanity, zero; landmines, 2.4 million every year. That is no contest. 
Like most problems, the abandoned landmine problem is rooted in economics. How much does it cost to remove a landmine? Lots of money, up to $1,000 a landmine. How much does it cost to place a landmine in the ground? A couple bucks. That is all. 
The recovery costs go up dramatically when the mine field maps are lost or purposely destroyed or become so old as to engender no confidence in the minds of the recovery crews. 
If we do not outlaw antipersonnel landmines, the economics guarantees proliferation of this barbaric practice. The economics of mine warfare guarantee more death and maiming and destruction unless these devices are forever outlawed and stockpiles around the world are quickly destroyed. 
But the world community might not outlaw antipersonnel landmines because they are so cheap and easy to use. I say that antipersonnel landmines have no place in a civilized world. We must stop the distribution of these implements of terror that spread permanent disability, disfigurement, and death wherever they have been used. 
There is pending in the Senate a bill to permanently ban the use of antipersonnel landmines. 
I support that legislation, as do 58 other Senators. This is the legislation that has been led by Senator Leahy. 
But even if the Senate supports this ban, others in the world community may not. The best and most effective way of banning landmines is to make them useless by making their discovery cheap and easy and by developing faster and cheaper ways of clearing landmines. This would be both a humanitarian advance and a lifesaving action for our troops on combat missions. 
To do this successfully we must better develop capabilities to locate buried landmines, and then we need to develop new and more effective ways to clear them. 
A few months ago, Mr. President, I made a tour of the lab at Livermore in California, one of our national laboratories. I said to them, how much money are we spending to find a way to remove these landmines? They said about $100,000 a year. 
We can do better than that. 
The magnitude of this task is significant. If one man could locate and recover one landmine every hour, that would be eight devices per 8-hour day per man in the field. Today's technology, of course, does not allow us to do it anywhere near as quickly as that. But even at that rate, which we cannot achieve today, it would take 1,000 men working 7 days a week, 24 hours a day, 34 years to remove the landmines that are now buried. But remember, we are putting in about 2.4 million extra ones each year. 
There are a lot of ideas out there of what we can do. We need to focus on developing and deploying landmine remediation systems while continuing the research that promises better capability in the future. 
An area of the Nevada test site has been equipped and used by our national laboratories for testing new ways of landmine detection and location. For example, at the Nevada test site, which was used for underground nuclear explosions and aboveground nuclear explosions, we can test these in many different ways. Systems were tested that permitted remote locations of buried landmines under favorable conditions. But much improvement is needed because conditions are almost never favorable. 
We will shortly begin testing a new concept that promises a better performance, and has the added value of detecting nonmetallic landmines, because the people who develop these weapons of destruction have gone a step further. They are no longer metal, they are plastic. This new concept allows detection and discrimination of buried objects at much greater depths. But we need to do something to develop the technique. 
As progress is made in landmine detection and location, we need to develop and test better ways of landmine recovery and destruction. We can do that. That is what this amendment is all about. There is plenty of talent, scientifically, to do it. We just need the support for infrastructure, personnel, equipment, and field work to do something about it. 
I say, again, antipersonnel landmines have no place in the future of civilized nations. We need to get on with developing better capability to remove these devices that are already deployed. Cheaper and faster landmine clearing will protect both innocent civilians and our combat troops and it will remove much of the incentive to spread more of these terrible instruments of terror, injury, death, and destruction. 
The amendment I have submitted today will permit our national laboratories to use their superb talents for accelerated development of landmine detection and clearing technologies. The report language for the National Defense Authorization Act includes direction to the Department of Defense to establish more effective collaboration with the weapons laboratories of the Department of Energy. 
This amendment is consistent with that direction. It will apply an existing national resource to this important mission and it will facilitate the development and testing of a new technology that promises mine detection performance well beyond that of any existing capability. This amendment will make antipersonnel 
landmines useless by cheap and easy detection, localization, and removal. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

If we look down the road to making this process better, we are not going to improve it by adding hours; we are going to improve it by making sure that amendments are offered before we finish the debate. If we have 50 hours, people are still going to offer all of these amendments at the end, if you have a loophole like this. I look forward to improving the system, but that we do it in whatever hours we have, and amendments should be offered during that time.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the chairman of the Energy and Water Committee entered into the Record this evening a news article that was printed earlier this year in the Wall Street Journal. The news article says a great deal about the debate that is taking place here tonight. 
We can talk about all the jobs that mining produces--and there are over 100,000 of them in the United States alone--we can talk about all the direct and indirect income that it generates for States, but the most important thing that I think brings this in proper perspective is to look at what is happening to mining today. 
`Gold-Mining Firms Act to Meet Price-Slump Challenge.' 
The price of gold has dropped precipitously. The price of gold is low. As indicated in this article, `[Mining Companies] Reduce Costs, Scratch New Mines, With No Quick Relief in Sight.' 
The article says, among other things: 
Mining companies are slashing costs and tearing up plans for new mines as the price of the precious metal continues to slide to three-year lows. . .[the prices] plunged to $353.40 an ounce . . . The skidding price is enough to turn many high-cost mines into money-losing duds and spoils the economics of many planned projects. 
Dennis Wheeler, chairman and chief executive officer of Coeur D'Alene Mines, which is headquartered in Coeur D'Alene, ID, says, `No question, * * * you will see fewer new gold mines.' 
This is a quote from this article. 
Gold prices have been pushed downward by slumping investment demand and the fear of increasing supplies from central banks. 
At [least] five of the 22 largest U.S. mines, cash costs to produce gold are at or above $347.30 an ounce. . . 
What this means, Mr. President, is that the cost of gold is not enough to meet the costs of producing the gold. That is why in Nevada you have seen companies laying off people. That is why you have seen mines going out of business. At this stage they have been the small operations, but the big ones are going to come unless something happens to raise the price of gold or to cut costs, or both. 
Coeur D'Alene Mines has recently laid off 4% of its staff, halted all charitable donations, and [as Mr. Wheeler said] . . . `We anticipate more challenging times ahead.' 
And that, Mr. President, is an understatement. 
Pegasus Gold is a substantial company based in Spokane, WA. They have operations in the State of Nevada. They mine over 
half a million ounces of gold a year. But they have taken steps to survive in the new lower price range, or trying to survive. 
The company recently announced it would reduce its exploration budget by about 20%, freeze senior-management salaries and delay construction on new gold projects in Montana . . . 
Echo Bay Mines, a Denver-based company has operations in the State of Nevada, among other places. Lower gold prices have also hurt Echo Bay, causing its gold reserves to go down. 
The company recently took a charge of $77 million after ripping up plans to develop its big Alaska gold project [in] Alaska-Juneau . . . 
Now, I say, Mr. President, this is only a little example. So $77 million they spent before they turned a single spade of dirt. 
A little operation outside the town of Searchlight, NV, where I was born, still maintain my residence--that operation took about $100 million before they could do any mining. It is a relatively small operation. 
Echo Bay: 
. . . also canceled common-share dividend payments to conserve cash after a string of quarterly losses. 
Many, many gold companies are suffering the same fate as the few of these that I have referred to out of this article. 
Gold mining companies are having real difficulty. As has been indicated already on the floor, the General Accounting Office has indicated that gold companies now--the mining industry now--is paying about a 32 percent effective tax rate. Now, if this goes up, as indicated by my friend from Idaho, they will be out of business in a large scale. 
This amendment, Mr. President, would create an administrative nightmare for the Department of the Interior. For example, the origin of the claims and lands currently being mined, they could not be tracked, or if they could it would be extremely difficult. Often these claims have been owned and conveyed at arm's-length transactions. 
How do you go back and effectuate this depletion allowance that he wants to dispose of? Many properties are obtained through a variety of ways other than the 1872 mining law. Remember, they have been mining in the State of Nevada since the 1840's. Many claims were filed prior to the 1872 mining law. 
Mining companies often put together their operation from private property acquired through laws, both State and Federal. 
How would we keep track of ore on a property that has several different property origins? The depletion allowance would apply to a shovel of ore for one location but not to a shovel of ore identical to that just 10 feet away. 
In principle, there is little difference between allowing mineral producers a depletion allowance and allowing a manufacturer to depreciate a plant and equipment. 
In the process of manufacturing, the manufacture's equipment requires replacement. 
Therefore, a depletion allowance for mineral producers a simply levels the playing field between these classes of taxpayers. 
Again this amendment unfairly targets the western mining industry. 
This amendment is an attempt to do mining law reform, and this is not the place or time for such an effort. 
If this Congress wants to rewrite the current mining law then it should begin in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, not on the Senate floor tonight. 
The Bumpers amendment proposes to eliminate the percentage depletion for non-fuel minerals. 
This amendment to eliminate Percentage Depletion is an ill-conceived and ill-advised attempt to circumvent congressional efforts to reform current mining law.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a disturbing trend in this country, a trend that to me was highlighted by a recent incident in South Carolina. 
This incident took place several weeks ago. I was aware of it at the time it occurred. It has been something that has been troubling to me since then, and I felt it was appropriate and important that we spread on the Record of this Senate this particular incident, which occurred while the State Board of Education of the State of South Carolina was discussing whether it could display the Ten Commandments on the walls of public schools. 
During this discussion, a member of this board provided a 
suggestion for groups which might oppose the placing of the Ten Commandments upon school walls. A direct quote: `Screw the Buddhists and kill the Muslims.' 
Mr. President, I find it contemptible that such an arcane, bigoted statement would come from someone who is tasked with the responsibility of educating our children, a member of the board of education. 
I find it even more shocking that not only would someone think this, but that they would go so far as to articulate it at a meeting of a board of education. Can we imagine what would have been the reaction to such a comment had it been directed toward Christians or Jews, Mexican-Americans, African-Americans? I find this individual's behavior reprehensible, and while I find his behavior reprehensible, the larger issue is an increasing trend in this country toward racial, religious, and ethnic intolerance. 
The Founders of this country fled persecution and intolerance in Europe and came to this country to be free from persecution, mostly religious persecution. Our country was founded on the principle of equality, and our Constitution, Mr. President--this document--which consists of just a few pages ensures freedom of religion and freedom from persecution. 
In this country, we are very fortunate to have the freedoms that we have guaranteed by our Constitution. These freedoms make us the envy of the world and are the strength of our Nation. 
I, however, think that, even though we have many protected rights in our Constitution, we have to speak out against individuals and especially people who are on a board of education who say, `Screw the Buddhists and kill the Muslims.' 
Because of the liberties we have in our country, this great country of the United States of America, immigrants from all over the world desire to come here and start a new life, just as our ancestors did. As a result, we are becoming a much more diverse Nation, increasingly diverse. The diversity within our Nation requires greater tolerance, patience, and a deeper level of understanding. 
Mr. President, I am a member of a religion where, in the last century, significant persecution took place. People were killed as a result of their belief in the religion that I now profess. I feel that we all must speak out against religious intolerance. People who speak out about screwing the Buddhists and killing the Muslims--you know, Mr. President, in our country, sad as it might be, there are people who would follow the leadership of a person like this and proceed to do just that. 
The remarks made by this school board member reflect a deep-seated racial and religious intolerance and ignorance that we should not allow to go unnoticed. This racial ignorance and lack of understanding are catalysts to intense racial intolerance. 
I am concerned about the steady erosion of racial and religious tolerance in our society, and intolerance. Intolerance is often the basis for much of the crime committed in America, and it is the very essence of hate crimes. Hate crimes are those crimes committed against an individual or a group because of their convictions or their ethnicity. 
In 1995, the last records we have, the Justice Department cataloged nearly 8,000 hate crimes. Those are the only ones reported; many were unreported. This number is growing at an alarming rate. Hate crime is an affront to our basic commitment to religious liberty and racial tolerance, and it poses a challenge to our entire Nation and our future as a common community. 
The remarks made by this school board member are disturbing. They are indicative of an increasing racial and religious intolerance and serve only to incite maliciousness against Muslims, Buddhists, and non-Christians in general. This school board member's comments are illustrative of the need in this country for increased understanding and patience. It is also, Mr. President, I believe, a call for us to speak out against this intolerance. It is this understanding and patience that we need to have which provides the foundation for a more tolerant America. Tolerance and understanding are crucial for us to continue fostering quality, dignity, and peace within America. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I withhold for my friend from Wyoming.  
Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.

Mr. REID. Madam President, there are going to be high priority projects in the transportation bill that passes the Congress this year. 
As long as there has been a U.S. House of Representatives, there have always been demonstration projects. The House is showing no signs of giving them up this year. 
There is no chance that the House will pass a transportation bill without earmarks for individual Members' projects. 
Given that knowledge, do we, as the Members of the Senate, really want to unilaterally disarm? If there are going to be demonstration projects, are we merely going to defer to the House? 
Rather than slipping projects into the final bill during the conference, wouldn't it be better to have an open discussion of the relative merits of these projects in committee than on the floor? 
At least give the House credit for having a process. The House committee of jurisdiction required that a 14-point check list be filled out for each demonstration project this year. Only a very few projects from that list will be selected for funding. 
If the original ISTEA legislation is an indication, well under 10 percent of the final dollar amount will be earmarked for demonstration projects. The original ISTEA bill provided $6.5 billion for demonstration projects out of a total authorization of $155 billion. 
I dispute the Senator's notion that all demonstration projects are merely glorified pork. In my home State of Nevada, one of the fastest growing areas in the Nation, we have used earmarks to keep up with the explosion in transportation needs. 
The I-15/U.S. 95 Spaghetti Bowl Interchange in Las Vegas, one of the busiest interchanges in one of the fastest growing cities in the United States was built with earmarked funding far more quickly than if it needed to go through a traditional funding process. 
Nevada's capital, Carson City, remains one of a handful of State capitals in the United States that is not linked to the Interstate System. An earmark in the original ISTEA funded the first leg of this critical link.

Mr. REID. There will be demonstration projects in the transportation bill that passes Congress this year. As long as there has been a House of Representatives and we have had highways, there have been demonstration projects. The House is showing no signs of giving them up this year. There is no chance --no chance--that the House will pass a transportation bill without earmarks for individual Member projects. 
Given that knowledge, do we, as Members of the Senate, really want to unilaterally disarm? There are going to be demonstration projects, which there will be. Are we merely going to defer to the House? Wouldn't it be better, rather than slipping projects into the final bill going to conference, that we have an open discussion of the merits here on the floor? 
At least the House--we should give them credit for having a process. The House committee of jurisdiction required that a 14-point checklist be filled out for each demonstration project this year. If you do not meet all 14, you do not get your project. 
Only a few projects from the list will be selected for this funding. In the original ISTEA legislation, under 10 percent of the projects had earmarks. So $6.5 billion for demonstration projects out of the total authorization of about $160 billion. 
I dispute the notion of the Senator from Arizona that all demonstration projects are glorified pork. That is not true in rapidly growing areas. It is very important to the State of Nevada. We should oppose this amendment.

Mr. REID. I want to thank the Senator from California for bringing this issue to my attention. Indeed, I believe the Bay-Delta program serves as a national model on how we can bring environmental, agribusiness, and other water users to the same table with the goal of preserving our natural resources for many uses. I see the program has having a particular benefit for our Western States. If California restores its environment and improves its water supply reliability, then we relieve the pressure on the Colorado River and lessen any tensions among the seven Colorado River States. When California restores migratory bird habitat and provides water for wildlife refuges, the health of the Pacific flyway will be improved, benefitting States from Arizona to Alaska. 
While the investments will be made in California, the benefits will be realized throughout the west. I look forward to working with the senator from California on the Bay-Delta project on the Appropriations Committee.

Mr. REID. Good morning Mr. President. I come to the floor today to offer two bills which are written to address the national shortage of geriatricians we are experiencing in this country. A problem I am sorry to say that is getting worse, not better. I am pleased to have as original cosponsors of my bills Senator Grassley, the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging and Senator Glenn, also a member of the Aging Committee, one for whom I have tremendous respect and regard. 
Our Nation is growing older. Today, life expectancy for women is 79, for men it is 73. While the population of the United States has tripled since 1900, the number of people age 65 or older has increased 11 times, to more than 33 million Americans. By 2030, this group is projected to double in size to nearly 70 million. 
Mr. President, I first became concerned about this problem when a read a report issued by the Alliance for Aging Research in May of 1996 entitled, `Will you Still Treat Me When I'm 65?' The report concluded that there are only 6,784 primary-care physicians certified in geriatrics. This number represents less than one percent of the total of 684,414 doctors in the United States. The report goes on to state that the United States should have at least 20,000 physicians with geriatric training to provide appropriate care for the current population, and as many as 36,000 geriatricians by the year 2030 when there will be close to 70 million older Americans. 
The bills I am introducing today, the Medicare Physician Worforce Improvement Act of 1997 and the Geriatricians Loan Forgiveness Act of 1997, aim--in modest ways and at very modest cost--to encourage an increase in the number of trained doctors seniors of today and tomorrow will need, those with certified training in geriatrics. 
One provision of the Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act of 1997 will allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to double the payment made to teaching hospitals for geriatric fellows capping the double payment to be provided to a maximum of 400 fellows per year. This is intended to serve as an incentive to teaching hospitals to promote and recruit for geriatric fellows. 
Another provision directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to increase the number of certified geriatricians appropriately trained to provide the highest quality care to Medicare beneficiaries in the best and most sensible settings by establishing up to five geriatric medicine training consortia 
demonstration projects nationwide. In short, allow Medicare to pay for the training of doctors who serve geriatric patients in the settings where this care is so often delivered. Not only in hospitals, but also ambulatory care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, clinics, and day treatment centers. 
The second bill I am offering today, The Geriatricians Loan Forgiveness Act of 1997 has but one simple provision. That is to forgive $20,000 of education debt incurred by medical students for each year of advanced training required to obtain a certificate of added qualifications in geriatric medicine or psychiatry. My bill would count their fellowship time as obligated service under the National Health Corps Loan Repayment Program. 
Mr. President, the graduating medical school class of physicians in 1996 reported they had incurred debts of $75,000 on average. My bill will offer an incentive to physicians to pursue advanced training in geriatrics by forgiving a small portion of their debt. 
Last year Medicare paid out more than $6.5 billion to teaching hospitals and academic medical centers toward the costs of clinical training and experience needed by physicians after they graduate from medical school. It is ironic, only a tiny fraction of those Medicare dollars are directed to the training of physicians who focus mainly on the needs of the elderly. Of over 100,000 residency and fellowship positions that Medicare supports nationwide, only about 250 are in geriatric medicine and psychiatry programs. Existing slots in geriatric training programs oftentimes go unfilled. With 518 slots available in geriatric medicine and psychiatry in 1996, only 261, barely one-half of them were filled. 
By allowing doctors who pursue certification in geriatric medicine to become eligible for loan forgiveness, and by offering an incentive to teaching institutions to promote the availability of fellowships, and recruit geriatric fellows, my bills will provide a measure of incentive for top-notch physicians to pursue fellowship training in this vital area. 
We must do more to ensure quality medicine today for our seniors and it is certainly in our best interest to prepare for the future when the number of seniors will double. Geriatric medicine requires special and focused training. Too often, problems in older persons are misdiagnosed, overlooked, or dismissed as the normal result of aging because doctors are not trained to recognize how diseases and impairments might appear differently in the elderly than in younger patients. One need only look at undiagnosed clinical depression in seniors or the consequences of adverse reaction to medicines to see how vital this specialized training really is. This lack of knowledge comes with a cost, in lives lost, and in unnecessary hospitalizations and treatments. 
We need trained geriatricians to train new medical students. Of the 108 medical schools reporting for the 1994 to 1995 academic year, only 11 had a separate required course in 
geriatrics, 53 offered geriatrics as an elective, 96 included geriatrics as part of another required course and one reported not offering geriatrics coursework at all. Mr. President, this is simply not good enough. 
In a country where by 2030, 1 in 5 citizens will be over the age of 65, there are only two departments of geriatrics at academic medical centers across the entire country. Yet, every academic medical center has a Department of Pediatrics. This just does not seem to make sense to me. While certainly no one would argue the need for emphasis on pediatrics, there is no less of a need for emphasis on geriatrics as well. In England, it is my understanding that every academic medical center has a department of geriatrics. Do our friends in England know something we do not? 
Mr. President, we have here a perfect case where an ounce of prevention will be worth a pound of cure. While not every patient over 65 will need a geriatrician, in fact most will not, we need academicians and researchers to train the medical community about the field of geriatrics and we need primary care physicians to have access to trained geriatricians when a patient's case warrants it. As our oldest old population increases, the population growing the fastest and most appropriate for geriatric intervention, we must ensure that access to geriatricians becomes a reality. 
I believe the Medicare Physician Workforce Act of 1997 and the Geriatricians Loan Forgiveness Act of 1997 are steps in the right direction. While they will not solve the total problem, they do make a critical first step. 
Mr. President, I am grateful to the American Geriatrics Society for their assistance in working with my staff on this bill and I especially want to thank my cosponsors, Senators Grassley and Glenn, for their support and leadership on this issue.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today, with Senator Snowe, the Equity in Prescription and Contraception Coverage Act of 1997. I have said time and time again that if men suffered from the same illnesses as women, the biomedical research community would be much closer to eliminating diseases that strike women. I believe this is a similar type of issue. If men had to pay for contraceptive drugs and devices, the insurance industry would cover them. 
The health industry has done a poor job of responding to women's health needs. Women spend 68 percent more in out-of-pocket costs for health care than men. Reproductive health care services account for much of this difference. According to a study done by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, 49 percent of all large-group health care plans do not routinely cover any contraceptive method at all, and only 15 percent cover all five of the most common contraceptive methods. Women are forced to use disposable income to pay for family planning services not covered by their health insurance--the pill--one of the most common birth control methods, can cost cover $300 a year. Therefore, women who lack disposable income are forced to use less reliable methods of contraception and risk an unintended pregnancy. 
The legislation we introduce today would require insurers, HMO's, and employee health benefit plans that offer prescription drug benefits to cover contraceptive drugs and devices approved by the FDA. Further, it would require these insurers to cover outpatient contraceptive services if a plan covers other outpatient services. Lastly, it would prohibit the imposition of copays and deductibles for prescription contraceptives or outpatient services that are greater than those for other prescription drugs. 
Each year approximately 3,600,000 pregnancies, or 60 percent of all pregnancies, in this country are unintended. Of these unintended pregnancies, 44 percent end in abortion. Reliable family planning methods must be made available if we wish to reduce this disturbing number. Further, a reduction in unintended pregnancies will also lead to a reduction in infant mortality, low-birth weight, and maternal morbidity. In fact, the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality determined that `infant mortality could be reduced by 10 percent if all women not desiring pregnancy used contraception.' 
Ironically, abortion is routinely covered by 66 percent of indemnity plans, 67 percent of preferred provider organizations, and 70 percent of HMO's. Sterilization and tubal ligation are also routinely covered. It does not make sense financially for insurance companies to cover these more expensive services, rather than contraception. Studies indicate that for every dollar of public funds invested in family planning, $4 to $14 of public funds is saved in pregnancy and health care-related costs. According to one recent study in the American Journal of Public Health, by increasing the number of women who use oral contraceptives by 15 percent, health plans would accrue enough savings in pregnancy care costs to cover oral contraceptives for all users under the plan. 
It is vitally important to the health of our country that quality contraception is not beyond the financial reach of women. Providing access to contraception will bring down the unintended pregnancy rate, insure good reproductive health for women, and reduce the number of abortions. 
It is a significant step, in my opinion, to have support from both pro-life and pro-choice Senators for this bill. Prevention is the common ground on which we can all stand. Let's begin to attack the problem of unintended pregnancies at its root.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, last New Year's Day, the people of northern Nevada suffered from flood waters that were untoward. We had never experienced anything like the floods that occurred in five northern counties. The State of Nevada, as large as it is, has the seventh largest area, State-wise, including Alaska. It has 17 counties, very large counties, and five of those counties were severely damaged as a result of the flood--Washoe, Story, Douglas, Carson City and Lyon. I traveled over the area by car and helicopter. The picture that I saw is something I will never forget. The Carson, Walker, and Truckee Rivers, small as they are, when the floods came, were devastating. 
Now, Mr. President, the flooding that we suffered in Nevada was significant. But the flooding and the disaster that hit Nevada was relatively small, as bad as it was, compared to the magnitude of disaster that we have seen in the Dakotas. To say that the community of Grand Forks, ND, is changed forever is an understatement. I had the opportunity the other evening of meeting the mayor of Grand Forks, ND, Pat Owens, and I had heard from the Senators from North Dakota, Senators Conrad and Dorgan, and I have seen in the papers, watched on television, as we all have, the devastation that hit the Dakotas--lives lost, tens of thousands of people dislocated, many of whom will never get back in their homes, 156,000 cattle died; some of them died standing, frozen stiff. Almost 2 million acres of cropland were under water. North Dakota had more snow in a matter of weeks than it had in the previous 3 years. Total damages are still being added up, but it will be nearly $2 billion in that State, which has a little over 500,000 people in it. Neighborhoods were destroyed by fire. 
Mr. President, we have had significant damage all over these United States this past year. That is what this bill is about--the damage caused by the floods in northern Nevada, by the floods caused by the Red River, which I understand runs normally at about 50 yards wide and now, in areas, is as much as 40 miles wide. That is what this bill is all about. It should not be about extraneous matters. That is the reason I am so committed to the amendment that has been offered and is pending. 
We know that the Government was shut down. We know that those of us on this side of the aisle had nothing to do with shutting down the Government. We know the American people rose up against the shutting down of this Government. I think it is commendable that people are concerned about never shutting down the Government again, and I agree with that concept. I hope we never shut the Government down again. But this legislation is not the vehicle to do that. We need to go on with this legislation, this disaster relief, this emergency legislation. There are important matters in this. 
In Hawaii, at the Lualualei Naval Station, there was flooding and mudslides, and tremendous winds have ripped this naval station to pieces. We need these moneys to go there, as have been committed. There is $45 million which will go to emergency infrastructure grants to repair water and sewer lines. These are fundamental to any community struck by these devastating floods. Only $4 million--a relatively small amount, as large as this bill is--will go for rural housing assistance programs to help the elderly with emergency repair of the housing. That is a priority. We should be doing that and not having continuing resolutions and other such matters in this legislation. 
The principal nonemergency item is the one that we are now 
here having struck. We know the Government was shut down for a lot of reasons. One of the reasons was spread across all the newspapers and television shows that could carry it last year when the Speaker of the House was offended because he was asked to go out of the wrong door of Air Force One. This took a personal vendetta to a whole new level, but it should not have led to a shutdown of the Government. 
Again, it is important that we don't have the Government shutdown at any time in the future. But this isn't the legislation that should do that. Last week, Friday, there was a celebration by the Democrats and Republicans that we had done something on a bipartisan basis; we had joined hands to come up with a bipartisan budget agreement, or compromise. Why don't we go ahead and see what bills we can get passed in the right way, the ordinary way--that is, we have 13 appropriations bills; why don't we pass those 13 appropriations bills. That would really send a message to the American public that we are doing things the right way around here. 
We have been told the President will veto this legislation. We have been told by the minority leader that there are enough votes to sustain the veto. What are the things that will be affected by this amendment? We know that the stockpile stewardship program will be affected. We know that privatization projects to clean up nuclear waste will be affected--97 of them, to be exact. We know that the Appalachian Regional Commission, serving some of the poorest counties in the Nation, will be affected with this amendment. 
The agreement that was reached by the President and leadership of both Houses of Congress is an important step in the right direction, so that we can go about Government in a normal fashion. This substituted amendment still cuts about $25 billion below what was agreed upon. All of us here can live with this McCain-Hutchison amendment. We can live with this. Everybody knows that. But let's live up to the agreement that we have, also, and that is, let's fund at levels that will get us to a balanced budget by the year 2002, or even earlier. 
Is there something here that I don't understand that is going to say that we are going to agree to a budget but we are not going to really live up to it, and that is why we are not going to have to pass any of our appropriations bills and we are going to have to rely on a continuing resolution? I hope that we can move on beyond where we are here, that we don't have to have a veto of this legislation, and that we can go ahead and get the emergency relief to the five counties in Nevada that so desperately need it and the 21 other States in our Union that have had disasters that also need the relief. We should not be legislating on an appropriations bill, and that certainly is what this does. 
I yield the remainder of my time.  
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, this place we now find ourselves in is one that is a perfect example of legislation. It is the art of compromise or the art of consensus building. It has been very difficult. It has taken several days. I initially want to extend my appreciation to the chairman of the full committee, Senator Chafee, the ranking member of the full committee, Senator Baucus, and also the two Senators from Idaho for their cooperation in this matter. 
It has taken a long time. Our staffs have worked very hard. I think, though, we have made something that will answer the questions that are now before us in this emergency supplemental appropriations bill dealing with disasters. 
Over the past days we worked hard to resolve the issue. I think we have worked something out that is a compromise. There are things that we do not all agree on, but it is something that I think will do the job. 
I also state for the record that the administration has also agreed to this amendment and a modification. I understand that the administration has also agreed to work with the Senators from Idaho on the St. Maries issue involving a problem in the State of Idaho that was a result of the floods that took place early this year. I have authority on behalf of the administration to extend that offer and that cooperation to my friends from Idaho. 
I hope that there are no large conclusions drawn from this debate that has taken place behind the scenes the last few days. I hope that, however, this will allow us to go forward in the months to come with a reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act. It is important that we do that. It is important that we all recognize that the Endangered Species Act is important, but we do need to do some things with it to make it more practicable, and one that the States accept more than they do now. 
The application of this amendment on the pending legislation is something that is debatable as to whether it should have been done. Some of us feel that the work done by the administration and the Fish and Wildlife Service over the past several months, especially in the State of California where they issued a regulation that dealt with the 47 counties there, was sufficient. 
This is not the time to debate that issue. It is a time to declare that the legislative process has worked and that we are now able to move on past the issue that we now have before the Senate.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have 2 minutes left and I will use that. 
Mr. President, we have agreed to a narrowly tailored provision to address a specific issue caused by this year's historic flooding. I read from testimony given by John Garamendi, who is from California, the Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior, who said. 
. . . we are aware of no case where it can be shown that implementation of the Endangered Species Act caused any flood control structures to fail. Nor has the presence of any listed species prevented the proper operation and maintenance of flood control facilities prior to recent floods. 
That was just given to a committee of this Congress. 
I say that protecting lives or property are not mutually exclusive. Also, Mr. President, the Endangered Species Act didn't cause the floods or the damages. I believe that this narrowly tailored amendment is helpful. It certainly makes the duties of the administrative agencies more clear, even though the Endangered Species Act had language that would cover emergency provisions. I move the amendment.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the quorum call, and others matters that have taken place in the last few minutes, I have had the opportunity to speak in some detail with the chairman of the Environmental and Public Works Committee. He indicates to me that in the last little while serious negotiations have been undertaken with the administration and others interested in this problem that is now before the Senate. As a result of that, the chairman of the committee feels that this matter can be resolved. That being the case, I will at this time indicate to the manager of the bill that I am not going to proceed further. I will leave my amendment pending with the anticipation that we can work something out. I hope so. 
I also say to my friend that we will probably need an hour and a half on this side if, in fact, we can't resolve this matter. But we can worry about that at some later time. That being the case, unless the manager has something else----

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Alaska, that is why I am here. I wanted to move this thing along. Nevada is one of the 22 States that benefits from this legislation. We had a very serious problem around the first of the year with flooding. So I acknowledge the seriousness of this. 
I say to my friend from Alaska, if there were a cloture motion filed, I would vote to invoke cloture. I think that we do have to move this thing along, and that is the reason I am here. But with my having spoken to the chairman of the full 
committee, I think it is appropriate that I give him every opportunity he can to see if something can be worked out.

I acknowledge that there are very few things in life more frustrating than being here, having a lot of work to do, and nobody shows up here. So I understand the feelings of the manager of this bill, the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee. This is important legislation. If we can't resolve this endangered species matter, let's bring it up, vote on it and get on to something else. 
Having said that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. REID. Madam President, in the wrap-up, in the final business that will take place here today, Senate Resolution 84 will pass. This is a resolution that deals with suicide prevention. Currently, there are 31,000 suicides every year in the United States; 83 people a day kill themselves. 
I made some remarks earlier today that will be in the Record of the Senate on this subject. I just want to express my appreciation to those that are sponsoring this resolution. It is a bipartisan resolution. Senator Coverdell has been the lead Republican on this issue. Madam President, he is the lead sponsor on this because in his State there is a very courageous man, a man named Jerry Weyrauch. Jerry is leading a national effort in this country to draw attention to this issue. He is doing it after having gone through the trauma of losing his daughter by suicide. 
Suicide is something that affects many people. As indicated, 31,000 people a year kill themselves in this country. In my Senate office here in Washington, about 2 months ago, during a period of 4 weeks, three of my employees had relatives that killed themselves. One was an 11-year-old boy that hanged himself. 
Suicide is something we have learned can be avoided. I became vocal about suicide after having participated in a hearing before the Senate Aging Committee last year. Mike Wallace, a person those of us in Government hate to get a call from, appeared before our Aging Committee. The hearing was on senior depression. Mike Wallace, in my opinion, Madam President, showed a lot of courage when he came before our committee and acknowledged--this very articulate TV personality appeared before our committee with a lot of humility--there were times in his life when he felt like he wanted to die, he was so depressed. The message he gave our committee was that there was no reason for him to feel this way. With a little bit of counseling and some medication, his life was changed. 
It was at that hearing that I said to myself, and I indicated publicly, that it was time I acknowledged the fact that my father killed himself. It was something our family was embarrassed about, maybe even a little ashamed about. But with Mike Wallace talking the way he did, I thought it was something I should be more vocal about, and try to prevent others from going through the trauma that my family went through. 
So, at that hearing, I said to the now Secretary of Defense, then Chairman Cohen, that I thought it would be a good idea if we held a hearing on senior suicide. We did. It was a remarkable hearing. We learned it is a problem. We learned, of course, with that hearing centering on senior suicide, what a tremendous problem it is across this country, especially in Nevada. Nevada leads the Nation in suicide and is twice--two times--the average for senior suicide. Nevada has a real problem. 
We came to learn in that hearing that suicide cuts across all ages, it cuts across all economic lines, all social and economic boundaries. More people die from suicide in the United States than from homicide. That says a lot because there are tens of thousands of people, about 24,000 people a year in this country, who are murdered. 
On an average day in this country, almost 2,000 adults attempt suicide. For young people, ages 15 to 24, suicide is the third leading cause of death, only behind unintentional injury and homicide. In 1992, more teenagers and young adults died from suicide than died from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease combined. We can take all of the people age 15 to 24 who died from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and lung 
disease, and they do not equal the number of young people that killed themselves. Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. 
One of the things we have learned in these hearings, Madam President, is we do not know the cause of suicide. Why are the 10 leading States in the Nation all Western States? We do not know why. We need to know why. Why do males commit suicide, at rates and numbers for suicides, four times more than females? 
Elderly adults have rates of suicide more than 50 percent higher than the Nation as a whole. We also know that seniors are much more adept at killing themselves. We know a youngster is not very good. About every 1 in 200 who attempts suicide is able to be successful; yet, 1 in 4 seniors are successful. Suicide is preventable. 
As I indicated, we learned from the Mike Wallace hearing that a little bit of counseling and a little bit of medication is all that is needed. Most suicidal persons desperately want to live; they are just unable to see alternatives to their problems. Understanding and identifying the risk factors for this phenomenon and evaluating potential suicide prevention interventions must become a public health priority. 
So we must do something about this preventable public health tragedy. It is irresponsible and insensitive to allow victims and families to suffer in silence or to nationally hide our heads in the sand. 
Those of us who have had experience with suicide wonder, is there more we could have done? Why did he do it? Why did she do it? But I think the important thing is to recognize the progress that has been made. It wasn't long ago, Madam President, that someone that committed suicide could not be buried in a public cemetery. They simply would not allow it. There were many religious boundaries that the family of someone that committed suicide could not go beyond. Things are changing for the better. They will become better, and this resolution is really an outstanding step in that direction. 
I have acknowledged Senator Coverdell and I appreciate his support, along with the two Senators from Louisiana, Breaux and Landrieu, Senator Murray, and Senator Wellstone, those who have cosponsored this legislation. The lead person in the House of Representatives is John Lewis from Georgia. I am grateful to him for taking the lead in this. 
But the most important thing we can do is not be insensitive. Again, it is irresponsible and insensitive to allow families and victims to suffer in silence or to nationally hide our heads in the sand and pretend it doesn't exist. We have to acknowledge the problem and we need to take the critical first step in doing something about it. 
Today the Suicide Prevention Advocacy Network--the organization Jerry Weyrauch formulated, sponsored and pushed--delivered over 20,000 signed petitions from 47 States calling for the action that was accomplished here today. It is time to lift the veil of secrecy and begin the effort to heal the wounds and take the steps to prevent unnecessary loss of life. It is time to continue the effort for mental health parity and to ensure that all those who need assistance get the assistance they need, without stigma. 
The resolution I offered today, I hope, will be the first step in focusing awareness on the need for suicide prevention and addressing the need for a national strategy. No life should be lost when there is an opportunity to prevent its loss. 
Not one of the nearly 31,000 lives lost to suicide annually is insignificant. These are the children, parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, friends, coworkers, and neighbors of each and every one of us. There are some things, I repeat, that we don't know. We have multiple suicides in families--families that appear to be the normal families. We have fathers committing suicide and sons committing suicide. We need to know more about this. Few of us can say we don't know someone who has been touched personally by this tragedy. 
In addition to this legislation, I am going to continue to offer legislation which will be vital in taking necessary steps by calling for the establishment of injury control research centers, which will deal exclusively with the subject of suicide. We need a focal point where we can develop expertise on suicide, both of seniors and of children, and share this expertise with others interested in getting involved. 
I also intend to ask the National Institutes of Health to conduct research into the treatment of clinical depression and suicide generally. 
Again, I express my appreciation to Members on both sides of the aisle for supporting this resolution. It will be, I believe, the first step in acknowledging suicide as a national problem.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Eating Disorders Information and Education Act of 1997. This legislation would establish a program, as part of the Public Health Service Act, to provide information and education to the public on the prevention and treatment of eating disorders. Eating disorders include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorders. Further, my bill would provide for the operation of toll-free telephone communications to provide information to the public on eating disorders. Such communications shall be available on a 24-hour, 7-day basis. 
Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and compulsive overeating are all serious emotional problems that can have life-threatening consequences. An eating disorder refers to a set of distorted eating habits, weight management practices, and attitudes about weight and body shape. Further, it is these distorted eating related attitudes and behaviors that result in loss of self-control, obsession, anxiety, guilt, and other forms of misery, alienation from self and others, and physiological imbalances which are potentially life threatening. 
Anorexia nervosa is an intense and irrational fear of body fat and weight gain, a determination to become thinner and thinner, and a misperception of body weight and shape to the extent that the person may feel or see themselves as fat, even when emaciation is clear to others. These psychological characteristics contribute to drastic weight loss and defiant refusal to maintain a healthy weight for height and age. Food, calories, weight, and weight management dominate the person's life. 
Bulimia nervosa is characterized by self-perpetuating and self-defeating cycles of binge eating and purging. During a binge, the person consumes a large amount of food in a rapid, automatic, and helpless fashion. This may anesthetize hunger, anger, and other feelings, but it eventually creates physical discomfort and anxiety about weight gain. Thus, the person purges the food eaten, usually by inducing vomiting and by resorting to some combination of restrictive dieting, excessive exercising, laxatives, and diuretics. 
Eating disorders arise from a combination of longstanding psychological, interpersonal, and social conditions. Feelings of inadequacy, depression, anxiety, and loneliness, as well as troubled family and personal relationships may contribute to the development of an eating disorder. Our culture, with its unrelenting idealization of thinness and the perfect body, is often a contributing factor. Once started, eating disorders become self-perpetuating. 
The Federal Government has taken a role in research into eating disorders. The National Institutes of Health [NIH] is sponsoring research to determine the causes of anorexia, the best methods of treatment, and ways to identify who might have a high risk of developing the disorder. Further, NIH, through its Division of Researcher Resources, supports 10 general clinical research centers throughout the country in which anorexia research is underway. 
Researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health are studying the biological aspects and changes in brain chemistry which may control appetite. Although psychological or environmental factors may precipitate the onset of the illness, the study indicates that it may be prolonged by starvation-induced changes in body processes. 
Althouth research into eating disorders is established and continuing, we need to provide help for those already trapped in the cycle of an eating disorder. That is why I offer my legislation today, to provide a resource to people who need help.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to submit a Senate resolution which I hope will raise national awareness to the problem of suicide and one that recognizes suicide as a national public health problem needing attention. 
I am pleased to have as cosponsors of this resolution Senators Murray, Wellstone, and Coverdell. Their courage and leadership on this issue is appreciated. 
Currently there are nearly 31,000 suicides annually in the United States--83 suicides per day; or 1 suicide every 17 minutes--with 12 of every 100,000 Americans taking their own lives. 
Suicide cuts across all age, economic, social, and ethnic boundaries. 
More people die from suicide than from homicide in the United States. 
On an average day in this country, an estimated 1,900 adults attempt suicide. 
It is estimated that there are 750,000 suicide attempts annually. 
In 1994, the latest year for which we have statistical data, the 10 highest suicide rates, averaging twice those of the mid-Atlantic region, were found in States within the intermountain region of the west. 
Unfortunately, my State of Nevada leads the Nation in this public health tragedy. 
Mr. President, suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. 
Males commit suicide at rates and numbers of suicides three to four times those of females. 
Firearms are currently the most often utilized method of suicide by essentially all groups--that is males, females, young, old, white, nonwhite--and the rates are increasing. 
Suicide rates have traditionally decreased in times of wars and increased in times of economic crises. 
Rates of suicide are highest among the older adult 
population above 65. Last year I was pleased to call for a Senate Special Committee on Aging hearing which addressed this issue. 
Elderly adults have rates of suicide more than 50 percent higher than the Nation as a whole and the young--15 to 24. 
Youth--15 to 24 years of age--suicide rates increased more than 200 percent from the 1950's to the late 1970's. Following the late 1970's the rates for youth have remained stable or slightly lower, although current rates are also approximately 200 percent higher than in the 1950's. 
For young people 15 to 24 years old, suicide is the third leading cause of death, behind unintentional injury and homicide. In 1992 more teenagers and young adults died from suicide than died from cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia and influenza, and chronic lung disease combined. 
The risk for suicide among young people is greater among young white males; however, from 1980 through 1992, suicide rates increased most rapidly among young black males. Although suicide among children is a rare event, the dramatic increase in the rate among persons 10 to 14 years of age underscores the urgent need for intensifying efforts to prevent suicide among persons in this age group. 
Although there are no official statistics on attempted suicide, it is generally estimated that there are at least 8 to 20 attempts for each death by suicide. 
Risk of attempted suicide is greatest among females and the young. Females have generally been found to make 3 to 4 times as many attempts as males. Estimate of the ratio of young attempted suicides to suicidal deaths have generally ranged between 100 to 1 and 200 to 1. 
Mental health diagnoses are generally associated with higher risk of suicide. Groups/diagnoses at particular risk are the depressed, schizophrenics, alcoholics, and those with panic disorder. 
Feelings of hopelessness--that is `there are no solutions to my problem'--are found to be more predictive of suicide risk than diagnoses of depression per se. 
The socially isolated are generally found to be at high risk for suicide. 
The vast majority of those who are suicidal display clues and warning signs. 
It is estimated that at least 4.0 million Americans today are survivors of a loved one's suicide. 
Mr. President, suicide is preventable. Most suicidal persons desperately want to live. They are just unable to see alternatives to their problems. 
Understanding and identifying the risk factors for this phenomenon and evaluating potential suicide prevention interventions must become a public health priority. 
Most suicidal persons give definite warnings of their suicidal intentions, but others are either unaware of the significance of these warnings or do not know how to respond to them. 
We can and must do something about this preventable public health tragedy. It is irresponsible and insensitive to allow families and victims to suffer in silence or to nationally hide our heads in the sand. 
By acknowledging the problem, we take the critical first step to doing something about it. 
This week in Washington one such survivor, Mr. Jerry Weyrauch, who lost his 34-year-old physician daughter to suicide, is taking his personal loss and turning it into an opportunity for all Americans. 
He has formed a group called the Suicide Prevention Advocacy Network [SPAN] which calls for a national suicide prevention strategy. While in Washington his group will deliver over 20,000 signed petitions from 47 States to Members of Congress calling for action. 
His efforts are a classic American story of how one person with a cause can make a difference. I am pleased to see democracy work in such a commendable manner. This is indeed how our Government was set up to work and I am pleased to support his efforts, and those of SPAN, on behalf of so many Americans. 
It is time to lift the veil of secrecy and begin the effort to heal the wounds and take the steps to prevent unnecessary loss of life. 
It is time to continue the effort for mental health parity and ensure all who need assistance, get the assistance they need, without stigma. 
The resolution I submit today with my colleagues I hope will 
be the first step in focussing awareness on the need for suicide prevention and addressing the need for a national strategy. No life should be lost when there is an opportunity to prevent its loss. 
Not one of the nearly 31,000 lives lost to suicide annually is insignificant. These are the children, parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, friends, coworkers, and neighbors of each and every one of us. 
Few of us can say we do not know someone who has been personally touched by this tragedy. 
I lost my father to suicide many years ago. I also know of several others who have just recently experienced the loss of a loved one to suicide. 
Mr. President, I am honored to submit this resolution today and hope my colleagues will join me in taking the first step to making a difference in this very preventable public health tragedy. 
I intend to offer legislation this session which will be vital in taking a necessary first step by calling for the establishment of injury control research centers which will deal exclusively with the subject of suicide. We need a focal point where we can develop expertise on suicide and share this expertise with others interested in getting involved. 
I am pleased to lend my voice to this worthy cause and I am very happy to have Senator's Murray, Wellstone, and Coverdell joining me in this effort. 
I would also like to thank Jerry Weyrauch from SPAN and Dr. Lanny Berman from the American Association of Suicidology and Dr. Jane Pearson from the National Institute of Mental Health for their leadership in this field. 
I also want to acknowledge the countless professionals and volunteers across America who staff the crisis call lines; facilitate the workshops and support groups determined to help survivors go forward after such a loss; organize and implement prevention programs; conduct the research and evaluation to understand the causes of suicidal behavior; provide the treatment and support; and the many brave families and survivors who go on helping others to put the pieces back together again. 
Mr. President, we have before us today an opportunity to take the critical first step. I hope my colleagues will join me by overwhelmingly supporting this Senate resolution.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation which will help resolve a serious problem that plagues this Nation. Last year, and unless we do something this year, 1,000 young boys and girls will be abducted from their home and taken to foreign countries. Most of them will never come back to this country. These are young people who have every right to be in this country, but one of their parents gets a passport and takes them someplace. 
This legislation I am introducing involves a young boy by the name of Mikey Kale. His father was Croatian. His father got a passport signed--not notifying the mother--and went to Croatia. This is one of the happy endings of these stories. This young boy was allowed to come home with his mother--not allowed to come home. She went through a lot of time and effort and spent a lot of money to get him so she could bring him home. 
Most of the time the children never return. For example, Mr. President, this last week on ABC's `Prime Time,' they featured a case very similar to the Mikey Kale case, a case that involved a mother who took a daughter to Costa Rica. She did not have custody of the child. Sole custody was awarded to the father. A warrant was issued for her arrest. For more than 3 years this father has searched, and suffered, trying to get back his daughter. He has been unable to do so. It appears, even pursuant to that television program, that they know where the child is, but because of the complexity of the law in Costa Rica, the child has not been allowed to return. 
Extradition law, generally, does not include child abduction. So most parents are stymied. I repeat, 1,000 young boys and girls each year are abducted in this manner. Usually, these abductions take place during or after a contentious divorce, sometimes even by an abusive parent, many times by an abusive parent. At a time when these children are most vulnerable and most uncertain about their future, they are snatched and taken to a foreign country. 
The tragedy of this wrong is best illustrated by an ordeal forced upon people from the State of Nevada. No family should have to go through what Fred and Barbara Spierer went through in 1993. Barbara's ex-husband obtained a passport for 6-year-old Mikey without Barbara's knowledge, consent or approval. On Valentine's Day, 1993, he abducted Mikey, boarded an airplane, and left for his country of Croatia, his native country. At that time, that country was, for lack of a better description, in a state of war. After tremendous emotional and financial efforts, the Spierers were able to get Mikey to come home. 
I stress, this problem is more common than we would like to think. It has been suggested that we do something about it. This legislation will do that. What, in effect, this legislation would do is say if you are going to take a child outside the United States, you must have the signatures of both parents. If one parent has custody, then only that signature is required. If there is joint custody, it would take both signatures. It is not difficult to get the signatures of both parents to take a child outside the country. Thousands of parents throughout the United States are currently undergoing the same emotional and financial stress that the Spierers experienced. This simple change in the law would prevent future agony and distress. 
As I indicated, Mr. President, few parents are as fortunate as the Spierers. Few will ever see their children again. Recovery rates for children, once they are in a foreign country, are extremely low. It is a sad fact that once a child leaves the United States, it is nearly impossible to get the child returned as most nations do not recognize custody orders from the U.S. courts. 
As I said, most extradition treaties do not cover international parental abductions. Experience shows that foreign governments are generally reluctant to extradite parental abductors. Often when facing extradition, the abducting parents will hide the child with a friend or relative in a foreign country or even go to another foreign country, complicating things even more. This action prevents the child from ever being returned. 
At any rate, getting a child returned in the United States is extremely expensive, far beyond the resources of most families. Many families have to spend in excess of $50,000 just in lawyers trying to retrieve their children, often, to no avail. Prevention is the only feasible way of dealing with international parental abductions. The best way to prevent international parental abductions is to make it more difficult for parental abductors to obtain passports for the minor children. 
The aim of the Mikey Kale Passport Notification Act is prevention. It prevents parental abductors from obtaining U.S. passports for their minor children. This, Mr. President, seems the least we could do.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, several months ago I visited White Pine County High School located in Ely, NV, one of the rural spots of Nevada. I was going to speak to an assembly of high school students. I was in a room waiting to give my presentation. In the room were two young ladies. They were dressed in letter sweaters from White Pine County High School. One of them was named Lauren and the other was Casandra. 
While waiting, I struck up a conversation with these two young ladies. I asked them what sports they participated in. One of them ran track. She told me she had won the summer tournament in sprints. The other girl said she participated in softball. 
So we carried on our conversation for a short period of time. As I was getting ready to go in, one of the young ladies said, `Senator I don't know what I would do without my sports.' 
Mr. President, these two young ladies' ability to participate in athletics is as a result of something that the Federal Government has done. 
I started a series of speeches last summer on the Senate floor to discuss the good things that happen in Government. We tend to dwell on the negative, rather than the positive aspects of Government. I talked about how proud I was that we have our National Park System with great parks like Yellowstone, Yosemite, Grand Canyon, and the other great entities that are the envy of the world. 
I talked about the Federal Emergency Management Agency, what a great job they have done in Nevada, and how proud I was of the work they had done in the State of Nevada during the recent floods. They are, of course, in every newspaper and on every news program because of the work they are doing with the floods of North Dakota and South Dakota right now. 
I talked about the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and about the great work they do to make the marketplace safer for us. 
I also talked about the great work that 25,000 men and women engage in every summer in fighting forest fires, principally in the Western part of the United States. They do very courageous things, such as jumping out of helicopters with backpacks weighing almost 100 pounds, and rappelling off the back of helicopters. 
These are Government programs. We should acknowledge them. The Federal Government has its shortcomings, and I am the first to acknowledge that. But let's not dwell on the shortcomings. Let's talk about some of the good things that happen. 
That is the reason I am here today; to talk about one of the programs that the Federal Government initiated that I think is good. I am here to speak about title IX, enacted as part of the Education Act Amendments of 1972, which gives women and girls equal rights in education and in athletics. 
Just a couple of months ago we celebrated the 11th annual National Girls and Women in Sports Day. We had all kinds of star female athletes come here to The Mall in Washington to celebrate the accomplishments of women in sports and to commemorate the upcoming anniversary of title IX. 
I think this Federal statute is an example of good Government. What we attempted to do in this legislation is level the playing field for all Americans. 
Title IX is an example of Government funding providing just such an opportunity in America. We have not reached the goal of equity for men and women in high school and college athletics. But we have come a tremendous way as indicated, in my opinion, by Lauren and Casandra telling me about their enthusiastic participation in rural Nevada athletics. 
So as we approach the 25th anniversary of title IX this June we can be proud of the accomplishments made under this law while looking ahead to the goal of equal treatment for men and women in education and in sports. 
In 1972, when this law went into effect, about 1 out of every 30 girls in high school played sports. Today it is 1 in 3. Now women account for 34 percent of athletic participants in high school and college sports. 
In 1972, just a small amount of money was spent nationwide on athletic scholarships for women--less than $100,000. Today it is approaching $200 million. Fifty-five percent of women participate in high school sports. 
A recent USA Today analysis of 303 NCAA Division I schools found that women comprised 37 percent of all athletes at these schools. There has been an increase even since 1992 in girls participating in college athletics. It is up over 20 percent. 
It is a great accomplishment to have one of your children graduate from college. I have had that opportunity with my children. But it is also a great thrill to watch your children participate in athletics at the high school level and at the college level. Only one of my children has participated in athletics at the college level. But that was a great thrill for me to watch my young boy play on three national NCAA championship teams on three separate occasions. He played soccer at the University of Virginia, where they were national champions. Girls should have the same opportunity that my son had to play Division I and Division II college athletics. 
Nationwide, 7 million women of all ages play soccer. The number of NCAA Division I women's soccer teams has increased from 22 in 1982 to over 200 now. That is a significant increase. Thanks to title IX, more women are going to college, more women are getting scholarships, and more women are playing sports at a competitive level. 
I have always been one that supported college athletics. While some criticize competitive athletics in college, I think they are great. Athletics allows people who would never have set foot within a university campus to get an education. They don't always graduate, even though the graduation rates are increasing, but it gives them the opportunity to be someplace where they ordinarily would not be able to go. That is good. It should also allow women the opportunity to go to college because of their athletic abilities. Title IX is helping women get athletic scholarships that they would not have gotten just a few years ago. This is important and good for the country and for education generally. 
What are the benefits of sports for women and for girls? Women and girls achieve numerous benefits from participating in athletics. In my opinion, with our society becoming increasingly more sedentary, we need to increase physical activity and athletics for all of our citizens--not just for boys but also for girls. 
Getting young ladies involved in sports improves their health and well-being, and increases the likelihood they will stick with athletics and exercise throughout their lives. 
In addition to the general health benefits of physical activity, a study conducted at the Harvard University's Graduate School of Public Health showed that young women who participated in college sports were significantly--and I stress that--less likely to contract breast cancer and other reproductive cancers. 
There are other benefits. Participation in athletics benefits young women in the same way that it benefits young men. Participation in sports has been found to increase the self-esteem of girls and boys. 
Mr. President, one of my older boys played football in high school. I was talking on the telephone to one of my friends who had been a college athlete. He and I played ball together in high school. I was concerned that a boy from my son's team had just gone to the hospital with some football injury. And my friend, who is now a veterinarian, told me, `Harry, athletics builds character. He may have gone to an emergency room. He is home now. Stick it out. 
Athletics builds character.' That it does. 
I believe, for those that I have seen participate in athletics generally, it is a character builder. It should be a character builder not only for young men but also for young women. 
I believe, as I said, that athletics increases self-esteem of girls and boys. High school athletes have higher graduation rates than nonathletes. Female athletes also have lower dropout rates than nonathletes. 
Studies reveal that girls involved in sports are more likely to aspire to be leaders in their communities. Expanding sports opportunities for women and girls will help more women in their leadership roles and help them to lead successful adult lives. If it is true for men, then it should be true for women. 
Further, increased opportunity for women in sports increases exposure for women's athletics, and makes it possible for more women to make a career of sports. 
Mr. President, the NCAA women's basketball championship this year was a sellout. The women's--not men's but women's--college basketball championship was a sellout. They played great basketball. 
When I go home I love to watch women's softball. Last year UNLV was ranked in the top five of the Nation. It was exciting to watch these young women play fast pitch softball. I am sure, if you brought the men's baseball players over to play these young women in softball, that the men would lose. These young women are good. I like to watch women's basketball too. It is just as entertaining as men's. Title IX has played an important role in providing opportunities for women to excel in athletics. 
It is important to stress, however, that the intent of title IX was not to cut men's programs but merely to bring women's programs up to the level that they ought to be. This costs money, and many schools aren't willing to shell out this money. Subsequently, title IX has gotten some negative reaction from schools who have limited funds. 
Mr. President, I think it is important to note that schools are trying to comply. For example, the University of Nevada at Las Vegas developed a compliance action plan to make changes and work toward compliance with title IX. They have submitted a plan that will put girls athletics at UNLV on a par with male athletics by the year 2001. Their plan is to increase female athletic participation opportunities--scholarship and nonscholarship--by a minimum of 100 over the next 5 years. They are going to add women's soccer in 1998 and add another women's sport in the year 2001. They are going to provide medical support, training and equipment to meet these additional needs; and provide new funding, up to $4 million over the next 5 years, to meet these gender equity needs. 
UNLV doesn't currently meet any of the tests for title IX compliance, but they are working at it to the benefit of Nevada's athletes, and I think to education generally. 
Mr. President, compliance with title IX is not unreasonable, nor is it impossible. Seven NCAA Division I schools meet the proportionality test, where the percentage of female athletes is within five points of female undergraduates. 
Among the schools in compliance are Dartmouth, Lehigh, the University of Massachusetts, Harvard, and Montana State. 
So it is not all of these eastern schools. It can be done, if people try. Obviously, Montana State was interested in complying, and they accomplished that. 
Even the most basic efforts that schools make toward compliance with title IX have started a nationwide boom in women's sports. 
I talked about basketball. But as more women have entered athletics they have not displaced men. Instead the total number of athletes has increased. There has been an ongoing struggle. We have had case decisions in the U.S. Supreme Court. On Monday, April 21, the Supreme Court declined to review a case filed by Brown University where they wanted to test the Constitutionality of title IX. 
The Supreme Court would not even consider the case. As a result of that, we are going forward with more proportionality. We are going to make an even playing field. 
Because of these positive outcomes, title IX must be supported and enforced because it is good government. Somewhere out there are future female professional athletes and Olympic gold medalists who may never jump a hurdle or pick up a ball if their families, coaches, and schools do not give them the opportunity and the encouragement to play sports. These girls and women who are the champions of the future must be supported. Title IX is vital to that effort.

Mr. REID. Madam President, when I came to the Senate about 11 years ago, one of the first things I did was come to the Senate floor and talk about the need for campaign finance reform. I thought it would come very quickly. I could not believe, with all the problems that occurred during that election cycle, including what happened in my election in the State of Nevada 11 years ago, we would not rush to reform the way we elect Senators and Members of the House of Representatives. 
The problems were replete, with the Federal Election Commission being really a toothless tiger. They had no money to enforce the rules and the laws that existed. Much to my chagrin and, frankly, much to my surprise, 11 years later we have done nothing, zero. In fact, things have even gotten worse. Why? Because the Supreme Court, among other things, declared that any money that goes to a State party cannot be regulated. So this last cycle, even though we had Federal law to the effect that there would be no corporate money in Federal elections since the early part of this century, the Supreme Court stood that on its head, and suddenly not only do we have the problems we have had with a myriad of people trying to skirt the law, now we have the fact that you can use corporate money in Federal elections. 
I think that is wrong. I think it is too bad that we have not done something. That is why I am here today to commend and applaud Senators Feingold and McCain for their courageous work on campaign finance reform. I am a cosponsor of that legislation. I do not agree with every jot and tittle, every line and verse within that legislation, but it is a step in the right direction, and I happily joined in cosponsoring that legislation. Why? Because it is going to do some things--it is going to reform campaign financing significantly and importantly and in a good way. It will require greater disclosure of independent expenditures. I believe independent expenditures is a sore that is festering and is going to wind up tremendously damaging the body politic. 
Unnamed people, with money coming from unknown sources, are running campaign ads viciously attacking candidates. That is wrong. That is really un-American. 
The McCain-Feingold legislation will require the FEC to provide advance notice to complying candidates if they have been targeted by these independent expenditures or outside organizations. 
McCain-Feingold would restrict contributions from people not eligible to vote in Federal elections. It could ban incumbent use of franked mass mailings in the calendar year of an election. 
It would increase disclosure and accountability for those who engage in political advertising. And it would strengthen penalties for willful violations of Federal election law. We must do something to make people feel better about the elections. 
Elections are 18 months away. Negative ads are already starting around the country. That is wrong. People who say we need to hold more hearings to determine whether or not McCain-Feingold is a good law, I say let us look at what has happened over the past 10 years. Congress has produced almost 6,800 pages of hearings. There have been 3,361 floor speeches. I guess because of this one, it is 3,362 floor speeches. There have been 1,060 pages of committee reports, 113 Senate votes on campaign 
finance reform, and one bipartisan Federal commission. Certainly this is enough. We have enough information to act responsibly. 
Over the next 2 years, Madam President, Congress will deal with changes to regulations and programs that affect virtually every American, from clean air and water to education programs, matters dealing with crime in the streets, juvenile crime, trying to improve our infrastructure, Medicare, Medicaid, problems dealing with our Nation's elderly. In order to address these concerns credibly, should we not first act to reform the way we are elected? I say yes. I hope that my colleagues join hands in rallying around the McCain-Feingold legislation. It is the best we have to bring debate to the Senate floor and to get something done. I have talked about it for 11 years. It has been a problem even longer than that. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, since I have been here in the Senate, we have been under a majority controlled by the Republicans and the Democrats. When I first came here, the Democrats had the majority, and now the Republicans have the majority. 
During the times that the Democrats had the majority, there were some very controversial nominees that came forward, but they always came forward and there was a vote. My concern is that we are now entering into a new era, where the majority is using nominees of the President--and there is no question about their capabilities and their credentials to hold the job, and there is nothing relating to their moral qualifications. They are simply holding up the President's appointees because they don't want them to be selected, or they have some other issue and they are trying to hold the nominee hostage. 
As an example, Alexis Herman has been nominated to be the Secretary of Labor. We were initially told we are not going to get her out of committee until there is comptime legislation marked up in the Labor Committee. That hurdle has gone over. The legislation is marked up. Now there is another hurdle this woman must find herself facing. Now we are told that there is an issue that deals with an opposed Executive order that would permit Federal agencies to consider requiring contractors on certain large Federal construction projects to comply with labor contracts for the duration of the project. Governor Miller of Nevada issues a similar order and a project labor agreement is now in use on a very large construction project outside of Las Vegas to bring water into Las Vegas. 
Mr. President, I respectfully submit that holding Alexis Herman's nomination hostage to this is wrong. To hold her nomination hostage over an Executive order is wrong. She is qualified morally and educationally and is experienced. Therefore, she should be working for the taxpayers of this country in the job she was selected to do by the President. What is happening is not right. 
We can get into the merits of the issue of the majority holding Alexis Herman hostage, but should that really be the case? If we looked at it closely, we would find that in the State of Nevada, as an example, of the seven contracts awarded, three went to nonunion contractors. I assume that is what the majority is concerned about. They have this problem with unions. Well, in Nevada, even though the Governor entered this order, three of the contracts went to nonunion contractors, and four went to traditional union contractors. Of the 36 contractors who bid on the seven contracts, 16 were nonunion, 20 were union. 
The point I am making, Mr. President, is that this issue, this proposed Executive order, is just that--an issue. We should debate it. It is wrong and there is legislation to hold hearings or try to get the Executive order overturned, but we should not hold up this woman's nomination.  
Are we going to continue without a Secretary of Labor until the majority leadership gets their way on every labor issue? I hope not. I don't think that hostage holding is a proper way to pass good legislation. It is not the way to have the President's nominees chosen. The President has a right to select who he wants to work in these very sensitive Cabinet positions. He has chosen a woman that is certainly qualified. 
Mr. President, this woman is a graduate, as is my colleague, the junior Senator from Maryland, from Xavier University in New Orleans, LA. In 1977, she was the youngest director ever of the Woman's Bureau at the Department of Labor. She is certainly entitled to this job by virtue of her qualifications. 
We are willing to debate these issues and work for compromises if, in fact, that is necessary. But the majority is saying that it is their way or no way. This tactic is becoming a way of business under this majority. Also, I don't believe there has ever been judicial nominations put on hold by a Congress as we have seen with this one. One must wonder about the pattern of the recent majority attacks--Alexis Herman, Senator Landrieu, Congresswoman Sanchez, and judicial nominee Margaret Morrow. For example, take Margaret Morrow; she has been found very qualified by the American Bar Association. 
She was first nominated almost a year ago, and we still have not had the opportunity to vote on this woman. This is wrong. The rules of the Senate allow leadership to delay a nomination if there are questions about the nominee's qualifications. But there are no questions about this nominee's qualifications. 
There is no reason that we don't have a vote on Alexis Herman. And we should have it this week. I think that it is wrong that we go forward with legislation--the majority feels important, and the minority goes along with that--but I think we are going to have to arrive at a point where we have to take a look at how the majority is handling what takes place on this Senate floor. Maybe what we should do is nothing until these people who are qualified, like Alexis Herman and like Margaret Morrow, until we have votes on them. 
If they want to vote against Alexis Herman, then the majority should vote against Alexis Herman. But to hold this woman hostage--it is now approaching the 1st of May, and this woman has not been able to go to work as Secretary of Labor. That is wrong. I think the American public deserve more, and I hope that majority leadership will allow her nomination to go forward along with some of other nominees that are being held up for reasons unknown to most of us.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to address this body on a most important issue, an issue which may affect our country and, of course, the citizens of our country. The Chemical Weapons Convention, when ratified by this body, will mark the beginning of a new arms control era. 
I first stood before the Senate December 11, 1995, and urged that we bring the Chemical Weapons Convention to the floor for debate. I urged that this be done expeditiously and without partisanship. After many unsuccessful attempts, we are now in a position to debate the treaty on the Senate floor. 
This treaty was negotiated and signed during the administration of President George Bush. The Clinton administration, after making its own assessment of the treaty, submitted it for the Senate's advice and consent pursuant to our Constitution in November of 1993. The Chemical Weapons Convention is truly a bipartisan effort and is now enjoying support from both sides of the aisle. The Chemical Weapons Convention has been signed by 161 countries and ratified by 68 of these countries and many more will ratify the convention once the United States does. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention is not about eliminating our chemical weapons. The United States is already committed to eliminating our chemical weapons. We have done that unilaterally and have been doing that since 1985 because in 1985 we passed legislation requiring the unilateral destruction of all of our chemical weapons inventory. The only question since then has been how and where we do the destruction of the chemical weapons. 
The convention will hold other nations to the same standards which we hold ourselves. How can this be viewed as anything but beneficial to the citizens of this country. The Chemical Weapons Convention requires signatory nations to destroy their chemical weapons inventory. The security of this Nation and our allies will be improved when the Chemical Weapons Convention enters into force on April 29 of this year. 
Secretary Madeleine Albright, our Secretary of State, has said, among other things: 
The convention will make it less likely that our Armed Forces will ever again encounter chemical weapons on the battlefield, less likely that rogue states will have access to the material needed to build chemical arms, and less likely that such arms will fall into the hands of terrorists. 
That is what our Secretary of State said, and I agree with her. 
This treaty reduces the possibility that our Armed Forces will encounter chemical weapons on the battlefield by preventing signatory nations from producing and, also importantly, possessing chemical weapons. 
Ratification does not prevent our military from preparing for chemical attacks, nor does the ratification diminish the ability of our military leaders to defend against a chemical attack. In fact, as I speak, our national laboratories are working on programs to test how we can defeat terrorist activities using chemical weapons. We need to have a program where we determine how we can eliminate rogue states that have these materials in their possession and terrorists obtain them. A lot of this will be going on at the Nevada test site in the deserts of Nevada. 
Ratification does not prevent our military, as I have indicated, from preparing for chemical attacks. The Department 
of Defense is committed to maintaining a robust chemical defense capability. The defense capability will be supported by aggressive intelligence collection efforts and also the research and testing that I have indicated that will likely take place at the Nevada test site. The Department of Defense will continue to prepare for the eventual possibility of chemical attacks, and they will continue to train on systems which can be used to defend against such an attack. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention requires other countries to destroy their weapons, I repeat, weapons that may someday threaten American citizens. 
Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who became an American folk hero because of his activities during the Gulf war, has said: 
I'm very, very much in favor of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. We don't need chemical weapons to fight our future wars. And frankly, by not ratifying that treaty, we align ourselves with nations like Libya and North Korea. 
The 1925 Geneva Protocol does not--I repeat, does not--restrict possession and production of chemical weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention fills that void by further rolling back the threat of chemical weapons. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, acquisition, stockpiling, retention, transfer and use of these weapons. It enforces these basic prohibitions through the use of a multinational economic and political sanction network. 
I stress, the Chemical Weapons Convention makes it less likely that our Armed Forces will face these horrible instruments of power on the battlefield by prohibiting the production and the stockpiling of these chemical weapons. The convention also protects Americans at home from deadly terrorist attacks such as those that occurred at the Tokyo subway. It does not eliminate them but it adds to the protection that we in America have. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention not only prohibits development of chemical weapons, it also, importantly, limits access to chemical weapons precursors. I do not know for sure, and I guess no one can determine for certain, if this convention would have prevented the deadly attack in the Tokyo subway. It certainly would have made it less likely. But we do know that almost immediately after the attack in the Tokyo subway, where people were killed and injured for life, Japan ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
Terrorism is a real threat to this country. We only need look at what happened at the World Trade Center, Olympic Park, and, of course, Oklahoma City. Chemical weapons provide an avenue for terrorists to further their cause. The Chemical Weapons Convention, while not perfect, will minimize the opportunity for these groups to use chemical weapons. The convention enters into force this month on the 29th day. Refusal to ratify the treaty will not stop the treaty. It will only prevent our country from participating on the governing council of this convention. 
The United States is the premier world leader today. That is without dispute. We provide leadership and direction in economic, military and political issues whether we want to or not. Delaying ratification of this treaty is counterproductive to our world leadership role and counterproductive to this Nation's security. Failure to ratify this treaty by the 29th of this month not only aligns us with nations like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, it also prevents the United States from obtaining a seat on the executive council and the international inspection team. This executive council will decide how the treaty will be implemented. If we are to continue as world leaders in nonproliferation, which we are now, it is vital for us to be a part of the executive council and international inspection team. We not only, in my opinion, have the desire to do that but the expertise to do that. 
The Department of Commerce estimated last year that only about 2,500 U.S. firms will be required to submit a data declaration form. Most of these firms will only be required to complete a two-page form. It is important to note that chemical companies support this convention. Leading U.S. chemical trade associations such as the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturers and the Chemical Manufacturers Association participated in the negotiation of this treaty and strongly endorse this treaty. 
The chemical industry of the United States uses and produces chemicals from medicinal and industrial applications. The Chemical Weapons Convention does not restrict the use of chemicals for these purposes. The Chemical Weapons Convention is designed to ensure that commercial facilities do not convert sensitive precursor chemicals into weapons agents. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention, I suggest, does not end the chemical weapons threat. It is only a tool that we can use to reach that as an objective. That objective is eventual elimination of a very dangerous class of weapons. The convention establishes a global norm by which state behavior can be judged. Some would say it levels the playing field in games 
of weapons proliferation. 
Make no mistake. The Chemical Weapons Convention is not without a flaw. However, for all its imperfections, it is in essence a fine treaty, one that will serve this Nation and this world well and will assist in stabilizing this all too volatile world. This convention is clearly in the best interests of our national security. It will assist in the leadership of our country. It will assist in the worldwide destruction of chemical weapons. Let us not imperil our global leadership position. It is time to ratify this convention. 
Mr. President, I also want to extend a personal word of congratulations to the two leaders who enabled us to get to the point where we can have a say in whether or not this treaty will be approved. The Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, has worked personally, spending hours, days, and weeks to allow us to get to this position. And I have to say I think this shows the leadership qualities of the Republican leader in allowing us to have this treaty before the Senate. If it did not come before the Senate, I think it would show a lack of leadership. At this stage I hope I am not going to be disappointed. I hope it will come before this body in a fashion that will allow us to fully debate and ratify this convention.

Mr. REID. I ask the Chair to advise the Senator when I have used 2 minutes. 
Members of the Senate, you have seen bad legislation in your day, but this is the worst. S. 104, as written, was bad. S. 104 in the substitute form is just as bad. People like Senator Bingaman have tried to improve this legislation. Senator Bingaman worked very hard. They tinkered with the edges. The proponents tried to pacify Senator Bingaman and others, and the legislation was not improved upon with their tinkering. 
This legislation is bad in its substitute form and in its amended form. They have failed to deal with the transportation system at all. They haven't dealt with it. In Germany, in recent months, they tried to move six casks. They called out 30,000 police to take care of that--30,000. There were 170 people injured and 500 arrested. It cost $150 million to move it less than 300 miles. The German parliament is reconsidering the program. There is nothing in this legislation to allow it to be carried through your State safely. Every environmental group in America opposes this legislation. 
The terrorism possibilities with this legislation are replete, as we laid out on the floor yesterday. The Washington Post is only one newspaper that said `don't do it.' Many newspapers throughout the country have said `don't do it.' 
The President is going to veto this because it is bad legislation, as agreed upon by his Secretary of Energy, head of the EPA, and by the Council of Environmental Quality. We picked a scientific group to give us insight and oversight of this legislation. They have told us that this legislation is bad. We, the Congress chartered these scientists. They are not from Nevada. They are bipartisan scientists, and they said the legislation is bad. 
The United Transportation Union doesn't like the legislation. Doctors oppose this legislation. Churches, like the Lutheran Church and the Baptist ministry oppose this legislation. A group of environmentalists who deal with Native Americans in this country 
oppose this legislation. 
This is bad legislation. If you want to cast a good vote, vote against this. It is a bad bill. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. REID. I extend my appreciation to the manager of the bill, the Senator from Alaska, who has been a gentleman during these deliberations these past 9 days. It is a hotly contested issue. We hope there is the ability to use reason in this issue, to go ahead and site the permanent repository wherever it should be and use good science to judge. But I do extend my appreciation to Senator Murkowski and his staff for the courtesies they have extended to the Senators from Nevada and look forward to working with him in the future on matters of importance.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, S. 104 is a bad bill in the form it was originally introduced. The bill in its substitute form is bad--for a lot of different reasons. No one in this body that I know of is more in tune with the substance of legislation than is the junior Senator from New Mexico. This man, who graduated from Stanford University among other schools such as Harvard, is a person who understands the merits of legislation. He has worked for years to try to improve this piece of legislation. He has worked on it because he believes in good public policy. He has failed. He has tried, he has tried, but when it comes right down to it, the proponents of this legislation will not give the junior Senator from New Mexico anything that will really substantively improve the bill. They have tried at the edges to play with it a little bit, but they have not been willing to change the substance of this poor legislation. 
The Senator from New Mexico summed up this legislation best in his closing few minutes of remarks today when he said, and I am paraphrasing: It is very obvious what is happening. Once the system is short-circuited and they go around the law that now exists and establish a temporary repository, that will end good science and good law. 
In effect, what he was saying is once interim storage is established, the billions, the billions of dollars spent trying to determine if Yucca Mountain is suitable would be wasted. That is what it amounts to. S. 104 is bad. It does not deal with transportation. We do not have the means of safely transporting nuclear waste today anywhere in the world, as evidenced by what happened recently in Germany. We will talk about that later. 
Why do all environmental groups--I repeat, all environmental groups, not 65 percent of them, not a majority, not a vast majority, not 85 percent--100 percent of environmental groups oppose this legislation? Not a single group favors this legislation. Why? Because it would be difficult to dream up a scenario that would be worse than this for the environment. 
One of the things we have not talked about is terrorism. 
We will talk about terrorism in a few minutes, but this legislation does not do anything to address the terrorism that is sweeping this world and is sweeping this country, and this bill leaves the terrorists a sitting duck. 
To show how insincere proponents of this legislation are, let's take one amendment that was offered and defeated. We have heard on this Senate floor for the past week how safe it is to transport nuclear waste, how safe it is generally. In fact, we were told by one of the proponents of this legislation that it was safer to transport nuclear waste than it was to pick up a carton of milk at a grocery store and take it to your home. That is not a paraphrase, that is a statement that was made. 
If, in fact, that is true--and, of course, it is not--but if it is true and the proponents of this legislation really believe that, why wouldn't they accept an amendment we offered that simply said, if you want to transport nuclear waste through a State, the Governor of that State should agree to let it pass through the State? If this material can be transported safely and the material is as benign as they say, if it is like picking up a carton of milk at 7-Eleven and taking it home, then they should have supported our amendment, but they did not do that. 
Mr. President, what is happening can best be illustrated by virtue of an editorial that appeared last week in the Washington Post newspaper. This editorial said, among other things, that this was not the appropriate thing to do, this is not the time to bring up this legislation.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, `Waste Vote in the Senate' is the headline. The Washington Post said: 
Our own sense is that the bill is the wrong solution to a genuine problem . . . Proponents like to say the nuclear alternative is clean when compared with such other sources of power as coal. It is until you get to the disposal issue: what to do with the spent fuel rods. Then it's the dirtiest of all . . . . 
The permanent storage decision is too important to be made under that kind of pressure. 
The Washington Post, Mr. President, said that we are being stampeded into a decision that will have long-term detrimental effects on this country. I believe the Washington Post. 
We also know that the President of the United States is going to veto this bill. He is going to veto this bill if it gets 100 votes, which it will not. He is going to veto this legislation no matter how many votes it gets, because Bill Clinton believes this is bad policy. 
The President has said in a statement of policy earlier this month, about a week ago, that this was bad policy for our country. This statement has been coordinated with all the Federal agencies. We should remember that the President is going to veto this for good reasons: It is bad policy. 
The easiest thing for the President of the United States to do would be to join with a vast majority who support this legislation, not the majority of people, because the President is helping to set public policy to oppose this legislation, but it would be easy for him, less controversial for him, if he would go along with the madding crowd here that says, `Let's support this legislation.' He won't do that for a number of reasons, not the least of which, as I indicated, it is bad public policy. 
We also know that the Secretary of Energy, Federico PenAE6a, opposes this legislation, with a letter directed to us on April 8, 1997.

The President has, and it has been in the last 20 years, an agency within the Executive Office of the President that gives the President advice on environmental issues. The chairperson of that very important office is Katie McGinty. Her office has advised the President this legislation is bad legislation. She has advised the minority leader and the majority leader of the U.S. Senate that it is bad policy.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, not only do we have Government agencies opposing this legislation, we have already established that the scientific community opposes this legislation. When this legislation was established, it was determined that there should be some nonpartisan, scientific group that could give the Congress and the President a scientific view as to what was happening on nuclear waste. 
The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board was established, and a group of scientists were selected. The chairman of this group is from prestigious Yale University. He is a dean at one of the schools there. They have said, do not support this legislation, interim storage of nuclear waste should not be. 
Mr. President, in addition to scientists, we also have environmental groups all over the country who oppose this legislation. 
So I guess I would say to the Chair and those within the sound of my voice, which position would you support? The position of the monopolistic nuclear utilities, the nuclear power lobby? Or the scientific community unions, like the United Transportation Union, environmentalists, and churches? I would say, first glance and second glance and third glance, you would go along with the churches, scientists and the environmentalists.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, native Americans have joined together almost in unison against this legislation. Native Americans also have an organization called National Environmental Coalition of Native Americans, NECONA. They have said this legislation is extremely bad. They have done this in the form of a letter written on March 31 of this year: 
[D]eveloping a storage facility now would jeopardize the repository program and has the added risk of prejudicing any future decision about the suitability of that site. . . 
The DOE lists 109 cities of over 100,000 people which would be impacted. Dozens of our tribes would also be impacted, and the most recent DOE survey of tribal and state capabilities to deal with nuclear transportation accidents revealed many serious gaps in preparedness.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, in short, this legislation is bad. The technical experts say it is bad. There is no technical or safety reason to move spent nuclear fuel. It is before us for one simple reason, and that is the power of the nuclear utilities. The motive of the nuclear utilities is more money. We have already established the huge profits they make. I compared their 17 percent average profit to what I learned in a case that I handled against Safeway Stores. They make a little over 1 percent on their volume. The nuclear utilities make 17 percent. This legislation is here, it is motivated by money, and they want more money. Their greed is endangering the American public, our fragile environment and the Nation's policy to develop a permanent repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. 
This bill, S. 104, is antienvironmental. The bill is opposed by every environmental group in America, as I have stated several times. This bill is a disaster for the environment. The public opposes this legislation because they see the facade of S. 104's hysterical claims of crisis for onsite storage. This is not true. 
The real motivation, we have established, is money. The best option is to leave it on site, right where it is today, Mr. President. We would save billions of dollars, and it would be safe. Everyone should be outraged by this legislation. No better evidence of bad legislation exists than that the provisions of the legislation prohibit discussion and full and open disclosure of the bill's consequences and its alternatives.

Mr. REID. I would just say that terrorists' modus operandi is to find areas of weakness so that they can spread terror. This, believe me, Mr. President, would spread terror. And that is an understatement. 
As my colleague from Nevada pointed out, S. 104 is not improved with the substitute. 
This substitute amendment is no better than S. 104 as originally submitted. 
The bottom line of this substitute is that the nuclear power industry and its allies insist that spent nuclear fuel be stored in Nevada no matter what. 
They did not address their real concern, they say, and that is transportation. They did not address environmental concerns. 
The bill now says that if Yucca Mountain is found unsuitable by the President, then a different interim storage site must be designated within 24 months. If that is not bad public policy, I cannot believe what would be. 
If a different interim site is not designated within that period, then Nevada would become the default storage site, even though it has already been determined scientifically to be inadequate for that purpose. 
Everybody knows that no alternative site can be designated in 24 months. Everybody knows we spent well over 15 years trying to decide whether Yucca Mountain is suitable. At least that much time would be required before another interim site could be designated. 
Yucca Mountain must be designated as interim storage site under S. 104 regardless of the suitability assessment. That is wrong. That makes a mockery of the scientific and objective process of site characterization at Yucca Mountain.

Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Minnesota, as we have laid across the Record here in these proceedings this past week, this legislation is bad legislation. If they, the proponents of this legislation, were truly concerned about the ratepayers and the fact that there is a court decision that says that the Federal Government is responsible under the contractual provisions that they entered into with the utilities, it would seem there should be something in the legislation agreeing to compensate utilities. Nothing. That shows how disingenuous the proponents of this legislation are. They talk about problems, but the legislation does not meet that. 
Some have complained, Mr. President, as has my friend from 
Minnesota, about the rate of progress toward determining Yucca Mountain's suitability for permanent disposition of this waste material. Others have complained about the returns from the investments in the Yucca Mountain characterization. Those who complain about the Yucca Mountain schedule should remember that the Congress has consistently underfunded the project budget. Requested levels for funding have never been met. In fact, allocations have been less than 75 percent of requested levels. 
Perhaps more importantly, this job of developing a permanent repository of nuclear waste is far more difficult than critics are willing to admit. It is far more difficult than even the technical community thought it would be when they started. That difficulty should not be a mystery. We are undertaking a mission that has never been done before. We are starting down a path to completely isolate from the environment the most dangerous material in human history for a period longer than recorded human history. 
We have no experience with such an assignment, so a lot of options must be explored to provide a foundation for the assumptions we must make to evaluate effectiveness of final design. Utilities have pushed these time lines. The reality of a permanent repository demands a research program in which many unforeseen obstacles must be understood and resolved. 
These things take time and money. The Congress has seen fit to deny the money, so more time has been required than was initially estimated. 
Complaints about returns on the investment in Yucca Mountain have no basis in fact either. Those who benefit from nuclear power have been paying into the nuclear waste repository at the rate of 1 mill per kilowatt hour. Those collections today amount to nearly $12 billion, much of which has yet to be spent. 
So there is a lot of talk about abuse of this fund by inappropriate application of its resources. It is true that more has been collected from the ratepayers than has been appropriated for waste disposal to date, but the final bill for a permanent repository is estimated to be between $34 billion and $50 billion. That is more than the current plan proposes to collect, so it is likely the ratepayers will come out ahead. 
That means the general public will contribute to the waste repository so that ratepayers will get a break before all is said and done. 
I agree that the waste fund should not be applied to inappropriate activities, and I do not think it has. I agree that we should be vigilant to see that all the ratepayers' contributions are used for the permanent disposition of spent nuclear fuel. But I also believe that the general taxpayers should not have to pick up the tab for a repository except for that fraction dedicated to disposition of defense nuclear waste from whose generation we all benefited through assurance of our national security.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which will set a uniform poll closing time for the continental United States. Election officials and political scientists for years have believed that early announcements, based on exit polls, discourage thousands of people from voting and affect the outcome of close races for other Federal, State and local offices. Less than 50 percent of eligible voters actually voted last year. As public officials, we have a responsibility to do everything we can to encourage voting, not dissuade it. Uniform poll closing times is a step in this direction. 
We are all aware that the controversy over early network projections is not a new one. Senator Barry Goldwater introduced a bill after the 1960 election prohibiting radio broadcast of any Presidential election returns until after midnight on election day. Network predictions 4 years later of Goldwater's landslide loss, and of Richard Nixon's landslide victory in 1972, spawned several Senate bills to muzzle radio and television. But none were enacted. 
In 1980, when new technology made it unnecessary for networks to wait for actual returns, the furor over early projections was brought to its highest pitch. In that year, voters in the West were told at 5 p.m., hours before their polls closed, who the next President of the United States would be. The three major networks trumpeted Ronald Reagan's victory long before the polls had closed in their States. After the election, our colleagues, Representatives Tim Wirth and Al Swift began a congressional search for a way to prevent early calls of elections. Numerous ideas were discussed as solutions to the problem of early projections based on exit polls, but there was no consensus. In addition to uniform poll closing times, shifting election day to Sunday, spreading voting over 2 days, making election day a national holiday and forbidding the networks from issuing predictions were proposed. Of course the best solution would be voluntary restraint on the part of the networks, but that has proven to be a failure. 
My legislation simply states that each polling place in the continental United States must close, with respect to a Presidential general election, at 10 p.m. eastern standard time. This means the polls with close at 7 p.m. Pacific time, 8 p.m. mountain time and 9 p.m. central time. I do not believe these times are unreasonable. It is my hope that this legislation will revive the debate over the use of exit polls. I welcome my colleagues to work with me for a solution.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say to my friend from Minnesota and my colleagues, I think this amendment improves the bill, but it is still a lousy bill. This bill is opposed by every environmental organization in America. We know from the record that has been laid before this body that you cannot transport nuclear waste at this stage safely. The dry cask storage containers simply will not allow it. If you go 30 miles an hour, have an accident and there is a fire, you are in big trouble carrying this product. 
This is a bad bill. It is a bad bill for the environment. As indicated by the experience in Germany, you cannot transport nuclear waste. I say to anyone who has any care about the environment, listen to what the environmental community is saying about this legislation. This legislation is bad. This amendment, while directed toward safety procedures for transporting nuclear waste, is a pinpoint in the universe. It does not help the legislation. This is bad legislation, as indicated by the scientific community and the environmental community. 
I yield back the remainder of the time.

<TEXT>
Mr. REID. Mr. President, during the last several years, in fact, during the entire time I have been in Congress, there has been an explosion of comment about returning matters to the States. This has been evidenced in a number of pieces of legislation we passed, including those in the last Congress dealing with immigration reform and especially that dealing with welfare reform. 
Matters have been returned to the States. Why? Because there have been feelings of many that there was an accumulation of power here in Washington that had taken away from the basic foundation of our constitutional form of Government. Too much power was being developed and too much power actually existed in Washington, DC, in the Federal level of Government. 
Mr. President, as a result of that, we, most everybody in Congress, have felt that we needed to return things to the States and have the chief executive of that State have the say of what goes on within the confines of that State. 
That is what this amendment deals with. If you are going to ship the most poisonous substance known to man across State lines, then, of course, you should get permission of the Governor. 
Many also in the majority have proclaimed that the 105th Congress, above all other Congresses, be a States rights Congress, the mantra of those avowed supporters of States rights, grounded in the notion that Congress has no right to impose costly and burdensome laws, rules and regulations on the States. In fact, I joined with the assistant leader of the majority, Don Nickles, in sponsoring an amendment to the regulation reform bill that came from the House last Congress, the Nickles-Reid amendment. That passed. In effect, what that amendment said is that Federal agencies are promulgating too many regulations without Congress having any authority or say as to what regulations they have promulgated. 
What the Nickles-Reid amendment said is that if there is a regulation promulgated that has a certain financial impact, then it does not go into effect for 60 days. If it has less than a $100 million economic impact, it goes into effect immediately, but we have 60 days to review it. That was only one example of how we felt that Congress should have more say in returning power to the people. 
Mr. President, the mantra of the States rights Congress is grounded in the notion that Congress has no right to impose these costly rules, laws and regulations on States. I respect this point of view, and that is the reason I joined with my friend, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, in sponsoring this legislation that passed without a single dissenting vote. It did not have a dissenting vote when we offered the amendment here; there was not a single dissenting vote when it came back from the House in conference. 
That said, it is ironic that some who consider themselves stalwart supporters of States rights are going to support this underlying legislation. If there is ever a bill that abrogated abuse of States rights in a more terrible manner than the underlying legislation, I do not know what that would be. It seems that when it comes to issues involving the most basic of States rights, the right to be free of living with deadly nuclear waste, this Congress does not care. We, Mr. President, are directing this amendment not to the States that have to live with nuclear waste, we are directing it to the States that are concerned about their highways and railways transporting this poison. 
It seems that we should care. How can anyone who considers themselves to be a supporter of States rights vote against this amendment? It is clear that States rights then, if, in fact, they do not vote for this amendment, is as hollow as the arguments that they could make on any specious legislation. The next time we hear moving oratory about the sanctity of the tenth amendment and the need to protect States rights, I will simply refer to this second-degree amendment and ask where those strong voices were on this issue involving the most fundamental of States rights. 
This amendment offered by this Senator and my colleague from the State of Nevada is something that every Senate office should listen to and listen to very closely. Remember what we are saying is that if you are going to transport nuclear waste through a State, the Governor should give the signoff. Why do I say that? What we are doing is saving this country a lot of problems by saying, `Let the Governors sign off.' Nuclear waste will not be transported in the United States. It does not matter how many bills we pass, it will not happen. 
I was in the House of Representatives this morning talking to one of the Presiding Officer's and this Senator's former colleague when we served in the other body, and he said to me, `You know, I voted with Congress on Vucanovich,' who supported this Senator's position on nuclear waste. He said, `I did it for a simple reason. If everyone says that nuclear waste can be transported safely, then, obviously, it is going to be safe where it is to begin with. Why not leave it where it is?' 
The reason I say we are doing this country a favor with this amendment is that nuclear waste is not going to be transported. Look at the experiences they had in Germany recently with the transfer of almost 500 canisters of high-level nuclear waste. They wanted to haul this 300 miles to a remote place in Germany. We are talking about hauling it more than 3,000 miles. 
What did it take in Germany to haul this nuclear waste 300 miles? It took 30,000 police and military personnel. The average speed was 2 miles an hour. It cost the German Government over $150 million. The German Parliament has said, `We're not going to do this anymore. We are going to review what we are doing.' 
As we speak, Germany's Parliament is reevaluating the entire program. They shipped 8 of 420 casks of high-level nuclear waste, and they have given up; 30,000 military and police personnel, 107 injuries, demonstrations everyplace, people dug holes in the road and put barriers over them so the trucks would fall in them when they came back. It was absolute civil disobedience at its worst. Why? Because the people of Germany are human beings, and they do not want this stuff hauled unnecessarily. That is what this amendment is all about. 
The two people representing the very fine State of South Carolina were Governors of that State. Two of the most--I am trying to find the word. When the history books are written about the U.S. Senate, the two Senators from South Carolina will be talked about, the senior Senator and the junior Senator. They have made history in this institution. But they also, before they came here, were Governors. They know what the power of the Governor should be. 
Shouldn't the Governor of a State, a sovereign State under our Federal system of Government, have the right and the opportunity to say, `We will let this stuff travel through, but I'm going to have to sign off on it first'? If the Governor of the State does not have that right to make sure that his 
citizens are safe and free of harm and that they can have enough personnel--in the instance of Germany, it took 30,000--shouldn't they have that right? That is what this amendment is all about. 
I do believe, without any question, we are doing a service with this amendment. We are doing a service because if you are going to believe in this form of Government that we have, we have a central whole divided amongst self-governing parts--that is the definition of our Government under the Constitution, a central whole divided amongst self-governing parts--those self-governing parts are States, and shouldn't they have the right to determine whether or not we are going to haul this stuff willy-nilly through the States? That is what this amendment is about. It is simple and direct. It says, if you are going to haul nuclear waste, let the Governor of the State through which you are going to haul it sign off on it.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, we need to make it very clear that this amendment, this second-degree amendment, is not directed toward Nevada. It is directed toward this sovereign Nation made up of 50 separate States. 
For example, Governor Beasley of South Carolina, before nuclear waste moves through that State, would have to sign off saying, yes, it should travel through the State of South Carolina. Governor Hunt of North Carolina would have to sign off saying, yes, it can travel through the State. Governor O'Bannon of Indiana, Governor Romer of Colorado, Governor Voinovich of Ohio--and we would go through the list--allowing nuclear waste to travel. 
I would say to people who espouse some degree of returning matters to the States, there is no better and more direct example than this. What we are saying is that the Governor of the State, the Governor of a sovereign State, one of the 50 sovereign States in this Nation, should have the right to determine if they want this stuff carried through their State. It is as simple as that. 
If it is in the best public interest of that State, the Governor will allow it. It would be better, I think, that Governor Beasley, Governor Hunt, Governor Romer, Governor O'Bannon, Governor Voinovich, Governor Wilson, Governor Miller would sign off rather than some nameless, faceless bureaucrat making the decision. 
So I think Members of this U.S. Senate are going to be put to a test today, a very simple test. Do they really believe in States rights or do they not? 
There will, of course, be one of the very clever things that has developed, with precedent, over here--a motion to table. The managers of this bill will move to table our second-degree amendment. And they will say to their friends, `Well, you're not really voting against States rights. This is a procedural matter. You'll never be bothered at home.' Well, there is no doubt in my mind that this will be something that constitutional bodies--those who believe in the constitutional form of Government, I should say, will target this as a very important States rights vote. This is it. You cannot run and hide from this. The motion to table will not do it. 
So I hope that everyone will understand that this is a basic States rights issue. If you want to carry, transport or haul nuclear waste through a State, all you have to do is go to the Governor and say, `Governor, it's in the public interest to do this. It's very important that you allow nuclear waste to travel through your State. And you can weigh the good and the bad.' Let the Governor decide, not somebody who works in the bowels of the Department of Energy down here on Independence Avenue.

Could the Senator see that happen?

Mr. REID. Madam President, the senior Senator from Idaho articulated the position that we have felt for several years. He did it clearly and concisely and directly when he said nuclear waste is safe. If that is the case, leave it where it is. That is what we say. If it is so safe, leave it where it is. There is no reason to change the law, to go around, to short-circuit, to sidestep the present law. Last year, $200-plus million were spent characterizing the site at Yucca Mountain. What this underlying bill does is just throw all that money away and goes and pours a cement pad on top of the ground and dumps all the spent fuel rods on the cement pad. 
The amendment that is now before this body says that if you are going to transport nuclear waste through a State, the Governor must allow that to happen. We certainly, under this Constitution, this Constitution that we all live by and talk about, have the obligation, we have the right to set standards as to how the flow of commerce will take place. 
The senior Senator from Idaho said that you are moving Federal property. Certainly, doesn't the Federal Government, the Congress of the United States have the ability and the right to determine how Federal property is going to be moved? That is an inherent right we have, to determine the flow of commerce over our sovereign borders. 
Continually, there have been efforts to say this is only a Nevada problem, this is just a couple of Senators from Nevada carping about a provincial interest; nobody else in the world cares about this other than the Senators from Nevada. 
Madam President, every environmental organization in America opposes this legislation, and I say every. I also say that we only need look around. The United Transportation Union, you would think that this union would be really enthused about hauling large cargo. No, they are not real enthused. In fact, in a letter of April 8 of this year, the national director of this union, with a copy of a letter to the international president, C.L. Little, states: 
In its present form, S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, advocates a reckless and unsafe shipping campaign of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. 
Madam President, the United Transportation Union, to my knowledge, does not have a local. It does not have a local union in Nevada. If it does, I do not know about it. There may be one up in the northern part of the State where the railroad goes through, but I really doubt it. This letter is not driven by Nevada interests. It is driven by the United Transportation Union that cares about its members and wants safe transportation of products. The letter goes on to say: 
The Chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board has testified to serious deficiencies in the transportation planning and preparation that are so necessary to execute this campaign safely . . . 
Serious questions remain regarding containment integrity of the transportation canisters that would have to be designed, tested, evaluated, certified and procured. Presently the country has only a few shipping containers that were developed and tested a number of years ago. 
I was going to say a long time ago, which is, in fact, the case. 
These have apparently proven durable under some accident environments. 
And we talked about that. If the accident occurs and you are not going more than 30 miles an hour, you are in pretty good shape. If the fire isn't burning more than 1,400 degrees, you are OK. Of course, diesel burns at 1,800 degrees. They go on to say: 
The NRC certification requirements for newly manufactured containers have raised serious concerns regarding their integrity. 
That is the ones that are now in existence. 
A program of design and full-scale testing is desperately needed to generate confidence that the transportation campaign could be done safely. 
This is the not driven by Nevada interests. This is driven by interests of a national union that is concerned about what is shipped across the railways of this country. 
Now, I know there are Baptist churches in Nevada, but I have to tell you, I do not have enough power over the Baptist churches in Nevada to have them prepare a letter from the entire Baptist ministry of this country opposing this legislation. I wish I had that ability, but I do not. 
In spite of that, Madam President, just a few days ago they wrote a letter to every Senator in this body saying, among other things:

Mr. REID. I would answer my friend's question. We have made, since this bill came up, we have made $21 billion for the country. The figure was originally $80 billion. You heard the remarks of the proponents of this legislation. They said it is down to $59 billion. The truth is it should be down in the low millions, because to store this substance onsite costs almost nothing. The average cost per site is $5 million. Let us say we have 100 sites. We have 109 sites. We are talking about $50 million or whatever it is. Significantly less than $59 billion.

But that is only secondary to the issues that affect this whole country and that is why the Baptist Ministries, the United Transportation Union and the people from Missouri--and I only picked a few of the letters. As you know, there are several hundred organizations that we know of--oppose this legislation, which is so unsafe for the environment and so unnecessary, and only being driven by the gluttonous utilities of this country.

Mr. REID. So, Madam President, what we are saying is that this amendment simply establishes what should be the law of this land. That is, if you are going to haul, as indicated in the chart behind the manager of the bill and the chart behind my colleague from the State of Nevada, showing all these routes all over the country, what we are saying is this product, if it is going to be transported through a State, the Governor should give the OK. 
We have been told here for several days now that transporting this product is going to be just as safe as carrying a quart of milk from the store to your home. If that is the case, the Governors that I have mentioned, Beasley, Hunt, Romer, O'Bannon, Voinovich, Wilson from California, Miller from Nevada--and all the other fine Governors, chief executives of the States, they should be able to sit down with their staffs, it should be explained to them how safe this is, they would sign on the dotted line, and their constituents would feel happy that the government was protecting their interests. 
If we do not do this we are going to wind up with a situation that has already occurred in recent days in Europe where, to move this product in the country of Germany, 300 miles, you had to call up 30,000 police and armed guards to transport at the rate of 2 miles an hour. They had to go 2 miles an hour because people had dug huge holes under the roadways and put in, in effect, disguised covers so these vehicles would fall into them--2 miles an hour. There were 170 people injured, hundreds of people arrested. And Germany's parliament said we are not going to do this anymore. We are going to reassess our situation. 
That is what we should be doing here, but we cannot reassess the situation because the utilities, with all of their money, are dictating what is going on here on the Senate floor. That is what this amendment is all about.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to briefly respond to my friend, the manager of this legislation. I say that it appears that, if we continue to work the way we have today and yesterday, we should be able to work something out on a final disposition of this at a time when the leaders wish that to be done. 
The one thing I want to make very clear, Mr. President, is that we have to respond to a statement of my friend from Alaska that this is a crisis that we are dealing with. The only crisis we are dealing with is the pocketbook of the utilities--not that they are going to be burdened with huge costs, but it may cut down some of their profit margin. These companies are making huge profits, as was indicated in the chart yesterday, which is now spread across the record of this Senate. The utilities are making huge amounts of money to generate electricity by virtue of nuclear power. 
There is no crisis, as far as needing to undercut or circumvent the present law. The present law says that at Yucca Mountain in Nevada--they are characterizing a mountain, Yucca Mountain. In that mountain, we have a huge tunnel that is being bored by a big boring machine. The cost of that hole in the ground is $60,000 a foot. That has now gone almost 5 miles through that mountain. When I say `through the mountain,' it is in a horseshoe shape almost 5 miles long. 
This Government appropriated almost $200 million last year for the purposes of continuing the characterization of that mountain. The work at Yucca Mountain has been going on now for more than a decade. It seems to me rather strange that we would waste all the money, billions of dollars, to determine if in fact that site is suitable. 
What this legislation does is simply say that we are going to pour a cement pad in the middle of the desert and dump this stuff on top of the ground, not protect it from the weather, the elements, or anything else. 
Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, who would you rather trust, the hundreds of organizations that oppose this legislation, including the Baptist Ministry and the United Transportation Workers, who have to deal with products on a daily basis traveling across this country, and the Missouri Alliance, which I read from this morning, organizations like that, or nuclear utilities? Nuclear utilities are the only organizations pushing this legislation. 
I have mentioned a number of times that one of the most important elements of policy is public confidence that the Government knows what it is doing and their interests are being accommodated. Nuclear waste disposal efforts have, time and time again, demonstrated that we, the Government, don't know what we are doing. We have rewritten policy any number of times. We have abandoned the notion of characterizing more than one site because it was too difficult to decide which sites to study. We have changed the acceptance criteria in midstream because it was too difficult to prove that Yucca Mountain would be acceptable. 
I just think that this policy is bad. To think that we are now going to transport this stuff over 3,000 miles because utilities want us to do it is ridiculous. We can't transport nuclear waste. We don't have the containers to do it safely. We don't have the transportation routes to do it safely. Why are we doing this mad rush to satisfy the gluttonous utilities? I don't think there is a good reason in public policy to do so. 
So I hope that my colleagues will understand that there is no emergency. There is no crisis to transport nuclear waste. As indicated by one of the sponsors of this legislation, the senior Senator from Idaho, it is safer--I am not paraphrasing it--it is safer to transport nuclear waste than it is to buy a carton of milk at the store and take it to your home. It is safer to transport nuclear waste. Well, if that is the case, then I think we should go one step further in safety and leave it where it is. If the cooling ponds are filled and there is no more room for spent fuel rods, then do what they are doing at a number of sites in this country. Reuse the dry cask storage--use the containment policy. It is cheap and extremely efficient while we await the determination as to whether or not Yucca Mountain is a suitable site.

They should run from this bill. This is another reason that we should be so thankful we have a constitutional form of government and we have a President who is willing to veto bad legislation. This is bad legislation, getting worse every hour we spend on this floor. 
Now the numbers are changing. We are not talking about a few dollars here and a few dollars there; we are talking about $2.7 billion that the ratepayers are going to have to cough up early. This is another example of the gluttonous nuclear utilities taking advantage of the general public. We know we do not have the numbers, as has been proven, because the utilities seem to have a lock on this bill. They are the ones marching it through this Congress. But 16 blocks away, on Pennsylvania Avenue, we have someone who is going to veto this legislation. That is all we have left, because it is very clear that the nuclear utilities have a lock on this legislation that is getting worse by the hour.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the statement of the Senator from Tennessee is valid, and I am confident that it is, then the 
Senator should oppose this legislation, because if he believes that there is potential damage to residents of the State of Tennessee, then certainly he should understand that there is significant risk to the people of Nevada. The State of Nevada, people think of as a big wasteland. The fact of the matter is that not far from the Nevada test site are over a million people. 
We have significant problems. But not only are there problems in Tennessee and in Nevada; what about the entire route of this transportation? If the Senator from Tennessee is concerned about transportation of nuclear waste within the State of Tennessee, he likewise should be concerned about the transportation of nuclear waste across this country. 
We have established, Mr. President, that there are significant groups who are opposed to this legislation. We have yet to find anyone other than utilities companies who favor this legislation, and the utility companies that favor it are necessarily nuclear facilities, with some exceptions. 
We have talked this morning and been given a few examples on this floor about the Baptists who oppose this legislation and the United Transportation Workers and an organization in Missouri. We could give hundreds of examples. But I thought it would be appropriate because people believe--I hope they believe--if you are going to side with the Baptists or the nuclear utilities, you should go with the Baptists. But in case someone is concerned about that, we will look at the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. They wrote a letter to every Senator in this body on March 20 of this year, where they have said, `Don't support S. 104.' 
In addition to the risks of S. 104, it is objectionable because it weakens environmental standards for nuclear waste disposal by carving loopholes in NEPA, preempting other environmental laws and limiting licensing standards for a permanent repository. 
That, Mr. President, really says it all. If, on March 20, they felt that environmental standards were being weakened and loopholes were being carved into the legislation, look what this legislation now is. Every hour that goes by there is a new loophole. We raise a point of order with the Budget Act. Well, what we will do, we will make the utilities and the ratepayers pay $2.7 billion a little early. We want to carve another loophole here for Washington. We will do one for South Carolina, one for Tennessee. 
The Evangelical Lutheran church in America opposes this legislation, not because of the Senators from Nevada but because of the Members of their ministry throughout this country. This is some of the worst legislation--and I have been in this Congress for going on 15 years; I know a lot about this legislation--that has ever come through this body. You talk about special-interest legislation; this is it. The Congress has been appropriating for about 15 years a couple hundred million dollars a year, sometimes more than that, examining, characterizing Yucca Mountain. This legislation just basically throws it out. That is what the Evangelical Lutheran church says. This legislation wipes out the legislation for a permanent repository, which is the only hope of having a safe place to store it if, in fact, that can happen. 
If the Senator from Tennessee is concerned about safe transportation, he and the other Members of this body should revisit what has taken place in Europe. I repeat, 30,000 troops and soldiers to carry six nuclear waste canisters 300 miles in Germany--30,000 troops.There were one hundred seventy people injured. Many went to the hospital. And it cost $150 million to move it at the rate of 2 miles an hour. In addition to that--you think we have concerns about Chattanooga and Oak Ridge being close to a proposed nuclear site?--look what happened in Germany. I am reading from the letter.  
The transport of these 6 casks required 30,000 police and $150 million, more than 170 people were injured, more than 500 arrested. Even the police have called for an end of the shipments. They no more like arresting demonstrators, who many sympathize with, than they like guarding highly radioactivity waste casks. 
The writer goes on, `I measured the radiation of these casks at 15 feet.' 
Mr. President, that distance is from this Senator to the Presiding Officer. The radiation at 15 feet was 50 times higher than background levels, an amount no one should be voluntarily exposed to, and pregnant women and children should never be exposed to. The police, of course, stand much closer than 15 feet, and for hours at a time. No wonder the German parliament has abandoned and suspended the transportation of nuclear waste in Germany. Why? Because you cannot do it. 
So if the sponsors of this amendment are concerned about the safety of the people from Tennessee, then they should be concerned about the safety of the people of this country. 
What is the answer to the nuclear waste problem? Leave it where it is in dry cask storage containment or in the cooling ponds. As the representative from the State of Oregon told me this morning in the House, that is why he sided with 
Representative Vucanovich. If it is safe to transport these nuclear casks, these dry casks--which it is not, we have already established--if it is so safe, leave it where it is. That is why he supported Representative Vucanovich in the past. 
This amendment is special legislation, and my friend from Tennessee should be concerned, as I know he is concerned, about the people of this country in addition to the people of Tennessee. That being the case, this amendment shows how fallacious and weak and unsupportable this bill is. It is a bill that is rife with gluttonous nuclear utility industry. That is the only reason it is here and the only reason it is being pushed. This legislation is faulty. It is fake. It is insincere. I said this legislation; I did not say this amendment.

Mr. REID. While the Senator is getting ready, I would like to say a few things. 
First of all, there is no question that the two Senators from Nevada are doing everything we can to protect the State of Nevada. But in the process of preparing, as we have for years, for this debate, we have also come to the conclusion that this is not a Nevada issue; this is an issue for the well-being of all the people of this country. That is why organizations throughout this country support opposition to S. 104--churches, environmental groups, and cities are passing resolutions. 
The only supporters of this legislation are the very powerful nuclear industry who generate electricity. For example, there has been some talk in this debate that the facility in Connecticut, the Haddam Neck reactor fuel pool would be full by 2001 and the plant might have to close. There has been testimony before the Natural Resources Committee on February 5 that Haddam Neck permanently closed on December 4, 1996, for reasons that had nothing to do with waste disposal issues. 
Mr. President, fuel fill-up dates have been exaggerated for reactors that have been examined. This is just all part of the game played by the individuals who do not have rules--the nuclear power generating companies. They change the rules. They change the rules in the very middle of the ball game. They change the rules during timeouts. It doesn't matter. Whatever meets their greedy financial interests they satisfy that by changing the rules in the middle of the game. 
Right now we have 109 operating reactors in the United States. All of their waste is stored on site. In effect, S. 104 would create 110 storage sites for nuclear waste using the same technology that is already used at some reactor sites and is available to all the reactor sites. 
Why in the world would we want to create another site when we are spending $200 million a year trying to determine if Yucca Mountain is suitable?

Mr. REID. That is right. Although after S. 104, not only would you have the additional site near Las Vegas, but in addition to that you would have a significant number of other temporary sites caused because of accidents, traffic jams, and protests. I mean that is what is not on the bottom chart. Not only do we have the proposed temporary repository near Las Vegas but you will have several temporary sites as a result of the chaos that will ensue with this legislation.

Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Nevada, we would have to show on this chart after S. 104 massive traffic jams. Remember, to move it in Germany recently, it took 30,000 police. In addition to the 30,000 police, it required medical personnel to haul the people to the hospital. Five hundred people were arrested. The waste only went 300 miles. Think about what would happen if they were to move it 3,500 miles from the State of Maine to the State of Nevada. 
So I appreciate the question. The chart is very graphic and shows the potential danger of not having 109 sites but maybe having 125 sites because of what would occur as a result of moving this. 
I repeat. Mr. President, if in fact these casks are so good, leave them where they are. In fact, it has been said during the debate here today that the present technology of the casks indicate you can haul it, but in a crash of more than 30 miles an hour the container might be breached, or if you had a fire that occurred as you are hauling that and the fire burns at more than 1,400 degrees you are in big trouble. And the big trouble would occur because diesel fuel burns at 1,800 degrees. That is what propels trains and trucks. 
So the question is asked all the time. What do you want to do with it? You leave it where it is until there is a determination made that we can transport it safely and there is a site to accept it. 
I also am compelled to respond to a number of things said earlier today by my friend from Idaho. In fact, the description was used of picking up a quart of milk at a store and taking it home. He said no, no. Nuclear waste is safer to transport than that. Well, try to explain that to the people that have really transported nuclear waste. If you look at what has gone on in this country, you will find that Japan is actively pursuing a nuclear program based on reprocessing of nuclear fuel with the aim of becoming energy independent. We understand why. They have no 
natural resources. But the facts speak volumes of different language. A serious accident at the Honshu breeder reactor, the flagship of the Japanese reprocessing program, in December 1995, ended all thoughts that Japan could breed its own nuclear fuel. Honshu to this day has not been restarted and probably will never restart. 
A second serious accident at the Tokyo reprocessing facility in March 1997, just a few weeks ago, ended all thoughts of reprocessing as a serious option, in Japan. In fact, Japan cannot site any new nuclear plants due to overwhelming public opposition. This fact has been acknowledged in numerous newspaper accounts. The Japanese Government is now laying aside all hopes for nuclear expansion, and with reprocessing no longer a viable option Japan now faces a problem. But to think it can be transported safely is just not true. 
I would also respond to my friend from Idaho. There has been talk here by him and others that there have been several thousand shipments, a couple of thousand shipments of high-level nuclear waste made in the United States up to this date. Of course, these shipments, mostly of naval reactor fuel, were not only far smaller than any shipment contemplated under this bill but carried a radioactive inventory of thousands of curies rather than tens of millions of curies that would be carried by each cask from a commercial reactor. 
These shipments typically travel far fewer miles. There were seven accidents in these 2,400 shipments. A ratio of one accident for every 343 shipments. I say to my friend from Nevada. It has been established here that there has been one nuclear accident for every 343 trips. I ask my friend. Is it not true that there is contemplated at least 17,000 shipments of nuclear garbage under this bill?

Mr. REID. I also ask my friend. Then, if it has been established that there would be 2,400 shipments and that we would have 7 accidents, a little math indicates to me that there would be about 50 accidents if the same ratio is maintained hauling these 17,000 shipments. Wouldn't that be about right?

Is it any wonder that every environmental group in the United States supports the defeat of S. 104? In addition to churches as has been laid on the Record, transportation unions believe that this legislation is truly a nightmare.

Mr. REID. We have been here now for several days. Every question that has been asked by the Senator from Idaho has an answer that is much different than the answer given by my friend from Alaska. 
The fact of the matter is, that there are hundreds of nuclear tests at the Nevada test site. That was part of the national security of this country. Nevada did not run with open arms `bring these aboveground nuclear tests and kill all our animals, make people have cancer.' We did not know at the time. But in spite of it, all of the nuclear tests described by my friend from Idaho created 5 tons of nuclear waste--5 tons. They are talking about moving 85,000 tons to Nevada. 
This is not a Nevada issue. Our friends on the other side of the aisle are trying to make this a Nevada issue. It is not a Nevada issue. It is an issue that affects our country, this Nation.

Mr. REID. I would just say that is why, because of the aboveground tests, there was radiation which went various places because of the cloud. 
The fact of the matter is we all know such explosions are very dangerous. That is why they should continue the characterization at Yucca Mountain until they find a safe place to dispose of this garbage. 
The transportation is a problem, a significant problem. We have established that, I think, with substantive evidence today. 
Mr. President, suffice it to say we believe that the record is clear in answering every argument that has been suggested by the Senator from Idaho. I hope staff Members and Senators have had an opportunity to listen to this debate. We are where we are today because the nuclear power industry is trying to short circuit the system. There is no reason to transport nuclear waste to an interim storage site until there is a permanent repository. Even then, we have to be careful about the transportation. 
I do not want to go over the same arguments we have talked about on a number of occasions. It is my understanding there is to be a vote, and after that the leaders, hopefully, will be able to propound a unanimous consent request.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do not mean in any way to denigrate pigs. I like pigs. As far as I am concerned, they do not look too bad. But no matter how you dress up a pig, formal clothes or dress, it still looks like a pig. And this legislation, no matter how you dress it up, still appears to be garbage. It is a bill that is not good legislation. No matter how you dress it up, it is a bad piece of legislation. Not the least reason for that, Mr. President, is the fact that now, this year, we are trying to interchange the word `viability' with `suitability.' They are two totally different concepts with two totally different meanings. 
As defined by the Department of Energy, viability is simply a finding that to that point in time, no disqualifying characteristic has been found. It simply says to this point we have not yet found anything wrong. It does not mean that the site will be suitable. Subsequent to viability, there is significant additional technical study to be pursued in the context of a repository design. The site could still be found unsuitable for an extended period later, while they find out if it is suitable. So an assessment of viability does not mean much. 
This distinction between viability and suitability has been repeatedly pointed out to the Congress. It is a shame that in this debate, this year, we are now trying to satisfy the element of suitability by using the word `viability.' The distinction was emphasized by the immediate past Director of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, who cannot be considered someone who is opposed to the nuclear industry. He simply said the finding of suitability is much different and a much higher standard than the finding of viability. 
The distinction was emphasized in S. 104 testimony by the Chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. He said repeatedly, as did the former Chairman of the Office of Radioactive Waste Management, `Do not confuse viability with suitability. Suitability is the final step before license applications can be pursued. No centralized interim storage should be approved before that suitability decision has been made.' This is very clear. So, in this debate let us not confuse suitability with viability. 
There have been constant statements made on this Senate floor during the past few days that nuclear waste transportation is just fine, they do it other places. How many times have we heard statements, people saying we transport nuclear waste all over? Let me read from a letter written to my colleague, Senator Richard Bryan, on March 28, 1997. This is not something that took place in ancient history. This is a brandnew letter. Let me read it: 
Dear Senator Bryan: As the Senate prepares for a vote on S. 104, I thought you might find my recent experience with real-world transportation of radioactive waste in Gorleben, Germany of interest. 
In early March, I was part of an international team which monitored the transport of six CASTOR casks of high-level atomic waste from southern Germany to the small northern farming community of Gorleben, a distance of about 300 miles. My experiences are chronicled in the enclosed issue of the Nuclear Monitor. But I want to add just a few points. 
Too often, I feel like many of your Senate colleagues believe nuclear waste transportation is just another routine industrial endeavor and that, if they vote for a bill like S. 104, this transport will just be carried out with few problems. 
The reality in Germany is quite different. The CASTOR shipments were met with protest every mile of the way. The shipments were front page news in every German newspaper the entire week I was in the country. Near Gorleben, a farming area and home of the `interim' waste storage facility, opposition to the transport and the `interim' facility is very nearly unanimous. In some towns nearby, I could not find a single house or farm that did not display anti-CASTOR, anti-nuclear, and anti-government signs. Farmers barricaded roads, and dug holes under them so the 100-ton CASTOR casks could not travel across them. Schoolchildren were forcibly removed from their schools, so police could use them as staging areas. The CASTOR transports had changed a quiet, conservative region of Germany into a bastion of protest and anger, causing a divisiveness in German society only now being recognized by the German Parliament, which has begun hearings on the issues. 
The transport of these six casks required 30,000 police and $100 million. More than 170 people were injured during demonstrations, more than 500 arrested. Even the police have called for an end to the shipments; they no more like arresting demonstrators (who many sympathize with) than they like guarding highly radioactive waste casks. I personally measured the radiation from one of these casks: at 15 feet, it was 50 times higher than background levels--an amount no one should involuntarily be exposed to, and pregnant women and children should never be exposed to. The police, of course, stand much closer than 15 feet, and for hours at a time. 
Eight casks, of 420, have been shipped to Gorleben. Total cost to the German government has been about $150 million. Each shipment the protests and anger increase, instead of dying down. 
Perhaps obviously, while watching the casks lumber down the highway toward Gorleben, at about 2 miles per hour (it took them about six hours to move the final 14 miles), surrounded by police and protestors, I reflected on what this might mean to our own radioactive waste programs. We're not trying to move six casks, or eight, or even 420. Under S. 104, we could be moving as many as 70,000 casks--not six in one year, but six every day. And we wouldn't be moving them 300 miles, but many hundreds and thousands of miles at a time. 
I frankly don't know if we will experience protests like those in Germany, though I suspect we will. But I do know we will experience the same type of anger expressed by the local farmers and townspeople, the same type of distrust of government and authority, and the same kinds of societal divisions. And I have to ask myself, has anyone in the Senate actually thought about what these waste shipments could mean? I fear not. 
Nor, I am convinced, is the U.S. government as prepared as the German government to handle these shipments. Germany was able to place 30,000 police, brought in from all across the country, along the transport route. Medical people and the Red Cross were well in evidence. The first line of emergency responders--the police--obviously were present for every mile of the transport. And they were clearly well-trained, if sometimes visibly uncomfortable in their roles. 
It will not work to simply load up a huge cask of high-level atomic waste from a nuclear utility and send it onto an American highway or railway like a truck or boxcar carrying cars or oranges or even gasoline or some other hazardous material. Radioactive waste shipments are qualitatively different and require much more thought, planning and contemplation than the U.S. Senate so far appears willing to provide. 
In the end, it required establishment of a literal police state in the Wendland area of Germany, and very nearly a war zone, to complete this cask movement. I do not believe this would be a credible or accepted policy in the United States. 
With only eight of 420 casks shipped, Germany's Parliament is re-evaluating the entire program. Perhaps we can learn from them, and begin our re-evaluation before the shipments start. 
I would be happy to further brief you or your colleagues on my experiences at your convenience. 
It is signed by Michael Mariotte. 
So, Mr. President, saying you can ship these casks with no problem is just not common sense, in light of what has happened in other places of the world. In the country of Germany, a very sophisticated country, Parliament has had to stop the shipment program. 
This substitute is no different from the bill as originally submitted. S. 104 and its nuclear industry advocates insist that waste will be stored in Nevada no matter what. And they do not at all consider the transportation problems, as I indicated we should. The substitute amendment says that if Yucca Mountain is determined unacceptable by the President, then a different interim storage site must be designated within 24 months. If a different interim site is not so designated within that period, then Nevada would become the default storage site. 
Sponsors of S. 104 in this Senate and the nuclear industry know that no such designation is possible within 24 months. Everyone knows that. That is why this substitute is as big a sham as the original bill. As I indicated, you can dress up a pig however you want, but it is still a pig. This legislation is still garbage, no matter how they try to dress it up. 
They know that there has been spent to this point over a decade trying to understand the area around Yucca Mountain well enough to approve permanent storage there. They want to void the billions of dollars spent in Yucca Mountain and sidetrack, short-circuit the system. They know that any site that receives nuclear waste will keep it forever, because a permanent repository will never be built. That is the whole game of the very powerful, greedy, devious, deceptive nuclear waste industry. They do not want to play by the rules. They want to have their own game where they set their own rules, as they are trying to do in S. 104, and they are trying to doctor it up by saying we have made the goal lines not 100 yards apart, they are only 80 yards apart. That is not true. 
They know once waste is moved from its generator site to a centralized site, it will never be moved again. A suitability decision will permit designation of a site. Viability will not. 
So the only possible way to proceed, the only way to overcome the overwhelming opposition to centralized interim storage, is to designate an interim storage site at a place that has already been found suitable for permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. That is the only way to do it. 
It is this inability to see that S. 104 is putting the horse behind the cart, that is, establishing an interim site before a suitability decision--it is this blindness that compels me to believe S. 104 is really all about sabotaging this country's avowed policy to permanently dispose of nuclear waste. 
The industry, with all their money and all their profits, want to change the system. They want to change the rules in the middle of the ball game. Everyone knows that Nevada is not happy with Yucca Mountain. But at least some rules have been established there, where scientists have at least some say in what is going on there. And the reason the nuclear waste industry is willing to change--wants to change the rules in the middle of the game is they know that Yucca Mountain is being, at this stage, studied, analyzed, and characterized in a fair fashion. 
Think about it. S. 104 would move nuclear waste to Nevada and store it there permanently at a site that has been found unsuitable for that purpose. I repeat. Think about it. S. 104 would move nuclear waste to Nevada and store it there permanently at a site that has been found unsuitable for that purpose. What could be more outrageous than that? 
Such a policy goes beyond stupidity, goes beyond unfairness. It would knowingly risk public health and safety by storing waste at a site that has been determined to be an unsafe site, and, by storing waste on an open, concrete pad, exposed----

Mr. REID. I thank the Chair. 
By storing waste on an open, concrete pad, exposed to the weather and all manner of natural and accidental damage. That is wrong. Permanent storage, because that is what it would be, at a temporary site would be about the worst decision this Senate could make. 
This legislation, this so-called substitute, is as bad as the original bill. I defy anyone to controvert what we have talked about here today, about the problems they had in Germany. Eight casks out of 420, moved 300 miles, not thousands of miles like we are moving them here. They had to call out 30,000 police and army personnel to allow those to proceed, at a cost of $150 million. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, let me respond to a number of things brought up by my friend, the manager of this bill. 
First of all, he is right about nuclear power. It produces a lot of electricity in the United States. But everyone recognizes those days are numbered. The average life expectancy of nuclear power in the United States is 15 years. After that it is going to be gone. 
As I indicated yesterday, it might be 25 years with one of the reactors and it may 5 years with another. But nuclear power is all through in this country. It simply is too dangerous, and everyone knows that. 
I will also speak to the question of what to do with spent fuel. That question has been raised. Senator Bryan and I continually answer the question. It is very easy. We should leave it where it is--capsulated in the spent fuel rods kept in dry cask containers. 
As Senator Bryan mentioned today and I mentioned yesterday, there would be no fire that would damage the dry cask storage containers as would happen in a diesel truck or train. There would be no accident that would occur driving at speeds that would rupture the casks. It is safe and it is cheap. That is what should be done with nuclear waste for the foreseeable future. 
I will also state, Mr. President, that the question still has never been answered: What about the environmental groups? Hundreds of them oppose this legislation--not two or three, not 20 or a couple score, but hundreds that are now a part of the record. 
No question has ever been answered as to why these environmental groups oppose the legislation. They oppose the legislation because it is dangerous for the environment. It would be different if there was an equal balance, half of them supported it and half of them did not. Every one of them--it is exclusive--all environmental groups oppose this legislation. 
Let me also say, Mr. President, one of the things being lost in this debate is the fact that as we speak hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent in characterizing the repository at Yucca Mountain to determine if in fact that site is going to be scientifically safe for storage of nuclear waste. I repeat, this past year hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent. Next year the same--hundreds of millions of dollars will be spent characterizing that site. 
Let us not lose sight of the fact that this legislation is a way to avoid the permanent repository. The very powerful, greedy nuclear industry that is promulgated by the utilities, basically what they want to do is short-circuit the present system. They do not want to take their chances at Yucca Mountain in having a safe, scientifically characterized site. They want to circumvent the system. They want to do away with environmental laws. They want to void the present law that says you cannot have temporary storage in the same State where a permanent site is being considered. 
Why have we not heard anything about Yucca Mountain? That used to be the big debate. Because the nuclear industry wants to avoid Yucca Mountain. They want to do it the cheap way. 
We have heard raised continually the fact that Nevada used to be a place where they set off bombs, atmospheric tests and underground tests, and more than 900, almost 1,000 of those tests have been detonated. 
As I stated, the State of Nevada has sacrificed significantly for that. We did it because there were hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of nuclear warheads pointed at the State of Nevada and 
the United States. Conversely, the United States of America pointed their weapons at the Soviet Union. The cold war has terminated. I repeat, this ended a dangerous era. It was a time of national crisis. We were all called upon to do what was necessary to protect this country. The State of Nevada did its share. We did what was right at a time of crisis. 
The time has come now, though, to understand that that was then and this is now. There is presently no danger that would drive us to endanger our environment or public by reckless and ill-conceived actions. That is what this legislation is. 
There is no nuclear waste crisis that any objective and competent study has been able to uncover. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board has testified to the lack of urgency and crisis with respect to moving spent nuclear fuel from its generation sites. The chairman of the board, under the direction of this Congress, testified last year, and now the new chairman this year, that `There is no urgent, technical or safety reason to move spent fuel to a centralized storage facility.' So there is no emergency. 
Moreover, existing contamination from early nuclear tests is not at all comparable to the potential contamination from premature and reckless storage of spent nuclear fuel in Nevada. 
Mr. President, one transportation container of spent nuclear fuel contains about the same amount of radioactive waste as 200 nuclear tests. One transportation container that will travel through the State of Colorado and many other States in this country contains the same amount of radioactive waste as from 200 nuclear tests. 
We are contemplating more than 15,000 shipments of spent nuclear fuel. Some of these shipments will have two containers. So more than 3,000 times the amount of contamination from the nuclear testing program--3,000 times as much would be stored in the repository. 
Measured another way, each nuclear explosion generates 125 pounds of radioactive material per megaton of yield. The average yield of tests conducted in Nevada is much less than the maximum yield permitted under the limited test ban treaty. Assuming the average yield to be about 85 kilotons, the total testing program in Nevada would have generated only about 5 tons of radioactive waste. 
They are trying to move, with this cheap legislation, 70,000 tons of nuclear waste to Nevada. So anyone who compares the nuclear tests in Nevada, which build up 5 tons of radioactive waste, are either exaggerating, deceiving the American public, or do not know what they are talking about. 
And anyone who wants can make their choice of the three. The fact is, scientifically, we have 5 tons of radioactive waste compared to 70,000 tons that they are going to try to haul along the railways and highways of this Nation. 
Is it any wonder, Mr. President, that entities--cities, municipalities, counties--throughout this country have passed resolutions saying: Do not bring it through our cities. 
Complete and enduring isolation of this highly radioactive material is necessary if we are to avoid many times the danger and damage caused by the nuclear testing program. 
Mr. President, there has also been a lot of debate on this floor about onsite storage of spent nuclear fuel: It is going to break the country. It is going to break the power generating companies. 
Well, let me just say this. This is, for lack of a better description, a scare tactic. It has no foundation in fact. Those who are propounding this have dismissed any thought of risk to the environment or to public health and safety, and any mention of such risk is waved away as scare tactics. 
The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board--remember we keep referring to this because it is a scientific body that we have deemed legislatively to tell us what to do with nuclear waste--the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board agrees that new transportation containers deserve full-scale testing to assure that 
these are as durable as those designed, tested, and procured many, many years ago. 
That has not been done. The Technical Review Board agrees that we are not ready to undertake this massive program of nuclear waste shipments. That is why they have said, do not ship them. The scientific body, I repeat, this Congress has designated to tell us how to deal with nuclear waste, has told us, do not ship it. 
The board agrees that a lot of planning is necessary and that it is crucial for emergency response teams all along the planned routes to be provided with equipment and training for managing the accidents that will happen, even with the best of planning. 
The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board goes further. They agree with the Senators from Nevada that it is absolutely critical that the promise of objective characterization that we have been given in years gone by be completed before any nuclear waste is shipped to Nevada. The board agrees that the 105th Congress should honor those promises made in earlier legislation. 
The board agrees that serious uncertainties remain with respect to Yucca Mountain's suitability. The board's chairman testified to these concerns during the S. 104 hearings. 
But let us go forward with Yucca Mountain. Let us not short circuit the system and have this legislation which is being promulgated and propounded and pushed by the very powerful nuclear utilities in this country. 
The board agrees about these uncertainties. The board agrees that this process must proceed objectively without a hint of prejudice of even the appearance of a premature decision. Without this promise of high quality, objective assessment, the American people will never believe that permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel can be done safely. 
So, Mr. President, we are not using scare tactics. We are merely standing up for the public health and safety of our country's environment and for protecting the public confidence in the final disposition of spent nuclear fuel. 
Instead of doing their job, the nuclear power industry, this powerful, disingenuous industry, and its lobby are busy using scare tactics to try to saddle the American taxpayer with the costs of managing the consequences of all of its profits. 
These profits are, for lack of a better description, Mr. President, obscene. The nuclear power industry is required to report its costs and revenues annually. All utilities must do this because they represent a virtual monopoly. The so-called retained earnings of power utilities, with at least 20-percent nuclear generation, average about 17 percent of total revenue. 
Mr. President, this chart which I have here--these are in thousands of dollars, so this is a billion. Commonwealth Edison, $1.083 billion net profit. This is not gross profits; net profit, 17.25 percent. Not bad. 
You can pick any one of them you want. Virginia Electrical, $731 million net profit, 17.54 percent. 
Look at it. 20.5 percent, 18.9 percent. The average, Mr. President, as I have indicated, have profits of more than 17 percent. 
I handled a case once. I sued Safeway Stores. The jury said I was entitled to punitive damages. I can remember going back trying to get discovery, getting information from Safeway Stores. I was astounded. Safeway Stores, with the tremendous volume they had, had made less than 2-percent profit. It was 1 percent-plus. 
Our utilities who are crying, `We're starving to death,' are making revenues of $1 billion, 17.25 percent profit, an average of over 17 percent. Safeway Stores are making less than 2 percent, but our utilities, struggling as they are, are averaging 17 percent. These are only the nuclear utilities, because they are doing better than the rest. 
So the so-called retained earnings of power utilities with at least 20 percent of the power they generate by nuclear energy averages about 17 percent. The simple interpretation of these numbers is that once the industry pays its operating costs and its capital mortgage obligations its profit is about 17 percent from all the revenues collected from the customers. Not bad. 
A reduction of this obscene profit by just 1 percentage point, reducing the average profit from 17 to 16 percent, would completely cover the ratepayers' fees that are collected to pay for managing the waste, that was generated to the benefit of both the ratepayers and the industry. 
So, Mr. President, these pious complaints from the nuclear industry and from the sponsors of S. 104 that the ratepayers are being gouged, are actually accurate. The problem is the gouger is the industry, not the Government. They, the industry, are the gouger. They are the gougers. 
So for their next scare, their next fright, S. 104 advocates in the industry have developed their own views on how much more the storage costs of the nuclear waste would be until this permanent repository is operational. This is a dandy. Here is what they come up with here. They are saying that they will have to pay $80 billion, that is what it will cost the taxpayer. They might as well pick a figure of $400 billion. It has as much relevance. They could have picked $80 dollars with as much relevance. They do not know what they are talking about. It is ridiculous. 
Sponsors of S. 104 have argued that only passage of this bill will relieve every American family of a $1,300 bill, payable to the nuclear power industry. If that is not scare tactics, I do not know what is. The actual incremental cost, until a permanent repository is operational, is clearly not that much, it is not even close. The cost is negligible compared to their profits. 
The Department of Energy has done a study that predicts $8 million as the average fixed cost for onsite storage facility. They estimated the operational costs of onsite storage to be about $750,000 per year for operating reactors, and as much as $3 million for shut-down reactors. 
Here is a monopoly that is gouging an obscene profit from customers at a 17-percent rate, claiming it should be awarded damages of $80 billion when the actual costs are less than $2 billion. How is that? The industry and their congressional supporters want the taxpayer to add to the industry's already obscene profits by awarding them billions of dollars that they did not earn, do not deserve, and did not spend. I am here to tell everyone within the sound of my voice that the nuclear industry will not get away with this nuclear extortion. That is what it is. 
I wish words could describe my appreciation for the President of the United States saying he will veto this legislation. Mr. President, the Constitution of this country was not drafted to protect the majority. The Constitution of the United States was drawn to protect the minority. There is no better example of that, there is no better example of how this Constitution works than this legislation. Last year, 37 brave Democrats and Republicans said, `We think this is bad legislation.' They were following the constitutional dictates that said if there are enough votes to sustain a veto, that legislation is history. It was history last year. It will be this year. We are wasting the taxpayers' time because the Constitution protects the minority. That is what we are doing here. 
Now, there has already been a day in court which affirmed that the contract between DOE and the generators of this waste calls for DOE to deal with this spent nuclear fuel beginning in 1998. The court specifically avoided discussion of a remedy, should DOE not honor the terms of the contract, since a deadline has not been reached. Moreover, the standard contract clearly contains language for remedies for failures to meet its terms. They are conditional. It is likely, should a court get involved in determining the remedies--which will probably never happen--the case will focus 
on conditions leading to the breach. They are very clear if it is the fault of DOE, they pick up the cost. We know that. But the deadline has not been passed yet. It is unlikely any court will rule on breach of contract remedy prior to contract violation. 
DOE has made a good-faith effort to involve the industry in developing the solution to the real problems that no repository exists prior to 1998. That good-faith gesture has been rejected and rejected and rejected by the industry and the sponsors of S. 104 to justify their efforts to rip off the taxpayers, to justify their threats to seek billions of dollars in compensation for a $2 billion incremental cost. 
The industry does not want a resolution of this permanent repository dilemma. If one were found, they would not be able to unload all future costs to the taxpayer. Remember, Mr. President, this boils down to the fact that you can store nuclear waste onsite, as I indicated, for $750,000 at an operational site. So the costs are negligible, but they are not willing to do that. 
They would be pleased to see S. 104 succeed since they know an interim storage facility in Nevada would become the permanent resting spot for all the waste. In this instance, `interim,' by the dictionary of those pushing S. 104, means forever. That needs to stop. 
Again, I congratulate publicly the President of the United States for standing by something that is right. We know politically there are big utilities that are telling the President, Oh, do not do this. The President is standing for principle, and the people of this country should admire and respect that because this is going to prevent nuclear garbage from being hauled through the streets, highways, and railways of this country. I hope the President gets his due deserve for doing the right thing. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. REID. Among those that are opposing this legislation are the Physicians for Social Responsibility, Clean Water Action, the Students Environmental Action Coalition of the University of Northern Iowa, Eco-Action of Penn State University, Southwest Research and Information Center, Snake River Alliance, Alliance for Survival, San Luis Obispo Mothers for Peace, Los Alamos Study Group, Desert Citizens Against Pollution. These are only a few, Mr. President, of the organizations that oppose this legislation. There is not a single environmental group in the United States of America that supports this legislation. 
We heard yesterday and we have heard time and time again, Mr. President, that the State of Nevada had nuclear testing, therefore, why do we not have open-armed acceptance of storage of nuclear waste? I say, Mr. President, some have said that since the Nevada desert has already been degraded from nuclear weapons testing, it is a logical place to store nuclear waste. 
Somehow, this logic seems to contradict the old saying that two wrongs do not make a right. The suggestion assumes that these two activities have something in common. The only thing they have in common is posing danger to Nevada citizens and its environment. 
We have just recently finished 50 years of the most dangerous period in America's history. During this period of time, the Soviet Union and the United States had tens of thousands of nuclear warheads pointed against each other. 
Mr. President, as I said, just a few years ago, tens of thousands of nuclear warheads were pointed toward the Soviet Union and toward the United States. This dangerous era was ended successfully, I believe, Mr. President, in large part, because of what was done at the Nevada test site. That is, we tested the new weapons, the safety and reliability of those that were in existence. This, Mr. President, was a time of national crisis. All were called upon to do what they must in order to protect our country's security. The urgency of this national mission required things to be done in ways that, under less stressing conditions, would never have been permitted. 
Well, just like the promises made by advocates for waste storage in Nevada, that was then and this is now. Then was a period of national crisis and danger. Now is one of peace and prosperity. Now is a time when we can surely do things right. There is no danger presently that would drive us to endanger our environment or our public by reckless and ill-conceived actions. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. REID. I recognize that my friend from Minnesota has been on the floor, and I will just take a few minutes because there are many things we can talk about during the time tomorrow. I will just say, so I do not have to answer today everything that my friend from Idaho propounded, that the $80 billion figure that my friend has brought up is, I suggest, maybe not modern math. It simply does not make sense. If in fact we are talking about saving money, the thing to do would be to leave it where it is. We would save not only the cost of the site of construction at Yucca Mountain and the proposed interim storage site of billions of dollars, maybe as much as $10 billion, but we would also not have the American public frightened and concerned about the transportation of nuclear waste. We will talk about that more tomorrow. 
I will also say, tomorrow we will discuss in some detail the argument that because there has been nuclear testing there, we should also have nuclear waste; we will establish that is a clearly erroneous and fallacious reason. 
Also, we will spend time tomorrow indicating how this legislation would wipe out environmental laws in this country, and that is the reason all environmental organizations in this country vehemently oppose this legislation. 
Mr. President, there is a lot that we need to talk about with this legislation. As indicated, however, my friend from Minnesota has been waiting all afternoon. My friend from Idaho, my friend from Alaska and the two Senators from Nevada will discuss this in more detail tomorrow.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, we need to understand what this debate is all about, and that is how powerful the nuclear lobby is. We acknowledge that it is pretty strong. They have gotten more out of a worthless piece of legislation than I could ever imagine. They continually are allowed to bring this up and continually talk about it. 
Mr. President, my friend, the junior Senator from Alaska, said that nuclear waste is all over, that we need to put it in one spot. Nuclear waste is all over, and it will stay all over for years to come no matter what happens with this legislation; no matter what happens with the legislation as it relates to the permanent repository, where my friend is absolutely wrong. Nuclear waste is not in some States. Commercial nuclear waste is not in Nevada. We don't manufacture nuclear waste. It is not in the Dakotas. It is not in Montana and a number of other States. So the statement was a little wrong. 
Mr. President, this legislation, I repeat, is being driven by the nuclear lobby. As shown in the chart that the junior Senator from Alaska had, there are a number of nuclear generating plants around the country; a little over 100 generating facilities. The average lifespan of those facilities is about 15 years. Some will last 25 years. Some will be out of business in 5 years. 
The point is that nuclear waste manufactured by power companies generating electricity is in our lifetime going to be a thing of the past. It is not going to happen in the future. Generating electricity by nuclear power is no longer going to happen. It has been determined that the environmental concerns are too much and the American public simply won't stand for another nuclear power facility being built in this country at any time. 
The powerful nuclear lobby recognizes that they are going to be out of the business of generating electricity by nuclear power. So they want to wash their hands of the mess they have created and shift the responsibility to the Federal Government now. They don't want to wait, as the law now indicates, until someday a permanent repository is constructed. They want to short-circuit the system. They want to change the law, which now says you can't have a permanent repository and a temporary repository in the same State. They want to eliminate that. They want to also do an end run around all environmental law. 
Mr. President, my friend, the junior Senator from Alaska, said that they were working on amendments with the junior Senator from New Mexico. Well, I would just alert everyone. Be very careful about the amendments because, as we learned last year, amendments in name are not amendments in fact. The fact is that they cannot make changes in this legislation to any standard that will allow them to go forward with this legislation. They are talking about changes in this legislation by amendments just like they did last year. But when the facts come down, you will find that their amendments mean virtually nothing. You had better read the amendments very carefully. 
Mr. President, I think it is important to note that from 1982 to today, the scientific community has been working on methods of transportation, as indicated on the chart that my friend, the Senator from Nevada had, showing the transportation routes around the country--they, the scientists, have been working on a way to transport nuclear waste. They have been working on it, now, for 15-plus years. Interestingly enough, they have not found a way to safely transport nuclear waste. The best they have been able to come up with is something called a dry-cask storage container, which is a canister, and in it would be placed spent fuel assemblies. 
What they have come up with to this point is a dry-cask storage container that is safe unless it is immersed in a fire that burns at more than 1,400 degrees. Diesel fuel burns at 1,800 degrees. So these dry-cask storage containers are not safe because, of course, fires that are going to occur on a train or a truck are going to be of diesel fuel. These casks cannot withstand the intense heat of a diesel fire. 
Second, the dry-cask storage containers have been made safe only to transport nuclear waste if an accident occurs at less than 30 miles an hour. Trains and trucks in this modern day and age rarely travel less than 30 miles an hour. So a dry-cask storage container is basically worthless for transporting nuclear waste around this country. Remember, most of the nuclear waste is produced in the eastern and southern parts of the United States. It would have to be hauled, sometimes, more than 3,000 miles to an interim site at the Nevada test site. You cannot carry it safely because the dry-cask storage containment does not allow it; because accidents occur at more than 30 miles an hour and fires occur at more than 1,400 degrees. In effect, that is why a number of entities, including entities in the State of Colorado, have said we want no part of nuclear waste. And that is why the senior Senator from Colorado has spoken out in committee on our behalf, saying interim storage is not important and not necessary at this stage. 
Yucca Mountain is being evaluated--it will be determined if that is a site that can safely store nuclear waste for up to 10,000 years--remember, they are digging a hole inside that mountain. The cavern they are digging is more than 25 feet in diameter. It is a huge hole. You can take a train through it easily. But I think it is interesting, and that the taxpayers should know, that hole, piercing that mountain, is costing $60,000 a foot. The cost now is approaching $2 billion. What this legislation would do is say we will forget about that, the billions of dollars spent there. We want to short circuit the system, pour a big cement pad out there and dump the waste on top of the ground. 
Anyone who thinks that is temporary is temporarily insane. The purpose of that is to store it permanently at the so-called interim site. 
My friend, the junior Senator from Alaska said, and I was surprised to hear him say this, it is so absolutely true--he said this legislation is little about science and a lot about politics. I could not say it better myself. I agree with the junior Senator from Alaska. This legislation deals totally with politics, nuclear politics. The powerful nuclear lobby is driving this legislation. They want to wash their hands of this. It appears that we are about to repeat last year's wasteful mistake. They tried all last year to get S. 1936 passed. What was learned at that time was that the President was going to veto that. We had enough votes at that time to sustain the President's veto. We still have the same votes. Everyone knows that. This is a gesture in nuclear politics, to show the nuclear power lobby: `We are doing everything we can to satisfy you. Please, accept our offering, that is the taxpayers' time, energy and money, in this Senate Chamber. Do not be upset with us, utilities. We are doing the best we can, even though we all recognize this legislation is going down to defeat.' 
Nothing has changed from last year that would make S. 104 any more attractive than S. 1936 was at the conclusion of the 104th 
Congress. In fact, we have another year of progress toward understanding the suitability of Yucca Mountain. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent in this past year in Nevada, characterizing Yucca Mountain. I have been there within the past 2 months. I took a ride through that huge hole that is being dug. They are trying--in fact, within weeks they should be able to cut through the side of the mountain a tunnel 5 miles long, $60,000 dollars, and after they do that they will start running shafts, adits and cross-cuts and drifts from that, for purposes of determining the suitability of this site. 
We need to find out if Yucca Mountain is suitable. The interim storage would vitiate all the time, energy, effort and money spent on that facility. The President and this administration remain committed to the present law that prohibits siting an interim storage facility at a site undergoing evaluation for permanent disposal of nuclear fuel or other high-level nuclear waste. This commitment is not political posturing, it is good government. And mostly, good science. It is only proper and responsible, given the importance and difficulty of managing the most dangerous substance known to man, plutonium and nuclear waste in general. 
As I have indicated, this Nation has already spent billions of dollars--I said $2 billion, it is approaching $3 billion--on the Yucca Mountain evaluation. We have dug a very large tunnel through the mountain, as I have indicated. It is huge. It is more than 2 stories high. It is not easy or cheap to do these things, because something like this has never been done before. Yet the proponents of this legislation are saying we want to do it the easy way. We want to do it the cheap way. We want to pour a cement pad out in the middle of the desert and dump this stuff on top of the ground. That's it. 
We all know, no matter what verbiage the junior Senator from Alaska uses--`we are going to limit the time to 40 years'--it doesn't matter if you limit the time to 20 years or 80 years, this interim site will be the permanent site. That is why they want to change the law to say you can have a permanent repository and a temporary repository in the same place. 
Time is what the proponents of S. 104 would take away from the science. The scientists have said we are doing the best we can to make a scientific determination as to whether geological burial at Yucca Mountain is appropriate. Much of the money necessary to resolve critical uncertainties would be spent unnecessarily on interim storage at Yucca Mountain and the money spent on the permanent repository would be wasted, totally wasted. 
We have heard talk here, by everyone, last year and this year, about the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. They are a group of scientists chosen because they are scientists, first of all. The chairman of the board is a dean from Yale University. I do not think we can quibble with his qualifications. But his expertise is only one of the qualifications these scientists have. These are some of the most brilliant scientists in the world, on the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. 
They have told us a number of things. No. 1, what they told us is `Don't have an interim storage site.' They have also said that:  
The civilian radioactive waste management program will have to sustain the support of the general public and the scientific and technical community for generations. Such support may be more difficult to maintain if the determination of site suitability, perhaps the most critical step in the entire process of developing a repository, is not viewed as a technically objective evaluation by a very broad segment of the population. 
The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board opposes this S. 104. It is wrong. And for the reason, among others that I have just read, that it is not viewed as technically objective. 
The board chairman went on to say, at a hearing on S. 104, Professor Cohen: 
Predicting the performance of a repository for thousands of years involves inherently large uncertainties. The Board believes that scientists and regulators can evaluate those uncertainties. Ultimately, however, the public and its representatives must have confidence that technical analyses count; if the analyses are viewed as facades serving only to justify foregone conclusions, public confidence cannot be achieved. 
A premature decision to store spent nuclear fuel near the Yucca Mountain site could contribute to the perception that the suitability of the site for development as a repository has been prejudged and that the reviews by scientists and regulators are meaningless. 
I say to my friend, the junior Senator from Nevada, that Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board--would you acknowledge that they are some of the greatest scientists we have in America today?

Mr. REID. If we change our course now, Madam President, there is no doubt in my mind that a permanent repository will never be built and all the effort and all the money will just go down the drain as misguided nuclear politics. 
The work done at Yucca Mountain is an essential part of the program that was promised to guarantee public health and safety at any site selected for a permanent repository. This guarantee was done in 1982 by Chairman Udall and others who were prominent in pushing this legislation through, the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act. 
Without their assurance, the Congress would never have supported the policy amendment, would never have supported the underlying legislation and the policy amendment that designated Yucca Mountain in 1987 as the only site to be characterized. The arguments then were, `We'll do such a grand job of scientific study and evaluation that there will be no question about Yucca Mountain suitability, reliability; we will never compromise on safety, not where the American public is concerned; we will do everything necessary to identify and resolve any concerns that Yucca Mountain might not be a suitable repository site; we guarantee Yucca Mountain will not become a storage site before all concerns have been satisfied.' 
Madam President, that was then, and this is now. Then was a time for promises that they hope everybody has forgotten. Now is a time for political expediency and smoothing the ruffled feathers of the powerful nuclear power-generating lobby. Now is the time for pushing the waste into Nevada before anything is ready, even without a repository site, even though the scientific community says no, even though the environmental community says no. Never mind repository reliability and permanent isolation from the environment. If anything happens, it will happen on someone else's watch, in someone else's backyard. That, Madam President, is bait and switch if I ever saw it. It is a well known, but not a highly respected way of doing business, and it should not be done here. 
I have talked about the independent reviews by competent Government-chartered experts. We have talked about the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. Here is a direct quote that you will hear from the two Senators from Nevada of what the chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board said: 
. . . because there are no compelling technical or safety reasons to move spent fuel to a centralized storage facility for the next few years, siting a centralized facility near Yucca Mountain can be deferred until a technically defensible site-suitability determination is made. . . . Deferring the siting of a storage facility until that time will help maintain the credibility of the site-suitability decision. 
Madam President, I hear people and I know my friend from Nevada has heard the same thing, `Well, what are you going to do with the waste?' 
If I can call upon my friend from Nevada again for a question, he will recall last year in the debate there were dire urgings that if something did not happen last year, powerplants would close down last year. Do you recall in the early eighties statements similar to this being made?

Mr. REID. I say also to my friend from Nevada, we established with the dry cask storage containers I spoke of earlier that if they burn from diesel fuel, that is bad. If you are in an accident because of going fast, that is bad. I say to my friend from Nevada, we acknowledged what some of the scientists are saying: Leave it where it is. Put these spent-fuel rods in dry cask storage containers in onsite storage. It would be safe, you would not have a diesel fire or accident from going fast. It would be safe and cheap. It would cost hardly anything to do that. There are utilities doing that right now, is that not true?

Mr. REID. `Deferring the siting of a storage facility until that time will help to maintain the credibility of the site-suitability decision.' 
That is what was said by the chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, among other things. 
These same reviews have cited the steady and productive progress toward the objective--and I underline and underscore `objective'--of determining Yucca Mountain's suitability for siting the Nation's repository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. 
The powerful, aggressive, obsessive nuclear power lobby is not willing to wait. They are not willing to wait. They do not care 
about the credibility of the site-suitability decision. They are only interested in getting it out of their pockets, out of their backyards and putting it someplace else. Their arguments, I say, are mindless and reckless. Their arguments are specious. 
As we have indicated, spent fuel is safe right where it is. My friend, the senior Senator from Colorado, stated during the committee hearing that if the waste is safe enough to ship, it is safe enough to leave in place. That says it all. 
The arguments for consolidation are without substance because an interim storage facility at Yucca Mountain will not reduce the number of storage sites. On the contrary, it will increase their number. This is fact, it is not supposition, it is not presumptive, it is not vulnerable to contradiction. Continuing operations will require onsite storage of spent fuel in cooling ponds or in an onsite interim facility for transportation staging. 
Nuclear waste will always be stored temporarily at operating nuclear power-generating sites. For those generating sites that either have terminated operations or will terminate operations, preparation for transportation will take far more time than is required for the 1998 viability decision for Yucca Mountain. They know that. Preparations to ship this waste material across the country have hardly begun, and that is an understatement. 
In his arguments against S. 104, the chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board pointed out: 
The country currently has a capacity to transport only a few hundred metric tons of spent fuel a year. 
And, I might say as an aside, some people would agree we cannot even haul that much. He went on to say: 
Developing a transportation infrastructure necessary to move significant amounts of waste, including the transportation of casks and enhanced safety capabilities along the routes, will take a few years longer than will be needed to develop the simple centralized storage facility currently envisioned by DOE. A site-suitability decision could be made beginning the interim storage facility with no lost time. 
If transportation performance is not improved, there will be at least 50 accidents involving spent fuel or high-level radioactive waste on our railroads and highways here. That is what the average would be under the present statistics--50 accidents involving spent fuel or high-level nuclear waste. That is a lot of accidents, I must say. 
Madam President, I want to close this part of my statement by reminding everyone why we are here. We are here because of the nuclear power lobby. There is no other reason. The President has said he is going to veto this legislation. The legislation will be vetoed. The President's veto will be sustained. There is no reason that we are doing this other than because of the nuclear power lobby, and some are trying to satisfy this lobby. We would be better off by dealing with the budget, which, I say to my friend from Nevada, as I understand the law, were we not to have completed a budget before the April break when we went home for Easter? Isn't that the law?

Mr. REID. I will also state that if we do not have a budget, we cannot deal with the 13 appropriations bills. I am a member of the Appropriations Committee, and we have done nothing, basically, on our appropriations legislation because we have not gotten our marks from the Budget Committee. Thirteen appropriations bills and not a single one has been marked up. 
We are absolutely going nowhere. But what are we doing here? We are spending a week on legislation that the President said he is going to veto, which failed last year because of that. If there were ever a colossal waste of legislative time, which means taxpayers' time, this is it. I yield the floor. 
Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor to the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act. Unfortunately, my State of Nevada has the highest rate of bogus telemarketing operations in the Nation. I have been involved over the last few years with uncovering these scams. We held a hearing last year in the Special Aging Committee to call attention to this crime, which primarily targets seniors. At the time of the hearing I called these scams electric muggings, and stated that Congress needs to treat these telephone thugs like criminals on the street who attack and steal. This act aims to do just that. 
Nationwide these phone schemes cost consumers over $60 billion a year. As I stated earlier, Nevada has the highest rate of fraudulent telemarketing operations. But Kathryn Landreth, U.S. attorney for Nevada, has been working with the Department of Justice to break up these schemes. Last year they rounded up over 200 fraudulent operators in Las Vegas. Nevada AARP members served as decoys for the sting, and I again commend them for doing so. 
Sadly, victims of telemarketing fraud are most often our senior citizens. These white-collar thugs who cheat victims out of their hard-earned money, are swindlers who choose to satisfy their greed by bilking others instead of doing an honest day's work. These thugs not only rob their victims of their financial security, but also of their dignity. Many older Americans live alone, may have just lost their spouse, and are particularly vulnerable to con-artists who act like they are their friends. One of the telemarketers prosecuted by the U.S. attorney of Nevada's office collected obituaries from various newspapers so that he could take advantage of recent widows and widowers. 
Typical schemes involve the telemarketer promising thousands of dollars, free vacations, or new cars if the victim buys a fur coat or overpriced vitamins, for example. If a victim receives anything at all in return for the money sent to the telemarketer, the items are generally worth far less than represented; in some cases they are no more than worthless junk. 
Not only do we need vigilant law enforcement and tough punishments, but we need to inform people. We have to get the message out to people, especially seniors, to be wary of offerings over the phone and hang up when asked for money. Further, they should report the incident to the U.S. attorney's office. Hopefully, strengthening the punishment for these crimes will deter others from entering the arena, but it is extremely important to follow up on this act with enforcement and information.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am a sponsor of Senate Joint Resolution 18. I am proud to be a sponsor of that resolution. 
What we have to understand is that the present system must change. It is hard for me to comprehend that since I was first elected to Congress more than 14 years ago the system is still the same as it was. It has not gotten better. It has gotten worse. Ten years ago when I was elected to the Senate, I came to this floor, and one of the first speeches I gave was about the need for campaign finance reform. It is hard for me to really believe that here it is 10 years later and it has not gotten better. It has gotten worse. I thought it might stay the same. In my most pessimistic thoughts I thought there was a possibility that the system would remain the same. It has gotten worse. 
What our friend from Delaware just talked about in this very remarkable good speech is what other abuses take place. Independent expenditures--we didn't have independent expenditures when I was first elected to Congress. What is an independent expenditure? That is a good question. No one really knows. But they are legal. They are legal. They are not illegal. If a group gets together, they don't have to identify themselves. They can make up a name. Senator Bryan, for example, was Governor of the State Nevada, and he ran for the Senate. A group of individuals got together and they represented the automobile industry. They ran a bunch of ads, hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of ads, tens of thousands. I don't know how much money. There is no way to know. They do not have to list how much they spent against Senator Bryan, using Social Security as their issue. It had nothing to do with their field of interest. But it was a way to embarrass my friend, the Governor of the State of Nevada, who was running for the Senate. That is an independent expenditure. 
In my race the last time I ran for the Senate, a wealthy person from Las Vegas ran ads against me dealing with something about the military on submarines and aircraft carriers because I didn't visit with one of his grandchildren when they came to Washington. I was busy. I don't know what it was. I didn't visit with his grandchild when they came to Washington to visit me. He is a rich man who spent money trying to defeat me. He doesn't have to list where the money comes from. That is an independent expenditure. 
Early this century Congress outlawed corporate money in Federal elections. They are not illegal anymore. The Supreme Court ruled last year that you can give unlimited amounts to State parties, and they can spend the money any way they want. That is what happened this election. That is what all this campaign mess is about--State parties spending all of their money. 
So things have gotten worse; they have not gotten better since I have been in the Congress. It is really too bad that the system has reached a point where it is. 
I have heard a lot of speeches here today about our Founding 
Fathers and about the first amendment. Well, the Founding Fathers who drew up this little instrument, the Constitution of the United States, would turn over in their graves if they saw how money was being used in campaigns. The first amendment wasn't meant to allow unlimited spending of money in campaigns. Should we wind up in this Congress with 535--it can't just be a millionaire--multimillionaires? The answer is no, that isn't the way it should be. 
When I first was elected to the House of Representatives, we had a plumber, a tradesman, who represented a congressional district from Missouri. He ran and he won. He could not win working on those wages anymore; he couldn't win. 
We cannot let what has now become the status quo--which is worse than the status quo of the election before--continue. Under the current campaign finance laws, Government is restricted from regulating campaign spending. This is a result, as we have heard here several times, of a U.S. Supreme Court in a 5 to 4 decision equating spending money in a campaign to free speech. 
There are all of these speeches here about first amendment rights. If the resolution of the Senator from South Carolina passes, there is nothing that will violate the first amendment. Every day that we come on this floor to pass legislation we have to be aware of the first amendment. We are not going to do anything to denigrate the first amendment rights. The Supreme Court struck down the expenditure limits imposed by the Federal Campaign Practices Act of 1974 as an unconstitutional restriction on free speech. The intent of that legislation which restricted campaign spending was to equalize the ability to run for office between persons of differing wealth. The Supreme Court, through their decision, made the playing field not level. 
What happens in a relatively small State like Nevada is, if someone wants to come in and spend, it will cost now $4 million to run in the State of Nevada, or more. What if somebody wants to come in and spend $10 million, a third as much as was spent in the California race an election ago where a man came in and spent $30 million of his own money--$30 million. He could save $20 million if he decided to move to Nevada. 
I have to say, as popular as the present Governor is in the State of Nevada, as popular as my friend, the junior Senator from Nevada is, $10 million would test their ability. The airwaves would be drowned with TV messages, radio, and, of course, newspapers throughout the State. Is that fair? I really do not think it is. I think that we need to be able to stop that. The playing field is not level. 
Most Americans believe that the current system is flawed. Their central concern is special interest influence. It is ironic that the Court equated free speech with money. Their decision has the opposite effect. It actually ensures that those with money can talk and those without money cannot talk. 
I want to also spread across the record of this Senate my appreciation for the courage of the Senator from South Carolina for continuing on this issue. We are only here today as a result of the persistence of the Senator from South Carolina. We are here by virtue of a unanimous consent agreement that was entered into sometime ago saying we are going to debate this issue or I am not going to let something else move forward on the Senate floor. That is what the Senator from South Carolina did. And it took someone with experience, prestige, and abilities to get us to the point where we can at least talk about it. 
I also say to my friend from South Carolina, I think we know we are not going to get 67 votes. I am disappointed. And maybe a miracle will happen. But that does not mean we are not right. That does not mean what the Senator from South Carolina is leading is not right. And we are going to win some day. It is only a question of when. I say thank you from the people of the State of Nevada to the Senator from South Carolina for allowing us to have the opportunity to talk about this. 
Campaign finance is a sore that is festering in the body politic of America, and we have to do something to change it. We may not change it with this resolution passing, but we are going to change it because we are going to keep talking about it, because what is going on now is wrong. It is wrong you have independent expenditures, somebody spending money against people because they refused to see their grandchild. And in the middle of the night they go to the TV station and run these ads because they are wealthy. Is that the way to conduct business in this country? I say no. 
I say people can stand up and say, well, it is free speech; they can do what they want. But they can play by the rules everybody else plays by. If somebody wants to contribute to my campaign under the Federal law that I thought existed when I came here--you have to list how much they give and they cannot give more than $1,000 an election, their occupation, where they live--why shouldn't they have to do the same. You do not know who these groups are that come in the middle of the night. I did not learn until after the election someone was mad at me because I did not see their grandchild. 
I repeat, the Supreme Court equated free speech with money. Their decision has the opposite effect. It actually ensures that those with money can talk and those without money cannot talk. 
Over the last decade we have seen an unsettling trend in American politics. Most of our candidates for Federal office have money. There are some estimates which say $1.6 billion was spent on campaigns this past year. And campaigns have become more expensive with each election. You can call it free speech; call it whatever you want. That is wrong. You cannot make something wrong right by saying it is wrong enough times. It is wrong to have the ability to be elected depend on how much money you have. 
Thomas Jefferson was a bad speaker. He could not be elected today. As much of a genius as Thomas Jefferson was, he could not be elected today unless we change these rules. 
The skyrocketing costs are prohibitive and serve as a deterrent for average Americans who want to participate in the political process. As long as costs continue to rise, so will the need for more money. Limiting spending is the only way of keeping the cost of campaigns down. 
I wish we had a way of shortening the election cycle. The Presidential election just finished and people are already beginning to run for President. 
Over the past 10 years, Congress has tried to get around the Buckley decision with at least 100 different proposals. There are numerous proposals now pending. But we are never going to slow the amount of money associated with campaigns until we address the Buckley decision head on. That is what the Senator of South Carolina has done. 
Congress must undo the Buckley decision and reinstate campaign spending limits. This legislation amends the Constitution to authorize Congress to cap campaign expenditures in Federal elections. I do not take lightly amending the Constitution or our precious freedom of speech, but it is the only way to undo the Buckley decision. 
No one is in favor of free speech more than I am, and I think I have the record to indicate that. I represented newspapers before I came here. Some of my clients went to court on first amendment cases. But equating free speech with campaign spending simply creates a constitutional protection for wealthy candidates to buy Federal elections. 
An alternative to this amendment is to continue to spin our wheels, working on hundreds of different initiatives designed to provide public financing, financial inducements in exchange for voluntary spending limits or one of the other failed proposals 
we have debated over the years. 
I have been in the Senate 10 years, so I do not want to go back further than that, but let me read to my friend, the prime sponsor of this resolution this year and the years gone by: During the years I have been in the Senate, we have had 6,742 pages of hearings. We have had 3,361 speeches, 62 now with this one, 1,063 pages of committee hearings, 113 Senate votes on campaign finance reform, and we even had one bipartisan Federal commission which went nowhere. The vast majority of those votes, I would say 90 of the 113 votes were for cloture--stop debate so we could get to vote on one of the issues. 
Now, I am a cosponsor of McCain-Feingold, an imperfect piece of legislation, but I say I do not know how we could make things worse than what they now are. I support McCain-Feingold; I hope it passes, but I think the chances of passing are pretty remote. I have to tell you that. I hope it passes. I am a sponsor of it. But until we do what the Senator from South Carolina suggests we do--and I am cosponsoring the amendment, an original cosponsor--I think we are just going to add to this. We are going to have probably by the time this year is over 7,500 pages of hearings, maybe 500 floor speeches, maybe 1,300 pages of committee reports, and probably 125 votes rather than 113, and accomplish nothing. 
So I think we have to stop talking about limiting spending and look for a way to hit Buckley head on. We cannot enact powerful campaign spending limitations as long as this is the law. 
Overall funding for the Democratic and Republican Parties totaled almost $1 billion last year, a 73 percent increase over the same period during the 1992 cycle. We can get up and say all we want that this is just part of free speech. I do not buy that. I do not think we can be whipsawed into cowering because the free speech argument is raised. I am not going to be. I am going to talk about this issue every chance I get. 
I would like to be able to spend more of my time debating issues dealing with education, dealing with the trade deficit, dealing with juvenile crime, adult crime; I have some environmental things I would like to come here and talk about. That is one of my prime responsibilities on the Environment and Public Works Committee. I would like to come here and talk about that. I would like to spend some time talking about the ISTEA bill. But, frankly, a lot of us have to spend a lot of time making phone calls to raise money. 
It is too bad, isn't it.

Mr. REID. The public believes that escalating cost of elections puts a price tag on our democracy. So why is there this call for campaign finance reform? Let us go over the issues. 
No. 1, record-breaking spending. As I said, we hear all kinds of estimates, but just the parties spent over $1 billion; in overall spending, $1.6 billion at least. 
No. 2, Americans feel shut out. Americans, more than ever, believe that the emphasis on money in elections excludes them from meaningful participation. They believe that special interests who contribute large sums of money have more influence on elected officials and that candidates are forced to spend too much time raising funds and too little time listening to voters' concerns. 
No. 3, campaigns are too expensive. Campaigns have become more expensive with each election. The skyrocketing costs are prohibitive and serve as a deterrent to the average American who wants to participate in the political process. As long as the costs continue to rise, so will the need for more money. Limiting spending is the only way of keeping these costs down. 
My friend, the Senator from Delaware, talked about these pages. We have serving in the U.S. Senate today a fine senior Senator from the State of Connecticut who was a page. I am sure, years ago, he sat where you young people are sitting and heard speeches delivered by various Senators. I am almost embarrassed to stand here and talk to you four young people about this issue. It is embarrassing to me, to admit the system is failing. I don't like to talk about the system failing. I started last summer coming on this floor talking about how good Government was, that we should be proud of Government. And I do believe that. There are many things we should be proud of: Our National Park System, how well FEMA reacts to crisis, our Consumer Safety Products Commission--many, many things we should be very proud and happy over. But this is one thing I am not proud of. I am embarrassed to come here and admit a Government failure, and that is what this is. I hope you young people are not so turned off by the speeches that are relating to this proposed constitutional amendment that you turn against Government, because you should not. 
No. 4, comprehensive reform is the only lasting solution, and comprehensive reform can only come about as a result of our amending the Constitution to allow us to get around the 5-4 decision made by the Supreme Court. 
We need bipartisan action. I say to my friend, the junior Senator from South Carolina, that we have a sponsor on this resolution, Mr. Specter, who is second in line. The second sponsor of this amendment is the Senator from Pennsylvania, the senior Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter]. I commend and applaud his courage for stepping out on this issue. We need more bipartisanship. This is a bipartisan resolution. I wish we had a few more from the other side of the aisle, but this is bipartisan and I, again, want to congratulate my friend from the State of Pennsylvania for having the guts to step forward and say he also believes that this resolution should pass. 
No one can say anything about his ability to analyze the law. I have heard him give hours of speeches here, with detailed legal analysis. I am sure he has spent time, recognizing we are not violating any free speech. If there is 
no other reason that we should feel good about this, it would be because we have bipartisan support from a Senator who has joined us who has great qualifications as a legal scholar. So we need bipartisan action and I think we need to move forward now and pass this resolution. 
I hope that I am wrong. I hope that over the weekend--we are going to vote on this early next week--I hope that people get the idea that this is the only way to go and that we are surprised and get 67 votes, enough to pass this constitutional amendment. I hope so. 
The time to act is now. Over the next 2 years, Congress will deal with changes in regulations and programs that affect virtually every American, from clean air and water to education programs for our children and Medicare and Medicaid for our Nation's elderly. In order to address these concerns, Congress must first act to reform itself. That is what we are talking about. We talk about reforming everybody else, why don't we reform ourselves? Why don't we reform ourselves? Because the present system is pretty comfortable. We, who have access, have the ability to raise money and, unless you are independently wealthy, access is really, really important. Why don't we do something that would level the playing field, like we tried to do in 1974? 
So I close with the plea that we can reform the way we handle campaigns in this country. The only way we can reform the way we handle campaigns in this country is if we follow the admonition and the courageous activities of the junior Senator from South Carolina, Ernest F. Hollings, who has worked so hard and so long on this issue. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of Nevada's leaders and activists, Cruz Olague. On March 15, 1997, the Los Amigos de Cruz Olague will honor former Mayor Cruz Olague--a fine Arizonan and Nevadan--at their first testimonial dinner. I have known Cruz for many years, and he is truly deserving of this honor. 
Born February 26, 1934, in Winslow, AZ, Cruz later moved to Henderson, NV after serving 4 years in the U.S. Navy. Afterward, he worked as an office manager in a supermarket while completing his accounting studies at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. 
In 1971, Cruz was persuaded to run for the Henderson City Council. After receiving 53 percent of the popular vote in the primary, a general election was deemed unnecessary and Cruz was declared the winner. This was the first and only time such an event has occurred in the history of Nevada local politics. Moreover, Cruz won this seat on the City Council with a campaign budget of a mere $3,000. Following this tremendous feat, Mr. Olague went on to become a popular mayor of Henderson, and served in this capacity until 1975. 
Cruz is a man with deep religious convictions and a remarkably calm demeanor. Even when driving home a contentious point, he always maintains a gentleman's dignity and an even temperament. With his kindness, Cruz easily won people over. Consequently, it came as no surprise when he was selected Mayor of the Year in 1974. 
This prominent member of the Hispanic community has long believed that our racial and ethnic diversity is our Nation's greatest strength. Cruz Olague has spent his life tirelessly fighting on behalf of minorities, the elderly, and the poor. He has used his abilities for those who often lack a voice in our society. The work of this outstanding citizen has left a lasting impact on the lives of many Nevadans. 
Across southern Nevada, Cruz Olague will always be known as an individual of great integrity and conviction with a passion for good government. For 27 years, it has been a privilege to call Cruz Olague a friend. It is my pleasure to speak today in tribute to Cruz, and congratulate him on this special honor.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for one of the most important parts of the education of our Nation's children--music education. Nevada has a proud music tradition and one of the groups that help keep this tradition strong is the Nevada Music Educators Association [NMEA]. It is my pleasure to speak on behalf of the NMEA, and to stress the importance of music to the education of our Nation's youth. 
A recent event has made me especially proud of my State and its commitment to music education. The Hug High School band in Reno was selected to perform in President Clinton's second inaugural parade. Being chosen for the parade is truly an honor and it spoke to the quality of Hug's band and Nevada's music programs. The only way the band could make the trip from Nevada to Washington, DC, however, was to raise a lot of money. Right in the wake of the terrible New Year's flood, which caused devastating damage throughout northern Nevada, the citizens of Washoe County banded together and raised over $120,000 to send these deserving students to our Nation's Capital. Thanks to the kindness, generosity, and support of their community, the Hug High School band was able to come to Washington and perform beautifully in the inaugural parade. 
Nevada is at the forefront of music education. We are leaders in the development of music standards and have active band, choir, and orchestra programs throughout the State. Recently, the bands of Edward C. Reed High School and Green Valley High School had the opportunity to represent the United States in international music festivals. 
Music and the arts are vital components of the education of our youth; no school career is complete without them. Recent scientific research has shown that early childhood education in music helps develop a child's logical brain. Pediatric neurobiologists indicate that the brain circuits for math reside near those for music. Accordingly, music lessons and listening to classical music may help a child develop skills in logic and spatial reasoning and, thus, do better in math. In addition to the cultural and artistic enrichment that music education provides, it also helps our children to learn and grow in other areas. As we move into the future, our children need to be given all the tools they will need to compete and succeed. Music education is essential to this effort, and it must be supported. 
I am very proud of Nevada's music programs and the bands, orchestras, and choirs that bring joy to all of our lives. It is my pleasure to speak today in appreciation of the Nevada Music Educators Association and all the teachers, administrators, and citizens who support music education in our schools.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the ranking member, who has done a stalwart job in managing this joint resolution in the last week or 10 days. 
Mr. President, if there were ever an example of a `David versus Goliath,' it is apparent in what happened this last week. All over America, ads are being run on television, radio, and in newspapers. Millions of dollars are being spent to talk about the merits of the underlying constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. These ads are full-page ads in some of the most expensive publications in the world--the Wall Street Journal, et cetera. 
The people who need Social Security can't afford these ads. These people are certainly those that represent the `David versus the Goliaths.' Let me read to you a couple of letters I have received in my office:  
Dear Sir: I would like to join your fight to stop Congress from turning Social Security trust funds into a slush fund to offset Government spending. I support a balanced budget, but not one to loot the Social Security that we have paid into, and our fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, and cousins have also supported. I want to help you in your fight to protect America's trust. Mildred Johnson. 
This is not a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal, or an ad on network television or radio stations all over America, but just the sending of a letter. This is the best she could do. It was probably hard for her to pay for the stamp on the mail. 
In the State of Nevada we have a Social Security recipient who receives $725 a month. These are the people who are supporting what we are trying to do. George Fry from Reno, NV: 
Thank you for your concern, Senator Reid, for Social Security. I am 74. After working my whole life, I really need Social Security. I have a difficult time. My income is in the $6,000 range per year. Social Security plus SSI are $490.89 month. You are very good about helping poor old people. 
He is good to send his letter with a 32-cent stamp. 
Francis Salden, from Las Vegas: 
Please do not let anyone take Social Security from us. We work very hard for this and sure would be lost if we wouldn't have this. My husband and I work from 7 in the morning until 11:30 at night so we would not be without this . . . Social Security. 
They are not just old people who are concerned about Social Security. Young people are concerned also. 
Mr. President, Social Security is an important program, one that we have to do everything we can to support and maintain. It is the most important social program in the history of the world. It is the most successful social program in the history of the world. If Senate Joint Resolution 1 passes, Social Security will be devastated. 
We have heard very little talk about how Social Security wouldn't be protected. Everyone has said we want to protect Social Security. The easiest way to protect Social Security is to secure it from the confines of the underlying amendment, as we tried to do, and we got 45 votes. All we need is five other people to come and say, `We support the amendment,' and follow the leadership of the courageous Senator from Arizona, the senior Senator, Senator McCain, and the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, who said, `In spite of party affiliation, we are going to vote for the amendment because it will protect Social Security.' 
Mr. President, the polls in America support us. When I started this debate 4 years ago, I was a lone wolf crying in the wilderness. Now, 75 percent of the American public say we want to balance the budget but we want to exclude Social Security from doing so. That will make it hard to do. The easy way to balance the budget is to use Social Security. We want to exclude Social Security. 
We have the Congressional Research Service supporting us. The Center for Budget Policy supports our position, Mr. President. We want to balance the budget, and we have voted for a balanced budget. It would be very difficult and hard to balance it if we excluded Social Security, but it will be the right way to do it. 
I ask my friends from the other side of the aisle to recognize that unless we exclude Social Security, we are dooming the most successful program in the history of the world to failure. 
Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, people continually talk about using Social Security. `Let's use Social Security until we balance the budget, and then after that we will not use it any more.' 
That argument says it all, Mr. President, because, if you use Social Security, it makes it pretty easy to balance the budget. If we want to really balance the budget let's do it the right way, the hard way, the honest way. Let's not use the surpluses--this year alone over $8 billion. That is the easy way to balance the budget. But it is not the right way. 
Dorothy Ray from Reno, NV, wrote to me: 
I urge you to fight all attempts to cap, cut, tax, or otherwise cut Social Security benefits and to focus on the real causes of the Federal deficit. Social Security is an earned entitlement that does not contribute 1 cent to the Federal deficit. We workers and retirees and employers have paid and continue to pay special taxes. We fund Social Security. The Federal Government has no right to borrow our Social Security and deplete all the reserves which we contributed for this purpose. Please fight all attempts to cut or rob us of our earned benefits. 
Sincerely, Dorothy Ray. 
I heard also from Sparks, NV, from Bernice Murray. She wrote to me: 
Dear Mr. Reid. In reference to your stand on Social Security I stand behind your views 100 percent. I have lived in Nevada since 1946, and most of that time in Sparks. I am 72 years old. My husband just passed away January 17, '97. My only income now is his Social Security. I agree with what you are trying to accomplish, and please keep up the good work. Us older Nevadans need you. 
Mr. President, not only do the older Nevadans need this, but all Nevadans. All Americans need this. 
The Social Security Program is for people over age 62 or 65 who are now receiving the benefit. But it is the benefit for future generations. All across America, as we speak, in certain specific regions there are huge amounts of money being spent on television, on radio, and in newspapers against people like Senator Reid from Nevada. These ads say, `Why won't Reid support a balanced budget amendment?' I say to those people that are spending these hundreds, thousands, and millions of dollars on these ads all over the country that I do support a balanced budget amendment. I just do not support theirs. I support mine, the one that excludes Social Security. This isn't some new-found religion for Senator Reid. I have been doing this. This is the 4th year. I have offered my amendment every year, and will continue to do so until we prevail because the people about whom I speak, Bernice Murray, Dorothy Ray, and others cannot afford hundreds of thousands of dollars in the State of Nevada to run ads. All they can do is write their letters hoping that right will prevail. It has so far. I hope it will continue. 
We need to balance the budget. We need to do it though, Mr. President, the right way. I have heard people say, `We will never be able to balance the budget without using Social Security.' Well, we can balance the budget without using Social Security. It is going to be harder, and we may not be able to do it by the year 2002. But we can do it. And, when we accomplish that, we will have prevailed in righting one of the biggest wrongs in the history of this country; that is, depleting these trust funds for purposes other than what the money was paid in for by employers and employees. 
For many people in America today, Social Security is the only money they get. Only 50 percent of America's workers have access to pensions. That does not count Social Security. Most people working in America, and especially women, have no hope of ever getting a pension. To enshrine in the Constitution any amendment that would guarantee to the American workers that these contributions are no longer going to be protected I believe is wrong. 
How much of an impact does Social Security make on the lives of Americans? Nationally, in December 1995, benefits were paid to about 44 million Americans. This includes 27 million retired workers, about 5 million widows, a few widowers, 4 million disabled workers, and more. 
The monthly average benefit paid to a Social Security retired worker is $720. A wife gets $354, because it usually is a wife at this stage. Most husbands have Social Security benefits. Wives have not up to this stage. It is changing in the future years. 
In the State of Nevada, we have about 229,000 people who receive Social Security benefits. Said another way, that is about 15 percent of the people in Nevada depend on Social Security for support. In Nevada, 153,000 of these people are retired, 21,000 are widows, about 23,000 are disabled, and then there are, of course, some children, about 17,000 children, whose parents have been killed or died in some fashion who receive benefits. 
The average benefit in the State of Nevada is $5 a month more than the national average; $725 a month is what Nevadans get on an average from Social Security. For $725 a month, they are not able to pay for ads in the larger newspapers in Nevada, full-page ads at a cost of about $5,000. They are not going to be able to do that. Ads running in radio stations today alone will cost tens of thousands of dollars, and in television, no telling how much money. 
These people cannot pay for the ads, but the large corporations are helping pay for these ads or are paying for these ads. Why? Because they know, Mr. President, that if we balance the budget the right way and do not use Social Security benefits and we really want to balance the budget, they are probably going to have to chip in a few dollars or take longer or they are going to have to make more cuts. So they are willing to spend money up front to save them a few dollars. 
In the State of Nevada, $2.1 billion was paid into Social Security last year. Drawing out of that was far less than $2 billion--about $1.4 billion. The rest went to surplus, the surplus the people in this body want to use to mask the deficit. I say they should not be able to do that. These moneys should be set aside for Social Security recipients. 
Social Security in every State plays a vital role. It is a program that keeps people off poverty. It gives people dignity. It is not only in Nevada. This is the way it is all across the country. In fact, the amendment I offered, which was defeated by a vote of 55 to 45, had two very courageous Republicans from different parts of the country who voted in favor of it. The senior Senator from Arizona voted for it; the senior Senator from Pennsylvania voted for it. 
In addition to that, we now have held up in the House the balanced budget amendment. Why? Because some very courageous sophomore Republicans are saying we will vote for a balanced budget amendment but we want to exclude Social Security benefits. My office has received some phone calls about people in this body on that side of the aisle who are now considering offering amendments of their own. I hope that there will be further thought given to that, that we will exclude Social Security from the calculations of the balanced budget amendment. 
Social Security is the major source of income for 63 percent of all the beneficiaries. For 63 percent of the people who draw Social Security benefits, that is all the money they get. It is for this group that I am most concerned and speak on their behalf today. They are not going to run ads in the newspapers. They are not going to be able to pay for television or radio ads. But their thoughts are just as important, their ideas are just as important as the people who are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to get out the message that they want to be able to mask the deficit. 
Currently, about 90 percent of older households get Social Security benefits. Benefits keep about 15 million Americans above the poverty line and even more from near poverty. While this is nothing to be proud of, I think it is something we should reflect upon as to how much better we are doing. Today, 10.5 percent of our senior population falls below the poverty line. 
It was just a few years ago that we had poorhouses where people who had no money went. Most of the counties--the States helped a little bit--had poorhouses for these people. The difference between poorhouses and no poorhouses is this program we call Social Security. 
So I am concerned about approximately 44 million Americans and 229,000 Nevadans who depend on this program to maintain their dignity. This is by no means the time to turn our backs on the success of this program or the citizens who rely on this program. We must listen to the people who tell us: balance the budget but do not do it using Social Security. 
The vast majority of Americans agree with my position in spite of the ads, in spite of the media blitz. The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, NBC, CNN have all run polls showing that about 75 percent of the American people support balancing the budget but without using Social Security. 
Franklin Roosevelt said upon signing the Social Security act, `We can never insure one hundred percent of the population against one hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against a poverty-ridden old age.' 
This statement, given in August 1935, was visionary because we have done just that. We have given dignity to the old of America. They do not have to live in poverty. You can see the impact of this program, which I have said on this floor is the most successful Social Security program in the history of the world. It is my hope that Members on both sides of the aisle will think long and hard about the impact of the balanced budget amendment on Social Security and vote accordingly. 
News accounts indicate that the Republican leadership is open to modifying the underlying amendment. I understand that as we speak some are shopping language they believe would address this issue. As long as they focus on Social Security, I am willing to do that. I have been very narrow in my advocacy on this floor. While I think some of the other ideas about capital budgeting, emergencies and the military are good, I am not willing to focus on those amendments. I want to focus on Social Security and the importance I think it plays in our society, and therefore I hope those who are shopping amendments will shop in a very narrow fashion and wind up supporting the amendment where we give continued dignity to the seniors of this country.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have in months gone by, to talk about some of the good things that are happening in Government. We tend to dwell--because of the negative perception that the press throws on almost everything that is done here in Washington--on things that the Government is involved in that are not good. There are things we do that are good, however, and I want to talk about some of those things. I want to do this, Mr. President, in an effort to stem the tide of negativity that has engulfed the perception many Americans have about their Government. Strident skepticism about our Government seems to rule the day. I worry about the harm it will do to our country in the long term. 
A recent survey of 1,000 registered voters found that about 63 percent of them did not want their children to be President. This is in stark contrast to what it was 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago. If this is the case, where will we find the leaders for future generations? 
There are, in fact, as I have already indicated, many Government efforts and agencies that serve this country well. Last summer I spoke on this floor about the National Park Service, which began in the early part of this century as an idea of President Theodore Roosevelt. The National Park Service has worked to preserve and protect the remarkable lands that we call our national parks. 
Since Congress established the National Park Service, this agency has cared for these natural wonders. Today, about 80 years after the National Park Service was formed, 270 million people will visit our National Park System. 
I am very proud that the most heavily visited entity in our entire National Park System is in Nevada. The Lake Mead recreational area has over 10 million visitors every year. Because of the hard work of the Park Service, these national treasures will be available for all Americans to enjoy for generations to come. 
Another worthwhile Federal agency about which I have spoken is the Consumer Product Safety Commission. This is a very small agency, but very effective agency, and it has jurisdiction over more than 15,000 different products. It maintains a constant vigil to seek out and eliminate harm to the American consumer. For example, after a baby's death resulting from a faulty playpen right here in the District of Columbia, the Consumer Product Safety Commission responded quickly by removing these playpens from stores and issued a nationwide alert to all consumers. 
The Consumer Product Safety Commission most recently made news by recalling popular fleece clothing because it was found to be dangerously flammable. At one time, we had a similar problem with children's pajamas catching on fire. Because of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, we now have flame-retardant pajamas for our children. 
From investigating reports about unsafe products to protecting our children from lead poisoning on playgrounds, the Consumer Product Safety Commission has proven, in my opinion, to be an indispensable and beneficial Government agency. 
Every summer wildfires sweep the Western part of the United States. About 25,000 brave men and women fight those fires. These self-sacrificing and hard-working firefighters are coordinated through the National Interagency Fire Center, which is a joint project of the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. These people put their lives on the line. Hundreds of these men and women parachute out of the back of airplanes with backpacks weighing almost 100 pounds. We have hundreds more who propel off helicopters into harm's way in order to save life, property, and our great natural resources. 
We should be proud of this work done by the Federal Government. When wild fires race across our forests and fields, and the flames threaten our communities, these brave firefighters risk their lives to keep us safe. 
Today, I want to take the time to recognize the good work of another Government Agency that takes care of us when we suffer calamities. That is the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. Mr. President, when I was in the other body, one of the committees I served on had jurisdiction over authorizing what FEMA did. In those days, more than a decade ago, FEMA got a lot of bad publicity. They have made remarkable improvements. This organization is one of the best examples of how Government truly works for Americans. 
In late December and early January, northern Nevada experienced the worst floods in the history of our State. We do not have many rivers in Nevada, but three tiny rivers in northern Nevada--the Truckee, Carson, and Walker Rivers-- became raging torrents, washing away people, animals, and property. While most of America was enjoying the New Year's holiday, we in Nevada were besieged by the `Flood of 1997,' as were a number of other Western States. When northern Nevadans were confronted with this devastating damage, the Federal Emergency Management Agency quickly responded to the short-term and long-term needs of residents and businesses. With FEMA's help, Nevada is not only rebuilding, but we are well on the road to recovery. 
FEMA has been tremendous. They called on their reserves and utilized their experts to assist with our devastating farm losses. They were even able to bring in people that could deal with the losses we had to tourism. 
FEMA is an agency that is used to handling water damage. About 80 percent of the emergencies they deal with in the United States deal with water damage and floods. They are truly experts at this. 
FEMA was established as an independent agency in 1979 when its 
original purpose was to deal with nuclear attack. That is no longer the case. While the Agency once operated within a narrow mandate, it has since been expanded to handle disasters generally. 
Mr. President, this is an agency that recognizes that people who are hit by floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other national disasters are Republicans, Democrats, and independents. This is an agency that must act on a bipartisan basis. And I think they have done a good job of doing that. 
Due to the present Director, James Lee Witt, who visited Nevada during the flood disaster, FEMA has become an example of good government. For example, in an effort to streamline and reduce costs, FEMA has closed a number of field offices and has drafted a plan to reduce its internal regulations, which we all dislike, by more than 50 percent. It has become a cost-effective agency which has developed an innovative, customer-oriented approach to government. Most notably, from the very first sign of disaster, FEMA works in partnership with State and local governments, as well as businesses and private agencies. I can testify to this, as it is precisely what happened in Nevada. FEMA does not act like some type of monolithic big brother trying to supersede all local efforts. Everything they do is in partnership with local government. They also deal with business concerns. When the New Year's flood struck, FEMA was on the ground within hours to begin the coordination of relief efforts in Nevada. In conjunction with local officials, FEMA conducted preliminary damage assessments. They did not do it on their own. They did it with local officials. Based on FEMA's initial findings, the President declared 6 of our 17 counties disaster areas, and one major city in Nevada as a disaster area. After the declaration, FEMA began some more good work coordinating numerous assistance efforts in the State. 
In a disaster, FEMA becomes the central point of contact for a wide range of emergency responses, including planning, mitigation, and recovery. Aid offered by the Agency ranges from low-interest loans, even cash grants, to advice on how to mitigate damage from future disasters. 
FEMA's basic disaster recovery assistance falls into three main categories. No. 1 is human services, or individual assistance, which provides aid to individuals, family, and business owners. No. 2 is infrastructure and public assistance, which helps State and local governments pay for emergency services and repair damages to facilities such as roads, bridges, buildings, and utilities. 
During the flood, when it was still raging, I went into an area outside of our capital, Carson City, to meet with county commissioners. One of the big problems we had with the Carson River, which is a wild river with no dams, was with a levy that had been washed away. This levy had been there for as long as anyone could remember, but no one claimed ownership of it. It did not belong to the county. It did not belong to the State. The farmers did not claim it, and neither did the Indians. It was essential, however, that levy be reconstructed. So the county said, `We will take responsibility.' As soon as they did that, FEMA was there to begin work on how to reconstruct the levy, which is so essential to prevent damage from Nevada's spring thaws. 
The third disaster assistance category is hazard mitigation assistance, which provides funding for reducing future losses in disaster areas. We have an area along the Truckee River where FEMA is considering buying all of the land. It is likely that this area will suffer another flood, so why should we continue to put those residents in harms way? The homes should not have been built there, and FEMA's efforts to buy this land is a fundamental part of hazard mitigation assistance. 
Additionally, one of the first things FEMA does in an afflicted community is activate what they call the National Teleregistration Center. This sounds like a fancy name, but it is basically a telephone bank which begins taking applications for assistance within hours of the President's declaration. In Nevada, we have had over 3,000 people register for assistance by using this telephone number. Moreover, as of just a few days ago, FEMA had issued millions of dollars in housing checks to Nevadans; 
approved nearly a half a million dollars in individual and family grants in Nevada; obligated almost $5 million in public assistance grants to repair and restore Nevada public facilities; and issued $15,000 in disaster unemployment assistance to Nevada residents left jobless. 
One reason FEMA works so well in a partnership with local governments is because, when there is a disaster, they do not come in and say we are going to take care of everything. The reason cooperation is coming from State and local governments is because they are required to come up with 25 percent of the costs of these repairs. 
Amidst all the chaos of this devastating flood, FEMA was a source of hope, assistance, and relief. In time of disaster, when communities are reeling from devastation caused by nature or humans, it is vital than an emergency management infrastructure is ready to respond immediately. FEMA works in cooperation with States and nonprofits to pick up where their efforts left off. This efficient Federal Agency also works to cover what residents' insurance does not. 
Since the potential for flooding in some areas is still extreme, FEMA's efforts in hazard mitigation planning are invaluable. I have already talked about an example of that. The Carson and Walker Rivers are threatening to flood again, and the problem will not be gone until the snow has melted. The flood of 1997 washed away levees, choked river channels, and saturated soils. These conditions make the area ripe for more flooding. FEMA will be there to help if this untoward situation takes place. Because of strong leadership and a willingness to make necessary reforms, FEMA has become an indispensable Government agency for millions of Americans who have suffered these terrible losses. In a 1994 survey, over 80 percent of natural disaster victims approved of the way FEMA did its work. This is clearly, Mr. President, government working for us. The Director, James Lee Witt, should be very proud of this Agency. I know I am. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. REID. Madam President, I saw my friend this afternoon offer the amendment, my friend from North Dakota. I wanted to come to the floor for a couple of reasons. One is to express my personal appreciation for the determination and the expertise he has lent to this argument over these last several years. The Senator from North Dakota has a background in finance. He was a State tax commissioner. He served in the other body, the House of Representatives, on the Ways and Means Committee for many Congresses. So he brought that with him when he came here. 
I have read with interest the numerous op-ed pieces he has written for newspapers all over this country on this issue, on the matter now before this body. I do not think there is anyone--I can say with certainty--there is no Senate delegation that has the financial expertise that the delegation from North Dakota has. The senior Senator and the junior Senator from North Dakota are people whom I, and many people in this body, look to for guidance when it comes to matters dealing with finances. So I express my appreciation, again publicly, to my friend from North Dakota for what he has done to narrow the issue and to make sure that it is an understandable issue.

Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota--a couple of things. First of all, the debate that has taken place, and this is what I wanted to add, after my compliment, the debate that has taken place has led to the ability of the American public to understand this issue. Now 75 percent of the American public agrees with us. That is not the way it was, when all this information that was not right was put out in years past. We have been able to put this issue so the American public understands it. 
That is, the amendment we are offering, the amendment that has been offered by my friend from North Dakota, of which I am a sponsor, is what I refer to as the honest balanced budget amendment. I have been struck by the statements made by those proponents of the underlying amendment who come on this floor and say we cannot balance the budget unless we use Social Security moneys. That is my whole point. I do not want to do that. I want to balance the budget in the honest way and that is the right way. 
I ask a question to my friend from North Dakota. Why do we refer to this as the honest balanced budget amendment?

Mr. REID. I would also hope that people would look closely at the vote yesterday on the amendment that I offered to Senate Joint Resolution 1. We got 44 votes with one Senator being ill who is here today. And we will get on this amendment, I assume, a bare minimum 45 votes. I hope there will be some people like John McCain. You really do not have to talk about his courage. I think that has been established. It was established even before he was confined for 6 or 7 years to a prison camp in Vietnam. He is a courageous man. I think part of his courage was, certainly, apparent yesterday when he decided to vote with us on the amendment that I offered. 
The senior Senator from Pennsylvania also voted with us. 
I hope that we would get some other courageous people on the other side of the aisle to vote with us. Why? Because the balanced budget debate would be over for all time, because we would have to balance a budget. And it would be hard. We would have to make significant cuts or we would have to phase in and balance the budget, maybe by the year 2008, or maybe even 2010. But when that budget was balanced, I say to my friend from North Dakota, the debt clock would no longer continue to run. 
I am willing to do that. If we are going to stop playing games with the American public, then let's balance the budget the right way, the honest way. 
I had somebody come to me today and say, `Well, if you want to take the Social Security trust fund, why don't you take the other trust funds?' I told them the same thing I said on this floor yesterday. The Social Security trust fund is where the big bucks are. As Willie Sutton said when they asked him why he robbed banks, he said, `That's where the money is.' The other trust funds don't mean anything in the whole scheme of things. But when you have budget surpluses that go into the trillions of dollars, that is the real money, and that is why we have to have a real honest balanced budget amendment. I hope the substitute is one that is adopted. 
I read in the paper today that the majority leader had a trick up his sleeve. I hope the trick up his sleeve is they will vote for our amendment. We can have a celebration. I repeat, the celebration would be short-lived, because we would have to come back here, if the House adopts it and the States adopt it, and make some real tough decisions, but we won't be playing games with the American public. We would have a real balanced budget amendment. 
Madam President, as I said yesterday, we are talking about small sums of money for millions of people. We don't have millions and billions and trillions of dollars that represent certain interests that want this Senate Joint Resolution 1 passed. We represent small numbers in dollars but large numbers in people. They are concerned about whether or not they are going to continue to be able to get their check of $700 a month to maintain their dignity. That is why this amendment is so important. We represent the working men and women of this country, not just the seniors, people who want to maintain the Social Security system for the years to come. 
Social Security is the finest social program in the history of the world. This substitute will allow this finest social program in the history of the world to continue. I support the amendment that has been offered by my friend and would certainly ask my friends on the other side of the aisle to support it also.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wrote a letter to a number of people in Nevada, and this is what I said in the last paragraph of the letter: 
There is no question Congress must face up to the tough task of balancing the Federal budget. I'm the first to accept responsibility for this task, but I draw the line on devastating the Social Security trust fund to accomplish this task. 
Franklin D. Roosevelt, upon signing the Social Security Act, said, 
We can never insure 100 percent of the population against 100 percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life, but we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age. 
I received numerous responses after writing this letter, but one response I received, as I mentioned on the floor yesterday, was from Helen Collins who said: 
I have been a widow since age 21. I never considered applying for any kind of welfare assistance. I worked, and raised and educated my son. He got a master's degree. Sad to say, at age 71, I am totally on my own on quite a limited budget. By being very careful, I get by. However, I do worry about getting more seriously ill and losing Social Security. For many of us, these are not the golden years. But I, for one, thank God that good people like you are helping us maintain our dignity and independence. 
That is what this debate is all about. It is about the Helen Collinses of the world, not the people who are running full-page ads in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The people on Wall Street want this to pass because it gives them an easy opportunity to balance the budget. 
Mr. President, I heard my friend, my good friend, with whom I serve on a subcommittee--I am the ranking member of the subcommittee, and I have served on the Appropriations Committee with him since I have been in the Senate--I heard my friend, the senior Senator from New Mexico, say that what we are trying to do is keep Social Security on its own. That is absolutely true, we are. We are trying to keep Social Security on its own. It is not part of the unified budget. It shouldn't be part of the unified budget. We have passed laws in this body so it would not be part of the unified budget. 
Here is what happened over the last decade: The Greenspan commission, where we established, by a majority vote, a bailout of the Social Security system, and it was to last to the year 2060; in 1985, we passed the Deficit Control Act, which further strengthened Social Security; in 1990, we passed the Hollings-Heinz amendment which took Social Security off budget. 
What right do we have to suddenly start including it in the unified budget? We don't have any right to do that. Everyone has 
said you can't balance a budget unless you use Social Security. That is my whole point. If we are going to balance the budget, we should do it the right way, the hard way. 
I think the most telling thing, Mr. President, was when my friend from New Mexico came and gave this very well-meaning speech--he is a sincere man, but I think it is glaring that he did not respond to the statements that I have made and the junior Senator from South Carolina has made over the last 2 days about his own words from 1990. These were his own words:  
I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I support the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget deficit calculation. But I cast the vote with reservations. 
What were his reservations that he came to this floor and did not respond to? His reservations: 
We need a firewall around those trust funds. . . . 
That is what this amendment is all about. 
We need a firewall around those trust funds to make sure the reserves are there to pay Social Security benefits in the next century. Without a firewall or without the discipline of budget constraints, the trust fund would be unprotected and could be spent on any number of costly programs. 
It is here, and that is what my amendment is all about. Social Security should not be used to pay--in the words of the present chairman of the Budget Committee, `the trust funds would be unprotected and could be spent on any number of costly programs.' These moneys should be spent on one thing and one thing only: paying old-age benefits. 
Silence is golden. My friend from New Mexico did not, in his 20 minutes on the floor, even respond to the statements he gave in 1990. They are in the Congressional Record. Not a word. 
Mr. President, we received today almost a million signatures from a group of senior citizens who signed these petitions in the last few days. They have a right to do that. Of course they do, because, Mr. President, American seniors are exercising a powerful right to stop a devastating wrong. The right to petition our Government for wrongs is guaranteed in the first amendment of the Constitution. This right is a cornerstone of our democracy and deserves to be enshrined in the Constitution, and it was. Giving Congress and the courts the power to permanently raid Social Security should not be guaranteed by the highest, most powerful legal document in our country. 
So, Mr. President, I believe that what is taking place here is a cheap, easy, deceitful way to balance the budget. It is contrary to law to take the Social Security surpluses and use them for other purposes. And even if it weren't law, you shouldn't do it because it is a trust fund, and a trust fund should not be spent for any purpose other than for what the trust fund was established. 
My friend from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, talked about the Concord Coalition and others who last Congress said we would protect this program through enabling legislation. What they were saying in the last Congress is maybe what we can do is have a statute to preserve Social Security. I am sure they must have checked with somebody who is in their first year of law school who told them that a statute will not override the Constitution. 
And after having checked with a first-year law student, they came up with a new pitch, and that is, `Let's go along with it. Let's just raid Social Security.' And that is what they have said. 
Mr. President, my good friend from Utah has also said the Congressional Research Service changed the memo the second time, it doesn't really say what they said it says. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities disagrees. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, among other things, says, all three memos, the two from CRS and theirs, explain that under the Hatch balanced budget amendment, outlays in any year, including outlays for benefits paid from the Social Security trust fund, may not exceed receipts in that year. All three memos note that any funds drawn down from the accumulated Social Security surpluses to help pay for Social Security benefits of retired baby boomers would not count as receipts in those years. 
They go on to say: 
Under the balanced budget amendment, the Social Security surplus could not be tapped and interest earnings on the surplus could not be used unless there was offsetting surplus in the rest of the budget. 
Mr. President, we have a number of other people saying that, and one person saying it is not a first-year law student but a graduate of one of the finest universities in America today, the person who is in charge of the Office of Management and Budget, a person who has a great reputation, Franklin D. Raines. 
Franklin Raines said, in writing this letter to Senator Daschle, the minority leader: 
Dear Mr. Leader: I am writing in response to your inquiry regarding the February 5, 1997, Congressional Research Service memorandum entitled `Treatment of Outlays From Social Security Surpluses Under a Balanced Budget Amendment.' 
That memorandum noted that the 1983 Social Security reforms called for accumulating those surpluses to allow payments even when annual trust fund income is no longer sufficient to make those payments. It concluded that, under S.J. Res. 1 and without further congressional action, accumulated trust fund surpluses could not be used for the full payment of Social Security benefits in any year when outlays would otherwise exceed receipts. That conclusion is correct. 
Under current law, expenditures from trust funds are governed by the amount of funds available in the trust fund balances and by congressional spending authorizations. This general rule applies to the Social Security trust funds. . . 
S.J. Res. 1 would require overall federal government cash flow balance on a year-by-year basis. In the event that revenues are projected to fall below outlays for a given year, outlays would need to be adjusted for the remainder of the year. Such a shortfall would most likely occur toward the end of a fiscal year, when only a limited base of discretionary outlays would be available for reduction. Consequently, programs with monthly payments would be unable to avoid exposure to such reductions. 
All entitlement expenditures--including Social Security--would be treated as expenditures under S.J. Res. 1 and, thus, would be exposed to reductions. This would mean that, due to operation of the proposed constitutional amendment, the government might not be able to make payments from trust funds with both available balances and full congressional authority to make expenditures from the trust fund. Reductions in entitlement spending would have a particularly perverse effect if the revenue shortfall was caused by a recession, and where payments subject to limitation are part of the automatic stabilizers. 
So, Mr. President, it is very clear that the underlying amendment would devastate Social Security. Well, there are some who say, `Why are you trying to protect Social Security, there are other trust funds?' Mr. President, the reason I am trying to protect Social Security is that is where the money is. The other trust funds are pittances. They are bits and kibbles. There really is not much money there. Social Security is the finest social program in the history of the world, and I feel an obligation, a moral obligation, to protect it. 
The reason that there has been all this emphasis on Social Security is they are going after the moneys just as Senator Domenici in 1990 said we should try to prevent. `We need a firewall around those trust funds,' said Senator Domenici, `to make sure the reserves are there to pay Social Security benefits in the next century. Without a firewall of the discipline of budget constraints, the trust funds would be unprotected and could be spent on any number of costly programs.' 
That is a direct quote. 
So, Mr. President, I think we have to narrow the focus of what this is all about. The focus is whether or not we are going to allow the Social Security trust fund to be raided on a yearly basis until it runs out of money and then, of course, Social Security would be wiped out. 
I say, Mr. President, that I suspect, and I feel that I cannot direct this to anybody in the Senate because I do not know, but there are people in the leadership in the House of Representatives who believe the Social Security program is a bad program. Again, I do not think you have to be real bright to figure out that is how they feel. This is a statement from the majority leader, the present majority leader of the House of Representatives. Again, I quote: `Social Security is a rotten trick. I think we are going to have to bite the bullet on Social Security and phase it out over time.' 
Now, does that appear to be somebody that is pushing a balanced budget amendment and wanting to protect Social Security? Would you trust someone of that philosophy to try to draft a statute to avoid a constitutional provision? First of all, you cannot. But even if you could, would you trust someone with that philosophy? I think not. There are people supporting this amendment, recognizing that doing so will wipe out Social Security. 
I think we should not do that. I think we should look at the Helen Collinses of the world and say the money that she is talking about is just a small amount of money. We have a number of letters here that my staff has brought me. One woman talks about getting 300-some-odd-dollars a month. That gives her a little bit of independence. This amendment protects her interest by excluding Social Security from the calculations of the balanced budget amendment. It protects the interest of the Helen Collinses of the world. 
Social Security is, therefore, not at fault for the deficits that have been accumulated. Not a single Social Security recipient is the cause of the deficit. Social Security is not running up deficits. In 1983 we passed legislation to forward fund Social Security. The reason this amendment is so important to some people 
is that is where the money is. They do not want to balance the budget the hard way. 
We heard statements here from President Clinton saying it is going to be real hard to balance the budget if you do not use Social Security. No kidding. I understand that. We all understand that. But if we pass my amendment we would have a true balanced budget and we would also preserve Social Security. I think that is a pretty good deal and I think it is worth the risk. 
The Social Security trust fund is being used to mask the size of the deficit. Each time the Government dips into the Social Security trust fund to help pay for the deficit it hurts Social Security. We should stop that. 
Because the Constitution will require the Federal Government to balance the budget, Social Security moneys will have to come from one of four places. 
I see my friend from Florida. Does he care to make a statement? I am happy to withhold and allow my friend from Florida to make a statement.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I yielded to my friend from Florida, I was saying at that time that if it passes it will require the Federal Government to balance the budget and Social Security moneys after that will have to come from four places. 
No. 1, raise the payroll taxes in order to cover the difference; No. 2, cut benefits to beneficiaries; No. 3, cut Government expenditures and other needed programs to pay its debt to Social Security; and No. 4, because of the language in the constitutional amendment, to get a three-fifths majority of each House to constitutionally raise the debt. 
That is a pretty rough row to hoe. 
Also, it is quite clear that because there is no vote required to borrow from the Social Security trust funds that there is a powerful incentive to borrow from those funds to pay for general programs. 
So I believe we should pass a balanced budget, which is not a gimmick. It isn't going to make it easy. I acknowledge that. If my amendment passes, it is going to be extremely difficult to balance the budget. But when we do, it will be a fair way to balance the budget. We will not be using the surpluses out of Social Security to balance that budget. 
Mr. President, last Saturday the President gave his weekly statement to the American public over the radio. He said in that radio address: 
Over the last several weeks, we've received the full data on our country's economic progress for the last four years. The economy created 11.5 million new jobs, for the first time ever in a single term. That includes a million construction jobs and millions of other good paying jobs. 
In fact, Mr. President, 60 percent of the jobs were high-paying jobs. 
Entrepreneurs have started a record number of new businesses, hundreds of thousands of them owned by women and minorities. We've the largest increase in home ownership ever, a big drop in the poverty rate, and a big increase in family income. And just this week, we learned that the combined rate of unemployment and inflation over the last four years is the lowest for a Presidential term since the 1960's. 
That is a direct quote from the President's address. 
There is more that he said. But, among other things, he said, if this amendment passes, that: 
. . . it could force the Secretary of the Treasury to cut Social Security, or drive the budget into courts of law when a deficit occurred when Congress was not working on the budget. In a court of law, judges could be forced to halt Social Security checks, or raise new taxes just to meet the demands of the constitutional amendment. 
I say that isn't very pleasant. 
Also, there are millions of people out there young and old who believe that this Senate Joint Resolution 1 is bad. For example, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security stated in a February 11 letter that my amendment will preserve the integrity of the Social Security fund under a balanced budget constitutional amendment. Borrowing from a reserve to finance the current debt will place a heavy burden on future generations because the debt to the trust fund must be repaid with interest. 
The American public support my position. Almost 75 percent of the people in the polling data in the last week say we want a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, but not if you include Social Security. 
The argument being used by the proponents of this amendment is Orwellian. They are saying that because we have been stealing money from the Social Security trust fund in the past that we should go ahead and stick it in the Constitution. We are saying exempt it. That is what should be done. 
I know that my friend, the minority whip, wishes to speak. I am very happy to have him speak. But I want to just say, Mr. President, that this is not a group of Democrats only. Maybe in the Senate. But in the House we have some courageous Republicans--most of them sophomores--who have said we are not going to be taken down the path to destroy Social Security, and we will not vote for a balanced budget amendment unless we can vote on an amendment like Senator Reid is propounding. 
This is what Congressman David McIntosh, a sophomore Republican House Member from Indiana, said, `Republicans cannot allow us to be defined as cutting Social Security even as we move forward with the balanced budget amendment.' 
I say that Congressman McIntosh has it right. We should follow his lead. Some of the people on the other side of the aisle and over here should follow this courageous young man and vote for my amendment. 
Mr. President, how much time does this side have?

Mr. REID. Mr. President, my amendment is not one I want to direct to big numbers, even though that is what this body has talked about during these past few days. But I want to draw your attention to small numbers, people who draw Social Security checks on a monthly basis. They do not understand the billions and trillions of dollars we are talking about. They understand the hundreds of dollars they receive on a monthly basis because the check they receive represents the difference between retirement with dignity and retirement in poverty. 
The reason President Roosevelt signed the bill in August 1935 was to give seniors dignity, and, Mr. President, that is what Social Security has done. I repeat, it is the most successful social program in the history of the world. And we are about to give everyone an opportunity to see how they stand for Social Security. 
We have had people come to this floor and say, well, I am a big supporter of Social Security. I have a lot of seniors in my State. 
I have no doubt that is true. But if you want to protect Social Security, exclude it. Why? Because to do otherwise, these funds will continue to be raided and the Social Security trust fund will be a slush fund. 
Most, as I have indicated, express public support for continued maintenance of Social Security. But this is the test right now. Vote to support a balanced budget amendment, a true, honest, nondeceptive balanced budget amendment. Those who say they will not use Social Security to balance the budget cannot have it 
both ways. You cannot say we are not going to use Social Security, we are going to protect Social Security and say that we are going to do it. And I agree with the chairman of the Budget Committee when he said in 1990 there should be a firewall developed to protect Social Security. I want that firewall, and that is what this amendment is. 
We have communication from the Congressional Research Service, the President of the United States, the Office of Management and Budget, think tanks, who say if you pass this amendment, you are going to destroy Social Security. Absent an express exemption of the Social Security trust fund, we will place at risk the ability to draw down those reserves when the baby boomers begin to retire. We have both a moral and a fiduciary relationship to prevent this. 
We all know that the practice of misusing Social Security trust funds is wrong, so let us stop it. Let us terminate it. This is the chance to do that. About 75 percent of the American public agrees with us. Why do we not do something for a change that the American public thinks is the right thing to do, not continue the smoke and mirrors process that has been going on in this country so long that we have stacks of deficits that big, 4 or 5 feet high as indicated by my friend from Utah. It has been referred to as the Reagan-Bush budget deficit memorial. That is what it is. Huge deficits have accumulated during these years. They must stop. They have gone down in the last 4 years from over $300 billion to a little over $100 billion. We can do better. 
My amendment, even as my opponents concede, is the only way to do this. But they say if you do it, it is going to be hard to balance the budget. I am willing to take that chance and make the hard, make the difficult choices because when we do it, it will not be smoke and mirrors. It will not be a gimmick. We will be balancing the budget the right way, the proper way, and we will protect the most important social program in the history of the world. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, even the great mind, Justice Scalia, who does not like legislative history, does not like to look at it, even Justice Scalia would recognize we have established in this matter a legislative history that is second to none. We are taking Social Security from the confines of this balanced budget amendment. This is not all alone, floating in the air. It is out on its own, as it was required by law in 1990. All of a sudden we are ignoring this law we passed. Any one of the Senators who voted for this in 1990 and now does not vote for my amendment better check his or her record on inconsistency, because this would probably be at the top of their inconsistency list. 
The only way to protect Social Security is the way we are doing it. We are not running full-page ads paid for by the Wall Street brokers and power brokers. We are trying to establish, through petitions signed by a million people that were received today, that what is being done with Senate Joint Resolution 1 is wrong. We are representing the recipients, the beneficiaries of Social Security, not the people who want to raid Social Security so it will be easier to balance the budget. 
We are supported by the beneficiaries past and those in the future and those in the present. We are supported by the American public by almost 75 percent in polls taken. We are supported by the National Committee to Save Social Security, by the President, in letter and in radio address. We are supported by the Office of Management and Budget. 
Mr. President, we are supported by Republicans in the House of Representatives who have stepped forward courageously to say we are not going to be seen as trying to cut Social Security. I repeat, I hope some of my friends on the other side of the aisle will step forward with the courage shown by Congressman McIntosh, Republican of Indiana. 
Mr. President, Franklin Roosevelt, when this legislation was signed, said that he had an obligation not only to protect business interests. I feel that same obligation to protect business interests. I am for reduction in the capital gains tax. I was for the legislation that gave significant incentives to small businesses last year that we passed in conjunction with the minimum wage bill. But as President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, said: 
. . . just as Government in the past has helped lay the foundation of business and industry. We must face the fact that in this country we have a rich man's security and a poor man's security and that the Government owes equal obligations to both. National security is not a half and half manner: it is all or none. 
We have to help business and we have to help the small person. We are trying to help those people who are trying to survive to maintain their dignity. That is what this amendment is all about. I repeat, anyone who voted in 1990 to take Social Security off budget and now votes against my amendment had better recognize that that is probably about as inconsistent as you can be, legislatively. 
I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. It is the right thing to do for the American public.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the record is quite clear. The issue on the balanced budget amendment is quite narrow. The issue is whether or not we should balance the budget using the Social Security surplus. 
The arguments always are, `Well, we have been doing it in the past.' That is my whole premise. Why should we continue to do it in the future and enshrine it in the Constitution? I say no. I say if we are going to balance the budget, we should do it the right way, the hard way, the honest way, and not include in the calculations to arrive at a balanced budget the Social Security surpluses. 
We have a number of amendments, and just speaking for this Senator, I have not supported any of the other amendments to the underlying amendment. I want my focus to be very clear. Even though I think when statements are made, as was made by my friend from Wyoming, that my State balances its budget, the fact is they really do not. The fact is that States have their capital expenditures off budget, through their bonding process. The State of Nevada does this, as do the vast majority of the other States. That is how they balance their budget. They simply exclude the costs of building construction and other long-term capital expenditures. Even though there will be an attempt to amend the underlying matter now before this body with a capital expenditure budget, even though I think that makes some sense, I will not support that. My emphasis, my concerns are about the permanent misuse of the Social Security trust fund if my amendment is defeated. I have made that very clear. 
As I spoke yesterday, Social Security is a program we have had for 60-plus years. It was a program for dealing with old age, principally. It was not a giveaway. It was not a handout. It is a program that is given to people when they reach age 62 or 65, whatever eligibility might be for that particular person. It is done without any means testing. Why? Because people have paid into a Social Security trust fund for purposes of having those moneys set aside when they get old. An employer pays in, an employee pays in. It is now about 13 percent of every dollar they earn that is paid into the trust fund for their future years. 
As I indicated, trust funds, whether handled by an insurance fiduciary or a lawyer, must be treated very carefully. There are definitions in any dictionary about what a trust fund is. It is `assured reliance on the character, ability, strength or truth of someone or something; one in which confidence is placed; reliance on future payment for property held by one for the benefit of another; something committed or entrusted for one to be used or cared for in the interest of another.' This is how Webster defines it. That being the case, Mr. President, it seems to me it is unfair that we use Social Security trust fund moneys for purposes other than for which they were collected. 
It is a trust. It is an agreement between the Federal Government of the United States and its workers. We hold these moneys in trust in the interest of the American people. They should not be used for some other purpose. They should not be used for foreign aid. They should not be used for any other purpose. They should be used only for the old-age recipients. I believe Social Security is a binding contract between the U.S. Government and the American people. We should not violate that. 
The fact that we have been using those moneys in the past for other purposes does not mean we should continue to do it. I think we should balance the budget, but we should do it in the right way, the fair way, the honest way, by excluding the Social Security trust fund moneys. 
In 1983, a commission headed by Alan Greenspan advised raising payroll taxes, with the end of achieving long-term actuarial balance, and hence to ensure that we are prepared for the retirement of the baby boomers. Congress voted to raise the payroll contribution made by workers because these funds are not ordinary taxes but are rather unique moneys contributed to the trust fund that deserve our special consideration and protection. 
In 1990, the Senate, understanding the need to protect these Social Security funds, voted 98-2 to pull it out of the unified budget, showing our interest in protecting Social Security trust funds from misuse. The present chairman of the Budget Committee, the senior Senator from New Mexico, said at that time that he reluctantly voted for this amendment, and his reluctance was that it wasn't strong enough. He felt that these moneys should be set aside and not used to offset the deficit. 
I appeal to everyone to review the statement made by a person that I believe understands money about as well as anybody in this body. The underlying balanced budget amendment would effectively overturn the 1990 decision to place Social Security off budget and would undermine what then the senior Senator from New Mexico said. 
Last year, this body went on record again with a huge vote, pledging we would not raise or cut Social Security in order to balance the budget. Did that vote mean anything? It didn't mean much, because we are in the process now of using surpluses this year to again balance the budget. These votes, the one in 1990 and the one last year, demonstrate the unique position Social Security holds, as well as our commitment to the American people to protect this trust fund that we have set up. It is our obligation to do everything in our power to protect the Social Security trust fund. 
It is no different than when any attorney in the United States takes a client's money and puts it into a fund. They cannot use that money for any purpose other than for the client. We can't pay personal expenses. To do so would cause the attorney to lose his or her license. The balanced budget amendment, without an express exemption, places Social Security in serious danger. 
So, Mr. President, I believe that we need to step back and understand what a simple message this is. My amendment would simply disallow Social Security trust fund moneys from being used to offset the deficit. That seems fair. If we want to balance the budget, let's do it the right way. The easy way is to use the Social Security moneys. People are running around pounding their chests about what strong people they are for taking Social Security money to balance the budget. That is the easy way. If you really want to balance the budget in 2002, have a real, honest balanced budget, do it the hard way, not the easy way, and take--this year, $80 billion--that money to mask the deficit. People ask, what would we do? We would have to either cut expenses or raise taxes. That is the only way it can be done--not to circumvent what I think is the clear intent of the Social Security law, that we should not use Social Security surpluses to balance the budget. 
So, in short, Mr. President, I think we should pass a balanced budget that isn't a gimmick. It should be a straight on, tough, hard procedure. We should balance the budget without using these huge surpluses in Social Security. We have the President of the United States, among others, including the Congressional Research Service and the Center for Budget and Policy Review, who say that if this underlying amendment passes, the courts will be deciding what should be cut and whether Social Security gets paid. 
So the constitutionally permitted raiding of the trust fund would be devastating to current and future beneficiaries and would undermine confidence in this Nation's most successful Government program. I believe Social Security must be viewed as one leg of a three-legged stool, Mr. President. You should have, in addition to 
Social Security, private pensions and savings. However, 50 percent of all Americans do not have pension protection. Hence, they rely on Social Security checks as the mainstay of their income in their later years. Letters come in to me daily from seniors in Nevada saying that, without Social Security checks, they would be destitute. They plead with me--and I am sure with others--to protect Social Security. Current polls have shown that young people are concerned about Social Security, and well they should be when people are trying to use their moneys to mask the deficit. 
A nationwide poll showed that almost 75 percent of the American public do not want a balanced budget if Social Security surpluses are used to balance the budget. Misuse of Social Security trust funds moneys must stop. If we are going to balance the budget, let's do it the right way. Let's protect Social Security trust funds, as well as the trust of the American worker. In the language of the honorable senior Senator from New Mexico on June 10, 1990, `We need a firewall around those trust funds to make sure that the reserves are there to pay Social Security benefits in the next century.' 
It could not be said better, because this amendment I have offered does provide that firewall that my friend, the senior Senator from New Mexico, the present chairman of the Budget Committee, said was necessary.  
Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.

Mr. REID. My only statement to my friend from Wyoming--I am happy to see my western representative friend in the Chamber--is if we have a unified budget, why did we vote on more than one occasion to take it off budget? Social Security is not part of the unified budget. And because we have violated that, what we have done here on the Senate floor and in the House does not make it right. I believe the highway trust fund should be taken off budget. I have offered legislation on this floor--it is pending right now--saying we ought to spend money in the highway trust fund. 
The reason we are talking about the Social Security trust fund is just like Willie Sutton; when he was asked why he robbed banks, he said, `That's where the money is.' Social Security is where the bucks are. There is very little money in the highway trust fund on a comparable basis to Social Security. So that is why we are protecting Social Security. 
Emotional? Yes, it is emotional. It is emotional because people like my friend, Helen Collins, from Nevada said: 
I have been a widow since age 21. I never considered applying for any kind of welfare assistance. I worked and raised and educated my son. He got a master's degree. Sad to say, at age 71 I am totally on my own on quite a limited budget. By being very careful, I get by. However, I do worry about getting more seriously ill and losing Social Security. For many of us, these are not the golden years. But I, for one, thank God that good people like you are helping us maintain our dignity and independence. 
The underlined word, Mr. President, is `independence.' 
So there are people who do consider Social Security an emotional issue because it is emotional. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. REID. That is absolutely true. It is this Senator's feeling, as well as the sponsors, of which my friend from North Dakota is one, that it is unfair to balance the budget the easy way, and that is to use these huge Social Security surpluses that we have had in the past and that we will have in the near future to offset the deficit. It is not fair.

Mr. REID. While my friend was coming to the floor, I made an analogy. Willie Sutton, probably the most famous bank robber of all time, after he was apprehended and in jail, was interviewed, and they said--I do not know if they called him `Willie' or `Mr. Sutton,' but they said, `Why did you rob banks?' He was very succinct and to the point. `Because that's where the money was.' 
And that is why they are doing what they are doing here, I say to my friend. They are going after Social Security because that is where the money is. There are huge surpluses in the Social Security trust fund. There are other trust funds but they are dribbles and drabs compared with the $80 billion this year alone. So they are going after this money because that is where it is.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the early 1930's, this country faced what was called the Great Depression. That was a time that in the history books is even hard to understand. But banks had their doors locked and depositors could not get into the bank to get their money. Banks were formally closed and informally closed. Factories were either slowed down or stopped completely. Homes were foreclosed upon. Families moved in with each other. You had brothers living with brothers and everyone living with each other. It was such that books were written about what was taking place. It was the `Grapes of Wrath,' as indicated in the book by John Steinbeck, where the State of California, to stop people from migrating to California, actually tried to close its borders, as people were fleeing from the economic hardship they found in the States east of California. 
We were a rich nation. We are a rich nation. But the rich nation we knew had collapsed. Mines were closed. Farms became dust bowls. Trees were not cut in our forests. It was the stuff of which songs were written. The troubadour of the Depression, Woody Guthrie, wrote many songs dealing with the Depression--`Dust Bowl Blues,' `End of the Line,' `Hey, Buddy, Have You Got a Dime.' These are a few of the songs Woody Guthrie wrote. 
There was much written, Mr. President, that capitalism had failed, and maybe even democracy was failing. We had soup kitchens, bread lines, people scavenged the dumps to find the bare necessities of life. The rules and laws that said kids should go to school were not enforced. Some say that up to 25 percent of children were malnourished. We have terms that were originated during the Depression, such as `tramps,' `bums,' `hitchhikers,' and `railriders.' More than 30 percent of the people were out of jobs. Those with jobs, many times, wished they had no jobs because they worked endless hours, for almost no pay. Only about 15 percent of the people of that day had pensions. It was during this time of calamity, this time of depression, that people said we have to do something else. 
Mr. President, one of the things that was done was, we adopted during the Great Depression in 1935 a program we call Social Security. It was a noble experiment. It has come to be the finest social program in the history of the world. What was said during that debate 60 years ago or more? Among other things, President Roosevelt said, on August 14, 1935, when he signed the bill: 
Today, a hope of many years standing is, in large part, fulfilled. The civilization of the past 100 years, with its startling industrial changes, has tended more and more to make life insecure. Young people have come to wonder what would be their lot when they came to old age. The man with a job has wondered how long that job would last. The Social Security measure gives us at least some protection, and protection to as many as 30 million of our citizens who will reap direct benefits through unemployment compensation, old-age pension, and through increased services for the protection of children of the prevention of ill health. 
We can never ensure 100 percent of the population 100 percent of the vicissitudes of life. But we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age. 
He went on to say: 
If the Senate and the House of Representatives in this long, arduous session. . . 
Remember, Mr. President, this was in the throes of the Great Depression. 
If the Senate and House of Representatives in its long, arduous session have done nothing more than pass this bill, the session will be regarded as historic for all time. 
Said President Franklin Roosevelt. 
Mr. President, at that time we lived by the radio--not TV, but by radio. The President gave a radio address where, among other things, he said, on August 15, on the fifth anniversary of Social Security: 
Five years ago the term `Social Security' was new to American ears. Today it has significance for more than 40 million men and women workers whose application for old age insurance accounts have been received. This system is designed to ensure them an income for life after old age retires them from their jobs. 
He went on to say in this same address to the American public:  
The millions of today want and have a right to the same security their forefathers sought--the assurance that with the health and willingness to work they will find a place for themselves in the social and economic system for the time. Because it is becoming increasingly difficult for individuals to build their own security singlehanded, Government must now step in to help them lay the foundation stones. Just as Government in the past has helped lay the foundation of business and industry, we must face the fact that in this country we have a rich man's security and a poor man's security, and that the Government owes equal obligations to both. National security is not half and half. It is all or none. The Social Security Act offers to all our citizens a workable and working method of meeting urgent present needs and future needs. It utilizes the familiar machinery of a Federal-State government to promote the commonwealth and the economic stability of the Nation. The act does not offer anyone, either individual or collectively, an easy life, nor was it ever intended to do so. None of the sums of money paid out to the individual in assistance or insurance will spell anything approaching abundance, but they will furnish that minimum necessary to keep a foothold, and that is the kind of protection Americans want. 
Mr. President, these were some statements made by Franklin Roosevelt. These statements that he made were visionary because we have established in this country a program that people depend on. 
I received a letter in my office today from one Helen Collins who lives in Las Vegas. I wrote her a letter to talk about the balanced budget. She wanted to know about it. So I answered her request. 
She wrote on the bottom of my letter a handwritten note dated 
February 18, 1997. 
Dear Senator Reid: Thank you for the update and for supporting a balanced budget amendment which expressly exempts the Social Security trust fund. I have been a widow since age 21. I never considered applying for any kind of welfare assistance. I worked, and raised and educated my son. He got a master's degree. Sad to say, at age 71, I am totally on my own on quite a limited budget. By being very careful, I get by. However, I do worry about getting more seriously ill and losing Social Security. For many of us, these are not the golden years. But I, for one, thank God that good people like you are helping us maintain our dignity and independence. Sincerely, Helen M. Collins. 
Mr. President, this is what the President of the United States said more than 60 years ago. He said, `The act does not offer anyone'--not Helen Collins or anyone else--`either individually or collectively, an easy life, nor was it ever intended to do so * * * but they will furnish the minimum necessary to keep a foothold, and that is the kind of protection Americans want.' 
I repeat, the most successful social program in the history of the world is Social Security. This amendment is an effort to save Social Security. 
I have listened to the arguments for the last several years about this balanced budget amendment and why it is important. I agree. But I agree, Mr. President, that the balanced budget amendment should pass only if it exempts Social Security. 
I think we should have a balanced budget the hard way, the right way. Why should we use $80 billion this year, as an example, in surplus in Social Security to help disguise and offset the budget? We should not. 
When I first started this matter a number of years ago--3 years ago, to be exact--I was a lone voice crying in the wilderness. That is not the way it is anymore. We have gained support. In the last year we gained support from people like courageous Republican Congressmen in the House of Representatives who have said they will support a balanced budget amendment, but they want the opportunity to exclude Social Security because they believe also that, if we are going to balance the budget, it should be done honestly. It should be done the hard way. 
This Social Security Program that was set up 60-plus years ago was a fairly simple and principled experiment. They said what we will do is have the employer and the employee pay into a trust fund those moneys that will be saved so that people when they retire can have some money. Remember, Mr. President, we are talking about a Social Security trust fund. 
Before coming to Congress, I was a practicing lawyer. I represented people who had problems and needed guidance. In some of the work that I did, I dealt with my clients' money. I established in my office trust accounts for my clients. And in this trust account, I would put my clients' money. If I took any part of that money, $10, $100, $1,000, $10,000, any portion of it for personal use, to buy my wife a coat, to make a car payment, to make a house payment, or to go to dinner, I would be subject to disbarment. They could take my license to practice law. Not only could they do that, but if the activities that I had committed were egregious enough, I could be prosecuted criminally. I do not see why the Social Security trust fund should be any different. What right do we have to pilfer those trust funds? 
I have heard arguments made here on the floor of the Senate by people saying, `Well, that is what we have been doing in the past.' Well, isn't that great? Does that mean we should place in the Constitution or enshrine in the Constitution of the United States the fact that we have been taking money wrongly in the past from Social Security? It is an easy way to balance the budget. It adds billions, coming to trillions of dollars by the year 2029 to balance that. It is an easy way to balance the budget. No wonder there is a rush to balance the budget when you are going to violate and take money out of the Social Security trust fund. 
I have heard people say, `Well, there may be a little confusion here with Social Security. What we will do after we pass the constitutional amendment is we will then come back and pass a statute that says you can't use Social Security.' That is really stretching, because we all know you can't pass a statute to override an expressed provision in the Constitution. A promise like that is really meaningless. 
Proponents know the calamity of passing it. I say if we want to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, just exclude Social Security. This would pass with 85 votes in the Senate and probably at least 350 votes in the House. Social Security is not a giveaway. It is not an entitlement program. It is a program, though, that requires sacrifice by an employer and employee, and because of that I believe we should do everything within our power to make sure that Social Security remains strong for the foreseeable future. 
There are some who say that if we have this amendment, then people can claim everything as Social Security. You can claim that building highways is Social Security. That is so fallacious and wrong. Social Security is enshrined in the law. We know what Social Security is. The underlying amendment diverts Social Security revenues for other uses. It could force future Social Security cuts to resolve frequent budget crunches, and I think more positively would force future Social Security cuts to resolve frequent budget crunches. It will force Social Security into an early funding crisis. 
Also, this is a little off the point, but I have heard arguments today saying, well, States balance their budgets; why don't we? I have been a constitutional officeholder in the State of Nevada, served three legislative sessions. People go around saying Nevada has a balanced budget, just like most States. They do not have a balanced budget. What they do is put capital expenditures off budget. They bond for that. There is no balanced budget in the State of Nevada or most other States. But I am willing to go for a balanced budget. I am saying we will keep the capital expenditures off. All I want is to exclude Social Security. My amendment seeks a balanced budget that protects Social Security. It keeps Social Security revenues in the trust fund. It protects Social Security from cuts. It preserves the 1983 long-term rescue of Social Security. It protects Social Security. 
In 1983, Tip O'Neil, Ronald Reagan, Claude Pepper, and a number of others got together to determine what they could do to fund Social Security in the foreseeable future. Social Security was in a time of crisis. They got together in a bipartisan fashion and funded Social Security, they thought at the time, to go to the year 2060. We know now that fund will likely go to the year 2029 or thereabouts. But they did excellent work. In 1983, they reformed Social Security to preserve it for future generations. We can preserve it long after 2029 with some minor adjustments. I served as a member of the entitlement commission where we studied this and other issues for more than a year. 
So to finance Social Security benefits, low- and middle-income wage earners now pay a heavier payroll tax than wealthier Americans. The largest single tax that people pay is Social Security. It would seem to me that it would be logical and fair to do what we can to secure those benefits. 
The underlying amendment would abandon our commitment to future retirees. No funds could be reserved for future use. The constitutional amendment would supersede the statutory transfer of bonds into the Social Security trust fund. If we adopt the current 
underlying balanced budget amendment, we remove the obligation to eventually use the Social Security surpluses to pay benefits. 
The underlying amendment would force Social Security cuts. It will force crisis. It will encourage deadlock. 
In a letter to Tom Daschle from the President of the United States, January 20 of this year, the President said:  
In the event of an impasse in which the budget requirements can neither be waived nor met, disbursement of Social Security collections would cease or unelected judges could reduce benefits to comply with this constitutional mandate. No subsequent implementing legislation would protect Social Security with certainty because a constitutional amendment would override statutory law. 
That is pretty specific. Would there be a crisis? Of course there would be a crisis. We would have three alternatives: have deep cuts in Social Security or deep cuts in other programs we have already cut to the bone. Alternatively, we could have massive tax increases. I think any one of those is not something I look forward to. I think we should pass my amendment and then pass a real constitutional amendment to balance the budget. The Democratic alternative, the one that I am offering, would allow the trust fund to spend surpluses, keeping Social Security viable for many years. 
We have heard a lot in this past week about the need to protect Social Security. It is important to recognize in a little more detail the history of Social Security and appreciate why some of us are fighting so hard for this express exemption. I have said and I believe that Social Security is the most successful social program in the history of the world. It was enacted on August 14, 1935, at a time this country was in the throes of the greatest depression this country has ever felt and perhaps the greatest worldwide depression ever. It was enacted to provide for the general welfare by establishing a system of Federal old age benefits and by enabling the several States to make more adequate provision for its old. 
The real significance of this act is that it was this country's first major Federal program to deal directly with the economic security of its citizens. 
Before then, this matter was handled by States and private sources. In those days we had what were called poorhouses. Each county had a poorhouse where they woul put poor people They were not pleasant. Some were better than others. There were no standards. Whatever the counties could provide with State assistance is where people went. 
Social Security took away county poorhouses. Federal action became necessary because neither the States nor private charities had the financial resources to cope with the growing need during the depression years. The balanced budget amendment now before this body radically alters in one fell swoop this program. It shifts the burden for ensuring the economic security of our Nation's senior citizens. It puts us on the course of turning this responsibility back to individual States and private charities, and it does so, in my opinion, in a very deceitful way. 
Balancing the budget is very hard. It is made significantly 
easier by having these Social Security surpluses. If those surpluses were not available, we would really have to bite the bullet. We would have to make some significant changes, but we would at least have an honest balanced budget. This is not an honest balanced budget. And there is no wonder that the Helen Collinses of the world write and say, `We are afraid of our little security you are going to take away from us.' They have reason to be afraid. 
I have talked on this Senate floor a number of times about my grandmother. The first time I ever heard of Social Security was from my grandmother. I never knew my grandmother as a young woman. I knew my grandmother as short and somewhat heavy. She did not get around very well. She had eight children. She lived in a very rural part of Nevada, in a very depressed place, but my grandmother had dignity because she was able every month to get her old age pension check, and she was proud of that. It gave her dignity and independence from her eight children. She did not have to be a ward to her family, and she was one of the lucky ones because she had a family. Think of how much more insecure a person who had no family would feel. 
So Social Security is an important program. People like Helen Collins should be worried, because if this amendment passes, Social Security as we know it is gone. It will be destroyed. 
What is the recent history of Social Security? We have talked about it a little bit. We have talked about what happened in 1983 in this bipartisan commission. But we have also had a current commission. Included were former majority leader Dole and current Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan, a notable opponent of the balanced budget amendment. 
But these people studied what should take place. The panel charted a course to long-term solvency. This contract that we have, the Social Security contract, is really a Contract With America, the first Contract With America, one that means something to people on the street. People on the street may not understand the importance to them individually of term limits, of line-item veto, of prayer in school. But they do understand the importance of getting a Social Security check. Separate and apart from the merits that I have just spoken of, Social Security is a Contract With America. 
So, in short, we must protect what happened in 1935 and how it was again protected in 1983. The only way to do that is to pass this amendment. 
In 1990, there was an amendment offered on this floor. It was an amendment offered by Senator Hollings. It became known as the section 13301 amendment. The effect of this amendment was that it took Social Security off budget. It passed overwhelmingly out of committee. All but one person voted for it out of committee. All but two Senators voted for it in the Senate. It got 98 votes. The author of this amendment has spoken on this floor eloquently on a number of occasions. The junior Senator from South Carolina said he offered this amendment for the purpose of protecting the integrity of the trust funds of the Social Security system. The purpose of the Hollings amendment was to separate Social Security from the unified budget. 
After we established the payroll tax we wanted to ensure the money was excluded from the unified budget. It passed by a vote of 98 to 2. It was a strong statement of congressional intent to protect Social Security. 
The balanced budget amendment now before this body repeals something we passed 98 to 2. The plain language of S. J. Res. 1, the underlying amendment here, makes it clear that Social Security should be treated as part of the unified budget and should be used to bring down the deficit. It is ironic that some would suggest that this should occur after we voted just a few years ago by a vote of 98 to 2 to pass the Hollings amendment. The real inconsistency is that voting in 1990 to remove Social Security from the budget and then voting in 1997 to again include it. 
I do not think there are many people in this body who would say that the senior Senator from New Mexico does not understand budgetary matters. In fact, I think he has had a wide ranging experience, not only serving on the Budget Committee but serving on the Appropriations Committee, where I have had the pleasure of serving with him during my tenure in the Senate. The senior Senator from New Mexico, during the time that the debate took place on the Hollings amendment, said, among other things, `I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal because I support'--this is a direct quote--`I support the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget deficit calculation. But I cast this vote with reservations.' 
Now, listen to his reservation:  
The best way to protect Social Security is to reduce the Federal budget deficit. We need to balance our non-Social Security budget so that the Social Security trust fund surpluses can be invested . . . instead of used to pay for other Federal operating costs. We could move toward this goal without changing the unified budget, a concept which has served us well for over 20 years now. 
So what the chairman of the Budget Committee today said back in 1990 is that we have to support the Hollings amendment. And he voted for it. The only reason he did not like it is it was not strong enough. 
Again: 
I voted for Senator Hollings' proposal [this is the senior Senator from New Mexico talking] because I support the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget deficit calculations. But I cast this vote with reservations. 
And here I say, what are his reservations? It was that the provision, the Hollings amendment, was not strong enough. He wanted to build a firewall. He, Senator Domenici, went on to say: 
We need a firewall around those trust funds to make sure those reserves are there to pay benefits in the next century. Without a firewall or the discipline of budget constraints, the trust funds would be unprotected and could be spent on any number of costly programs. 
Now, please, someone tell me how we can go forward now, 7 years later, after the chairman of the Budget Committee said this in 1990? I mean, is this misspeak? 
Many of us spent a great deal of time reviewing the recent report by the Advisory Council on Social Security, and I mean within the past few months. This panel of experts was charged with providing recommendations to Congress on the long-term solvency of the trust funds. There were 13 members from all walks of life, chaired by a professor from a university in Michigan. They were not unanimous, but all 13 said that Social Security trust fund moneys should be invested in some fashion; part of them. Six felt one way, five another way, one another way, but they all felt these moneys should be partially invested in the private sector. 
Now we are saying, if this amendment passes, that this 13-member commission, their work would go for naught, because you cannot invest moneys if there aren't any. And there would be no moneys if this amendment passed because the surpluses would be used to offset the deficit. So, should we now vote to utilize the trust funds for balancing the budget that will place at risk our ability to pursue these proposals suggested by the 13-member commission just a matter of few months ago? One proposal calls for investing a portion of the current trust fund in the equities market. You cannot invest in the equities market unless there is some money left over, so you could not do that. 
We need to understand the importance of the mission of the advisory panel. We paid this group of experts to find solutions that will bring about long-term solvency of the funds. By including Social Security in a balanced budget amendment, we are, in fact, admitting that we care not about the long-term solvency of the trust fund. What we are really saying is that the short-term goal of balancing the budget is all that matters. 
I am saying the American public wants us to stop playing games back here. If we are going to have a balanced budget amendment, let us do it the right way, let us do it the honest way: Exclude Social Security and not use those huge surpluses that will be going on for the next 30-plus years. 
We are not simply negating their findings by passing this underlying amendment. In fact, we are negating the whole reason we organized this Commission in the first place. And we are negating the need for Social Security. 
There are some people who do not want Social Security. I believe that there are people who would rather Social Security fail. I need look no further. I pull this out. I carry this with me all the time. This is a quote from the majority leader of the House of Representatives, House Majority Leader Dick Armey: 
Social Security is a rotten trick. I think we are going to have to bite the bullet on Social Security and phase it out over time. 
Does that sound like somebody who wants to save Social Security? I think not. 
Mr. President, there is a need for an express exemption of Social Security. It is Congress' obligation to ensure both parties perform their obligations under the terms of the contract we have with the people of America. This will not be possible if the underlying balanced budget amendment passes. It can only happen if we exempt Social Security. 
Social Security is a program that is working. It is a Government program that works. The poverty rate for today's seniors is about 10 percent, the lowest in the history of this country. What was it prior to the adoption of Social Security? It is obvious that someone like Helen Collins would be in one of those poor houses. A widow since age 21, who struggled and worked to put her only child through college, now is pleading with us: `All I have is Social Security. I have never had to go to welfare. Social Security is not a welfare program. Can't you do something to make sure you protect Social Security?' 
That is all we are asking. Adopt this amendment and then go ahead and pass a balanced budget amendment. But I say to my friends, please, don't pass the underlying amendment unless we exclude Social Security. The poverty rate today for seniors is 10.5 percent, the lowest in the history of this country. We don't need poorhouses anymore. We don't need people, like my friend who wrote me this handwritten note, in a poorhouse. 
Why don't we have poorhouses? Why do we have a poverty rate of seniors at 10.5 percent? We have it because of one reason, and that is Social Security. 
Are we concerned about the raiding of this surplus by those intent on enforcing the balanced budget amendment? Maybe so. This is not a Democrat or Republican issue, I hope. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would recognize that Social Security is a program that is important to both Democrats and Republicans. We need Republican support to adopt this amendment, and I plead with my friends, adopt this amendment. We have some courageous Members in the House of Representatives, sophomore Republican Members of the House, who are leading the fight over there to exclude Social Security from a balanced budget amendment. I think we should all be proud of them. We need some Republican Senators to join with them. 
What we can't support is an attempt to use Social Security as a means of achieving this short-term goal. To do so would be a breach of our obligation under the terms of the Social Security contract with America that we have. In short, people pay into the Social Security trust fund through a lifetime of their employment in the labor force with the guarantee that they will get their money back upon retirement. It is a simple contract to understand. Today's workers support today's retirees, and tomorrow's workers support tomorrow's retirees. This simplicity belies the high regard and faith that the American worker has for this guarantee. 
So, at a time when so many are attacking this institution, questioning their faith in the system, it is imperative we provide Americans with the guarantee that while we all will sacrifice to balance the budget, we will all sacrifice equally, we won't do it on the back of Social Security, because to do so would just be another gimmick, another thing that was referred to as smoke and mirrors. 
This amendment should receive the support of everybody supporting the balanced budget amendment. While some have given assurances Social Security will not be touched in the enforcement of a balanced budget amendment, this amendment will put teeth into that assurance. If people on the other side of the aisle say, `We agree with the Senator, we don't think Social Security should be touched either; in fact, we will pass a resolution, we will even tell you we will pass a statute after this becomes effective,' well, it is wasteful, it will be meaningless. The only way that it will work is if it is included in this amendment. Let's exclude Social Security. 
Our amendment gives all an opportunity to, in effect, step up to the proverbial plate and take a swing at what is the right thing to do, and that is to exlude Social Security so that it is protected. If they don't wish to protect Social Security, they should not support our amendment. Promises not to raid the Social Security system are insufficient and really unenforceable. We need a binding commitment, and this amendment will do just that. 
Social Security affects all of us. There are proposals that include investing this money in the private market. This cannot be done unless we exempt the trust funds to ensure those funds are available for investment. By not exempting Social Security, we not only hurt today's senior citizens but are compromising the future of tomorrow's retirees as well. This is not an amendment that helps people with white hair only. This is an amendment that helps their children and their children's children. 
As I indicated, Mr. President, when I started this 3 years ago, I had very little support and help. But the message is resonating to the American people. Within the past 10 days, there have been two comprehensive nationwide polls. Hart-Teeter--now, remember, these are Republican pollsters. They poll for Republicans running for office. They also do work in the markets. They did a poll for NBC, National Broadcasting Co., and the Wall Street Journal. Mr. President, 71 percent of the people polled said they will not support a balanced budget amendment unless Social Security is excluded. A similar poll was conducted a few days later by the New York Times. Like numbers. Almost 75 percent of the American people say, `Do not balance the budget if Social Security is included.' They say, `Balance the budget, but exclude Social Security.' 
We have a number of think tanks that have taken a very close look at this. I served on the Entitlement Commission with the Director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Mr. Greenstein. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities told us that by the year 2020, the second decade of the next century, Social Security reserves will be in the trillions of dollars. 
They say:  
If Social Security surpluses were to be used in the next two decades to increase national saving rather than to offset the deficit and the rest of the budget, that will likely result in stronger economic growth. 
So what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says is if you take these moneys to mask the deficit, it doesn't help. But if you take the Social Security reserves and make them truly reserves, it will result in greater savings and will cause more economic growth in our great country. 
Here is what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says about the underlying amendment. Among other things, they say: 
Unfortunately, the balanced budget amendment-- 
The underlying amendment-- would undercut the approach to bolstering Social Security. The implications of this requirement on Social Security are very significant. First, the budget would be considered balanced when the deficit outside Social Security exactly offset the surplus inside Social Security. But when that occurred, the objective of accumulating Social Security surplus, partly to build the Nation's capital stock and productive capacity so we can better afford to pay for the baby boomers' retirement, would be stymied. Second, the benefits of the baby boomers would likely have to be financed in full by the taxes of those working in the years the baby boomers retire. 
Very simple. So everyone understands what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says, 
for example, if in the private sector you pay into a fund all your life so that when you reach age 65 you can retire, and you go to your employer and say, `Well, I'm 65. I want to draw my retirement,' they say, `Fine. You can go ahead and draw your retirement, but every penny you draw out for retirement you have to put that much money in.' And the person says, `Would you repeat that?' And so the boss would repeat it. The boss would say, `Sure. You paid money into the fund all of your lifetime while you worked here, but we've used the money for something else. So if you want to draw money out, you have to put it back in the second time.' That is in effect what is--not in effect --that is literally what is happening in here. 
If the underlying balanced budget amendment passes, Social Security recipients will have to pay twice if they want their benefits. This version of the balanced budget amendment would thus undercut the central achievements of the 1980 Social Security reforms. 
That is pretty direct. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities further says: 
Under the amendment, reductions in Social Security could be used to help Congress and the President balance the budget if they are faced with a budget crunch. The balanced budget amendment is likely to lead to periodic midyear crisis when budgets, thought to be balanced at the start of a fiscal year, fall out of balance at the fiscal year, such as factors of slowing economic growth. When sizable deficits emerge with only part of the year remaining, they will often be very difficult to address. 
Among other things, they can, under this amendment, raise the debt if they get a three-fifths vote; raise taxes, another supervote. In such circumstances, the Policy Priority Institute says: 
The President or the courts may feel compelled to act to uphold the constitutional requirements for a budget balance. 
In documents circulated in November 1996, explaining how the amendment worked, the House coauthors of the amendment--listen to this--wrote: 
In such circumstances the President would be bound at the point at which the Government runs out of money to stop issuing checks. This would appear to include Social Security checks. 
Mr. President, this is not something I made up. These are direct words from the sponsors of the amendment in the House of Representatives. They put in writing--I quote-- 
. . . the President would be bound at the point at which the Government runs out of money to stop issuing checks. 
So, ladies and gentlemen, the underlying amendment clearly will destroy Social Security. 
The major difference between the two versions of the balanced budget amendment--mine and the underlying amendment--is that the version which excludes Social Security allows the Nation to draw on its Social Security savings during the period when the baby-boom generation is in its peak retirement years and requires the Nation to save more in advance to help cover the cost of the baby-boom generation. Pretty clear. 
We have here a great institution, part of the Library of 
Congress, called the Congressional Research Service. When a Member of Congress has a question about an issue, you can call. You may want to know about how much lumber our forests are producing. You may want to know how many miles of roads there are in Nevada, Iowa, or Colorado. Any kind of information they can get information for us. 
One of the things they were asked to comment on is, What about this underlying amendment? What about the amendment that is now before this body? What will it do? They said, among other things: 
The amendment would preclude, at a future time when Social Security outlays in a particular year begin to exceed Social Security receipts in that particular year, the use of the Social Security funds to pay out benefits. 
So what they said is the same thing Greenstein said, that when you have surpluses built up they would go to offset the deficit. They go on to say: 
Therefore, under the balanced budget amendment's language, there is mandated a balance in each year for the outlays that year and the receipts that year. Payments out of the balance of the Social Security trust funds would not be counted as Government receipts under the balanced budget amendment when in the year 2019, or whenever the time occurs, the receipts in those particular years and the Social Security trust funds are not adequate to cover the outlays in those years. That is, payments out of the trust fund surpluses could not be counted in the calculation of the balance between total Federal outlays and receipts. Because the balanced budget amendment requires that required balance be between outlays for that year and receipts for that year, the moneys that constitute the Social Security surpluses would not be available as a balance for the payment of benefits. 
That again is very clear. It is again from another source saying that the underlying amendment will destroy Social Security. 
Some people tried to get the Congressional Reference Service to change their mind, to write another report. And they wrote another report that said the same thing. Shorter, but says the same thing. 
Thus, the pending balanced budget amendment requires outlays for any fiscal year not to exceed total receipts for that year. 
What they are saying is you would not have to use Social Security surpluses. What you can do is borrow more money or cut more services or raise more taxes. Of course, remember, when you have surpluses running as highs they are, the one place you are going to go is where the surpluses are. 
To support what CRS has said we again come back at a later time with the subsequent report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities where they say:  
Under the balanced budget amendment, the Social Security surplus could not be tapped and interest earnings on the surplus could not be used unless it was offsetting surplus in the rest of the budget. 
Again, it is very clear what CRS said, what the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said. 
Mr. President, there are numerous organizations that oppose 
the balanced budget amendment for various reasons. There are also organizations that do not support the passage of the balanced budget amendment because of what it does to Social Security. 
One such organization is the esteemed National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare with about 6 million members. Mr. President, they, just a few days ago, wrote a letter to me where they said, among other things: 
Your amendment would preserve the integrity of the Social Security trust fund under a balanced budget constitutional amendment. 
They did not equivocate. They did not say, `Offer this amendment at the right time.' They say, the amendment that is now before this body will preserve the integrity of the Social Security trust fund under a balanced budget constitutional amendment. They go on to say: 
The issue is clear-cut. As drafted, S.J. Res. 1 overturns the 1990 law taking Social Security off budget and allows Social Security to be raided to reduce the deficit. Statutory measures to protect Social Security from such a result are not adequate because of the supremacy of the Constitution and because future Congresses are free to change such statutory measures while the provision to place Social Security on budget will remain in the United States Constitution. Borrowing from the reserve to finance current consumption will place a heavy burden on future generations because the debt to the trust fund must be paid with interest. 
Mr. President, there certainly has to be consideration given to what will happen if the underlying balanced budget amendment passes. It will not only throw the Social Security trust fund out of kilter, it will be a cheap and very deceitful way to attempt to balance the budget. As a result of that, we have a letter written January 28 from President Bill Clinton to Leader Daschle where he says in the paragraph in the middle of page 1: 
I am very concerned that Senate Joint Resolution 1, the Constitutional amendment to balance the budget, could pose grave risks to the Social Security system. In the event of passage, in which the budget requirements can neither be waived nor met, disbursement of Social Security checks could cease or unelected judges could reduce benefits to comply with this constitutional mandate. No subsequent implementing legislation could protect Social Security with certainty because a constitutional amendment overrides statutory law. 
Mr. President, we have offered this amendment. The Senator from Nevada has offered it, along with Senators Dorgan, Daschle, Kennedy, Feinstein, Wyden, Conrad, Ford and Hollings. 
Mr. President, I say stop and look at what is happening. If you take a look at what is the state of the economy today, last year was the 4th year in a row we had a declining deficit, the first time since before the Civil War we have had 4 years in a row with a declining deficit. Lowest unemployment, lowest inflation for 40 years, highest economic growth in 40 years, 300,000 fewer Federal employees today than 4 years ago, excluding the cuts in the military. Our Federal Government today is about the same size as when President Kennedy was President. Home building during the last 2 years, the largest number of homes built in any comparable 2-year period. 
The economy is doing well. I do not think this underlying amendment which would throw Social Security in reverse will do anything to help the economy. In fact, it will hurt the economy and certainly hurt the Helen Collinses of the world, people who have their dignity as a result of the Social Security system. 
Mr. President, I talked about why Social Security was passed. I talked about banks shutting their doors. I talked about factories slowing down and stopping. I talked about homes being foreclosed upon, farms being foreclosed upon, people being evacuated from their businesses because they did not pay their bills, families living together, `The Grapes of Wrath'--we do not need `The Grapes of Wrath' revisited. We are a rich nation. We have an obligation to provide for people in their senior years, especially when they provided for themselves, and that is all Social Security does. Social Security is not a gift. It is not welfare. It is a program, Mr. President, that gives people dignity like my grandmother and like Helen Collins. 
We need to understand that this underlying amendment is not fair. If everyone acknowledges that they want to take care of Social Security and protect Social Security, then why not accept my amendment? I hope people of good will on both sides of the aisle will think about this amendment, will understand where we have come in the 3 years since I first offered it. 
I was a lone voice crying in the wilderness 3 years ago. Now, Mr. President, we have support. The American public supports what we are attempting to do. They are supporting it because they know the importance of Social Security, and they know that if we do not expressly exclude Social Security from a balanced budget amendment, it will be destroyed. That is why I will only support a balanced budget amendment that expressly exempts Social Security.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have just a few more comments which I would like to make in response to my friend, my western friend from the State of Utah, for whom I have the greatest respect. But I would say to him and those listening that we are all beginning to see where some of the special interest scavengers are and who the rats are that will be looking for the cheese. And I think if you look at the Wall Street Journal today you will look at a full-page ad. You would find that those are the people who are the rats and those are the people looking for cheese. The Helen Collins of the world who are trying to survive on Social Security can't run a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal. The cheese is the surplus from Social Security. That is what the rats are eating. They have been doing it all along. 
For my friend from Utah to say that President Clinton has said he has been using it in his calculations, that doesn't make it right. That is my whole point. Let's do it the right way. Why would we enshrine in the Constitution something we have been doing wrong for 15 years now? The surpluses of Social Security should not go toward balancing the budget. Everybody says it will be hard to do. You have that right. It will be hard to do. But when we do it it will be honest. It will be done the right way. When we say we have a balanced budget we will really have done it. We don't have one now. 
My friend, prior to coming to this body, was a trial lawyer, and a good lawyer. I say to him and to anyone within the sound of my voice that you can't have Social Security. It is statutorily defined. You can't include a national park in that, and other programs. 
It is statutorily defined. 
Now, people may say that you look in the Wall Street Journal; Merrill Lynch and others, which I have not seen--I am sure it is a full-page ad--they run this full-page ad. I repeat, the Helen Collinses of the world and almost 75 percent of the American public do not support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget unless Social Security is excluded. They cannot run a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal. But those that are running full-page ads know where the cheese is, and the cheese is the surpluses for Social Security that they will use to balance the budget. 
And people say, why? The same answer I guess is the answer that Willie Sutton gave when they asked him, after he was put in prison, `Willie, why did you rob all those banks?' He said, `That's where the money was.' Well, the reason they are going after the Social Security surpluses is that is the only place we have surplus money now. 
I repeat, why enshrine in the Constitution something that we have been doing that is wrong? 
Now, my friend from Utah has said, well, the CRS really did not mean what they said, and if they said what they mean they really did not say it that way. I read from the Center on Budget Policy Priorities just a few paragraphs. In fact, I know the time is late. I will read one paragraph. They say there are three memos, two from CRS and one from them. 
All three memos explain that under the Hatch and Schaefer-Stenholm versions-- 
This underlying amendment-- outlays in any year--including outlays for benefits paid from the Social Security trust fund--may not exceed receipts in that year. All three memos note that any funds drawn down from the accumulated Social Security surpluses to help pay for the Social Security benefits of retired baby boomers would not count as receipts in those years. 
Very clear. That is what they have said. 
Now, they have said there is no exception as to war. Of course, there is exception in the Constitution as to war. So this amendment is not as pure as some would like us to believe. 
I also say for emphasis that my friend said it would be difficult to balance the budget. Democrats and Republicans say it would be difficult to balance the budget unless you use Social Security trust fund moneys, but it is not a fair balance. 
Mr. President, I will close tonight--I know everyone is anxious to go. We will take this debate up tomorrow. We have a series of speakers lined up, as does my friend from Utah. 
Congressman David McIntosh, a sophomore Republican Congressman from Indiana, says, and I quote: 
Republicans cannot allow ourselves to be defined as cutting Social Security even as we move forward with the balanced budget amendment. 
Now, this man, Mr. McIntosh, is no left-wing socialist. He is noted as being one of the most conservative Members in the entire House of Representatives. He was part of the Republican revolution, but he, sophomore Republican, has said, I want to be able to vote on the Reid amendment; I want to be able to vote to 
exclude Social Security. Why? Because it is the right thing to do. It is the honest way to balance the budget.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would first of all say I don't know who this man is from the Washington Times, but having read that before coming here I know why he writes for that newspaper. I think he would have trouble getting a job anyplace else with the logic he uses in that. 
As far as I am concerned, he is perpetuating the myth that Social Security proceeds will and should be used to balance the budget. I think that is wrong. Remember, the commission that just reported to us in the last few months said that some of those trust fund moneys should be invested in private securities. We cannot do that if all the money goes to balancing the budget, as will happen with the underlying amendment. 
My friend from Utah said all through this debate that Social Security is the only way, using the excesses, the surplus from Social Security, that you can balance the budget. That does not make it right. That is wrong. If you told a future Social Security recipient the money you are paying in and your employer is paying in is going to be used to balance the budget, it is going to pay for foreign aid and other type things, I don't think they would be too happy. 
Senator Domenici said it about as well as we could in 1990 when he said, 
I voted for the Hollings proposal because I support the concept of taking Social Security out of the budget deficit calculations. We need a firewall around those funds to make sure the reserves are there to pay Social Security benefits in the next century. 
The Reid amendment is the firewall that the chairman of the Budget Committee called for 6 years ago. We should pass it. It can be done with my amendment. 
I further say that the President of the United States, in his radio address this past Saturday said: 
It would prevent us from responding to foreign challenges abroad or economic trouble at home, if to do so resulted in even a minor budget deficit. And because it would write a specific economic policy into our Constitution, it could force the Secretary of the Treasury to cut Social Security, or drive the budget into courts of law when a deficit occurred when Congress was not working on the budget. In a court of law, judges could be forced to halt Social Security checks or to raise taxes just to meet the demands of the constitutional amendment. 
It is wrong to balance the budget using Social Security surpluses. That is what Congressman David McIntosh, Republican from the State of Indiana, said when he stated, `Republicans cannot allow ourselves to be defined as cutting Social Security.' They will. Anyone voting for the underlying amendment and not for the Reid amendment will be deemed as cutting Social Security because that, in fact, is what would occur.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Nevada Taxpayers Association. On February 25, 1997, the association will celebrate 75 years of service to the citizens of Nevada. It is my honor to salute the organization for its diligent efforts to inform and serve the public on tax policy issues. 
The Nevada Taxpayers Association is the only tax policy and analysis organization of its kind in Nevada. The mission of this preeminent organization is to protect and preserve sensible fiscal policy that is beneficial to Nevada's citizens, and to enhance fiscal policies that impact our State, county, and city governments. 
Since 1922, the Nevada Taxpayers Association has represented the interests of the citizens of Nevada, as well as business and industry, to create a fair and equitable revenue system. For the past 75 years, Nevada's past and current Governors have worked cooperatively with the Nevada Taxpayers Association to ensure the best tax structure possible for the State. 
This year, the State of Nevada will celebrate Nevada Taxpayers Association Day on February 25. I applaud the Nevada Taxpayers Association for the integral role it has played, and continues to play, in fiscal policy analysis and research in Nevada. On behalf of all taxpayers in Nevada who have benefited from the association's many publications, reports, and analyses, I wholeheartedly thank them for their invaluable service. It is my pleasure to speak on behalf of the Nevada Taxpayers Association, and I commend the organization for its unwavering support of the rights of taxpayers.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, hopefully the week we get back, we will be able to start a serious debate on the most important issue relating to the balanced budget amendment, namely whether or not Social Security trust fund moneys should be counted in the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. 
There will be an amendment offered, of course, that the Social Security trust fund moneys should be excluded from that. It seems each day that goes by we get added support for our amendment. We have received support over the months from various individuals, and just yesterday we received an opinion from the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress that was very important. 
There has been some talk in the Chamber today that they have changed their opinion. Nothing could be further from the truth. And that certainly can come from reading the transmission from the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service today. My friend, the Senator from North Dakota, will discuss this when I complete my remarks. 
But, Mr. President, all you need to do is read this new document that they put out where it says: 
Only if no other receipts in any particular year could be found would the possibility of a limitation on drawing down the Trust Funds arise. Even in this eventuality, however, Congress would retain the authority, under the [balanced budget amendment] to raise revenues-- 
Of course, if you can get a supermajority. or to reduce expenditures-- 
That's very true, you could continue to cut. to obtain the necessary moneys to make good on the liquidation of securities from the Social Security Trust Funds. 
Mr. President, this is certainly the same opinion that they rendered yesterday. The Social Security Trust Fund is the largest money out there, this year, $80 billion. This is being applied toward the deficit to make it look smaller. And that is all they are saying, that is, in effect, when it comes time to balance the budget, they will look to Social Security. The way the balanced budget amendment is written, if there are not surpluses over and above the Social Security Trust Fund moneys, people simply would not be able to draw their checks. 
I will yield the floor----

Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota, also, we will discuss this at great length right after the break. But it is interesting that we are talking about trust fund moneys like it is some fungible commodity that can be used for any purpose. The fact of the matter is, Social Security Trust Fund moneys are put, supposedly, into a trust fund to be used for people's retirement, not to make the deficit look smaller.

Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President. It is interesting to see what has transpired in this past year. It seems there is a new tact now to get the constitutional balanced budget amendment passed, and that is to trash Social Security--`it is going broke; its program is bad; the baby boomers aren't going to get any money'--to do what we can to make Social Security look bad. 
Mr. President, Social Security is the most successful social program in the history of the world. It is a good program, and people who want to say Social Security is in deep trouble, it is going out of business soon, simply are wrong. Even the 13-member bipartisan commission which reported back on Social Security acknowledged that until the year 2029, Social Security is going to pay out all the benefits as it now pays out. In fact, in the year 2029, if we did nothing else, benefits would still be paid out at about 80 percent. We have to do some adjustment to Social Security in the outyears. There are many ways we can do that. 
Social Security is not in trouble of going broke unless this balanced budget amendment passes, and then there is going to be some real trouble. The trouble is that the surpluses have been and will continue to be used to balance the budget. The fact that there has been a procedure used in years gone by that is wrong does not mean we should enshrine that in the Constitution. 
So I suggest that the argument that Social Security is going broke is about as valid as the argument that is used on a continual basis that States balance their budget. The State of Nevada balances its budget, but capital improvements are off budget. 
So, Mr. President, I believe we should have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I am willing to go for that. I voted for all the motions to table. But I believe we should exclude Social Security trust fund moneys from the numbers that allow the false way of obtaining a balanced budget. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have just come from my office where I had a number of meetings. I met with a group of lawyers this morning. They were talking about issues that are going to come before the Congress that are important to them. But in the course of the conversation, I talked to them about the days when I was an attorney and practiced law. 
One of the things that has been brought to my mind as a result of my meeting with those lawyers today is how important it is to protect your client's assets. If you had a case for a client, any money that came in that was that client's property, you had to put that money in a trust account. None of that money in that trust account could be used to make a house payment or make a car payment of yours. Those moneys could only be used for the benefit of your client. 
If a lawyer violated the trust that he or she had with his client, you could lose your license to practice law. You could, in fact, be prosecuted criminally and go to jail. 
It seems around here that we handle people's trust accounts, the taxpayers' trust accounts in a very cavalier fashion. Today I want to talk about one of those trust funds. I want to talk about the highway trust fund. It is coincidental that I am here introducing legislation after having met in my office just a short time ago with Nevada's head of the department of transportation, a man by the name of Tom Stephens. He was back here with other Nevadans to tell me the problems that the State of Nevada has. I am a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and we will have to address the problems of this entire country when we reauthorize the highway transportation bill this year. The people from Nevada were telling me about the problems we have in Nevada. They are significant. We are the most rapidly growing State in the Union. We have traffic jams where we never had them before, especially in the southern part of the State. He proceeded to tell me about five projects that will cost about $1 billion--extension of Highway 95, I-15 to the California border, in the Reno-Carson City area we have to get the freeway completed between Carson City and Reno, and a number of other very difficult projects that cost a lot of money. He was looking to me for guidance and direction as to how some of these very difficult projects could be directed--how moneys in the bill could be directed toward the State of Nevada. 
There is no question, Mr. President, that this is going to be a busy legislative year. As I have indicated, one of the things we will work on is the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, what we call ISTEA, reauthorization of the highway bill. This legislation plays an integral role in the financing of our Nation's transportation infrastructure. It is a bill that will receive bipartisan support, I hope, for a number of reasons. Most recognize the need to invest in our transportation infrastructure. It is that way all over the country. 
The Presiding Officer of this body today is from a very sparsely populated State, but it is a big State and covers a lot of area. I have driven much of the State of Wyoming. The State of Wyoming has, like Nevada but in a more exaggerated sense, a very small population base. However, the people of Wyoming travel these long distances and they want to travel these distances on good roads. Not only do the people that live in Wyoming need those good roads, but the State of Wyoming is surrounded by States that people are trying to get to. Wyoming is a bridge State. Thousands and thousands of people come to Wyoming every year to go to Yellowstone National Park. Should the people of Wyoming alone be responsible for those roads? Well, the answer is no, we have a Federal policy that helps the State of Wyoming in the road construction. You have demand in the State of Wyoming that cannot be met by the State of Wyoming. Your transportation director, I am sure, will come and visit the Presiding Officer, just like my State of Nevada head of transportation came and visited me, to talk about particular specific problems that you have in the State of Wyoming which are compounded by the bad weather that you have there. 
I am sure a lot of people do not know that this money we collect in the highway trust fund is not used for highway construction. What is it used for? It is used to mask the Federal deficit to the tune of about $20 billion. All of us agree that we need to invest in our highway transportation system. We all agree that there is a need to provide a safe, efficient, and modern transportation infrastructure, and most agree that too little is being spent on this important investment. The biggest reason, though, we are spending too little on this investment is we are not spending the money we have in trust to spend. Just like the example I gave earlier where I, as an attorney, would take my client's money, just as we as a Federal Government take our client's money, the taxpayer, every time a gallon of gas is purchased, we take approximately 19 cents. Most of that money is required by law to be spent on the infrastructure of this country and it is not. That is what is wrong. Finances that should go to the highway construction is being use for other purposes. The money collected is not being used, I repeat, for its intended purpose. It is a perversion of the whole notion of how a trust fund should operate. 
There have been earlier attempts to end this misspending by taking the transportation trust fund moneys off budget. In the House it has been successful. I am going to initiate an effort here in the Senate too to do likewise. They have not only gotten it out of committee in the House, they passed it on the floor. I support these efforts that they have initiated in the House because I believe we need to protect the integrity of these trust funds. I believe we should attempt to get these funds off budget and we should do it now. 
That is why I am introducing this bill, the Highway Trust Fund Protection Act of 1997. It is very straightforward. It is a short bill. By taking the highway trust fund off budget we 
will be fulfilling our commitment to the taxpayer. We will be spending the revenues on the specific activities identified as the purpose of these trust funds. Mr. President, the trust fund is financed by sales taxes on tires, trucks, buses, trailers, as well as truck usage taxes. But about 90 percent of the trust fund revenue comes from excise taxes on motor fuels. As I have indicated earlier, the majority of the motor fuel revenue dedicated to the trust fund is derived from 18.4 cents per gallon tax on gasoline. Of this, 14 cents is dedicated directly to the highway trust fund. Of the remaining 4.5 cents, 4.3 cents go to deficit reduction and one-tenth of 1 percent goes to the leaky underground storage fund. 
Mr. President, there are many arguments for taking these trust funds off budget. I will talk about a few. First of all, it represents a contract with the people of this country. We pass legislation that tells someone when they buy a gallon of gasoline, part of that money is going to go into a trust fund to improve the roads--the roads in Wyoming, the roads in Nevada, and all over this country. If the highway trust funds are not going to be used for their stated purpose, we should eliminate the tax, or part of it. 
According to the Federal Highway Administration there are significant infrastructure needs not being met. We do not need to go to the Highway Administration. We know by our own individual experiences in our individual States that it is important we spend more money on this construction. The trust fund inclusion in the unified budget subjects our outlays to the budget process. As a result, they are liable to legislative spending limitations. These limits are not based on analysis of national transportation spending need. Not once in the 5 years since ISTEA was enacted have Federal highway programs been funded at their authorized levels; this, despite the fact that the Department of Transportation has identified billions of dollars in need. 
Remember, Mr. President, we have approximately $20 billion in excess funds not being spent and going into our infrastructure needs. The balances we run in the transit highway accounts makes no sense. This money should and could be invested in our Nation's highway system. It is estimated that to maintain--not improve, just maintain--our current highway system would cost over $200 billion. Taking the highway trust funds off budget will have limited effect on the deficit. The highway trust fund is user fee supported. The highway trust fund is deficit proof and has never contributed a single penny to the budget deficit. The highway trust fund supports long-term capital investments that produce economic benefits, which in turn generate increased revenue for the Federal Government. 
This bill is about protecting the integrity of the highway trust fund. All taxpayers have an interest in this. We are told when we pay taxes at the pump that this money goes toward maintaining and improving our roads. I wish that were so. It is a myth. It is a myth of the highway trust fund. My legislation provides truth and budgeting and would simply do away with this myth. 
It is unfair that we take a trust fund and use it for purposes other than for which the trust fund moneys were dedicated. I ask all of my colleagues to follow the example of the other body, the House of Representatives, and join me in supporting this legislation, which would take these moneys off budget and would allow us to spend the money that is so badly needed for highway construction in the United States.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Senate institution, Proctor Jones. His hard work and exceptional service have left a lasting mark on the Senate, and he will be sorely missed. 
I have known and worked with Proctor Jones since I began my service in the Senate. After having served with one of the giants of the Senate--Senator Richard Russell--Proctor Jones has gone on to become a giant in his own right. His vast knowledge of appropriations has made him an invaluable asset to the committee. Since he began in 1960, his only time away from the Senate came in 1966, when he left Senator Russell's staff to serve in the Marine Corps. Apart from this brief hiatus, Proctor has been a part of the day-to-day operations of the Senate, and it will not be the same without him. 
A native of Twin City, GA, Proctor came to work as Senator Russell's right-hand-man immediately after graduation from the University of Georgia. As he rose through the ranks on the Hill, Proctor found time to further his education at the George Washington University. In essence, he never stopped being a student, particularly of the Senate and its appropriations process. 
In 1971, when he joined the Committee on Appropriations, Proctor quickly became a part of the staff leadership. Under every Democratic chairman since 1973, he has been the staff director for the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development and, under Chairmen McClellan and Stennis, Proctor was deputy staff director of the full committee. Serving under some of the most distinguished chairmen of this venerable committee--Senators Russell, Ellender, McClellan, Magnuson, Stennis, Byrd, and Hatfield--Proctor distinguished himself as a genius of compromise and an expert on the budget. 
While the Senate has changed and evolved during Proctor's long tenure, he never lost his fervor for his job. Tireless is an adjective often used to describe public servants, but Proctor epitomizes this description. His seemingly endless supply of energy and love for the Senate made him a constant presence even at the latest of the late-night sessions. This veteran of the Senate has been intimately involved with the annual appropriations bills, as well as handling innumerable continuing resolutions, supplemental appropriations, and rescissions bills, and other measures relating to the appropriations process. Those of us who devote time to the task of appropriation know how grueling it can be. Through it all, Proctor Jones devoted himself completely, using his vast expertise in the service of his country. 
In addition to his Senate work, Proctor is an active member of his church and community. He is also the proud father of two daughters, Heather and Lisa. It is my pleasure to speak today in tribute to Proctor Jones, and I wish him every happiness in his retirement.

 Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and chief of staff, Reynaldo Martinez. Rey has recently been chosen for the Community Hero Award by the National Conference of Christians and Jews, and I am proud of him for receiving this well-deserved honor. 
I have known Rey since I was a boy. He and I have worked side by side since he ran my first campaign and got me as elected student body president of Basic High School in 1956. Since then, he has been my adviser, campaign manager, and chief of staff. In addition to helping take me from assemblyman, to lieutenant governor, to the U.S. Senate, he has had many other titles during his life, including teacher, lobbyist, coach, education advocate, and husband. To me, Rey is both a valued friend and a trusted adviser. To his country and the State of Nevada, he is a dedicated public servant and a tireless fighter. 
In his boyhood days, Rey was a great baseball player who led his high school team to numerous victories. This left-handed pitcher played a leading role in Basic High's multiple State championships, as well as its championship of the California Interscholastic Federation. In short, our tiny school in Nevada was so good, we beat all of the usually dominant California schools. 
Rey's baseball talents led him to Arizona State University, where, in addition to his efforts on the field, he earned a degree in teaching. After graduation, Rey returned to Nevada to teach government and coach the Western High School baseball team to victory in two State championships. While he was teaching, Rey worked on a local Nevada campaign with Monroe Sweetland, an executive with the National Education Association [NEA]. Mr. Sweetland recognized talent when he saw it, and lured Rey away from the Clark County School District to work for the NEA in Washington, DC, and across the Nation. After 13 years with the NEA, Rey directed his innumerable talents to my government career. 
For more than 30 years, Rey has been a key player in the public arena, both in Nevada and across the Nation. He is an invaluable asset to all of the organizations and campaigns to which he has lent his energy and skill. He has a quick mind and a political acumen which he uses to great effect for the causes he believes in. He has been recognized for his efforts by groups across the Nation, including twice being named Outstanding Hispanic of the Year--in 1990 by the Latin Chamber of Commerce, and in 1988 by the New Mexico Club in Las Vegas. In 1980, the National Education Association recognized Rey as one of its outstanding political and legislative consultants. He has also been honored as an outstanding teacher in Clark County and an outstanding baseball coach in Nevada. The Community Hero award is just the most recent in his distinguished list of accolades. 
The goal of the National Conference of Christians and Jews is to end bias, bigotry, and racism. Through advocacy and education, the National Conference seeks to promote understanding in all races and religions. For someone who has done so much toward these worthy goals, and who has served his community so well, Rey is truly deserving of the title `Community Hero.' 
It is my pleasure to speak today in tribute to my friend Reynaldo Martinez, and congratulate him on being selected for this honor.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the issue of whether to divide the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is one in which I have been very involved with since the initial proposal. I made clear my opposition to the proposed split last year, and I am still convinced that such an unnecessary and costly venture is unwarranted. However, I have agreed to the establishment of a commission to study the judicial circuits, the structure and alignment of the Federal court of appeals system, and to report to the President and the Congress its recommendations for such changes in the circuit boundaries or structure as may be appropriate for the expeditious and effective disposition of the caseload of the Federal courts of appeal. 
Today, Senator Feinstein and I are introducing a bill to create this commission. The commission makeup is fair, evenhanded, and bipartisan. It will consist of two members appointed by the President, two members appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States, two members appointed by the majority leader of the Senate, two members appointed by the minority leader of the Senate, two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and two members appointed by the minority leader of the House of Representatives. I think this is the most fair and equitable way to study this issue. 
In today's environment of fiscal belt tightening, it is crucial that we carefully scrutinize proposals such as splitting a judicial circuit. It is necessary that we curtail the development of costly Federal proposals and engage in studied cost-benefit analysis before we create new programs. There are many unanswered questions in splitting the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. What are the costs associated with such a division? Will this require the construction of new courthouses and hiring of additional judges? If so, how many and how much? And what are the benefits of a division? The commission we propose will answer all of these questions before we even consider any possible division. Further, the commission will examine the structure and function of all the Federal courts of appeal. 
This is a reasonable proposal for the establishment of a vital commission. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, the reason I came to the floor today was not to talk about the balanced budget amendment, which I have been happy to do, but I came here because I am going to introduce legislation today that will exclude prison inmates from the protections of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. 
Why would I want to do something like that? Well, when this bill came to the Senate floor approximately 2 years ago, I offered an amendment at that time that said I want people's religious freedoms restored but I think we have to be careful about prisoners and they should not be part of this because they are going to take advantage of it. Well, they are taking advantage of it. One prisoner in New York has filed 3,000 lawsuits. 
What are these lawsuits about? 
In Nebraska there was a lawsuit filed because an inmate thinks he is a woman trapped in a man's body and strip searches by male prison officials are not allowed by his religion. Should we take up the courts' time with this type of litigation? 
We have another case where a satanic group--they are in prison, of course--filed suit because they were not given unbaptized baby fat for their candles. 
About 40 percent of the courts' time, the Federal court's time in Nevada is taken up with this kind of stuff. 
In Nevada we have an inmate suing a chaplain for refusing to conduct a marriage ceremony for this man and his male friend. The plaintiff and his friend are both members of the Universal Life Church which he claims allows two people of the same sex to marry. 
In Nevada inmates allege their inability to practice a religion is being denied in violation of the first amendment because they want special services, including incense and special jewelry. 
Mr. President, this is serious business that the prisoners have made a mockery of. My amendment should have passed when I offered it. We should make sure that this nonsense is stopped. There are protections in my legislation. If someone is being denied their religious practices, certainly there are protections there. But protections of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act would be denied these prisoners, and I believe rightfully so. 
As I indicated, I addressed this problem several years go. The problem is inmates abuse the special protections provided under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. During consideration of this bill in 1993 or 1994, I offered an amendment to exempt prisoners from the coverage of this act as I have indicated. I did so then because I feared these special protections would be abused by inmates. They have been abused by inmates. Whatever I said on the Senate floor was not enough, because they have even outdone my expectations. 
I say, regrettably, I wish I would have been wrong. I wish that I had been wrong and that these inmates would not have abused the legislation that did pass. But it is apparent now that inmates are in fact abusing the special rights under this act. 
I have worked with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my friend from the State of Utah, to address the larger problem of frivolous prisoner lawsuits, and we were able to accomplish something last year, maybe not enough. We may even need to revisit that to find out if we were able to plug all the holes with the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act. 
I believe we need to do more to curb the ongoing abuses occurring under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act despite the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act. 
Today I am introducing this bill which will prohibit the application of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to inmates in a Federal, State, or local penal facility. I intend to meet with the Attorney General of the United States so that she appreciates the growing litigation that they face in the area. Criminals should not enjoy the same rights and privileges as law-abiding citizens. The sad commentary in our present system, Mr. President, is they enjoy more rights than many people who are outside prisons. 
We need not go through the litany of cable television, gyms better than people can buy membership in on the outside, libraries that are unsurpassed, exercise areas, food, three square meals a day, nice clean clothes. They have a pretty good deal. One of the deals I do not think they should have is the ability to file these lawsuits with an unending array of ideas at the expense of the taxpayers. 
The Religious Freedom Restoration Act sought to provide the legal protections supporting the right to freely exercise one's religious beliefs. Providing inmates with these same rights, I said, was a disaster and was a recipe for disaster; and it has been proven to be an understatement. 
Our courts now have to spend their time wading through lawsuits filed by inmates that are ridiculous, for lack of a better description. I have described some of these lawsuits this morning. I have described them in the past. I ask my colleagues to join with me to take this pressure off our court system and off the taxpayers of this country. This is wrong, what they are doing, and we have the obligation to stop it.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to all those within the sound of my voice that the two men whom you have just heard are people with an institutional memory, as Senator Ford has spoken. That is true. But also, these two Senators are gentlemen who have balanced budgets in their own States. They are Governors from two of the outstanding States in the Union, South Carolina and Kentucky. They know what they are talking about in truth in budgeting. 
I am very happy to have been able to sit on the floor and listen to these two statements made by these two gentlemen who understand what we are talking about when we talk about balanced budgets. Of course, the three of us--the Senator from Kentucky, the Senator from South Carolina, the Senator from Nevada--support a balanced budget. We support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, but we want to make sure it is a truth-in-budgeting balanced budget amendment, one that protects senior citizens and, most importantly, protects the real contract with America. That is the one that was developed some 50 years ago during the Great Depression when Social Security was first enacted. 
We have an obligation to make sure that the moneys paid into that trust fund by the employers and employees is not used as a gimmick to balance the budget. Of course, it is easy to balance the budget if you use the hundreds of billions of dollars in the Social Security trust fund. But let's do it the hard way. Let's do it the right way. And that is why, Mr. President, I was so elated, felt so good about the fact that in the other body, there are Members of the House of Representatives in both parties who are talking about maybe those few straggling voices in the Senate who last year were 
able to talk about the importance of the Social Security trust fund had something. Maybe we should look at what has gone on in the House when they pell-mell voted for a constitutional amendment and, in the process, said that we are going to destroy Social Security. 
I think it is good that the other body is talking about having a vote on a constitutional amendment that will protect Social Security. That is all that we are asking. That seems fair. It seems, if we are going to balance the budget, we should do it the right way. 
Finally, let me say this. Our position has been strengthened during the past year. It has been strengthened because the bipartisan commission to study Social Security has reported back, and they have said a number of things, but for purposes of this statement, I think the most important they have said is that all 13 members believe that all or part of the Social Security trust fund moneys should be invested in the private sector in some way. I say, Mr. President, how can those moneys be invested if there are not any? It is impossible. 
So, if the 13 members believe some of the Social Security trust fund moneys should be invested in the private sector, then our constitutional amendment, which we are going to introduce today, which says we want a balanced budget but we want to do it excluding Social Security, then I think we have the support of those 13 members of the bipartisan commission.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to coming to this body I was an attorney, practiced law, I have great respect for the law. I tried dozens and dozens of cases before juries. I did not always agree with the result of the verdicts that the jury came to, but I always respected what they did, their obligation to do what they felt was right. The U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts--I do not always agree with their decisions, but I respect the United States being a body that follows the law. We respect the 
law. We follow the law. 
Mr. President, on the 24th anniversary of the Roe versus Wade decision, I feel it is appropriate that I come and offer a few words today about what is taking place in our country. My record --as you know, is that I am personally opposed to abortion. But, Mr. President, I am also opposed to what is going on in this country today where certain people feel that they are above the law, that the law is something that they can interpret on their own. 
There is no justification for what is taking place in America today where violence is almost a way of life in some areas. Today on the news it had appeared that a bomb went off near an abortion clinic here in Washington, DC. It is not clear whether the bomb was meant to destroy the clinic, but all over the country there are abortion clinics that are being bombed. I think that is abhorrent and wrong. 
Mr. President, if someone respects life, you cannot choose which life you respect. You cannot only respect the lives of those who agree with you politically or those who agree with certain decisions surrendered by the Supreme Court. 
I am adamantly opposed to the use of violence to show one's displeasure with the law. I was the first Member of this body to come to the floor and denounce the killing of Dr. David Gunn in Florida. I am compelled to come to the floor again today, given the most recent bombings of abortion clinics. 
It is incumbent upon the leaders of this country to condemn these shameful acts. It is incumbent upon the religious leaders that they condemn these shameful tactics. Yet we need more than people saying, well, I disagree with violence. We need people speaking out against this violence. We need people denouncing these acts. Through their silence, I believe there is an acquiescence to this violence. 
The people who perpetrate these bombings are wrong. They are a fringe element. They are extremists who advocate violence as an alternative to meaningful debate and discussion. They believe, I assume, Mr. President, that they are above the law. 
Let us continue to have passionate and vigorous debate on this subject and all other subjects, but do not take the law into our own hands. I repeat, those who respect life cannot choose which lives they respect. You cannot only respect the lives of those who agree with us. 
Religion teaches us tolerance. This does not mean tolerance for only those people who agree with us. It means tolerance for all. If your message is to protect life, then you do not put other lives in jeopardy by your acts. 
We have been told in Holy Scripture, Mr. President, as you have heard it said, that it is no longer appropriate that we have an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. In fact, we have been told to turn the other cheek when we are struck. We have been told to love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you. 
I do not know how people have been lost in this debate, Mr. President, how they feel that they can come and bomb places of business, hurting innocent people. 
So I say, we must stop this violence. And the very first way of stopping the violence is to speak out against it. We must all speak out against these horrendous acts that are taking place in our country. 
I express my appreciation to the Senator from North Dakota for allowing me to speak out of order.

Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the two leaders allowing me to speak. I can say that it has been somewhat of an inconvenience for me to wait until the business of the body has been completed before we got to this matter. But the inconvenience to this Senator is so minor compared to the service that has been rendered in this body to the people of West Virginia, and to this country, by the Senator from West Virginia, that it is hardly worth talking about. 
I am happy to be here to talk about somebody for whom I have great feelings. I have served in public office since 1964. My first public office was 33 years ago. During that period of time I have had the good fortune to serve with great men and women, but I can honestly say I have never served with the likes of Senator Robert C. Byrd. 
As far as this Senator is concerned, he is a unique individual. I hope some day that Senator Byrd will complete what I understand he is working on, and that is the story about his life. I know a little bit about the life of Senator Byrd. I am an avid history fan, and every bit and piece I can find, and have found, about Senator Byrd I have tried to comprehend and understand. 
With someone of this magnitude, we sometimes wonder how he arrived at the point where he has such accolades pushed in his direction every day. 
I know that his first election was an interesting election, one where, seated often, as I understand, in the West Virginia State legislature were many, many people who were running for that office. Senator Byrd, being the person that he is, decided he needed to be a little bit different, to kind of stand out in the crowd, to be elected. So he decided that he would be different from the rest. The people would give long speeches telling why they should be elected to the State legislature. Senator Byrd would get their attention by playing a tune on his fiddle and singing a song. Senator Byrd was elected. 
Early in his career he decided to run for the West Virginia State Senate. But, as happens in a lot of States, there are kingmakers saying, `You run for this, you don't run for this, this isn't the appropriate time to run.' Someone who was a national figure thought that there would be other people who would be better qualified to serve in the West Virginia State Legislature. The great John L. Lewis, president of the Mine Workers, got word to Senator Byrd that he should not run. Of course, we all know now Senator Byrd, and that was the wrong thing to say to this man from the hills of West Virginia. He took on the leader of the Mine Workers, someone that literally brought the country to a standstill. But this man could not bring Robert Byrd to a standstill. He ran and was elected. 
Everyone knew that this man was close to the miners--may not have been close to labor, but he was close to the miners. And he was elected. 
Well, his career is outstanding. I can truly say that one of the most pleasant moments of my life was when I came to the Senate some 10 years ago and was notified that I could be on the Appropriations Committee. That, to me, was so memorable that I will never forget it. I have done my best to serve on the Appropriations Committee in a manner that I think is good for the State of Nevada, and hopefully good for the country. One person I look to as an example in that committee has been the person who was chairman, and is now ranking member of that committee, Senator Robert C. Byrd. 
I learned early on that the man carried in his pocket, as I now do, a copy of the United States Constitution. He carries that Constitution with him, not because he probably couldn't recite to the Presiding Officer, and to this Senator, every word in the Constitution from memory, if he chose to do so. But I think the reason he carries it there, next to his heart, is because he 
believes the Constitution is as important as any document in this country. 
We all know the rules that guide this body, and the person that knows them better than anyone else in this body--and probably knows them better than anyone else in the history of this body--is the Senator from West Virginia, who we are honoring today with this resolution. 
Mr. President, I had the good fortune to be a member of a delegation that met in West Virginia with British Parliamentarians. We had the ministers from Great Britain. We had other leaders. We met in West Virginia. After having been there, I understand some of the songs that come out of West Virginia, such as, `The West Virginia hills where I was born, and all is beautiful there.' 
What I am about to tell the Senate, and even though I was there, I find hard to believe. We had some entertainment, some music--blue-grass music. It was exciting. They asked Senator Byrd, `Tell us a song you would like to hear.' And he said, `There are more pretty girls than one.' They played that song. It was a great song. I have heard it many times since. 
Then he handed out notebooks to the Members of the Senate and to the Parliamentarians. From memory, without a note, he proceeded to recite the reign of the British monarchs, the date they served office, their names, and what they did. That took about 40 minutes or so for him to do, or maybe an hour. The British Parliamentarians were flabbergasted. They had never heard anything like this in their lives. But, as happens in this body, there are many times that we hear things that we have not heard any time in our lives, except from the Senator from West Virginia. 
I could tell you about the remarks he made on the Senate floor about the Roman Empire, about which a course at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas is now being taught, using the text of his lectures here on the Senate floor. 
Mr. President, the people of West Virginia should know that whether he was leading the debate on the Panama Canal treaty, or other international or domestic matters, that his No. 1 priority has always been the people of West Virginia. It has been a great example for all of us: to be involved in international and national affairs, but to never lose sight of the fact that you are elected by the people from your State and that the people in your State should have first priority. That is the most important lesson I have learned from the Senator from West Virginia. 
I express to the Senator, through the Presiding Officer, my affection, my admiration, and my respect, and I hope that, in some manner, my public service to the people of the State of Nevada will be as well-served as the Senator from West Virginia has served the people of West Virginia.  
Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.
