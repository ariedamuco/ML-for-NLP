Mr. BOND. I rise to engage the chairman of the committee in a colloquy to clarify a provision of the bill. Mr. Chairman, Section 8 of S. 2116 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer up to 10 percent of the information technology or information resource management funds from each office or agency to the account of the Chief Information Officer. Some of my constituents have expressed concern that this transfer of funds may cause a reduction in the number of employees in an office or agency. A scenario has been brought forth where an office or agency finds it necessary to reduce the number of its employees, using a variety of methods, to facilitate the transfer of funds. Would the chairman address this point?

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Roth, for attempting to bring some resolution to the home health crisis before the end of this session and making much needed revisions to the Medicare home health interim payment system (IPS). I fully support delaying the automatic 15 percent reduction for one year, raising the cost limits to 110 percent of the median, and raising payments for new agencies. However, I still have serious reservations about a blend approach which reshuffles the deck chairs on the Titanic. It is imperative that we restore access to home health care for medically complex patients, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to address this issue in conference. 
At this time my distinguished colleague from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, and I would like to engage the able Chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Roth, in a discussion about the problems that have resulted from IPS, and further action that the Senate must take to complete the work begun this year in this important area. 
Mr. President, there is not a single Member of the Senate or House of Representatives who has not become painfully aware of the serious problems that have arisen within the home health program over the last year. These problems stem from enactment of a temporary payment system that was recommended to us by the Health Care Financing Administration. The fact is that the so-called interim payment system (IPS) was untested, and, as we have found, made such swift and deep cuts in reimbursements, thereby hampering the ability of home care providers to serve needy patients and affecting access to care for some of the most frail, oldest, and poorest of our seniors and disabled. 
The IPS is the worse case of false economy that I've ever seen. If the elderly and disabled cannot get care at home, it's clear where they will go for care. Emergency room costs will rise, patients will go into more expensive institutionalized care, or patients simply won't get any care at all. In addition to increasing Medicare costs, there will be an explosion in Federal and State Medicaid budgets. I believe the Senator from Mississippi would agree that the problems brought about by IPS are significant.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I might add at this time that despite the fact that HCFA is responsible for this draconian system, HCFA has only offered technical assistance to address this crisis. HCFA must beheld accountable for this insane and inequitable system and face up to the fact that its system is wreaking havoc throughout our country. 
Clearly the program cannot continue under this scenario and continue to provide quality services to eligible individuals. Some of my colleagues may wonder how 
this all came about. Perhaps the Senator from Mississippi can provide some insight into this.

Mr. Bond. Thank you for those insights Senator cochran. I fully agree that this must be a priority of the Senate to address as soon as possible. There are additional issues which also need to be addressed at that time, particularly how to reimburse those agencies which serve our nation's most medically complex patients. We have a moral obligation to ensure that our nation's seniors and disabled are provided the quality and comfortable care they deserve. In addition, we must look at provisions which require that the payment limits are prorated where a patient is served by more than one agency. It is my understanding that the Health Care Financing Administration is not capable of administering this provision, yet it is having impact on patient's access to care. The problem centers around the inability of a home health agency to properly manage its business when it does not know the ultimate payment limitation which it must budget. The home health agency has no way of knowing whether a patient has received services from another home health agency during the year and cannot possibly figure out whether its breaking even or going broke. While we do not want home health agencies to abuse the system through schemes that allow them to circumvent the limits by transferring patients, we also do not want to penalize patients and providers from the appropriate management of home care services. Another issue is the elimination of the periodic interim payment methodology scheduled for October, 1999. That termination date was chosen to coincide with implementation of prospective payment system, which we now know, will not be in operation at that stage. This Congress should recognize the need to continue that system until such time as a Prospective Payment System is in place.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Fontbonne College in St. Louis, Missouri. On October 15, 1998, Fontbonne College will celebrate its 75th anniversary. 
Fontbonne has served more than 10,000 graduates in pursuit of academic excellence. As Fontbonne moves toward the 21st century, it is looking to continue the ministry of higher education begun by the sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet. 
Fontbonne's history goes back to seventeenth century France, the beginning of the Sisters of St. Joseph. In LePuy, France in 1647, six women under the direction of Jesuit priest Father Jean Pierre Medaille were brought together to dedicate their lives to the spiritual and material needs of the people. The order was publicly recognized as the Sisters of St. Joseph on October 15, 1650. 
Around 1778, Jeanne Fontbonne entered the congregation, received the name of Sister St. John Fontbonne, and later became the Mother Superior at Monistrol. With the violence of the French Revolution, the sisters were forced to disband. Several were imprisoned and executed. After the death of Robespierre, the day before Mother St. John was to be executed, she was released and asked to reform the congregation. In 1807, 12 women celebrated the rebirth of the Sisters of St. Joseph. 
Bishop Joseph Rosati of St. Louis asked Mother St. John to send sisters to the area to teach the deaf. Six sisters set sail for America and established its current home in Carondelet, on the southern border of St. Louis. A log cabin built on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River became the `cradle of the congregation of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet.' 
The sisters opened a day school in the area, a school for deaf and a girl's high school. With these successes, the sisters discussed a new twentieth century idea--higher education of women. 
Fontbonne College was chartered on April 17, 1917, but the entrance of the United States in World War I in that year precluded the beginning of classes. Construction at the Clayton location started in 1924. The first Fontbonne class began in 1923 at St. Joseph's Academy. New buildings were ready for the fall term of 1925. On June 18, 1927, Fontbonne conferred its first bachelor of arts degree on eight women. 
Since its beginnings in 1923, Fontbonne has changed with and been ahead of the times, but has also kept its identity. Fontbonne admitted African American students in 1947, eight years before the Supreme Court's school desegregation decision. Male students were admitted in selective majors in 1971, then in 1974 all classes were opened to men and women. In the 1980s, Fontbonne created degree programs with flexible scheduling to meet the needs of working students. Now Fontbonne has its first male president. 
Today Fontbonne is deeply rooted in the tradition and values--quality, respect, diversity, community, justice, service, faith and Catholic presence--of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet. 
I commend Fontbonne College staff and students for their dedication and perseverance throughout the college's many years of existence and hope they continue to enrich the St. Louis community for years to come.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Elizabeth `Bettie' Mohart for her outstanding service to the United States Senate. Bettie was the Chief Clerk on the Senate Committee on Small Business, of which I am Chair. In the three and a half years that she was with the Committee, she helped to make it run smoothly and efficiently. 
When Sam Rayburn said `you cannot be a leader, and ask other people to follow you, unless you know how to follow too,' he could have been talking about Bettie Mohart. She started her service in 1969 with Senator Stuart Symington as a Staff Assistant, and then went to work for Senator Robert Byrd as a Staff Assistant in 1972. In 1974, Bettie left the Senate to pursue other endeavors, only to return in 1985 to work for Senator Jack Danforth. She was hired as a Staff Assistant for Senator Danforth's personal office and was later moved to the Senate Committee on Commerce, when he became Chair. He then asked Bettie to return to his personal office, as Office Manager, where she stayed until his retirement. In 1994, I was fortunate enough to be able to hire her for the Committee on Small Business where she remained until her departure. 
By the time Bettie came to work for me she had worked in just about every capacity, in the Senate, with the exception of Chief of Staff and Senator, which no doubt she could have handled. This experience made her, not only an asset to my Committee, but it also gave her the wisdom to manage the Small Business Committee office with a just hand. I thank Bettie for her many years of service to myself and to the United States Senate, and wish her the best of luck in the future.

Mr. BOND. I thank our distinguished ranking member, Senator Mikulski. Before I get into the bill, let me say Senator Mikulski and her staff have given us tremendous cooperation, guidance and support. The process is always very difficult in this bill, but it runs much more smoothly because of her leadership, her guidance, and her deep concern for all of the programs covered. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate the conference report on the fiscal year 1999 VA-HUD and independent agencies appropriations bill. The conference report provides $93.4 billion, including $23.3 billion in mandatory veterans' benefits. I believe this represents a fair and balanced approach to meeting the many compelling needs that are afforded this subcommittee, particularly in the face of a very tight budget allocation. 
The conference report accords the highest priority to veterans' needs, providing $439 million more than the President's request for veterans' programs. Other priorities include elderly housing, protecting environmental spending, and ensuring sufficient funding for space and science. 
We did our best to satisfy priorities of Senators who made special requests for such items as economic development grants, water infrastructure improvements, and similar vitally important infrastructure investments. Such requests numbered over 1,000 individual items, illustrating the level of interest and the demand for assistance provided in this bill. 
We also attempted to address the administration's top concerns wherever possible, including funding for 50,000 new incremental housing vouchers, funding for the National Service Program at the current year rate, additional funding for the cleanup of Boston Harbor, and $650 million in advance funding for Superfund, contingent upon authorization and reform of the Superfund Program by August 1, 1999. 
For the Department of Veterans Affairs, the conference report provides a total of $42.6 billion. This includes $17.306 billion for veterans medical care. That figure is $278 million more than the President's request, and $249 million more than the 1998 level. Thus, we have increased by just about a quarter of a billion dollars the amount of money going to veterans health care above what was available for the past fiscal year. There was a strong consensus in this body, on a bipartisan basis, that the President's request for veterans medical care was inadequate, and that additional funds were needed to ensure the highest quality care to all eligible veterans seeking care. 
Funds above the President's request also provided for construction, research, State veterans nursing homes, and the processing of veterans claims. I am confident these additional funds will be spent to honor and care for our Nation's veterans. 
In HUD, the conference report provides for the Department of Housing and Urban Development a total of $26 billion. Again, this is $1 billion over the President's request. We were able to provide this significant increase in funding because of additional savings from excess section 8 project-based funds as well as savings from our reform of how HUD conducts its FHA property disposition program. 
Because of these savings and reforms, we have been able to increase funding for a number of important HUD programs, including increasing critically needed funding for public housing modernization from $2.55 billion to $3 billion; increasing HOPE VI to eliminate distressed public housing from $550 million to $625 million; increasing the very important local government top priority, Community Development Block Grants from $4.675 billion to $4.750 billion. 
We increased HOME funds, providing the flexibility for local governments to make improvements in providing needed housing for low-income and needy residents, from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, and we increased funding for homeless assistance from $823 million to over $1 billion, including requirements for HUD, recapturing and reprogramming unused homeless funds. 
We also included $854 million for section 202 elderly housing, and section 811 disabled housing. This is an increase of some $550 million over the President's request for the section 202 program. 
This reflects the sense of this body, expressed in a resolution jointly sponsored by my ranking member and myself, saying that we could not afford an 80-percent cut in assistance for elderly housing as proposed by the Office of Management and Budget. 
I want to be clear that these funding decisions for HUD do not reflect a vote of confidence for HUD. HUD remains a troubled agency with significant capacity problems and dysfunctional decisionmaking. Let me remind my colleagues that HUD remains designated as a high-risk area by the General Accounting Office, the only department-wide agency ever so designated. I am not confident that HUD is making appropriate progress. I also want to warn my colleagues that, while we have provided the additional 50,000 welfare-to-work incremental vouchers that the administration requested, HUD and we are fast approaching a train wreck. And the debris will be on our hands. 
Let me call our colleagues' attention to this chart. It shows an explosion. To be specific, in fiscal year 1997 we had to appropriate $3.6 billion in budget authority for the renewal of existing section 8 vouchers. These are the renewals for people who are now receiving section 8 assistance. Because in prior years we had multiyear authorizations, those authorizations are expiring, and just to maintain the section 8 assistance we are providing we had to go up to $8.2 billion this year. We will go up next year to $11.1 billion, the year after $12.8 billion, and by 2004 we will have to find budget authority of $18.2 billion, just to maintain the section 8 certificates, the vouchers for assisted housing for those in need that we already provide. 
So, this is a budgetary problem of huge magnitude and it is something that is coming. Unless we are to stop providing assistance for those who need section 8, we are going to have to find in the budget room for that much budget authority. I have asked HUD repeatedly, in hearings before our committee, to address this fiscal crisis. Yet HUD has repeatedly failed to fulfill these responsibilities. This is something this body and the House are going to have to work on next year and the year after and the year after. The problem grows significantly more severe as we move into the outyears. 
The conference report, at the request of the House and the leaders of the Housing Authorization Committee in the Senate--the distinguished chairman of that subcommittee, Senator Mack, will be addressing this later--includes a public housing reform bill entitled the `Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998.' I congratulate the members of the authorizing committee for making significant and positive reforms to public and assisted housing programs. I believe that, given the legislative calendar and the situation, it was appropriate, with the advice, counsel and direction of the leadership, that we included it. 
There are some issues I want to flag now because I think we may want to come back and readdress them, as we do in so many things that we pass in the housing area in this body. 
I am concerned that the requirements on targeting might adversely impact the elderly poor. I am concerned about a provision that could allow HUD to micromanage housing choices of public housing families on a building-by-building basis, and I don't agree with the provision that would provide the HUD Secretary with a slush fund of some $110 million. 
Most of my concerns, however, relate to provisions that will become effective in fiscal year 2000. I expect that we will continue to review these areas and we will work, as we have in the past, in full cooperation with our distinguished colleagues on the authorizing committees in both the House and the Senate and discuss these further in future bills. 
Finally, this appropriations bill provides a significant increase for FHA mortgage insurance. We raised the floor from $86,000 to $109,000 and the ceiling for high-cost areas from $170,000 to $197,000. This is a critical provision. It means that families will have new and important opportunities to become homeowners. 
With respect to the Environmental Protection Agency, the conference report provides $7.650 billion for EPA. That is about $200 million more than current year funding. Included in this is the President's full request for the clean water action plan which totals $150 million in new funding, principally for State grants aimed at controlling polluted runoff or nonpoint source pollution. The conference report also provides $2.125 billion for State clean water and safe drinking water revolving funds, an increase of $275 million over the President's request and $50 million over the current year. 
Mr. President, I am very proud that we were able to provide this, because I think in every State, if you talk with the people who are actually doing the hard work of making sure that wastewater is cleaned up and that we have safe drinking water, they will tell you that these State revolving funds, which provide low-cost loans and enable communities to take vitally important steps necessary to ensure that they clean up their wastewater and they have safe drinking water, they will tell you that these State revolving funds are absolutely critical for meeting the long-term needs of our communities. 
Back to the rest of the bill, for Superfund, the conference report provides $1.5 billion, the same as the current year funding. In addition, there is an advance appropriation of $650 million, contingent upon authorization by August 1, 1999. 
Other high priorities in EPA, which we have funded, include particulate matter research, funding for the brownfields at the full request level, providing to the States the tools they need to prevent pollution, cleanup of waste sites and enforcing environmental laws. Almost half of the funds provided in this bill will go directly to the States for these purposes. 
For FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, there is a total of $827 million, approximately the same amount as current year funding, with emphasis on preparing for both natural and man-made disasters. 
The conference report includes the President's request of $308 million for disaster relief spending. While there are not any additional funds above the President's request for disaster relief, let me assure everyone that the current balances in the disaster relief fund are sufficient to meet all the needs at this time, including those stemming from Hurricane Georges, as well as the flooding that hit my State over the weekend and resulted in tragic deaths in the Kansas City area, as well as severe damage to homes and businesses. 
We all appreciate the good work FEMA has done to help the victims struggling to recover from recent devastation, whether it is hurricanes, floods or tornadoes. Our thoughts and prayers are with the many people who suffered severe losses because of natural disasters. 
In order to support efforts aimed at mitigating against future disasters, the conference report provides $25 million for predisaster mitigation grants. These funds are intended to ensure communities will be better prepared and that losses will be minimized when the next disaster strikes. We hope these funds will be well spent to strengthen the Nation's preparedness for natural disasters. 
Finally, within FEMA, the conference agreement provides the full budget amount requested by the administration in July for antiterrorism activities. My ranking member and I believe this is vitally important preparation. It is something we need to be looking at in every area, and we are very proud to be able to provide this assistance for FEMA, because this is critical as part of an interagency effort aimed at preparing States and local governments for possible terrorists incidents. 
For the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, the conference report provides a total of $13.665 billion. This is $200 million over the President's request, including $5.480 billion for the international space station and shuttle activities. 
We remain very concerned over cost overruns, and the failure of the Russian Government to meet its obligations as a partner in the development and operation of the space station. As a result, this conference report includes requirements for NASA to address Russian noncompliance and includes a provision addressing the need for NASA to explore alternative ways of doing business with the Russians. Again, I thank my distinguished ranking member for her leadership on this issue. 
For the National Science Foundation, the conference agreement provides $3.6 billion for NSF. This is $242 million above the enacted level for the past year. Included in this is $50 million for the plant genome program. Mapping the significant crop genomes is vitally important to the future of agriculture and to feeding our country and to feeding the hungry people of the world. This is an increase of $10 million over last year's level and the initial phases of what I believe will be a significant scientific breakthrough. 
Before I yield to my colleague from Maryland, I do want to take this opportunity to talk about a crisis that is wreaking havoc throughout our country. That crisis is in Medicare home health benefits. They are in severe jeopardy. 
The Health Care Financing Administration implemented a home health interim payment system, the IPS, which hits hundreds of home health agencies, many of which are small, freestanding providers, and has been forcing them out of business. 
In Missouri alone where we had last year 230 home health care agencies, 50 agencies have already shut their doors entirely or have stopped accepting Medicare patients. One of them is the largest program in the State, the St. Louis Visiting Nurses Association, but many of them are small businesses that provide vitally needed health care services. It may be in rural areas or it may be in the inner cities, but they are serving some of the most deserving, poor elderly and disabled in our country. 
The agencies that are being hit are those that serve the most complex cases, the ones with the most difficult challenges. Some parts of Missouri are losing their only source of home health care. 
My hometown of Mexico, MO, has a small rural hospital. It is the Audrain Medical Center. We are very proud of it. But recently I received a letter from David Neuendorf, the medical center's chief financial officer, describing the difficulties they are facing. He stated the following:  
In Mexico the HealthCor, Beacon of Hope, and Homecare Connections agencies have closed. Other firms headquartered elsewhere have closed their Mexico offices. People who need home care in this area are simply not going to be able to get it in the future. When they become sick enough they will end up in the hospital where they will receive more expensive treatment. 
Mr. President, in Missouri we have a well known phrase: `Show me.' Mr. President, people in Missouri have shown me that the interim payment system is denying access to critical home health services. The IPS is the worst case of false economy I have ever seen. If the elderly and disabled cannot get care in the home, what is going to happen? They either will wind up in the emergency room very sick or they will go into institutionalized care, going into expensive nursing homes or even hospitals, or the patients simply will not get care at all. 
One agency chief officer who testified before the Small Business Committee exemplifies the problem. She tells me she provides care to the most complex cases, the most difficult ones to serve in a central city area. And if this system and the proposed cuts go through, she could go out of business, and of the 350 patients she has, almost half of them would have to go immediately into nursing homes. 
This means that not only will Medicare costs rise, but there will be an explosion in State and Federal Medicaid budgets. We are going to have to pay for these poor, elderly, and disabled who are very sick. If we do not take care of them in the home health setting, we are going to take care of them in less convenient, less comfortable ways for them but far more expensive ways for us. 
We must demand this insane, inequitable, and punitive system be corrected before we adjourn. And there are many proposals floating around. I believe Members on both sides of the aisle of this body know stories about how serious this crisis is. Some of them provide needed relief to home health agencies, those whom they serve. Some of them merely add a few lifeboats to a sinking ship. But it is clear one important consideration is missing. It is imperative we restore access to home health care for medically complex patients, especially those in center cities and rural areas. We cannot just reshuffle the deck and cause losses to vulnerable patients. 
Mr. President, I would have addressed this under the VA-HUD bill, under the FEMA's emergency budget. Unfortunately, home health care does not qualify for disaster relief. But let me assure my colleagues, that the human disaster of failing to address this home health care problem is going to be as severe, if not more severe, than many of the tragic natural disasters we address in FEMA. 
Mr. President, to sum up, I am very proud of the work that we have been able to accomplish. I appreciate once again the work of my distinguished colleague. I will recognize others who have worked on this later, but now it is my pleasure to defer to the distinguished Senator from Maryland. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to The Reverend Sylvester Laudermill, Jr. for his dedication and service to Saint Peter's African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) church in St. Louis, Missouri. On Sunday, October 4, 1998, the St. Peter's A.M.E. Church will celebrate the good work of Reverend Sylvester Laudermill whose leadership has helped to bridge the gap between church and community. 
Among several of the outstanding contributions of The Reverend is his musical talent. St. Peter's Inspirational Choir is one of the most sought after choirs and they have an annual touring schedule. Another outstanding aspect is the Reverend Laudermill's family-oriented approach to faith. He is an inspiration to the entire community. 
I commend Reverend Laudermill for his spirit and energy throughout his many years of leadership and hope he continues to enrich the St. Louis community for years to come.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 3412, the Year 2000 Readiness and Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. On September 15, 1998, the Committee on Small Business conducted a mark-up of H.R. 3412, a bill making technical amendments to the SBIC Program which passed the House of Representatives on March 24, 1998, and was referred to the Committee on Small Business. 
The Committee approved 18-0 my amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 3412, which included the Year 2000 Readiness Act (S. 2372), the Small Business Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (S. 2407) and portions of Senator Kerry's bill, the Small Business Loan Enhancement Act (S. 2448). Prior to approving my substitute amendment, the Committee approved seven amendments by unanimous voice votes.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, Sunday evening in St. Charles, MO, I was attending a picnic. Late in the afternoon a bright-eyed, starry-eyed 10-year-old boy came in. He had just witnessed something that is truly historic. I told the young man I hoped he had a really good memory, because I imagine that he would be telling not only his schoolmates, but his children and his grandchildren, and we might even hope his great grandchildren about it. 
As a matter of fact, as we travel around Missouri and other parts of the country, people have been talking about it all over. That is, of course, that on Sunday, Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals hit his 69th and 70th home run this season; a grand total of 70 home runs. To do that, he hit 5 home runs in his last 11 at bats. 
There were people who thought it would be very difficult to break the wonderful record that Roger Maris had established of 61 home runs. This year we saw something truly extraordinary. Another outstanding athlete, Sammy Sosa, hit 66. And the contest between these two superb athletes and wonderful human beings electrified this country. As somebody who has been a baseball fan for a long time, I was so delighted to see the excitement and enthusiasm as baseball came back to the status it has had as our Nation's pastime. People who never cared about sports in my State were clustering around the radios or the television whenever Mark McGwire came up. 
Mark McGwire is a man of immense physical stature, conditioning and strength. When I met him I was overwhelmed with his size and muscle. But he is a man of great mental dedication, of great concentration, determination, and--reading the column in today's Washington Post by Tom Boswell--probably possessing other extraordinary capabilities of which we mere mortals cannot be aware. 
He did something that, for baseball fans, was truly remarkable. It has done more for our State, the city of St. Louis--but for the country as well--when we look at the sportsmanship and the example of how hard work and determination and doggedness pay off. I would like to believe in other countries where baseball is played they felt the same excitement and the same enthusiasm that we did. 
To both Mark McGwire and to Sammy Sosa, we say congratulations and thank you for a wonderful season. Mr. Sosa has some more games to play with the Chicago Cubs. But I did not want this moment to pass without asking this body to consider acting on something that I think is a good idea. Actually, I read about it on the sports page. Bernie Miklasz' column in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch suggested it. I talked to my friends at the St. Louis Cardinals and they have been thinking about it. You see, there is an interstate highway that runs through St. Louis, interstate 70--a very fortuitous number, given the feat that Mr. McGwire has achieved. 
There are some of us--we don't want to raise a question, be nitpicking--who think he actually hit 71, if you count one in Milwaukee. But we are willing to pass on that one and say that there were 70 home runs that were hit. I am going to propose a measure today to designate a portion of interstate 70 in Missouri as the Mark McGwire Interstate Route 70; through St. Louis County and St. Louis City, to recognize the man who has not only brought baseball back to the top of everybody's mind and heart, but has done a tremendous amount for the community as well. 
This, I think, is a small measure for us to undertake. We are contacting our colleagues in the House to ask for their support. The mayor of St. Louis has indicated his support, and we are asking others to join with us. We hope to have clearance later on today, if we can obtain clearance to pass it in wrap-up. 
We also invite additional cosponsors. I have three who wish to cosponsor it to recognize this tremendous feat and to designate this in honor of the man who has really brought the thrill back to baseball and has shown that human beings have tremendous talent. 
I send to the desk a bill to designate the Mark McGwire Interstate Route 70. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, before being referred, that the bill be held at the desk to seek clearance from the minority side of the aisle.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the courtesy of my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania. I congratulate him on his leadership on this issue. These are very, very difficult procedures to describe and I know that no one here on the floor enjoys hearing them. But the fact that they are so horrendous I think is one of the reasons we are here today. 
Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on whether to override the President's veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act. This legislation would ban a particularly hideous form of late term abortion known as `partial birth' abortion. Unfortunately, while a majority of Senators supported the ban last year, the vote count was not enough at that time to override the subsequent veto by President Clinton. 
I hope that some Senators will have had a change of heart since then and will vote to override the veto. 
This is a horrible procedure. The Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, has likened it to infanticide. Remember that these are `late-term' abortions, meaning they take place during or after the 5th month of pregnancy. A fully developed fetus is brought down the birth canal, feet first, and then delivered, all but the head. Then the abortionist takes a pair of scissors, inserts them in the back of the baby's neck, and collapses the brain, and the baby is delivered: dead. 
I would note the American Medical Association, representing thousands of doctors, believes the ban is justified and that there is no room in medicine for this procedure. 
The overwhelming majority of the American people and Missourians are rightly revolted by this. Some states have banned the procedure, and the state of Missouri has come very close to banning it. Few other issues have generated so much mail and so many phone calls to my office. People feel very very strongly about banning this procedure. And it is easy to see why. 
And, the partial birth abortion ban has passed in both the House and the Senate by large majorities. In fact, the issue would be settled if President Clinton hadn't vetoed the bill last year, against the wishes of an overwhelming number of Americans. 
Rarely have I seen a President, like this one, who is willing to ignore the wishes of the overwhelming majority of the American people. The overwhelming majority is opposed to this hideous procedure. 
I have been asked why we are holding this vote in the Senate, when we are likely to fall short of what is needed to override the veto? 
We are holding this vote today because the President made a terrible mistake in vetoing the bill. It is up to Congress--it is up to Congress on this issue to listen to the people, to try to reverse it. 
Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to correct the President's mistake. We are going to work on it. I ask our constituents and the constituents of other Senators who may be undecided to let them know how important overriding this veto is. I hope--I sincerely, honestly, and devoutly hope--that we will muster the necessary votes to override the veto tomorrow. 
I thank the Chair. I particularly thank my colleague from Pennsylvania.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture so that the Senate may proceed to consideration of S. 1981, The Truth In Employment Act. As an original cosponsor of the bill, I applaud Senator Hutchinson for his efforts to restore balance to our federal labor laws. S. 1981 would prohibit the controversial practice of some unions called `salting,' while maintaining the right of all workers to choose whether or not to be represented by a union. 
`Salting' is a controversial tactic that typically involves a union instructing its agents to apply for jobs with non-union employers. If these agents, or `salts,' are not hired, then the union immediately files unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleging discriminatory hiring. If the salt is hired, he or she attempts to convince the other employees to join the union, tries to generate unfair labor practices, and initiates complaints with other federal agencies like OSHA and EPA. Some unions have made it clear that if organizing is unsuccessful, then the goal is to drive non-union companies out of business to lessen competition for unionized businesses.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Hannibal-LaGrange College in Hannibal, Missouri. On September 15, 1998, the Hannibal-LaGrange College will celebrate its 140th anniversary. This is especially significant considering the college's first seventy years were spent in LaGrange and the second seventy have been spent in Hannibal. 
Hannibal-LaGrange College offers an excellent liberal arts education and throughout the years has grown, not only in number, but in opportunities available for students. Today the college offers more than thirty areas of study, night programs for working adults, eight intercollegiate sports teams and four traveling performance groups. 
I commend Hannibal-LaGrange College staff and students for their dedication and perseverance throughout the college's many years of existence and hope they continue to enrich the Hannibal community for years to come.

<TEXT>
Mr. BOND. Madam President, it is a great honor and with pleasure that I introduce this resolution for myself, Mr. Ashcroft, the Senator from California, and others who may wish to join us. 
Yesterday, I was on this floor describing a very difficult predicament that Major League baseball was encountering. It seemed, as of early yesterday morning, that the Internal Revenue Service might say that a fan who caught a historic home run ball hit by Mark McGwire and turned it back to him might be liable for $150,000 or more in gift taxes on that ball. We pointed out that that made no sense. I am proud to say that we had bipartisan support for that proposition, Madam President. There are very few things that have brought this Chamber together more than that one simple proposition. 
I was very pleased yesterday afternoon to have a call from Commissioner Rossotti of the IRS, who understood the magnitude of the problem this could cause. He advised me that he has issued a release from the IRS saying that, while resolving gift tax issues is as difficult as figuring out the infield fly rule, it made sense that we congratulate a fan who returns the baseball rather than hit him with taxes. That is particularly good news to Deni Allen, a 22-year-old marketing representative from Ozark, MO, Mike Davidson, a 28-year-old St. Louis native, and Tim Forneris, a 22-year-old from Collinsville, IL, a member of the St. Louis grounds crew. They all just wanted to give Mark McGwire the baseball and didn't want to be taxed on it. Thanks to the support of this body and the action of the Commissioner, they will not be taxed. I am very pleased with that. 
I was also pleased to join many friends and colleagues last night in rooting for the historic home run hit by Mark McGwire. Mark McGwire's achievements are there for all to see on television, or to read about in the sports page, because this is one tremendous athlete. He hit home run ball No. 62 in his 144th game of the season. 
The purpose of our resolution is to recognize that historic contribution to baseball. But I also want to just spend a minute on Mark McGwire, the person. I have in my hand a copy of Sports Illustrated, which features a picture of Mark McGwire and his son, Matt McGwire. The article is entitled `One Cool Dad.' I think a lot of people who watched Mark McGwire in the year he has been in St. Louis, and probably before that in California, know that he is a dedicated father and he is a community leader. He has shown his willingness to serve his community by his generosity. 
This man is a great role model for young people in our country today, and the way he approached this record-setting mark, with due recognition for Roger Maris--also a tremendous athlete, one I greatly respected, who held the record prior to him--reflects extremely well on Mr. McGwire. I hope that I will have many cosponsors who will join in this resolution. I see several colleagues on the floor who want to discuss it, but suffice it to say that Mark McGwire has made a historic contribution to baseball. He has brought the country together. The only thing we are talking about in Missouri is Mark McGwire, not a lot of the other problems. His dedication to leadership and family values, his spirit of community contribution and leadership mark him as an outstanding gentleman who I trust all of us in this body are willing to recognize. 
Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Covenant House in St. Louis, Missouri on its 25th Anniversary. Over the years, Covenant House has been an important and integral part of the low-moderate income housing community for the elderly. The Anniversary celebration will take place on September 13, with special honorees Harvey and Wilma Gerstein. 
The Gersteins have dedicated a great deal of their lives to the development of quality housing for the elderly. Harvey was the first-ever President of the Covenant House and still serves on the Board of Directors. Wilma is a member of the Board and serves as Chair of the Volunteer Committee. 
Covenant House is publicly financed and has 434 units of housing to serve its 484 elderly residents. With the continuing need for more establishments like the Covenant House, they founded the Community Aging Corporation. This Corporation provides a variety of social services to guarantee safety for the elderly in an independent setting. 
It is a great privilege to honor this high caliber living community and its special honorees. Dedication to one's community has become an increasingly rare quality in our society. The St. Louis community is lucky to have such a facility and I want to express my sincere appreciation to everyone who makes the Covenant House excel.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud St. Louis Cardinals baseball fan. I have been a St. Louis Cardinals fan a lot longer than I have been a U.S. Senator, and I have never been more proud of the team, nor of the city and the State which supports that team. 
This weekend we saw the fabulous Mark McGwire hit home runs 60 and 61. And it was truly electrifying, not only for the people who were in the stands and watched the huge home runs--and when Mark McGwire hits a home run generally it is huge. He bounced one off of the dining room of the Stadium Club and it dropped back down beneath. There used to be a time when people didn't even think somebody could hit the Stadium Club. He has hit balls so far in Bush Stadium that they automatically start measuring them. The announcer of the Cardinal baseball games, the fabulous Jack Buck, talks about calling air traffic control to warn about it. 
There are a couple of things that I think need to be mentioned. No. 1, Mark McGwire is the kind of fine human being whom we need as a role model for our young people today, when the national spirit is sagging and we are talking about scandals. Here is a man, the first thing he did when he came to St. Louis was make a significant donation to the St. Louis Children's Hospital. He is a man who worships his son. When he crossed the plate after hitting his 61st home run, he picked up his 10-year-old son. There were some who were worried that the son might be in danger because of his enthusiasm. But Mark McGwire is truly an American hero. 
I would say also the same thing for Sammy Sosa, who was in the outfield with the Cubs when that 61st went out. Sammy Sosa is a class ballplayer, one we can be proud of. 
I will tell you something else that Missouri and the Midwest and America can be proud of, the young men who caught the home runs 60 and 61. When they were asked, `Are you going to sell it for a million dollars?' They said, `No, we are going to give it back to Mark McGwire.' And this selfless act, giving the ball back to the guy who hit it so he could give it to Cooperstown, epitomizes the spirit. The signs in the stadium said `Baseball City U.S.A.' St. Louis is very proud of being Baseball City and everybody who comes in there is proud of it, and they are proud of the spirit of the fans who are there. But you have to know, the Grinch appears. 
Today's New York Times, classic spot for the Grinch to appear: `Fan Snaring Number 62 Faces Big Tax Bite.' 
Now, get a life. The IRS spokesman has confirmed that the person who gives the ball back to Mark McGwire might be facing a gift tax of $150,000. The young man who caught number 60 is just out of college and he works in the promotion department of the Rams. The guy who caught number 61 is the catering manager who had to go to work at 4:30 this morning. They are going to have to pay $150,000? Now, that is about as ludicrous as anything I have seen. If the IRS wants to know why they are the most feared, disliked agency in town, this is the classic example. 
The New York Times interviewed a spokesman for the IRS who said: `I can confirm your understanding of how the gift tax works. The giver of the gift is required to file a gift tax return. We'd have to take a look at all the circumstances: the value of the gift and who owns the baseball.' 
I am asking my colleagues to join me in a letter to the Commissioner of the IRS. We come here as Democrats and Republicans, but I know there is a strong, bipartisan enthusiasm for the support of baseball. And for the Commission to tolerate somebody saying that a fan who gives the ball back to Mark McGwire could owe a $150,000 gift tax is outrageous. 
The IRS needs to lighten up. The fact that the Tax Code could allow for such a ridiculous thing is one thing. We are going to be tackling the issue of tax reform in Congress. We have done much on the Taxpayer Relief Act. We have made strides. The new Commissioner has talked about making the IRS a consumer-friendly agency, but it is absolutely ridiculous that the IRS would seriously consider imposing a tax on a generous fan who happens to catch the historic ball and return it. Get a life. Surely there are baseball fans among the clever lawyers and accountants at the IRS who can devise reasons why this good deed should go unpunished. My staff and I are available to work with them. I think we can find a way to take care of it. 
But if the IRS wants to know what their problems are, they have to look no further than this threat. I have to tell you that if you do not think people are paying attention, our e-mail has been running, our fax machine; the calls are coming in. 
Dean Pfeiffer of Lee's Summit said:  
What a better issue to use to highlight the need for tax reform. How can anyone defend a tax system that penalizes such a selfless act? 
Scot George said: 
This tax on this person is as unAmerican as Saddam Hussein. I urge you to act swiftly against the IRS on this matter. 
Mr. President, I warn you, there is a revolution brewing. There may not be enough agents to collect a gift tax from somebody who returns the 62nd baseball back to Mark McGwire. 
I do have a letter here to Commissioner Rossotti asking him to review this situation and clarify it so that when the fan catches the ball--we know he is going to be surrounded by security. The security is very tight to make sure he is not physically abused. And it is a jungle out there when people are going for the ball. We have security to protect him. We want to keep the IRS agents off of him. 
I say to my colleagues, if they wish to join me in signing this letter to the Commissioner to call this serious matter to his attention, I will have it today and it will be available for them to do so. I think that the time has come to say that a fan who catches a historic home run ball and gives it back to the guy who hit it should not be stuck by the IRS. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today with my colleagues Senator Jeffords and Senator Harkin I introduce the Assistive Technology Act of 1998. This important piece of legislation will provide technical assistance to the more than 50 million citizens in the United States with disabilities. 
The Tech Act, passed in 1988, has proven time and again its invaluable assistance in helping persons with disabilities acquire assistive technology that improves their functional capability and quality of life. This technical assistance allows students to learn better in school, adults to acquire jobs, and seniors to live more independently. I have seen the success of the State Tech Act projects first hand in my home State of Missouri. It is estimated that 750,000 Missourians of all ages live with a disabling condition. Ms. Diane Golden, of the Missouri Assistive Technology Project, informed me that Missouri's state office handled 4,000 direct cases this past year, not including thousands of calls regarding information and referrals. 
Mr. President, Missourians know the impact of the State Tech Act Projects. 
Wanda, an elder Kansas City woman lost most of her hearing late in life. For three years, she lived without the ability to talk with friends or to call her doctor in an emergency. Wanda's inability to use the telephone, in addition to other age related issues, was threatening her ability to continue living in her own home. 
Missouri Tech Act Project staff worked with Wanda to identify an adaptive telephone that would allow her to continue to live independently. The cost of the device was prohibitive for this woman and no public funding source was available. Nevertheless, Project staff located a private funding source for the adaptive telephone and as a result Wanda has been able to continue to live independently. 
Realizing that thousands of individuals throughout the state were facing the same need for adaptive telephone equipment, the Project developed a statewide telecommunication equipment distribution program that provides Missourians, with all types of disabilities, adaptive telephone equipment. The program has been operational for a year and has provided more than one million dollars of adaptive telephone equipment to thousands of Missourians. 
Another Missourian, Mary, an 8-year-old young girl, who is non-vocal, needed an augmentative communication device that would allow her to communicate at home and school. Medicaid had approved purchasing the device just before its conversion from a fee-based system to a managed care system. The new managed care plan was unfamiliar 
with augmentative communication devices and the family was having no success in securing the device. Project staff worked with the managed care provider to explain the importance and cost-effectiveness of augmentative communication devices and as a result, secured funding for Mary's device. 
Understanding that most, if not all, of the managed care plans under contract with Medicaid would be unfamiliar with augmentative communication devices and other types of assistive technology, Project staff worked with the Missouri Medicaid plans to educate them about the importance, cost-effectiveness, and coverage of assistive technology. As a result, numerous plans routinely approve assistive technology. As a result, numerous plans routinely approve assistive technology devices and many call the Project for assistance when they receive requests for assistive devices of which they are unfamiliar. 
These examples are just a small sampling of the successes of the Missouri Technology Assistance Project. Some other accomplishments of the Project include development of an educational technology access informational packet that the Department of Education distributed to more than 17,000 schools nationally; passage of a sales tax exemption for the purchase of assistive technology in Missouri; establishment of a short-term equipment loan program; development and distribution of a Consumer Guide to Missouri Assistive Device Lemon Laws; and establishment of a web page with postings of equipment for their recycling program. 
Missouri's success is one example of the many accomplishments of other State Tech Act Projects since the inception of the Tech Act in 1988. The Assistive Technology Act of 1988 will guarantee that states continue to serve the disabled community, their families, friends, teachers, and employers. 
The bill we are introducing also provides improvements to the current State Tech Act Projects. Some notable improvements include better coordination and information sharing; Microloan programs to help assistive technology end users in obtaining assistive devices; incentive grants to assure better accountability of all programs; and increased small business investment in assistive and universally designed technology research and development. These improvements and new initiatives strengthen the work currently done by the State Tech Act Projects, encourage improvements to current programs and are forward looking in the acquisition, development, and service delivery of assistive technology. 
State Tech Act Projects provide vital technology related services to individuals with disabilities. The initiatives of these important programs ensure the availability of technology to people with disabilities that make living independently a reality. The Assistive Technology Act of 1998 strengthens and maintains a program that works for a constituency that would otherwise be denied the exciting opportunities that technology affords. 
Mr. President I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House to pass this legislation expediently so that technological assistance can continue to be available for our nation's disabled. 
Let me conclude by thanking my distinguished colleagues Senator Jeffords and Senator Harkin and their staff for their hard work on this important piece of legislation. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Jeffords and Harkin and myself, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record, a letter of support for the Assistive Technology Act of 1998 from the United Cerebral Palsy Association.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. I remember well the days when I came back from summer vacation, and for the first days of school it was a little difficult to focus attention. It is good to see colleagues again. I appreciate very much the effort so that we can discuss what unfortunately has become a very serious problem. 
Mr. President, in light of the continued proliferation issues which surround the world and the Middle East in particular, I believe that now, more than ever, it is important for the United States to maintain its vigilance with respect to Iraq's insatiable appetite to procure the most terrible weapons on earth. 
Saddam Hussein has attempted to avoid any and every attempt by the civilized world to control and monitor his government's obsession with attaining weapons of mass destruction. Saddam Hussein has a proven track record of his proclivity to utilize these weapons if he does not believe that the consequences of his actions would lead to his own destruction or at least to severe injury. The continued aggressive monitoring of Iraq's weapons stockpiles is critical to preventing him from building and using these weapons to make another attempt to dominate the region through physical threats to neighboring populations. 
The recent resignation of Scott Ritter from the inspection team and his reasons for doing so should not go unheeded by this body. The coalition of nations which developed originally to thwart Iraq's aggression against its neighbors has deteriorated to the point where each new confrontation with Iraq becomes a test of wills within the United Nations and the Security Council. Time and time again, Saddam has scoffed at United States stated policy of `no compromise' and time and time he is proven correct. No longer do we punish Iraqi transgressions; we become party to negotiating additional concessions. We no longer lead with resolve; we follow timidly and make excuses for delay and inaction. 
We must not shirk from our responsibility to have the administration and the world understand our commitment to insuring that Iraq abandon its weapons of mass destruction program through strict inspections programs and a well defined and consistently implemented set of consequences for non-compliance. To achieve that I have proposed a resolution which outlines concerns I have regarding Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, calls upon the administration to oppose any effort to relax inspection regimes and has the President submit a report to Congress on the United States Government's assessment of Iraq's weapons program. 
I understand that the resolution I have proposed has been accepted by both sides and has been included in the bill and I thank the chairman and the ranking member and other members of the committee for their help to include this resolution in this bill which outlines our most grave concerns and calls upon the President to issue a report which certifies the level of compliance by the Iraqi regime to the numerous non-proliferation protocols currently in effect, the effectiveness of these protocols, and the implementation of United States' policy to curb Iraq's weapons program. 
I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman of the committee and the ranking member for permitting me to proceed. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today, I have been joined by Senators Coverdell, Domenici, Kempthorne, and Snowe to introduce `The Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998' to restructure and refine Small Business Administration programs that are designed to help small businesses succeed. In drafting this legislation, I followed one key principle--will the change help small businesses? Many of SBA's programs are dependent upon the private sector to make loans and investments or to provide services to small businesses. `The Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998' is intended to make Federal small business programs work more effectively while stimulating greater interest in the private sector to support small business owners and their employees. 
The small business sector is the fastest growing segment of our economy. Its sustained growth throughout this decade has enabled our Nation to experience one of its greatest periods of prosperity. During this time span, small businesses have been responsible for the net increase of new jobs in the United States. Today, small businesses employ over 1/2 of all American workers. Small businesses produce 55 percent of our Nation's gross domestic product. Our Nation's sustained economic growth would not be possible were it not for the strength of the small business sector. One would hate to imagine where we would be without a robust small business community. 
The Committee on Small Business opened the 105th Congress with a hearing on Homebased and Women-owned businesses. We received testimony on the significant economic contribution being made by the 8 million women-owned businesses and on the importance of business education, training, and financial assistance to this growing segment of our economy. 
To assist the rapid growth of small businesses owned by women, Section 2 of `The Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998' would increase the authorization level to $12 million from $8 million per year for the Women's Business Center program. This increase would ensure that new Center sites will be opened without jeopardizing the currently funded Centers from receiving funds for five years. 
To verify the SBA provides the Women's Business Center program with the staff and administrative support required to support a $12 million program, the bill directs the General Accounting Office to undertake a baseline and follow-up study of the SBA's administration of the program. These independent audits will assist Congress in its oversight of SBA's supervision and administration of the program. Knowing that the Administration has previously recommended a budget that would have shut down the program, we want to make sure it is receiving the appropriate level of staffing and agency resources. 
Last year, Congress passed the `Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997,' which increased the authorization for the Women Business Center Program to $8 million from $4 million and extended the number of years grantees can receive grants to five years from three years. The goal was to have a Women's Business Center operating in every state and additional sites in states where there is sufficient demand. Consistent with our view, the Administration's budget request for Fiscal Year 1999 recommended an increase in the authorization level to $9 million. Senators Kerry  and Cleland introduced S. 2157 which would authorize the Administration's request and would go one step further by increasing the authorization level to $10.5 million in FY 2000, and $12 million in FY 2001. I am encouraged to see such a strong show of support for the program--only two years after Congress killed the Administration's recommendation to strike all funding for the program. 
Section 2 of the bill includes a new provision to provide parity between Centers operating under three-year agreements with SBA when the Reauthorization Act was enacted and those Centers awarded five-year grants since that time. Section 2 amends the law to provide the same matching requirement in year four for all Centers receiving SBA grants. Under the 1997 Act, Centers that receive a two-year extension at the conclusion of a three-year grant have to raise two non-federal dollars for every federal dollar awarded; under Section 2, they will have to raise one non-federal dollar for each federal dollar--which is the fourth year matching requirement for Centers receiving newly awarded five year grants. The 2 non-federal dollars to one federal dollar matching requirement will remain in force for the fifth year of all awardees. 
Section 3 of `The Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998' would make the SBIR Program permanent. Testimony before the Committee on Small Business and the findings of the General Accounting Office clearly support this Congressional action. The bill would also increase the set aside from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. Beginning in FY 2001, the program would be increased by 1/4 of 1 percent in each of the next four fiscal years. 
Congress established the SBIR Program in 1982 because small businesses are a principal source of innovation in the United States. Under this program, Federal agencies with extramural research and development budgets of $100 million or more are required to set aside no less than 2.5 percent of that amount for small businesses. The SBIR Program was last re-authorized in 1992 and will terminate in FY 2000 unless Congress acts first. 
In April 1998, the General Accounting Office issued its comprehensive report on the state of the SBIR Program, and in June 1998, GAO addressed that report in testimony before the Committee on Small Business. The unmistakable message was very clear--this is a good program that is running well. There are ten Federal agencies that participate in the program, and GAO concluded they are all adhering to the program's funding requirements. Competition has 
been intense among small business R&D firms in response to solicitations from the ten agencies. GAO found, however, it was very rare for an agency to make an award when the agency received only one proposal in response to a solicitation was received. 
The bill would make a significant change in the program to encourage better outreach to states that receive few awards each year. GAO reported in FY 1996 that California received a total of 904 awards for a total of $207 million and Massachusetts received 628 awards for a total of $148 million. On the other hand, there were a great number of states receiving 11 or fewer awards. The bill would permit each of the ten participating agencies to spend up to 2% of the SBIR set aside pool of funds to support an outreach program, to promote better commercialization of the R&D awards, and to offset some administrative expenses. At least one-third of these non-award funds must be spent on outreach in those states that receive 25 or fewer awards each year. 
Earlier this year, I introduced S. 2173, the `Assistive and Universally Designed Technology Improvement Act,' to encourage the development and production of actual products for the marketplace for assistive technology end-users. As part of my effort to reach that goal, the `Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998' includes a provision encouraging all ten Federal agencies participating in the SBIR Program to solicit proposals to advance research and development in this critical area. 
In 1958, Congress created the SBIC Program to assist small business owners obtain investment capital. Forty years later, small businesses continue to experience difficulty in obtaining investment capital from banks and traditional investment sources. SBICs are frequently their only sources of investment capital. In 1992 and 1996, the Committee on Small Business worked closely with SBA to correct earlier deficiencies in the law in order to ensure the future of the program. Today, the SBIC Program is booming. Its performance since 1994 has been astounding. 
Section 4 of `The Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998' would make a relatively small change in the operation of the program. This change, however, would help smaller, small businesses to be more attractive to investors. The bill would permit SBICs to accept royalty payments contingent on future performance from companies in which they invest as a form of equity return for their investment. 
SBA already permits SBICs to receive warrants from small businesses, which give the investing SBIC the right to acquire a portion of the equity of the small business. By pledging royalties or warrants, the small business is able to reduce the interest that would otherwise be payable by the small business to the SBIC. Importantly, the royalty feature provides the smaller, small business with an incentive to attract SBIC investments when the return may otherwise be insufficient to attract venture capital. 
Section 5 of `The Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998' would require the SBA to make permanent a pilot program initiated two years ago to permit certain Certified Development Companies (CDCs) to foreclose and liquidate defaulted loans that they have originated under the 504 Loan Program. This is a necessary step to ensure the 504 program remains viable. 
Currently, SBA liquidates and forecloses almost every loan made under the 504 Loan Program. SBA has been performing this task poorly. The Administration's FY 1999 budget submission estimates that recoveries on defaulted loans under the 504 Loan Program will decline from 34.27% in FY 1998 to 30.67% in FY 1999. It is important to note that all loans made under the 504 loan program are fully secured by real estate. It is inconceivable that SBA recovers only thirty cents on the dollar on fully-secured real estate loans. 
Because the 504 Program is self-funded through user fees, with no appropriation required by Congress, borrowers must pay higher fees to compensate for the SBA's inability to recover a reasonable portion of defaulted loans. As borrower fees have increased, the 504 Loan Program has been priced out of the reach of certain small businesses. The 504 Loan Program was enacted to provide larger loans to small businesses for plant acquisition, construction or expansion. Such loans create jobs and improve the economic health of communities. Congress should not allow such opportunities to be limited because the SBA has been unable to recover funds on defaulted loans effectively. 
In 1996, Congress passed, at my urging, the Small Business Programs Improvement Act, which established a pilot program that allowed approximately 20 CDCs to liquidate loans that they had originated. Reports on this pilot program indicate it has been a success--CDCs are obtaining higher recoveries than the SBA. This bill makes the pilot program permanent and permits CDCs that have the ability to manage loan liquidations to do so. This change in the law is designed to increase the recoveries on defaulted loans thereby decreasing borrower fees. Consequently, more small businesses will have access to 504 loans, which will create more jobs and will help sustain the economic growth this country has been experiencing. 
The `Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997' included the creation of the HUBZone Program, which raised the goal to 23% from 20% for prime contracts being awarded by the Federal government to small business. This increase was advocated by the SBA Administrator and was embraced by the Clinton Administration. 
It has been brought to the attention of the Committee on Small Business that some Federal agencies may be using bookkeeping ploys to reduce the amount of contract dollars 
going into the pool of contracts used for calculating the older 20% small business set aside goal. By reducing the overall dollar volume of contracts, the value of contracts counted under the older 20% set aside goal is also reduced. Now that Congress has increased the goal to 23%, I am concerned there may be greater pressure on the agencies to `juggle the books.' 
In order for the Committee on Small Business to conduct its oversight of the small business contract set aside goal, Section 6 of the bill directs the SBA to send a report to the Committee on Small Business each year highlighting any Federal agency that alters its statistical methodology in tracking its efforts to meet the 23% goal. The bill also directs the Administrator of SBA to notify the Committee and the SBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy prior to approving any request from an agency to change how it reports its small business contracting efforts. 
Last year, when Congress approved the `Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997,' it included a separate title to improve business opportunities for service-disabled veterans. The Senate and House Committees on Small Business believed strongly that these individuals deserve better support from the Federal agencies than they have received historically. Last year's bill included a provision requiring the SBA to complete a comprehensive report containing the findings and recommendations of the SBA Administrator on the needs of small businesses owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans. Although this report should be received by the Congress no later than the first week of September, SBA's efforts to date to complete this report within the statutory deadline are disappointing. 
Section 7 of `The Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998' would go one step further to strengthen the mandate that SBA's programs be more responsive to all veteran small business owners. The bill would direct that veterans receive comprehensive help at SBA. The bill elevates the Office of Veterans Affairs at SBA to the Office of Veterans Business Development, which would be headed by an Associate Administrator, who would report directly to the SBA Administrator. 
In addition, the bill would establish an Advisory Committee on Veterans' Business Affairs composed of 15 members. Eight members would be veterans who own small businesses, and seven members will be representatives of national veterans service organizations. Further, the bill would create the position of National Veterans' Business Coordinator within the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE) Program. This new position would work in the SBA headquarters to ensure that SCORE's programs nationwide include entrepreneurial counseling and training for veterans. 
Section 7 of the bill would make veteran small business owners eligible to apply for small, start-up loans under SBA's Microloan Program. And the SBA Office of Advocacy would be directed to evaluate annually efforts by Federal agencies, business and industry to help business that are owned and controlled by veterans. 
The `Small Business Programs Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998' is a sound bill that will help small business owners, particularly those who are struggling or in the business start-up phase to compete more effectively. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have had a brief debate. The manager of the bill, the chairman of the committee, has moved to table the Feingold amendment. I want to add my comments to the debate on that issue. 
This is an amendment which I strongly oppose and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to oppose it. This is part of a continuing campaign of harassment against the Navy's No. 1 program, the No. 1 program of the U.S. Navy. This campaign has had a long, and to date totally unsuccessful, history. We all know the problems in the court systems when individuals flood the courts with frivolous lawsuits. We, in providing procurement funds for the Navy, have had a string of what I consider to be less than good-faith, responsible amendments directed at this program. 
The amendment before us purports to cut funds from a Navy procurement program and earmark them for the National Guard operations and maintenance fund. As a long-time and strong supporter of the National Guard, I recognize the limited funding the Guard has, and I have worked with my colleagues, the chairman and the ranking member of the Defense Appropriations Committee, and the Senator from Kentucky, my cochairman of the National Guard caucus, to fund adequately the Guard component of the total force. But I do not believe that pitting one service against the other, raiding the Navy's No. 1 procurement program, is the way to fill that funding requirement. No, this amendment is not a step forward for good government. It has been proposed for no other reason than as a reckless assault on a program which has successfully cleared every production hurdle with room to spare. 
I have been advised by Major General Edward Philbin, Executive Director of the National Guard Association of the U.S., that NGAUS is not supporting this program because, among other things, it would simply create problems between the National Guard and the Navy. This, to me, is a very unfortunate step when, as pointed out by the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, all services are facing shortfalls. We have to address the inadequacy in funding for the National Guard and all of the other services. But I can tell you that this amendment is totally uncalled for. 
The F/A-18E/F is the Navy's No. 1 priority procurement program. If you ask the Secretary of the Navy or any of the fleet carrier strike-fighter aviators what will enable the Navy to be viable in the 21st century and beyond, they will tell you it is the Super Hornet. Yesterday the CNO was in my office with one of the fine young men who fly the F/A-18. They reemphasize this is their No. 1 program. They cannot afford to take cuts in the program such as proposed on the House side, or particularly as proposed in this amendment. I think it is a sad day when some Members, for reasons known to themselves, would wish to pit the National Guard against the Navy. I think it is irresponsible and could lead to services raiding each other's accounts to achieve an individual Senator's political goals. 
In January of 1997, the Senator from Wisconsin led an effort to terminate the F/A-18E/F. He failed. Since then, he has continued what appears to be a vendetta against the program, and now his intent is slowly to drain the money from the aircraft by continuing a plan to reduce the number of aircraft and the funding available, to make a full-rate production decision nearly impossible. 
When you talk with the people in the Navy who know what their needs are, who know what the future of naval aviation is, they will insist, and they will tell you that this is the airplane that they must have. If we want our men and women in naval aviation to carry out the missions we demand of them, then we have to provide them the modern, up-to-date, efficient aircraft, technologically superior, that the E/F F-18 gives us. 
I remember full well several years ago when the distinguished ranking member of this committee, the Senator from Hawaii, said, `We don't ever want to send American fighting men and women into a battle evenly matched. We want to send them in with the technological superiority, the training, and the capability and resources to make sure they win.' 
Mr. President, that is what the 18E/F gives us. It gives us that technological superiority. It gives us the ability to make sure we have the best chance possible of bringing our naval aviators home safely, having accomplished their mission. 
The F/A-18E/F has already been scrutinized in the Quadrennial Defense Review. It has been scrutinized by the National Defense Panel. It has undergone GAO study after GAO study. It has been tested by pilots at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station and the Naval Air Weapons Station, China Lake. It has accumulated 2,749 test flight hours, over 1,800 flights, and numerous aircraft carrier landings. It has never had a catastrophic failure. I wish other tactical air programs could meet these standards. It has test fired just about every weapon the Navy might need it to carry. It is on time, it is on budget, and it needs to get underway. 
I ask my colleagues, if they have any question about the value of this plane, ask somebody who flies one. Ask somebody who has had the opportunity to fly it. Ask somebody who we are sending in harm's way, asking them to fly a fighter and attack aircraft off a carrier, ask them how important they think the F/A-18E/F is to their ability to carry out their mission and to come home safely. If you will ask the naval aviators, whose lives are on the line, I have no question what their response is going to be. I have heard it myself. Any of my colleagues who wish to contact somebody they know in naval aviation or in the Navy itself, I believe they will tell you it is the No. 1 priority. 
Mr. President, this is simply a bad amendment, and I sincerely hope that my colleagues will vote overwhelmingly with the chairman of the committee and the ranking member to table this unwise amendment. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act along with my colleagues Senators Bennett and Snowe. This bill provides small businesses with the resources necessary to repair Year 2000 computer problems. This legislation is an important step toward avoiding the widespread failure of small businesses. 
The problem, as many Senators are aware, is that certain computers and processors in automated systems will fail because such systems will not recognize the Year 2000. My colleague Senator Bennett, who is the Chairman of the Senate Special Year 2000 Technology Problem Committee and is co-sponsoring this bill, is very well versed in this problem and has been active in getting the word out to industries and to agencies of the federal government of the drastic consequences that may result from the Y2K problem. 
Recently, the Committee on Small Business, which I chair, held hearings on the effect the Y2K problem will have on small businesses. The outlook is not good. The Committee received testimony that the companies most at risk from Y2K failures are small and medium-sized industries, not larger companies. The major reasons for this anomaly is that many small companies have not begun to realize how much of a problem Y2K failures will be and may not have the access to capital to cure such problems before they cause disastrous effects. 
A study on Small Business and the Y2K Problem sponsored by Wells Fargo Bank and the NFIB found that an estimated four and three-quarter million small employers are exposed to the Y2K problem. This equals approximately 82 percent of all small businesses that have at least two employees. Such exposure to the Y2K problem will have devastating affects on our economy generally. As the result of communications with small businesses, computer manufacturers, consultants and groups, the Small Business Committee has found there is significant likelihood that the Y2K issue will cause many small businesses to close, playing a large role in Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan's prediction of a 40 percent chance for recession at the beginning of the new millennium. 
The Committee received information indicating that approximately 330,000 small businesses will shut down due to the Y2K problem and an even larger number will be severely crippled. Such failures will affect not only the employees and owners of such small businesses, but also the creditors, suppliers and customers of such failed small businesses. Lenders, including banks and non-bank lenders, that have extended credit to small businesses will face significant losses if small businesses either go out of business or have a sustained period in which they cannot operate. 
It must be remembered that the Y2K problem is not a problem for only those businesses that have large computer networks or mainframes. A small business is at risk if it uses any computers in its business, if it has customized software, if it is conducting e-commerce, if it accepts credit card payments, if it uses a service bureau for its payroll, if it depends on a data bank for information, if it has automated equipment for communicating with its sales or service force of if it has automated manufacturing equipment. 
A good example of how small businesses are dramatically affected by the Y2K problem is the experience of John Healy, the owner of Coventry Spares Ltd. in Holliston, Massachusetts, as reported in INC Magazine. Coventry Spares is a distributor of vintage motorcycle parts. Like many small business owners, Mr. Healy's business depends on trailing technology purchased over the years, including a 286 computer, with software that is 14 years old and an operating system that is six or seven versions out of date. Mr. Healy uses this computer equipment, among other matters, for handling the company's payroll, ordering, inventory control, product lookup and maintaining a database of customers and subscribers to a vintage motorcycle 
magazine he publishes. The system handles 85 percent of his business and, without it working properly, Mr. Healy stated that `I'd be a dead duck in the water.' Unlike many small business owners, however, Mr. Healy is aware of the Y2K problem and tested his equipment to see if his equipment could handle the Year 2000. His tests confirmed his fear--the equipment and software could not process the year 2000 date and would not work properly after December 21, 1999. Therefore, Mr. Healy will have to expand over $20,000 to keep his business afloat. The experience of Mr. Healy has been and will continue to be repeated across the country as small businesses realize the impact the Y2K problem will have on their business. 
The Gartner Group, an international computer consulting firm, has conducted studies showing small businesses are way behind--the worst of all sectors studied--where they need to be in order to avoid significant failures due to non-Y2K compliance. It estimates that only 15 percent of all businesses with under 200 employees have even begun to inventory the automated systems that may be affected by this computer glitch. That means that 85 percent of small businesses have not be even begun the initial task of determining how much of a problem they may have or taken steps to ensure that their businesses are not impaired by this problem. 
Given the effects a substantial number of small business failures will have on our nation's economy, it is imperative that Congress take steps to ensure that small businesses are aware of the Y2K problem and have access to capital to fix such problems. Moreover, it is imperative that Congress take such steps before the problem occurs, not after it has already happened. Therefore, today I am introducing the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act. 
This Act will serve the dual purpose of providing small businesses with the means to continue operating successfully after January 1, 2000, and making lenders and small firms more aware of the dangers that lie ahead. The Act requires the Small Business Administration to establish a limited-term loan program whereby SBA would guarantee 50 percent of the principal amount of a loan made by a private lender to assist small businesses in correcting Year 2000 computer problems. The loan amount would be capped at $50,000. The guarantee limit and loan amount will limit the exposure of the government and ensure that eligible lenders retain sufficient risk so that they make sound underwriting decisions. 
The Y2K loan program guidelines will be based on the guidelines SBA has already established governing its FA$TRACK pilot program. Lenders originating loans under the Y2K loan program would be permitted to process and document loans using the same internal procedures they would on loans of a similar type and size not governed by a government guarantee. Otherwise, the loans are subject to the same requirements as all other loans made under the (7)(a) loan program. 
Under the loan program, each lender designated as a Preferred Lender or Certified Lender by SBA would be eligible to participate in the Y2K loan program. This would include approximately 1,000 lenders that have received special authority from the SBA to originate loans under SBA's existing 7(a) loan program. The Year 2000 loan program would sunset after October 31, 2001. 
To assure that the loan program is made available to those small businesses that need it, the legislation requires SBA to inform all lenders eligible to participate in the program of the loan program's availability. It is intended that these lenders, in their own self-interest, will contact their small business customers to ensure that they are Y2K complaint and inform them of the loan program if they are not. 
The Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act is a necessary step to ensure that the economic health of this country is not marred by a substantial number of small business failures following January 1, 2000, and that small businesses continue to be the fastest growing segment of our economy in the Year 2000 and beyond.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Louis Taylor who has provided great service to the Committee on Small Business, the U.S. Senate and to me personally. Louis Taylor is stepping down this week as Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the Senate Committee on Small Business. When I became chairman of the Committee on Small Business in January 1995, one of my first actions was to hire Louis. For the past 3 1/2 years, Louis has provided outstanding leadership to the staff on the Committee on Small Business and he has been instrumental in support of my efforts to transform the committee so that it is the eyes, ears, and voice in the U.S. Senate for small businesses. 
In his tenure on the Committee on Small Business, Louis Taylor played a significant role in crafting important pieces of legislation to help small businesses. Two such legislative accomplishments stand out among the numerous bills that originated from the Committee on Small Business and were enacted into law--the HUBZone Act of 1997 and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, also known as the Red-Tape Reduction Act. The HUBZone program expands the opportunity for small businesses in economically distressed areas to compete for Federal contracts, bringing jobs and new investments to inner cities and poor rural areas. The Red-Tape Reduction Act established safeguards to improve the Government's regulatory fairness to small businesses and established an independent ombudsman and regional citizen review boards to give small businesses a voice in evaluating Federal agency actions. Without Louis Taylor's contributions, the ultimate enactment of these important statutes would surely have been much more difficult. 
In addition to these impressive legislative achievements, Louis Taylor played an integral role in ensuring that the Committee on Small Business capitalized on its expansive oversight jurisdiction to be a strong advocate for small business in the U.S. Senate. On those issues where the committee did not have legislative jurisdiction, Louis Taylor helped me guide the committee in its efforts to call attention to the impact such issues have on small business. For example, using its oversight jurisdiction, the committee was successful in including a number of small business provisions in the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, which was signed into law last week. These changes to the structure of the IRS and improved taxpayer rights will help small business owners to resolve tax problems more efficiently while providing them with the service and respect that they deserve from the agency. The committee has also been extremely active in ensuring regulatory fairness for small businesses and women-owned businesses, in particular. Perhaps the provision that will have the broadest impact, however, is the provision of 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed and their families. This measure ultimately will make health insurance more affordable for 5 million Americans who do not carry it now. 
In conclusion, the entire committee and I certainly will miss Louis Taylor as he moves on to other endeavors, but the contributions that he has made and the leadership he has given to the Committee on Small Business are greatly appreciated and will not be soon forgotten.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the `Medicare Home Health Beneficiary Protection Act of 1998' on behalf of myself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Faircloth, and Mr. Cochran. 
I have long believed that home care is the key to fulfilling the desire of virtually all seniors and those with disabilities to remain independent and within the comfort of their own homes. Home care is also often the only source of care for many disabled individuals and frail elderly, especially those living in underserved rural and urban areas of our country. 
Today, however, home health care is facing a crisis. 
In an effort to reduce Medicare home health expenditures and fraud and abuse, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 replaces cost-based reimbursement for home health services with a Prospective Payment System (PPS), effective October 1, 1999. In the meantime, Congress, at the recommendation of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), imposed an Interim Payment System (IPS), or new per beneficiary caps on home health agencies. 
There is no question that transitioning home health into a PPS is needed to ensure that all home health providers are cost-effective in the deliverance of services. But is also quite clear that the current IPS, coupled with HCFA's interpretation of the surety bond statute, is threatening access to these invaluable services throughout our nation. Quite simply, the IPS is fatally flawed and works tremendous injustice and hardship. 
In my home State of Missouri, reputable home health agencies provide high quality care to over 124,000 seniors and disabled are facing a crisis. I support making the deliverance of services more efficient and rooting out bad actors in the Medicare home health program, but I am deeply concerned about a punitive IPS which is driving scrupulous, quality providers out of business. In Missouri alone, over 35 home health agencies have shut their doors since enactment of the BBA of 1997. Nationwide, over 1000 home health providers have closed or stopped accepting Medicare patients. 
In St. Louis, the two largest, freestanding home health providers closed their doors this year--leaving hundreds of elderly and disabled patients searching for a new provider. The Visiting Nurse Association of St. Louis which served the St. Louis area for 87 years eliminated all of their Medicare home health services as of May, forcing over 600 patients to find a new source of care. 
It is imperative that Congress act now to impose a moratorium on the IPS. My bill not only accomplishes this equitable goal, but it also puts pressure on HCFA to move expeditiously towards the establishment of PPS for home care. 
I have written a letter to Secretary Shalala outlining the concerns and outlining the serious situation and I have asked she move expeditiously on this. 
A study conducted by The George Washington University Medical Center, Center for Health Policy Research, entitled `Medicare Home Health Services: An Analysis of the Implications of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 for Access and Quality', confirms why Congress must take expedited action in removing the IPS. 
Summarizing, the study concluded that: 
The home care population represents an increasingly sicker population requiring more acute management of chronic illness and higher intensity acute care; 
The BBA's reductions in Medicare home health coverage and financing can be expected to affect the sickest and highest cost patients and punish the very agencies that specialize in the provision of care to this population; 
The most severe effects of the interim payment system fall on the sickest patients living in states with the lowest utilization patterns; 
The BBA's interim payment system will shift costs to other payers (notably Medicaid) while rewarding inefficient agencies who care for relatively healthier patients; and 
The interim payment system will make it more difficult to design and implement the permanent prospective payment system scheduled to become effective in FY 2000. 
To those, I might add, Mr. President, when you take a look at cost when you force people out of home health care if they are Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, you are going to wind up putting them in institutions where the cost will be significantly greater and the benefits to the individuals served and to the communities will be far less. 
This is false economy and it is causing a real crisis in communities throughout our country. 
So not only are beneficiaries and providers of home health alerting us to the devastation of this system, but outside experts are also telling us why we must revisit this issue. 
Reducing Medicare's growth rate is a worthy and much needed goal; however, doing it in such a way that threatens access to critical home health services is downright unconscionable. Truly reforming Medicare means more than simply ratcheting down payments to providers and services to beneficiaries. While this approach is the short-term solution, it has serious consequences for many vulnerable patients and honest providers. 
Mr. President, I want to conclude my remarks by recognizing the efforts of my distinguished colleague from Iowa and Chairman of the Senate Committee on Aging, Senator Chuck Grassley, who first highlighted the devastating impact of the IPS and HCFA's surety bond rule on Medicare beneficiaries and home health providers. I thank him for his dedication and leadership and look forward to working with him to rectify this problem.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ozanam in Kansas City, Missouri for its service to the community. For fifty years, Ozanam has been helping children and families in turmoil. Ozanam facility and staff help children reach their full potential and become productive members of society. 
Ozanam began in the home of Mr. Al Allen, a Catholic Welfare Staff member, who after noticing the lack of help for emotionally disturbed adolescents, took it upon himself to bring six boys into his own home to give them long-term care, education and guidance. However, in just a year's short time, the need for a larger facility became apparent. Presently, the agency occupies 95 acres including two dormitories, a campus group home, a special education center that contains vocational training classrooms, indoor and outdoor recreation facilities and a spiritual life center. 
During its existence, Ozanam has had some outstanding staff and administration to help the more than 4,000 children who have stayed there. Paul Gemeinhardt, President, Judith Hart, Senior Vice President of Development and Doug Zimmerman, Senior Vice President of Agency Operations, deserve special recognition for their undying commitment and service to Ozanam. 
I commend the staff of Ozanam for their untiring dedication to helping children and their families in their time of need. I join the many in Missouri who thank Ozanam for its good work and continuing efforts to better the community. Congratulations for fifty years of service.

Mr. BOND. I agree with my colleagues Senator Connie Mack and Senator Alfonse D'Amato, in urging HUD to reinstate a fair and adequate time period for public review of these important new rules. In fact, it was my amendment in 1996 which halted HUD's attempt to remove the important public notice and comment provisions of the rulemaking procedure. 
On August 16, 1996, HUD issued a regulation entitled, `Rulemaking Policies and Procedures; Proposed Removal of Part 10.' The Fiscal Year 1997 VA-HUD Appropriations Act included my amendment to safeguard the notice and comment procedure contained in the Part 10 regulation. Last year, the VA-HUD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1998 contained a provision which in practical effect makes the notice and comment procedure part of the permanent law. 
While HUD can provide for good cause waivers of the sixty-day comment period, the regulation states that such waivers should only be made when the procedure is `impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest.' I do not believe that HUD has met any component of this threshold in this instance. 
HUD's current public rulemaking procedure were not adopted by accident. In fact, they were adopted in an effort to respond to past program abuses and were considered an essential component of HUD reform. Given HUD's ongoing systemic management difficulties, it is incumbent upon HUD to abide by the rules of public notice and comment rulemaking. Waivers of public notice requirements will not contribute to the much-needed reform of HUD's management problems. Public participation and input are critical aspects to avoiding unintended consequences in the rulemaking process. 
HUD's new proposed rules have followed soon after a series of massive `Super-NOFA's,' or Notices of Funding Availability which announce the availability and competition for dozens of HUD grant programs. Many local government agencies and community-based housing organizations are still in the process of finalizing their applications for these important HUD programs. Most organizations--including local public housing authorities, community-based non-profit corporations and resident organizations--have limited capacity to wade through and analyze HUD's new proposed regulations, in addition to applying for funding. HUD's decision to unilaterally waive the sixty-day comment period compounds this problematic situation. 
I therefore join my colleagues in strongly urging HUD to extend the review and comment period for the proposed rules issued on June 30, 1998.

Mr. BOND. Madam President--I would like to take some time to talk about the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Revolving Loan Funds. 
First, let me say that the Clean Water Act has been one of our most successful environmental statues. Our success is measurable and indisputable. We must ensure that the progress made continues. 
Enacted in 1972--we have seen impressive gains in our water quality protection. 
Most of us are familiar with the Cuyahoga River fires. We are all familiar with rivers and streams that we couldn't let our kids swim or fish in. 
Here in Washington, Lyndon Johnson called the Potomac River a `national disgrace'. 
The Clean Water Act, and more importantly, with the cooperation and dedication of the American people and industry, the majority of our rivers, lakes, and streams are fishable and swimmable. 
But, we still have a ways to go. 
Why? 
One reason is that statistics show that beaches, rivers, and lakes are the number one vocation choice for Americans. Whether people go to swim, boat, or one of my favorite past-times--fish, keeping our rivers, lakes, beaches, and streams clean is imperative for public health, the environment and the economy. 
In addition, it has already been `shown' that improving the water quality of the Potomac, or the Lehigh in Pennsylvania, or the Shenandoah in West Virginia is not just an environmental and public health success, but an economic one as well. 
According to EPA's 1999 Annual Plan Request, `Safe drinking water is the first line of defense in protecting human health.' In addition, `Safe drinking water is essential to human health and contaminated drinking water can cause illness and even death, and exposure to contaminated drinking water poses a special risk to such populations as children and the elderly.' 
Today, we have close to 58,000 community water systems that are providing drinking water for 80 million households. 
According to statistics this country has over 3.5 million miles of rivers and streams, 41 million acres of lakes, and 58,000 miles of ocean shoreline. 
Cleaning up our nation's wastewater and assuring safe drinking water should be, must be, at the top of our environmental priority list. 
Putting our resources to work where the risks are known and the benefits--both environmental and public health--are real and tangible! Setting priorities and making progress. Protecting public health and the environment. Investing our taxpayer dollars the right way. That is what investing in our water infrastructure is about. 
Mr. President, despite the fact that the Administration has claimed clean water as a top priority, the President proposed a reduction of $275 million in the Clean Water and Drinking Water Revolving Loan Funds for fiscal year 1999. 
As Chairman of this Subcommittee, I have made a priority of state revolving funds for water infrastructure financing--providing over $6 billion for SRFs since becoming chairman. 
I know. Senator Mikulski knows. More importantly, this Congress has `shown' that the state revolving funds are critical for ensuring the nation's water is protected and safe drinking water is provided to commities across the country. 
The state revolving funds stretch the federal dollar significantly through leveraging and cost-sharing features, helping to meet the very large need for water infrastructure financing. 
The $14.3 billion federal investment into the clean water SRF has generated an additional $11.4 billion for wastewater projects, including $8.7 billion in net 
leveraged bond proceeds. This loan pool of $25 billion has resulted in almost 6,000 project loans! This is a very substantial and gratifying return on the federal investment. 
According to EPA, the SRF program buys up to 4 times more environmental protection for the federal dollar than traditional one-time grants over a 20-year period. 
EPA has identified the national need for infrastructure financing at over $130 billion just in the wastewater area alone. EPA has identified over $135 billion in drinking water infrastructure needs. 
Mr. President--there are two glaring reasons of why investment in our water infrastructure is imperative. 
First are tuberculated drinking water pipes. 
Let me give you the definition of `tubercle.' Tubercle is a `small, rounded prominence or process, such as a wartlike excrescence on the roots of some leguminous plants.' In other words, there is something growing. 
Too many drinking water pipes providing water to communities--water that comes out of your faucet in your kitchen sink and bathtub--are tuberculated. But it is rare that anyone ever thinks about it. 
Too often no thought is given to the pipes until we become sick or there is an outbreak in the community. 
The second reason is a sanitary sewer overflow. 
A sanitary sewer overflow is a release of raw sewage often into lakes, rivers, and streams. 
We still have instances of raw sewerage overflowing into our lakes. As I mentioned earlier, EPA has estimated over $130 billion in wastewater needs. Continued improvements to our wastewater infrastructure will help us conquer the problem. 
For example, according to the EPA, improved sewage treatment is recognized as the single biggest factor in the Potomac River's restoration. 
Our wastewater infrastructure, like our drinking water infrastructure, is out of sight. We forget that in some cases we have century-old facilities. All too often, we have facilities that have not been able to keep in step with the population growth and treatment needs. 
Like our nation's highways, in many areas our water infrastructure has well exceeded its design life. Add to the expired design life, increased capacity and increased federal and state regulatory requirements and we have a potentially disastrous situation. 
I was reading a brochure about clean water given to me by the National Utility Contractors and came across the following:  
Before you build homes, establish businesses, or pave the streets, a dependable wastewater treatment system must be in place. 
Way too often we tend to forget this basic fact. 
Mr. President, I have made, and will continue to make, a commitment in protecting our nation's water. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the House and Senate to ensure that our progress continues in protecting public health and that real environmental gains and progress are made.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion over the past year on the Kyoto Protocol and concerns about efforts to implement its requirements prior to Senate ratification. 
We may disagree about whether or not the global climate is warming--and there certainly is no scientific consensus on the matter. But regardless of the scientific uncertainties and the differing views on the issue, one thing is certain: the level of greenhouse gas reductions called for in the Kyoto Protocol have the very real potential of inflicting serious economic harm on the U.S. economy. 
The agreement reached last December in Kyoto would, according to numerous studies, lead to significant job less and substantial lifestyle changes for Americans. Energy prices could rise dramatically. One study by Charles River Associates and DRI/McGraw-Hill, for example, projected that in my state, industrial electricity prices could increase 54.4 percent. 
Mr. President, this kind of increase in electricity prices would be devastating to small businesses, farmers, large manufacturers who employ thousands, and individual consumers, including those with limited incomes who would be hardest hit. 
From the numerous studies that have been done to determine the effects of implementing the Kyoto Protocol, we know that we could expect a serious economic disruption. What is not so clear is whether there is a global climate change problem, and if so, how significant it is and what is its cause. 
Therefore, I believe we must continue the debate and try to gain a better understanding of climate change and what action might be needed. To do so, we must continue funding of research and technology development. We must continue to support the voluntary efforts that many companies have undertaken to reduce greenhouse gases. And we must continue to support energy efficiency programs. 
What we should not do at this time is to begin to implement the reduction requirements called for in the Kyoto Protocol. That should not happen until there has been a full debate and until this body has given its advice and consent to ratify the Protocol. 
The Administration has assured Congress that it is not their intent to implement the Kyoto requirements in the absence of Senate ratification. Those assurances are appreciated. There is evidence, however, that efforts are underway to begin to implement the Kyoto requirements prematurely. 
This is a concern because, as I said earlier, there is a potential for serious economic harm if the Protocol is implemented. Until we have eliminated the uncertainties surrounding climate change, and until we have had a full, open debate on the issue and appropriate responses, we should not embark on a path that could lead us into economic disarray. Implementation before ratification is not the responsible--nor constitutional--way to go. 
That is why the Senate Appropriations Committee included in the VA/HUD report language clarifying that no funds should be used to implement the Kyoto Protocol. We must continue to provide for research efforts and other important programs that make sense, such as energy efficiency and voluntary initiatives, but we should not begin to spend funds for a Protocol that has not yet been determined to be in the best interests of our country.

Mr. BOND. The bill allows HUD to direct 25% of the funds allocated for the HUD Section 811 toward tenant-based rental assistance for people with disabilities--$48.5 million. Congress has allowed HUD to transfer these funds for `mainstream' vouchers and certificates in both FY 1997 and FY 1998. In addition, the bill grants HUD specific waiver authority with respect to existing programmatic requirements under Section 811. This limited waiver authority is intended to assist HUD in furthering the overall goals of the 811 program by increasing housing opportunities for persons with the most severe disabilities.

Mr. BOND. I agree. As my colleague knows, non-profit organizations that traditionally serve persons with severe mental and physical disabilities are a critical part of the success of the section 811 program. Any federal programs intended to meet the housing needs of people with mental and physical disabilities should draw in the expertise of organizations that have experience in providing supports and services to adults with severe disabilities. By contrast, the current `mainstream' voucher and certificate program does not currently consider this very important issue in the allocation of certificates and vouchers. Housing authorities should be encouraged to increase their coordination with non-profit organizations and the awarding of the vouchers and certificates should be based, in part, on that factor.

Mr. BOND. Madam President, I express appreciation to the leadership on both sides--the majority leader and the minority leader--for enabling us to get back on this bill and move it through. I thank all Senators for their accommodations and for working with us to get a very challenging and interesting bill finished. 
I express particular appreciation to Senator Mikulski. She has been an absolutely invaluable ally in making accommodations and working out reasonable agreements on this bill. Last night she said her clear, cogent, and charismatic comments, which helped us move the bill forward in an expeditious fashion. 
I express thanks to her very able staff, Andy Givens, David Bowers, and Bertha Lopez. 
I thank my staff, John Kamarck and Carolyn Apostolou, as well as members of my personal staff who helped on the bill. We look forward to taking this measure to conference and working on it in the most efficient and effective way possible. I appreciate the assistance of all those who stayed with us last night. Their sense of humor continued into the small hours of the morning, and I am most grateful for that. 
Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment would provide, within the $17.2 billion medical care appropriation, $20 million for VA's homeless grant and per diem program. The amendment would make these funds available for vocational training, outreach, shelter, and other important activities to aid homeless veterans in a comprehensive manner. 
This should help meet the needs of the 275,000 veterans who are estimated to be homeless on any given night of the year. Together with funds already included in the bill, we will have provided $100 million in VA homeless assistance. This is a critical need. I commend the other Senators who worked on supporting this.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska presents a very compelling case. As a Senator interested in that area, I can see the importance of the case he makes. The problem is, this deals with a subject matter over which this subcommittee does not have primary jurisdiction, and therefore I would have to say, No. 1, I cannot comment on or respond properly to the views of the appropriate appropriations subcommittee, nor could I respond to the questions that might be raised by the authorizing committee. 
The Senator has advised us that we do not have the scoring from CBO. He has assured us it will be minimal. Frankly, this bill is very close to our limits, and if the scoring turns out to push us over the allocations, we will have to raise a Budget Act point of order. 
So I urge the Senator to talk with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee--the chairman and ranking member, and the chairman and ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee, and seek their counsel on it. We will be happy to have a vote on it or to deal with it tomorrow. While it does involve veterans, the subject matter is not one which is within the expertise of this subcommittee, and we do need to hear from the other appropriations subcommittees and the authorizing committee on it.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is always good to see our former colleague on the VA-HUD committee come to the floor to talk about the difficult issues. We certainly appreciate his kind comments. 
The VA-HUD-Independent Agencies is a very challenging and interesting area. He raised the question about the increase in spending; and to explain that will perhaps give my colleagues some idea why this is such a complex area. 
The total spending includes--total spending is about $93 billion--includes $22 billion in mandatory spending for veterans administration categories. That is about a $4 billion increase over fiscal year 1998. The increase is attributable largely to the following--about a $1.5 billion increase in veterans administration, primarily mandatory spending, things over which our subcommittee has no control. 
In addition, there is, HUD figures, about $2.6 billion over last year's figure. And that is because money was taken from section 8 contracts earlier in the year to pay for a supplemental. This is the budget that is always raided. And the broader Appropriations Committee has raided these section 8 contracts. That would be good except for the fact that the cost of renewing section 8 contracts in HUD continues to escalate. 
In fiscal year 1997, we needed $3.6 billion in budget authority to renew existing section 8 contracts. Because we had moved to shorter and shorter term contracts, from multiyear contracts down to 2-year and 1-year contracts, it then shot up to $8.2 billion in budget authority for fiscal year 1998, the current year; and it jumps to $11.1 billion in fiscal year 1999. That is the result of the length of the contracts. 
But it means, in order to continue providing the same assistance we do currently under section 8, we have to have about $2.9 billion more in budget authority for fiscal year 1999 than we did for fiscal year 1998. If you say we do not want to increase it, it means, in essence, that we are going to have to take away section 8 housing contracts and kick people out. That is just a simple choice. 
I must oppose the amendment of my good friend from Oklahoma to strike the increase in FHA mortgage insurance limits for high-cost areas and to offset that with an increase of 6 basis points to the fees that Ginnie Mae charges for servicing costs. 
The first point we need to make is that the FHA mortgage insurance increase is a bipartisan proposal, a bipartisan congressional proposal, that enjoys wide support from both Republicans and Democrats in this body. I do not see this modest increase as growing government. Rather, the FHA mortgage increase represents an approach to fill a gap that allows Americans of modest means--moderate-income Americans--to own their own homes, one of the great American dreams for all families. 
The FHA was established in 1934 as a result of nearly impossible lending conditions during the Great Depression, and in over 60 years the public-private partnership of FHA and private lenders has enabled more than 25 million families to realize the dream of home ownership. Moreover, the FHA Mortgage Insurance Program supplements and complements the role of private mortgage insurance by assisting families who do not have adequate resources to meet the private mortgage markets' downpayment requirement, which is often 20 percent of the mortgage amount. 
While the private mortgage insurance market has made tremendous strides in providing new products to assist families in purchasing homes, many families would be unable to purchase their home without the benefit of FHA mortgage insurance. In brief, the Senate VA-HUD fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill provides modest increases in the FHA mortgage insurance limits, raising the floor from 38 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit, or about $86,000, to 48 percent of the conforming loan limit, or some $109,000. It establishes a new ceiling for high-cost areas from the existing 75 percent of the conforming loan limit, or some $170,000, to 87 percent of the conforming loan limit, or some $197,000. 
And let me indicate where these higher loan limits would be implemented. Right now--this is a chart which shows the United States. The colors of the chart indicate where the low rate, the base limit, is in place. These are the areas in blue. This is where the base lending rate would go from $86,000 to roughly $109,000. 
The green areas on here are 95 percent of the local median. 
The high-low rate, the one which is being challenged in this amendment which is raised to $197,000, would be in these few red areas on the East Coast--essentially, Boston, New York, Washington, DC area, Denver, CO, and California along the coastline. The rest of the country is not affected by the increases in the higher-end loan limit. 
I think the legislation seeks to strike a reasonable balance to promote additional home ownership and would allow home ownership for some 30,000 families, 20,000 in high-cost areas and 10,000 basically nonurban areas. In particular, these new FHA mortgage insurance limits will help in nonurban areas where the price of new housing has escalated beyond the capacity of first-time home buyers to use FHA mortgage insurance to buy a house in some areas because the FHA lower-limits financing is not available for construction of first homes for families of workers with lower wages. 
The problem is that the existing FHA mortgage insurance limits do not reflect the higher cost of new homes. New homes cost more than existing homes because of the cost of materials and labor. In addition, there are many other expenses. For example, the cost to develop new housing subdivisions is expensive because of the cost of utility hookups, environmental requirements, local taxes and surcharges for things like schools, roads, fire protection, as well as the cost of buildable land. Currently, the median price for a new home is $142,000, while the median price for an existing home is $126,500, for a $15,500 difference. 
Now, this difference is very important for Missouri as well as the rest of the Nation. Home ownership in housing construction has been and always will be a locomotive for the U.S. economy. In addition to the jobs created through the development of new housing, many nonurban areas in particular will be able to provide the affordable housing that is so critical to attracting new business and to maintaining existing businesses. 
I have talked with people in areas just outside the metropolitan Kansas, MO area, in areas of north Missouri, where they are benefiting from new jobs coming into the area but they are strangled because the new jobs bring in people who can't get housing. They can't get affordable housing. This is one of the critical needs for people in those areas so that they can continue to create jobs and see their communities grow. They need to have affordable housing. I am hoping that the raising of the lower limit will enable them to get FHA financing and build new homes. 
Now, I don't want to confuse anyone. As I said, Senator Nickles' amendment does not seek to reduce the increase to the FHA mortgage insurance floor, the one I was just talking about, as provided in the VA-HUD 1999 appropriations bill. Senator Nickles' concern, as well as those of his colleagues, is that the proposed new mortgage insurance limit of $197,000 for high-cost areas is too high. In particular, in a `Dear Colleague' letter, Senators Nickles, Mack, Allard, Kohl, and Feingold state that to qualify for a mortgage of $197,000, a family would need an income of at least $75,000. Well, $197,000 is a lot of money for a house. That cost, however, is the reality in many areas and it needs to be addressed. 
In addition, I think it is fair to say that $75,000 is not an extraordinary amount of income for a family. For example, it means that a two-income family, a schoolteacher and a firefighter, will be able to live in a community in which they serve. This is important. I do not think we should lose sight of the importance of mixed-income communities while providing opportunities for home ownership. 
Moreover, as part of Secretary Kemp's FHA reform initiative as enacted in the National Affordable Housing Act, Price Waterhouse conducts an actuarial review of the FHA Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund on an annual basis. From the perspective of actuarial soundness, NAHA mandated a fund to achieve a capital ratio of at least 2 percent by fiscal year 2000. However, the fund reached a capital ratio of 2.81 percent in fiscal year 1997 and is expected to reach 3.21 percent by fiscal year 2000. Moreover, the projected economic value of the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund was $11.3 billion at the end of fiscal year 1997. This represents a more than $14 billion increase in the value of the fund since Secretary Kemp's reforms in 1990, when it was a negative $2.7 billion. 
In addition, the FHA Single Family Mortgage Insurance Program is self-sustaining, has not cost the American taxpayer any money in its entire existence. Insurance premiums and loan loss recovery proceeds pay for all costs incurred in the administration of the program, leaving sufficient reserves from an actuarial perspective to pay all future claims. 
I note that Senators Nickles, Mack, and Faircloth have developed a number of very worthwhile reforms to the FHA mortgage insurance program which have been agreed to and will be included in the next managers' amendment. As with my colleagues, I remain concerned over HUD's capacity to administer its many programs, including its FHA mortgage insurance programs. These FHA management reforms would require that each 
lender provide a comparison of FHA mortgage funding with three of a lender's most frequently employed mortgage loan structures, an annual study by GAO on steering by lenders to FHA, and a requirement that HUD submit an initial report within 60 days annually on how HUD plans to correct mortgage problems in the FHA Single Family Mortgage Insurance Program. 
Finally, I have concerns about any changes to the Ginnie Mae servicing structure. I have been advised that any change in the servicing fee will likely result in increased home ownership costs to families, with estimates that it could cost consumers some $250 million per year and price some 15,000 home buyers out of the market each year. 
I have a letter from a significant group of veterans organizations that I will place at the end of my statement for the Record from the AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Non Commissioned Officers Association, Blind Veterans Association, and Paralyzed Veterans of America, saying that any increase in Ginnie Mae fees will result in an added cost to lenders which will invariably be passed on to VA loan recipients. We estimate that even just a 6-basis-point increase in the Ginnie Mae guarantee fee will cost VA borrowers over $67 million annually, with a typical veteran paying over $250 in upfront closing costs. With the veterans already struggling to afford their first homes, this cost increase would be devastating. 
I expect the argument of my colleagues will be that lenders currently receive a fee for servicing FHA-insured mortgages of 38 basis points, almost double the fee that lenders receive for servicing loans in the private sector. For example, as opposed to the 38 basis points lenders receive in service fees under FHA, lenders receive between 20 and 25 basis points for servicing fees associated with conventional mortgages guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Nevertheless, Ginnie Mae operates significantly different from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, particularly when Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac take on the responsibility that all security holders receive their payments, whereas the servicer is responsible for the pass-through on a Ginnie Mae security, and where a servicer fails, it is no longer permitted to participate in a Ginnie Mae program. That is a significant responsibility and merits additional fees. 
I send this letter of July 14 to the desk. It happens to be addressed to the distinguished occupant of the Chair. This is a letter from AMVETS, Disabled Veterans, Non Commissioned Officers, Blind Veterans, and the Association of Paralyzed Veterans of America.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Rhode Island because there is no question about the dangers of lead-based paint, what hazards they present. This is a critical program. The program is funded at $60 million. The Senator's amendment will increase it to $70 million. 
There is a great need to reduce lead-based paint hazards for children. As the Senator has pointed out, some of the statistics of lead-based paint and the dangers in some of our more mature urban areas is really frightening. I believe the figures are that there are some $3 billion in housing rehabilitation needs existing out there to address all of the lead-based paint problems in the country. 
It is our desire to accept the amendment on this side. The funding will be taken from the overall CDBG funding of $4.75 billion, which is $75 million over last year's level. We are willing to accept it on this side.

Obviously, the Senator can seek the floor later on if he has not finished. 
If he has finished with his argument, I am happy to respond briefly. 
The chairman and/or ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee will be here tomorrow to express their opposition, and I will print in the Record tonight the letter from the Environmental Protection Agency which says the EPA is strongly opposed to this amendment. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Senator has some compelling arguments. I sympathize with his frustration, but the EPA said, `We believe it is unnecessary, inconsistent with the policy requirements of the 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act and harmful to the protection of the public health.' He goes on to cite articles. He does state that, `The State of Nebraska has yet to avail itself of several opportunities for substantial flexibility and assistance described herein,' and the EPA Assistant Administrator, Robert Perciasepe, has offered to go to Nebraska and show up in Hastings. I think my colleague from Maryland and I will urge him in the strongest possible terms to coordinate his schedule with yours and go to Hastings and other towns to answer. 
But the fact of the matter is that there is a strong objection by the EPA to this. That objection is supported by the members of the authorizing committee. In our appropriations measures, we have not, we do not, and we will not take authorizing measures or legislative matters which are strongly opposed by the authorizing committee. We believe as a courtesy to the committees of jurisdiction that we should not do it. We have not done it and we don't intend to do it.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I might ask the Senator from Nebraska. He obviously has made some very compelling points. It is noted there are Senators who are waiting to offer amendments. If he would be willing to do so, I would like to finish up the work of the Senators who are waiting, and I will move to table the amendment, and then I will offer to go back in morning business and afford the Senator from Nebraska as much time as he wishes, 
because we have heard the compelling arguments--the situation is very clearly that with the authorizing committees opposing this, the agency opposing it, it is our policy not to accept these amendments on an appropriations bill. His arguments are made with a great deal of passion and common sense, but they are not going to be accepted, and he will have an opportunity to appeal to our colleagues in a colloquy or in discussions later this evening, or in the 1 minute tomorrow. Would that be acceptable to the Senator from Nebraska?

Mr. BOND. If the Senator from Nebraska would yield, we are willing to try to be as helpful as we possibly can. I have outlined for him the position in which we find ourselves. We are not going to be able to accept the amendment that is proposed. We have gone through that. The EPA has filed a letter that is now on the record objecting to it. That is not going to change. 
The Senator can speak as long as he wishes. But he is not going to change that position from my standpoint. 
If the Senator is willing to work with us--we can't do report language here. We can do report language in the committee and attempt to work with him on getting report language and seeing what we can encourage the authorizing committee to do. I have said we would be willing to ask the EPA Administrator to go out there. We don't direct and we cannot control the EPA. I think that is clear. You know what the political situation is. 
Frankly, continuing to talk on the floor tonight when others are waiting to offer amendments is not going to encourage us to work with the Senator from Nebraska on the very compelling problem he has. But we would be willing to help him. But talking about it on the floor at greater length is not going to further the process of cooperation and assist us in working out report language or some alternative means by which we can encourage the EPA to come to an agreement with the State of Nebraska.

Mr. BOND. I thought we tried to emphasize, we are willing to do anything we can the next opportunity we have. We have already stated on the floor that we would urge the assistant administrator to come out. He has talked in his letter about flexibility being available for the State of Nebraska. The EPA contends that there are a number of remedies available. 
I would certainly urge my colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee to work with you and the State of 
Nebraska to see if there are accommodations that can be made. We can work with you. And based on what we learned from the authorizing committee--the majority and minority--we might put language in the report directing or asking that steps be taken. But, frankly, that is not going to be bill language. But we are willing to work with you and with the ranking member and the chairman of the authorizing committee.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I, too, thank the Senator from Nebraska for his willingness to withdraw the amendment. This is not a productive road we are going down. But we are willing to work with both Senators from Nebraska because the points they make raise some very serious issues that need to be addressed by the EPA and by the authorizing committee with staff. I hope that we can bring them together and perhaps we can come out of the conference with report language that will outline a solution, or at least we can work with the authorizing committees and the other scientific entities to find out if the science on which the EPA is relying is adequate. 
Also, as I believe I mentioned, the EPA has said there are flexibility options under the existing programming in which Nebraska could take advantage. I cannot tell the Senator what those are, but we can find out and present those to the Senators so that a determination can be made if the problem can be solved by flexibility that EPA will utilize. At this juncture, at this time of night, we can't say what it will be, but we certainly assure the Senator that we will work to find, to explore every avenue to bring the relief the Senator seeks.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to all of the wonderful and exciting things my colleague from Alabama said about the space program. He made very telling points about how this is the future and motivation of our children, this is a symbol for the next century. There are many, many, many good things about our space program. As a matter of fact, I agree with almost everything he said about how important the space program is, and I think my colleague from Maryland agrees. And, frankly, that is why in a very extremely tough budget, when the President recommended $13.465 billion for NASA, we recommended we appropriate $13.615 billion for NASA. 
Now, these are the people who are running NASA. They say all they want is $13.465 billion. And we said, `No. You've got to do better. You are going to take another $150 million beyond what the folks who are running it--under the direction of the Director of OMB--have asked for. We are increasing it. And we think that is very important.' 
Unfortunately, we have had to make these choices in a budget where we had to restore an 83-percent cut in elderly housing, the section 202 elderly and assisted housing, the supportive housing that was savaged by Secretary Cuomo and the administration. We have had to restore money for veterans' health care where that was cut. 
Frankly, we have reached the accommodation on a very difficult bill. And we have agreed to maintain the funding at the National Service and AmeriCorps. And as part of, I think, an overall responsible approach to the budget for all of these agencies we work on, and, in addition, to assure that the administration will be able to sign the bill--because without the administration signing the bill, it does not do us any good to go through the drill of coming up with a totally different set of priorities than they have--we have kept in funding for National Service and AmeriCorps. 
Therefore, I commend the Senator for his enthusiasm for NASA. I do not believe it is feasible to achieve it. Therefore, I move to table the amendment, and ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, quite simply, this has to do with getting and keeping methamphetamine production out of public housing. Many of my colleagues do not have the misfortune of understanding why the amendment is so important. Methamphetamine is a raging crisis in Missouri and many other States in the Midwest. And if it isn't in your State now, it may well be soon. 
For those of you unfamiliar with the drug, it is a highly addictive, artificial stimulant constituted of such unwholesome products as lighter fluid, antifreeze, and ether, among other things. It is highly addictive, some say more so than crack; but it is perhaps the most physically destructive of illegal drugs. 
In my State of Missouri, through the excellent work of local law enforcement, in cooperation with the State, and with the DEA, nearly 800 clandestine methamphetamine labs were busted last year. 
Law enforcement reports that there may be even more this year. 
Meth started off as a rural drug, but labs have started to turn up in the major metropolitan areas of St. Louis and Kansas City. Urban drug users are starting to discover this drug as well. It is not likely that this trend will slow down, because the drug is cheaper than crack, it is more potent than crack or cocaine, it is more addictive than either of those drugs, and it can be made in the home or, in fact, almost anywhere else. In fact, it largely, in our State, is a home-made drug, which is the reason why this amendment is important. 
Most of the meth being consumed in Missouri is homemade in mom-and-pop drug stores. Information necessary to make the drug is widely available and the ingredients can be purchased at your local convenience store or discount store. 
The drug, however, is very dangerous to produce. While some who make this drug may consider themselves to be amateur chemists, they are actually rather ignorant individuals who are not only endangering themselves but innocent others. 
Mr. President, I have seen pictures of children horribly burned because adults caring for them have them in the room where this junk is being produced, and when it goes off it can be highly dangerous. It is highly explosive. Producing meth in a kitchen or a basement produces toxins, and it produces highly explosive gas. Meth labs have been known to explode when drug officers go into a bust. They use low-velocity guns, they use low-intensity flashlights, because a flashlight, a hot flashlight, could set off the ether. 
If you don't believe it, there are buildings that have had the sides blown out of them--motel rooms, shacks, wherever they have done it. When one of the meth labs explodes, it doesn't just cause a little fire. It can burn people. It can kill people. It can blow the sides of buildings out. It is very, very dangerous. That is why this bill provides for training and more assistance to local law enforcement officers, the first responders in emergency personnel--fire officials, law enforcement officials--so they will know what to do when they go into a meth lab. 
We need to send a clear message that this activity is not welcome and it will not be tolerated in public housing. Not only do we want drug dealers out, but we especially want those out who are so cavalier with the safety of others that they would conduct a chemical operation, a chemistry operation that is highly dangerous, in the heart of a densely populated residential area. Should anyone doubt that this is taking place, law enforcement officers have told me about drug dealers performing the process in hotel rooms, moving cars, trailer parks, State parks, in the parking lot next to our official offices in one city, and in homes with children. 
This amendment adopts zero tolerance for drug dealers. I hope that it can be adopted.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I agree with the comments of my friend, Senator D'Amato, the Chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, which has jurisdiction over federal housing programs. In an effort to ensure that HUD's elderly housing programs are operating in an effective manner, the Subcommittee included a provision in the legislation to require a report on the unmet housing needs of the elderly and the condition of the existing elderly housing stock. In addition, HUD will report on new and innovative approaches to providing additional housing opportunities while reducing costs and increasing efficiency. 
It is the intent of the authors of this legislation that HUD's report on elderly housing shall be developed with meaningful input from a wide variety of interested parties, including government entities and housing organizations. In particular, the authors fully intend HUD to develop this study in partnership with housing and service providers. Furthermore, the Subcommittee is fully cognizant of the invaluable work of the Council of Senior Centers and Services in meeting the housing and service needs of the elderly in New York City. The Subcommittee strongly encourages HUD to solicit the input and advice of the Council in the development of this study. 
I thank Senator D'Amato for his clarifying remarks and I look forward to receiving this much-anticipated HUD report on elderly housing.

If for some reason, the Administration determines that the money is not available to be spent in FY 1998, or does not reach a decision regarding the final disposition of these funds by the time this bill goes to Conference I, as Chairman of this subcommittee will do everything I can to make sure that the $900,000 for the final planning and design stage of the new national veterans cemetery is included in the FY 99 Conference Report so that this important project can move forward in FY 1999.

Although the Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies was able to increase the drinking water SRF for fiscal year 1999 to $800 million, it is impossible to expect the DWSRF to fund new projects where there is not a public health threat. The purpose of the DWSRF is to fund drinking water systems that are having difficulties complying with the Act, it is not intended to finance new drinking water systems for communities that are having difficulties distributing drinking water.

Second, for Senators Campbell, Stevens, and Mack, there are several amendments to ensure Native American groups are eligible for HUD drug elimination grants and the HUD rural housing and economic development. 
Third, for Senator D'Amato, we are continuing the authority for the HUD G-4 auction program. 
Fourth, we are allowing HUD to use data on multifamily housing developed by the Multifamily Housing Institute. 
Fifth, this amendment would require all agencies under the bill to provide detailed salaries and expenses information. 
In addition, we are including Senator Frist's amendment which authorizes OSTP, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, to conduct a study on methods for evaluating federally funded research and development. 
We have also included an amendment for Senator Wellstone providing for a 12-month notice to tenants before prepaying the mortgage of a preservation project. Owners who have already filed notice would not be impacted. We appreciate Senator Wellstone's providing this amendment. We had been hoping we could have adopted this one a number of weeks ago. 
Finally, we included a number of reforms of the FHA which we believe are very sound and responsible provisions. They are from Senator Nickles, Senator Mack, and Senator Faircloth to direct HUD to improve the management of FHA. 
I send this amendment to the desk and ask for its consideration en bloc.

This is the time now for us to move forward, for the Senate to add its voice and pass this bill for America's taxpayers. 
This is a historic opportunity to make some far-reaching changes in the operation of the Internal Revenue Service to strengthen taxpayers' rights. I believe the conferees have delivered, and it is now up to us to deliver. For too long, taxpayers have had to put up with poor service from the IRS, often to the tune of larger tax bills because of interest and penalties that accrue during the lengthy delays caused by the IRS in settling the disputes. 
For my part, I have asked people across Missouri for their suggestions on how to fix the IRS and protect taxpayers' rights. And as chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have also asked small businesses to give me their ideas. We have had hundreds of people who have taken the time and made the effort to share their views with us. 
I introduced a measure, called Putting Taxpayers First, in February. In that measure, we proposed things that are included in this conference report: 
No. 1, a requirement that the IRS restructure its operations to serve specific groups of taxpayers with similar needs, like individuals, small businesses, the self-employed, and corporations; 
No. 2, greater due process protections for taxpayers to guard against unreasonable seizures by the IRS; 
No. 3, expansion of the current attorney-client privilege of confidentiality to cover accountants and other tax practitioners who provide tax advice; 
No. 4, reform of the penalty and interest rules so they do not stand in the way of taxpayers who try to settle their accounts and get on with their lives; 
No. 5, clarification that a taxpayer may recover attorney's fees and costs when the IRS discloses information about the taxpayer without permission and when an IRS employee improperly browses a taxpayer's records. 
In addition, I am delighted to see: A requirement that the IRS establish an independent appeals process for taxpayers; a prohibition against the IRS contacting third parties, such as a business's customers or suppliers, without notifying the taxpayer first; improvements to the offer-in-compromise program; and prohibition on communications between an appeals officer and the IRS auditor or collection agent handling the case without permitting the taxpayer to be present. 
These are some of the abuses that we can and we will deal with in this bill. 
During the floor consideration in the Senate, I worked with Senator Moseley-Braun on an amendment which would provide clear direction that the IRS expansion of electronic filing of tax and information returns will be voluntary and not another Government mandate on the taxpayers of America. 
I am sorry that the conference agreement omitted this important provision, but rest assured that we will be keeping a careful eye on the IRS to ensure that Americans use electronic filing because it is simple, convenient, and easy to do so, not because they are forced to do so. 
While our ultimate goal must be simpler and less burdensome tax law, taxpayers need help today when dealing with the IRS. Like the bill introduced earlier this year, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act provides that help by putting America's taxpayers first. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the good work and the effort that has gone into this, the many people who have taken a lead in sponsorship of this, and the work that has been done in the committees. I know that the big challenge will lie ahead of us in the next couple years to embark upon a full-fledged reform of the IRS Code. That is the next step. But today we are taking the very first step. 
When I first argued for this bill, and pointed out that common criminals had more rights than taxpayers, my colleague from Texas asked if we really wanted to treat taxpayers like common criminals. And the answer is, we certainly do not want to treat them worse. This at least gives the American taxpayers the rights that all citizens should have in the United States. And we believe that it will end abuses in the IRS without curtailing the IRS' ability--an important responsibility--to collect the taxes that are owed. 
I commend the measure, and I thank the leaders on both sides. I hope that we can adopt the measure and send it to the President without further delay or distraction. 
I yield the floor and thank the Chair.

There is no question that Laurie has been a maverick. She has marched to her own drummer, voting only in accordance with her conscience. Laurie has stood second to no one in her support for early childhood education--a topic upon which I share her intense interest. Her efforts on behalf of the mentally ill likewise are the stuff of Missouri legislative legend. 
It is clear that State Representative Laurie Donovan's retirement is a loss for every Missouri citizen. I join all Missourians in wishing her well, and thanking her for her many years of dedicated service.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are in the process of seeking to reach a time agreement and have the measure set aside for a vote about 6:30. We have not yet cleared the time agreement. I intend to make some remarks now and would want those remarks charged against the time agreement if and when we do reach that time agreement. It is our hope that we will have this vote and be able to take another matter that is very important that Senator McCain is going to offer after this and vote on them at 6:30 and thereafter this evening. So for the information of all Senators, that is what we are working on, and we hope to have word from the Cloakrooms shortly. 
There are many points that can be made. I certainly appreciate the very knowledgeable comments of our distinguished colleague from Ohio, a man who speaks about space from personal knowledge that none of the rest of us have, and I know that we are all very, very enlightened by his description of the work that could go on, the scientific inquiry that can go on. But I want to address a point that was made earlier, just one of them that I think is very important. 
There was a statement made about 1 1/2 hours ago that all scientists in America are opposed to it. Clearly, there are many scientists whose disciplines have not yet identified enhancements that might come from the microgravity environment of space. It is not surprising that many of these scientists would rather see money for science go into one of their disciplines. But taking money away from NASA does not automatically make that money available for other research programs for other Federal agencies. 
Let me just indicate some of the scientific groups that have expressed support for the space station. The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology has called for a 58-percent increase in funding for NASA's live science research in its annual consensus report. 
In a 1997 report, the National Research Council said in something called `Future Materials Science Research on the International Space Station': 
The microgravity environment . . . of space provides a unique opportunity to further our understanding of various materials phenomena involving the molten, fluidic, and gaseous states by reducing or eliminating buoyancy-driven convection effects. . . . the anticipated scientific results of microgravity materials-science research range from establishing baselines for fundamental materials processes to generating results of more direct commercial significance.' 
I am not sure all of our colleagues understand exactly what they mean, but I get the drift of it, and that is that scientific investigation in space is good and they are going to make breakthroughs in areas that are very important. 
The National Research Council further stated, in Microgravity Opportunities for the 1990's: 
Increasingly, fundamental processes that were thought to be well understood under terrestrial (1-g) conditions have, in fact, proved to behave in altered and even startlingly unfamiliar ways when observed and measured in reduced gravity environments. Space experiments in areas such as combustion, fluid flow and transport, phase separation fundamental physics, and biology, have revealed new phenomena and have demonstrated new and occasionally unpredicted behavior. 
NASA and the National Institutes of Health have executed over 20 cooperative agreements in life sciences. The American Medical Association has passed a resolution in support of the International Space Station. In addition, we have quotes from people like Dr. Samuel C.C. Ting from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Laboratory for Nuclear Science. Dr. Ting is a Nobel laureate. He said: 
From my experience conducting experiments in particle accelerators for over thirty years, I conclude that the space station is an ideal place to address fundamental issues in physics. In the final analysis, the construction of the Space Station this year will provide scientists from many disciplines with the unprecedented opportunity to carry out large scale, precision, and long-duration experiments unimpeded by the effects of the Earth's atmosphere and gravity. 
I might cite Professor of Engineering Physics and Combustion, Director of the Center for Energy and Combustion Research at the University of California, San Diego, Professor Forman A. Williams, who said: 
The practical objective of learning how to burn our precious fossil fuels more cleanly, efficiently and safely certainly would benefit from the fundamental studies that the Space Station would allow us to pursue. Considering the astronomical costs of petroleum, the investment in Space Station thus seems to me very well conceived. 
Obviously, we have statements from other scientists who indicate the importance of this scientific research. But when you look at it, realize that the space station is not just justified in terms of science alone. The international space station is not and never has been simply a science platform. It serves many other functions, not the least of which is the greatest peaceful, international, scientific endeavor in history. 
It will offer practical applications beyond the realm of research, as a test-bed for manufacturing, for technology. It has a potential for great commercial involvement in manufacturing, in materials processing. If we choose, as a matter of policy, the station also can play a key role in civilization, taking another step beyond Earth's orbit. It is not just science. It is a laboratory with the capability that many of our top scientists are eager to begin using, and many who would hope to commercialize and provide benefits through the private sector, not only through investigations, scientific explorations, but actual production in space, may be able to realize. 
For these reasons, I hope, when the time comes for a tabling motion, an overwhelming majority of my colleagues will join us in so tabling the amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have heard much discussion today about the cost of the space station. We have seen from independent analysis by leading scientists that there are truly significant scientific advances which can come from the International Space Station, and we noted it serves many other functions. As the international scientific endeavor is furthered, it offers practical applications in research and potentially commercial manufacturing and materials processing. This is a tremendous step forward. We have heard about the Chabrow report. In it the NASA advisory council says that the task force members, with considerable experience, found the program to be consistent with the level of funding and that they have endorsed it. We think that it is an important measure. We would urge when the vote occurs that Members oppose the amendment offered by Senator Bumpers.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am not making such an argument. It was not the Committee's intention to imply, encourage or require States to use the 2 percent set aside authorized in Section 1452(g)(2) for the so called `circuit rider' program. The Committee is aware that Section 1452(g)(2) gives States the discretion to use up to 2 percent of their allotted revolving loan funds to provide technical assistance to small public water systems. The language was included in recognition of the fact that States have the ability to increase funding in this area above the $8 million provided directly in this bill at their discretion.

Mr. BOND. I appreciate the Senator's attention to this issue. HUD has incorrectly interpreted the enhanced voucher language. Previously assisted residents who receive enhanced vouchers should be paying the same percentage of income for rent as they had before they had received the enhanced voucher. This means that if a resident's income decreases, their rental contribution should also decrease. The purpose of providing enhanced vouchers to previously assisted residents was to ensure that these residents would be protected from displacement or unaffordable rent increases. 
I would also like to state that I expect HUD to administer the enhanced voucher program in a manner that will ensure a smooth transition for residents in prepayment developments. I have heard of some administrative problems with the enhanced voucher program that has created undue and unnecessary hardship for the residents. I would like to reemphasize that the transition should be administered so that residents are able to continue their tenancy with as little disturbance as possible.

Mr. BOND. I thank Senator Mack for raising these concerns. I completely agree that it is critical that the PAEs be in place by October if the program is to be able to operate at that time. I also add that the consequences of not implementing mark-to-market in a timely manner are serious and could create havoc with contract expirations and renewals. Even if the program is only delayed, HUD may have to extend the contracts at above market levels to provide the PAEs adequate time to restructure the properties. This will result in additional costs to the government and result in shortfalls in the appropriation for renewals. Further, the uncertainty surrounding the rules and regulations of the program will make it difficult for project owners and residents to prepare for mark-to-market. 
Mr. President, based on the Administration's less-than-adequate performance in selecting restructuring agents under the mark-to-market demonstration programs, I would say that the concerns expressed by the Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee are valid.

I also agree that HUD should not require the HFAs that act as PAEs to go through any unnecessary administrative steps in restructuring properties. I would especially be concerned if HUD created impediments in the HFAs ability to provide financing, such as risk-sharing, for restructuring transactions.  
OWNERS' RIGHT TO PREPAY FHA MORTGAGES

<DOCNO>105-bond-mo-27-19980707</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BOND. I thank the Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee for raising this issue. The Senator is correct that the Manager's Amendment contains language regarding the owner's right to prepay its mortgage and continues current housing policy that has been in effect for the past three years. This policy change was originally made in past appropriations legislation. 
Under the appropriations legislation and this year's legislation, the Congress restored the owner's right to prepay its mortgage under the Low Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (LIHPRHA). However, as a condition of prepayment, some resident protections were included in the appropriations law to prevent hardship for affected residents. Specifically, upon prepayment, an owner could not raise rents for 60 days and eligible residents were provided enhanced or `sticky' vouchers so that they could choose to remain in their homes at an affordable rent. The provision of sticky vouchers were provided in lieu of the resident protections under LIHPRHA. In other words, the provision of sticky vouchers and the prevention of raising rents for 60 days permanently replaces the LIHPRHA resident protections that included (1) providing relocation benefits, (2) keeping rents at levels existing at the time of prepayment for three years, and (3) requiring owners to accept voucher holders.

This legislation provides a total of $69.986 billion in discretionary budget authority and $80.78 billion in outlays, and an additional $23 billion in mandatory spending for veterans programs. 
The Subcommittee allocation was about $750 million below the President's request in budget authority. In addition, there were some significant shortfalls in the President's budget in such areas as veterans medical care and elderly housing. In attempting to balance all the competing demands, we were forced to make a number of tough decisions. 
The committee did its best to provide the needed funding for the important priorities within the bill, with the highest priority given to veterans programs and elderly housing. Other priorities included maintaining environmental programs at or above current year levels, ensuring adequate funds for our nation's space and science programs, and providing adequate funding for disaster relief. The committee also met the commitment we made to provide the necessary funding to cover all expiring section 8 contracts. 
On balance, I believe the recommendation is fair and balanced. Not everyone is happy, but I believe it is equitable. Clearly, we were not able to provide fully what each member requested--and I should note that we received about 1,000 requests from Members of this body for items in this bill--but we attempted to meet the priorities. 
Before describing what is included in this legislation for each agency, I want to thank Chairman Stevens for all his support, and I particularly thank my ranking member, Senator Mikulski, for all of her hard work and cooperation in putting this legislation together. This is always a difficult task, and it is made for easier and more efficient by the professional and wholehearted cooperation of Senator Mikulski and her staff--Andy Givens, David Bowers, and Bertha Lopez. I extend my thanks to them. Their contributions to this process have been invaluable. 
Mr. President, for the Department of Veterans Affairs, the committee recommendation totals $42.5 billion, including $19.2 billion in discretionary spending. This is an increase of $373 million above the President's request. The amount recommended includes $222 million more for medical care, $53 million more for the state home construction program to reduce the large backlog of priority projects, and $79 million in additional funds for other construction programs. 
The additional funds are intended to ensure VA medical care is the best possible quality, and that it is available to as many eligible veterans as possible. The funds are also intended to ensure VA facilities are adequately maintained, safe, and seismically secure, and that the final resting places for our fallen heroes are maintained in an appropriate and dignified manner. 
The recommendation also includes an increase of $10 million above the President's request for VA research, for a total of $310 million. 
This is a critical program, veterans research, in improving the quality of VA care, in furthering our understanding of such illnesses as gulf war syndrome, in developing prosthetic devices and other items which will improve the quality of life to veterans and others, and in seeking cures to diseases which veterans and the Nation at large face. The programs is also key in the recruitment and retention of top-notch medical staff at VA hospitals. 
For the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the committee recommendation totals $24.1 billion, an increase of $2.66 billion over the fiscal year 1998 level. 
This means we have been able to fund HUD programs fairly while meeting our commitment to provide the needed funding for all expiring section 8 contracts and by more than fully funding the section 202 elderly housing program at $676 million, an increase of $31 million over the fiscal year 1998 level and an increase of $576 million over the President's request of $109 million. 
I emphasize that the section 202 Elderly Housing Program is the most important housing program for elderly, low-income Americans, providing both affordable, low-income housing and supportive services designed to meet the special needs of the elderly. This combination of supportive services and affordable housing is critical to promoting independent living, self-sufficiency, and dignity while delaying the more costly alternative of institutional care. Section 202 elderly housing is more than just housing--it is a safety net for the elderly, providing both emotional and physical security and a sense of community. I am very disappointed and puzzled by the administration's failure to propose the needed funding for the section 202 program. 
Moreover, at the direction of the Senate and House VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittees, GAO conducted a very thorough budget investigation of the HUD section 8 accounts. Based on the GAO budget scrub and after discussions with HUD, we discovered that the administration's request for $1.3 billion in section 8 amendment funding is unnecessary for fiscal year 1999 and that a further $1.4 billion in section 8 project-based recaptures may be considered excess funding, which means we are actually above the President's request for HUD. 
These additional funds have provided us with needed flexibility to fund HUD programs as well as to fund other priorities throughout this bill. As a result, the committee has provided additional funding for HUD programs such as the HOME program, CDBG, Youthbuild, the HOPE VI program, and the Homeless Assistance Grants program. I think these all are needed additions that were made available as a result of this review by GAO and work with HUD. 
Nevertheless, HUD continues to be a troubled agency with GAO designating the entire agency as `high-risk.' In fact, HUD is the only agency ever to have received a `high-risk' designation agency-wide. Now, Secretary Cuomo has begun implementing the HUD 2020 management reform plan as his first step to agency reform and downsizing. Many of our future funding recommendations will depend on the success of this plan and I want to state my support of the Secretary in his efforts to reform the Department. Nevertheless, we expect to see tangible and quantifiable results. We need to know that HUD programs work, that HUD staff are capable of effectively administering HUD programs, and that there is accountability within HUD programs. 
Further, we also do not look to fund new HUD programs and initiatives until HUD can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Congress its ability to administer effectively its primary programs. I want to make it very clear that self-serving press releases by HUD that announce success carry little weight. I am from Missouri and I want to be shown. 
Finally, for the first time in a number of years, this bill would provide modest increases in the FHA mortgage insurance limits, raising the floor from 38 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit, or some $86,000, to 48 percent of the conforming loan limit, or some $109,000, and establishing a new ceiling for high-cost areas from the existing 75 percent of the conforming loan limit, or some $170,000, to 87 percent of the conforming loan limit, or some $197,000. 
I know for some that this is considered controversial, but we have tried to strike a reasonable balance and I believe that the new limit is needed especially in non-urban areas where the price of new housing has escalated beyond the capacity of first-time homebuyers to use FHA mortgage insurance to buy a house. In my own state I have seen many areas where, because of the FHA lower limits, financing is not available for construction of first homes for families of workers with lower wages. 
Nevertheless, I remain concerned about HUD'S capacity to manage the FHA mortgage insurance programs and will be looking for additional ways to ensure the solvency of the mutual mortgage insurance fund. 
For EPA, the bill includes $7.4 billion. This is about $50 million more that the fiscal year 1998 level. The bill maintains level funding or provides some increases to all EPA programs, reflecting the priority we have placed on environmental protection activities. Included in the recommendation is $350 million more than the President requested for state revolving funds, which he had proposed to cut by $275 million. The SRFs help to meet a need in excess of $200 billion nationally for water infrastructure financing. Cleaning up waste water and assuring safe drinking water should be at the top of our environmental priority list. 
The committee has provided 80 percent of the administration's request for the clean water action plan, including $180 million for nonpoint source grants and $106 million for water quality grants. The committee's action recognizes the importance of addressing polluted runoff and seeks to ensure that our Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams are protected from polluted runoff, and are clean for recreation and for wildlife. These funds gives the states the tools they need to improve the quality of our Nation's water. I promised Administrator Browner I would try to find more funds for this critical program, and I have. 
The bill includes level funding for Superfund. Given the myriad problems with this program, coupled with the lack of a reauthorization bill, an increase simply was not warranted. I remind my colleagues, with respect to the fiscal year 1999 advance that was provided in last year's bill for Superfund, those funds were to be made available only if the program was reauthorized. We had a deal with the administration on this, and unfortunately the administration conveniently seems to have forgotten this deal. 
Further, the program continues to be listed by GAO as high risk, subject to fraud, waste and abuse. Such abuse recently was demonstrated in an IG report which found that Superfund was being used to rebuild homes at several times their market value. Finally, experts agree that funds invested in Superfund yield less reduction in risk to human health and the environment compared to other EPA programs. 
Our recommendation totals $13.6 billion for NASA, an increase of $150 million above the request to ensure adequate funds for space station and other critical NASA programs. It also includes a restructuring of the NASA appropriation accounts to improve fiscal accountability. 
In particular, we have included a new account for the International Space Station to ensure that Congress and this subcommittee gets honest figures for the ISS from the administration 
While I strongly support the ISS and the many important programs administered by NASA, the long history of space station overruns reached a new and unprecedented level with the recent release of the report by the independent cost assessment and validation team headed by Jay Chabrow. The Chabrow report estimates that the ISS will cost some $24.7 billion instead of $17.4 billion and will take up to 38 months longer to build than NASA's current estimates. 
For NSF, the recommendation includes $3.6 billion, an increase of about $220 million above the 1998 level. NSF is an investment in the future and this additional funding is intended to reaffirm the strong and longstanding support of this subcommittee to scientific research and education. 
Finally, for FEMA, there is a total of $1.3 billion, including $846 million in disaster relief and about $500 million in nondisaster relief programs. The amount recommended for disaster relief, coupled with the $1.6 billion provided in the fiscal year 1998 supplemental, approximates the 5-year historical average cost of disaster relief in 1999 dollars. 
The recommendation includes the restoration of $11 million in state and local assistance grants to state emergency management agencies. It also includes $25 million in the new pre-disaster mitigation program. 
Mr. President, as you know, the administration last month submitted a budget amendment to increase funds for FEMA counterterrorism preparedness activities. 
I intend to work with my ranking member, Senator Mikulski, to offer an amendment to increase funds for such activities in FEMA by $8 million, in addition to the $9 million currently included in the committee mark. These are critical activities. I think it is important we accommodate the administration's request, and I ask for my colleagues' attention to this very important measure. We think not only the work that goes on in FEMA, but the work that goes on elsewhere in the Federal Government, needs to take account of the risks that we face in these areas. 
Mr. President, that concludes my statement. It is a pleasure to turn to my ranking member, Senator Mikulski. I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my distinguished ranking member for her very cogent and persuasive arguments. She makes an excellent case for the bill. 
I note when she says this is an interesting bill that there is an old curse that one should live in interesting times. But we are very fortunate to be able to work on a bill that has so many important programs and is of such great interest among our colleagues. 
I want to begin the debate. Before I turn the floor over to our colleague from Ohio, who I understand has other business, I urge all of our colleagues to please come forward if they have amendments, if they have colloquies. It would really help us if we could get as many of those in today as possible in order for us to complete work on this measure by tomorrow afternoon, which would be my hope. 
I know we have two amendments that are going to be argued with some enthusiasm and with great feeling on both sides. I hope we can complete those. In order for us to do that, I ask that all Senators who have amendments that might be cleared or colloquies which they wish to enter with us, they provide them by no later than the Tuesday lunches tomorrow so we may have an opportunity to look at them. If we get near the end it would be my desire to finish up, once we have dealt with the controversial amendments, and I would hate to have to turn down an amendment that might otherwise be agreed to because it is not presented in a timely fashion. In order for us to move forward with this bill so we can expedite the work of the Senate, I ask colleagues bring to us this afternoon, if possible, and tomorrow morning in any event, any amendments or colloquies or other matters it wishes to consider so we can complete work on them in as quick a fashion as possible. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Madam President, this amendment responds to the critical requirement of enhancing antiterrorist activities at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In our budget hearings with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Senator Mikulski and I raised the question of whether this country is ready to respond and take all appropriate actions to deal with the threat of terrorist activities in our country. The administration has submitted a budget amendment on June 8 to increase spending in several agencies for antiterrorism activities, including $11 million more than the original budget request for FEMA's emergency planning and assistance. With this amendment we will meet the request. 
The bill as reported by the committee adds $3 million above the initial request for such activities, and this amendment now pending before the Senate would add another $8 million, for a total of $11 million in this key area. These funds are to be used for such critical activities as planning at the Federal, State, and local level for the unique aspect of terrorist-related incidents. 
I note this is part of a larger proposal for $249 million to strengthen our ability to defend against and respond to terrorist incidents involving the use of biological or chemical weapons. I wholeheartedly support this effort. I think it is vitally important and I think this is a vital first step. 
In a recent self-assessment by the States, they rated themselves as being unprepared in this critical area. The funds we are adding today should go a long way in helping State and local governments prepare for these instances that we hope they never have to face. But, as in all emergency management agencies' activities, we have to be prepared for things that could happen that we hope never happen. 
With this amendment, FEMA funding would total almost $18 million. The FEMA program, as I said, complements a broader initiative involving the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, and the Department of Health and Human Services. That effort includes building a civilian stockpile of antidotes to respond to any large-scale attack, improving the public health surveillance system, and providing special equipment to first responders. 
We have already included in this bill assistance for first responders in dealing with a problem that is particularly acute in my State of Missouri, and that is the explosion of methamphetamine clandestine labs in our State. We have recognized in this bill the need to prepare first responders--emergency personnel, firefighters, police--when they go into a methamphetamine lab. These are very dangerous facilities that can blow up with any kind of heat or light, or even the discharge of a gun. So we recognize that the people who do the vitally important work responding to emergencies, whether they are firefighters or police or sheriffs units, the first responders as they are often called, need to be prepared. In this amendment, we are going to provide additional assistance to the people who will come on the scenes first. 
These are very frightening issues. The terrorism issue--we have already experienced domestic acts of terrorism in Oklahoma City and at the World Trade Center, so we know they can occur. We need to be prepared. We need to make our country as safe as possible. It is all too easy to ship weapons of mass destruction, be they explosives or chemical or biological weapons, even in a suitcase. This risk is not acceptable, and I strongly support the amendment as an important first step towards dealing with these problems. 
Our country has to be prepared to protect its citizens from the dangers of a hostile world. Unfortunately, the constant threat we face from rogue states makes it vital that Congress provide the funding for FEMA to use towards counterterrorism measures on a local level. Our amendment gives FEMA the funding it needs to enhance the training of emergency personnel in the event that a terrorist attack occurs. 
Madam President, I urge adoption of the amendment and I yield the floor to my colleague.

Mr. BOND. Madam President, this amendment includes clarifying provisions which have been cleared on both sides and are without controversy. 
First, on behalf of Senator Shelby, the amendment would allow the transfer of land from the Department of Veterans Affairs--Tuscaloosa VA Hospital--to the University of Alabama to use for the Ridgecrest Children's Center. VA has no objection to this language, and it is in keeping with the conveyance of land from Tuscaloosa authorized in the fiscal year 1997 VA-HUD bill. 
Second, the amendment makes a technical correction to a provision under the American Battle Monuments Commission. 
Third, the amendment clarifies that States, in administering their clean water State revolving fund program, may charge borrowers loan origination fees. This language has been reviewed and approved by both EPA and the authorizing committee. 
Fourth, the amendment would make a number of technical amendments to the mark-to-market legislation enacted as part of the VA-HUD fiscal year 1998 Appropriations Act with the concurrence of the administration and the Senate Banking Committee. 
Fifth, on behalf of Senator Harkin, the amendment would require that EPA recognize the differences between the environmental effects caused by spills of animal fats and vegetable oils, as opposed to petroleum oil, and issue regulations to accomplish this commonsense differentiation. 
Finally, the amendment would clarify the owner's right to prepay under the Preservation Program, as requested by the administration and cleared by the Senate Banking Committee.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Samaritan Center of Jefferson City, on the occasion of the groundbreaking for a new home. More than decade ago, Samaritan Center began as an effort of five Mid-Missouri Catholic churches. Three Protestant churches joined the cause and Samaritan Center has operated ever since as an interfaith agency. Virtually all of its resources are devoted directly to service delivery, as the center's single paid employee, an operations manager, is assisted by more than 150 volunteers each month. 
Respectful, loving service is delivered with firm supervision, and anyone who knows the center pays tribute to the practical assistance they provide. For example, during the historic Flood of 1993, which wiped out the life stake of so many Missouri farmers, the center not only donated food, clothing, diapers and utility assistance to make it through the winter; they also came through with help to get the crop in when spring arrived. Many folks got back on their feet thanks to this helping hand, and those who saw what it meant to these families will never forget it. 
I am one who marvels at how far the center can stretch its help. I have visited and left with my faith in people renewed. The computer is donated, the employees unpaid, the furniture castoffs--but the service is sterling and as varied as the need. 
This groundbreaking is another step toward meeting a new challenge the Samaritan Center is taking on. The current quarters are bursting at the seams, and new space must be found to continue to help the families they serve (which number more than 400 each month for food alone!). Characteristically, the center refuses to reduce service to pay for the new building they hope to place on land donated by supporters. So, in addition to continuing to help people with needs ranging from rent to work uniforms, the center and its friends are not so slowly and very surely piecing together the resources to build a site that meets the needs of Mid-Missouri today. 
To know the Samaritan Center is to respect and support it. It is my honor to offer this tribute from the United States Senate on the loving service provided by the Center, its volunteer and many supporters.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment on behalf of myself, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Faircloth. 
This vital measure would enhance the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) demonstration provisions currently included in the Department of Defense Authorization bill to evaluate the feasibility of using this effective program to ensure the availability of adequate health care for Medicare-eligible retirees under the military health care system. 
Specifically, this amendment increases the number of FEHBP sites from two to four and accelerates the implementation of the program from January of 2000 to July of 1999. 
Mr. President, our nation's military retirees are facing a grave health care crisis. Current trends, such as base closures, the downsizing of military treatment facilities, and the introduction of TRICARE, have all hindered access to health care services for military retirees aged 65 and over. In theory, Medicare-eligible retirees can receive health care services at military treatment facilities on a space available basis; however, active duty and their dependents have priority. 
Therefore, in reality, space is rarely available--resulting in military retirees being `locked out' of the Department of Defense's (DoD) health care delivery system. And because of their considered `secondary status', many retirees are forced to travel great distances to receive even the minimum of care. 
Further, when compared to what other Federal and private sector retirees receive in terms of health care options, it is clear that the current health care choices for military retirees are woefully inadequate and downright inexcusable. 
This is outrageous. The bottom line is military retirees aged 65 and older do not have time to wait for health care solutions, especially when our nation is losing 30,000 world War II veterans each month. It is high time that the federal government lives up to its promise of providing health care to those who honorably served our country. 
Although this amendment is not everything I wanted, it is a step in the right direction. I am pleased that the Armed Services Committee was able to address this problem, but I remain concerned that the DoD Authorization bill caps total funding for all the various demonstration projects at $60 million a year, of which only a portion would be available for the FEHBP demonstration. 
Mr. President, I understand the budgetary constraints that the Committee faces; however, this does not excuse us from our moral obligation to provide those military retirees who faithfully and selflessly served our country in times of war and in times of peace the health care they deserve. Our country must live up to the promise of providing military retirees more dependable, consistent, and affordable care while simultaneously applying equitable standards of health care for all federal retirees. 
Make no doubt about it--this battle has just begun. I look forward to working with my colleagues in conference in securing increased funding and sites for this purpose--as represented in the House's DoD Authorization bill. And again, I thank the distinguished Chairmen, Senator Thurmond, and Senator Kempthorne, for their efforts.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today is the 100th anniversary of the Hospital Corps of the United States Navy. On June 17,1898, President McKinley established the Hospital Corps which has recorded an illustrious history of service to the nation. The men and women who serve and have served as corpsmen have honored the nation, the Navy and themselves. They have upheld the highest traditions of service to the nation. 
As a group, corpsmen have been the most highly decorated men and women who have served in our nation's military. Every day they put their lives at risk in the course of performing one of our highest callings as human beings, the preservation and protection of life. 
Individually, during the course of their 100 year history, 1962 corpsmen have paid the ultimate price while administering to their wounded comrades on the battlefield. Twenty-seven times, their actions were so extraordinary that the individual was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
There is a little known fact about a widely hailed piece of American history. On February 23, 1945, six young men raised our national colors on top of Mount Suribachi on the island of Iwo Jima. A world renowned photograph was taken and this photograph became a symbol of the self-sacrifice and devotion to duty of the United States Marine Corps and our nation's military in general. What is little known is that the second young man from the base of the flagpole, was a U.S. Navy corpsman. Only days before, that young man, Pharmacist Mate Second Class John Bradley, during the assault of Iwo Jima, pulled a young Marine to safety and bandaged his wounds while braving severe machine gun and mortar fire from a determined enemy. For his actions, Pharmacist Mate Bradley was awarded the Navy Cross. This extraordinary individual as with his other compatriots in that photo is even more extraordinary because of his anonymity. They were there for the photo by chance, they became the symbol we so readily recognize by a twist of fate. But they carried out their duties as thousands of other young Americans had done before them and since, in the most terrible of circumstances. 
Corpsmen have been the protective blanket our soldiers, sailors, and Marines have relied upon in their times of greatest distress. They have been there for them to heal their wounds, to fend off the battlefield's angels of death, and sometimes to comfort them as life ebbed away. Corpsmen are representative of the best of our ideals. It is in that spirit I call upon my colleagues and all Americans to remember their significant contribution to our nation and celebrate this day in recognition of their service.

Mr. BOND. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill which will improve assistive and universally designed technology research and development and increase access to this technology for all Americans with disabilities. 
Assistive and universally designed technology provides a disabled individual the means to function better in the workplace or the home. Assistive and universally designed technology is technology that aids the millions of Americans with physical or mental disabilities. For example, assistive technology can mean a computer that can be used by an individual with Cerebral Palsy, a hearing aid for an aging individual or enhanced voice recognition for someone with Multiple Sclerosis, while universally designed technology can mean closed captioning for the deaf or for patrons in crowded restaurants and accessability ramps for individuals in wheelchairs or mothers with strollers. 
A year ago my office was approached by a small business owner and Missouri's United Cerebral Palsy asking for support for testing of a breakthrough in Voice Recognition technology. During my search to find an appropriate place for funding for this voice recognition technology, my staff and I became familiar with the overall government efforts in this area. 
There are many significant problems in the federal government's efforts in assistive technology research and development. My finding's were validated by a recent report from the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine, `Enabling America: Assessing the Role of Rehabilitation Science and Engineering,' which stressed that the federal government's efforts in this area are lacking awareness, funding, and coordination. 
My distinguished colleague in the House, Congresswoman Connie Morella, Chairwoman of the House Science's Subcommittee on Technology, joins me today in introducing the Assistive and Universally Designed Technology Improvement Act for Individuals with Disabilities. 
The Act provides federally supported incentives in all areas of assistive and universally designed technology, including need identification, research and development, product evaluation, technology transfer, and commercialization. These incentives achieve the goal of improving the quality, functional capability, distribution, and affordability of this essential technology. 
This legislation does several things. 
First, the bill includes an improved peer review process at the National Institute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation (NIDRR) at the Department of Education. This provision requires standing peer review panels and clarifies the evaluation of applications for funding of assistive and universally designed technology. These improvements provide more assistive and universally designed technology products to the marketplace, increase small business involvement in research and development, and assure research and development efforts cover all disability groups including persons with physical and mental disabilities as well as the aging and rural technology users. 
Second, the legislation augments technology transfer through improving the role of the Interagency Committee on Disability Research (ICDR) by increasing its authority, accountability and ability to coordinate. Provisions are included for increased usage of the Federal labs to improve coordination with all Federal agencies involved in assistive and 
universally designed technology research and development and for providing public and private sector partnerships for assistive and universally designed technology research and development. 
Third, to increase the market for assistive technology, the bill clarifies Title III of the Tech Act for the Microloan program. This microloan program assists disabled persons in obtaining assistive and universally designed technology. 
Fourth, funds are authorized for the Interagency Committee on Disability Research to hire staff and for operating costs associated with issuing surveys and reports. Additionally, $10 million in funds are authorized for the National Institute on Disability Research and Rehabilitation to provide for assistive and universally designed technology research and development. 
Finally, to increase access to assistive and universally designed technology, tax incentives are included to provide businesses a tax credit for the development of assistive technology, to expand the architectural and transportation barrier removal deduction to include communication barriers, and to expand the work opportunity credit to include expenses incurred in the acquisition of technology to facilitate the employment of any individual with a disability. 
These tax incentives and micro loans will assist individuals with disabilities to obtain assistive and universally designed technology in order to improve their quality of life, to secure and maintain employment, and to assist small businesses in complying with Americans with Disabilities Act requirements, which in effect, results in lessened financial burdens on society. 
As technology increasingly plays a role in the lives of all persons in the United States, in the conduct of business, in the functioning of government, in the fostering of communication, in the transforming of employment, and in the provision of education, it also greatly impacts the lives of the more than 50 million individuals with disabilities in the United States. 
An agenda, including support for universal design, represents the only effective means for guaranteeing the benefits of technology to all persons in the United States, regardless of disability or age, in addition to assuring for United States industry the continued growth in markets that will warrant continued high levels of innovation and research. 
This legislation has the support of many organizations, including: The Missouri Assistive Technology Advisory Council, the United Cerebral Palsy Association, the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America, the National Easter Seal Society, and the Association of Tech Act Projects. 
The bill also has broad bipartisan and bicameral support. My colleagues, Senator Jeffords, Senator Harkin, Senator Grassley, and Congresswoman Connie Morella have been very helpful in my efforts to improve the role of the federal government in assistive and universally designed technology. 
Let me conclude by taking special note of the help of the National and Missouri United Cerebral Palsy, as well as the Missouri Assistive Technology Project, the Federal Laboratory Consortium, and the numerous assistive and universally designed technology and disability community advocate organizations, for their assistance in developing and advocating this legislation.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are getting into the tobacco wars again today. I know we have made some progress. I have seen in the last week several amendments adopted which I think are very important. As a long-time advocate of assuring full deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed, I was delighted that, and the marriage penalty provision, survived a vote in the Chamber, and also what we called the Bond-Kerry amendment directing that some of the money paid out to the States be used at the very essential early stages of a child's development through early childhood development, parent education to make their children better students, better people, to accept responsibility for them, and providing child care to assure that children in elementary school are not left alone without supervision before and after school. 
These are steps in the right direction. I understand that one of my colleagues, for whom I have great respect, later on today will come to the floor and seek to strike all mandates on States in this bill. 
Generally, I have taken the position as a former Governor that we should not be mandating what States do with all of the money that is collected by the Federal Government from our State constituents. In this case, however, I think the situation is a little different because we have been asked by the States to come in and legislate. These actions started off as lawsuits, and it came to the point where they believed that a Federal law was necessary to implement the objectives that the States have and that we share, which is to assure discouraging of teenage smoking. 
I think that once we go down that path of imposing a major legislative solution--and we are going to be the ones who have to take the responsibility for imposing the fees, for setting up the smoking cessation programs and other things--that there is every reason for us to pose responsible legislative provisions which will have to be agreed to by a majority of both Houses. 
I would mention the fact that there has been some controversy. I regret we were not able to place a limit on the amount of fees the lawyers for the States would receive. It seems to me we missed an essential ingredient here. We are talking about imposing a settlement or directing a distribution of sums that is not really a settlement of a lawsuit. We are developing a major proposal which is going to raise large amounts of money, provide some tax relief, send some money back to the States. I think we have every reason to say how much money that lobbyists, who are essentially the attorneys who brought the suits--the lobbyists pushing this legislation--should be able to achieve. Some of the figures that have been expressed on the floor about $80,000 to $90,000 an hour are unconscionable. And the people of my State--and I believe the people of the United States--are very much concerned about what is going to be done with all this money. I share that concern. 
I think before this measure passes, or is finally adopted, there ought to be some limitation. Sure, let the people who worked on it get a reasonable return. But there is no reason to give a small group of people, selected by attorneys general, a windfall of literally potentially billions of dollars from our legislative action. The people who are going to have to be paying the higher fees for cigarettes, I think, have a right to ask us not to permit States to go through with the contracts which give essentially judicial contingent-fee-type rewards to people who are, in essence, coming to us, lobbying for us to pass legislation. 
I think we ought to be able to establish some conditions on some of the money that goes back to the States. I have said that smoking cessation is important. The educational element is important in ensuring young people at least know the message that smoking can be harmful and that they should not start. I think we need to inform them. 
I think, second, It is right and proper that, as we did last week, we support the concept in the Bond-Kerrey proposal, that funds going back to the States should be utilized for expanding child care, for assuring adequate early childhood development to ensure that every family takes responsibility for its child's behavior. We ought to be talking about parental responsibility, about family responsibility, about adult care-giver responsibility. 
I will tell you one other thing. There is something that is lacking in this bill, and I intend to offer--I hope it will be tomorrow--an amendment which will deal with one of the areas that this bill, in my view, wrongfully ignores. We are trying to get teenagers to stop smoking. Where is the responsibility on the teenagers themselves? I know teenagers. I happen to have one in my family. Mine is a fine young man. We have these wonderful, bright-eyed, aggressive, intelligent young people here who are working as pages. Yet we are saying we are going to protect them from everybody else--from the sellers, from the tobacco companies--but we are not saying they have to take any responsibility. Young people are old enough to begin taking responsibility. If they drive a car illegally and they get caught, they get sanctioned. If they drive and they are drinking, or if they are using drugs, in my State they can lose their licenses. Young people ought to know they have some limits and some responsibilities. So I am going to offer an amendment to say to the States: If you want to receive money under these block grants, you ought to set up a system for sanctioning teenagers who purchase cigarettes illegally. 
We are raising the price, we are providing education, but, as one teenager I talked to said: `Hey, if all they are doing is saying it's bad and the store that sells it to me is going to be in 
trouble or the people who make it are going to be in trouble but I can walk scot-free--that's worth a try.' There are some teenagers who, unfortunatley, in their rebellious teen-age ways--and most of us can still recall when we were teenagers and remember those days--will say, `That's worth a try.' If we want to discourage teenage smoking, then there need to be some sanctions on the teenagers. 
I would lay out a string of sanctions and say, for the first offense, either a $50 fine or a day's worth of community service. A $50 fine might be really heavy on one teenager, but for another teenager it might not make any difference. But if that young man has to spend a day picking up trash along the highway as part of a community service sanction imposed on him for purchasing cigarettes illegally, I don't think he is going to want to be out there in broad daylight in the hot, broiling sun, with all his buddies going by honking and waving at him picking up trash on the highway. 
I would even go so far as to say parents out to get sanctioned, too. We want to hold parents responsible. We want parents to recognize it is not just Government's responsibility, it is their responsibility as parents. Sure, we have all kinds of sanctions on the sellers, mom-and-pop stores that sell a whole range of things, including a legal product, tobacco, saying: You are really going to get it if youi sell to a teenager. 
But is it fair to have that penalty only on one side? The amendment I am going to offer, and I hope both sides of the aisle will support, will say: States, you have to come up with a graduated system of sanctions so teenagers will know it is not a risk-free endeavor to try to lure a convenience store operator or a grocery store operator to sell you cigarettes that you should not be buying. Some States are moving ahead and they have sanctions, so they would be in compliance. But I think this bill would be sadly lacking if we set out a system of penalties and tried some educational efforts to convince teenagers they should not do what is illegal, and left them without sanctions. 
So I hope we can adopt, tomorrow, a measure which does impose sanctions on teenagers or encourages States to say they must set up a reasonable graduated system of sanctions for anybody who purchases--acquires cigarettes illegally. Thus, I would say, when we come to the point about debating whether this bill should have no sanctions or no limitations or restrictions on the States, I think we have gone past that. Once the States came here and asked us to get involved and to set up a scheme to discourage teenage smoking, to raise the price of cigarettes to provide smoking education, provide research, provide health care benefits, we ought to continue down that road and provide the one element which is lacking in the current scheme, and that is strong incentives for States to punish and to impose a reasonable, graduated system of penalties on those who purchase illegally. 
So I ask my colleagues not to support a removal of all requirements on the States. I ask them--I hope it will be tomorrow when we come forward with our amendment--to support the amendment. My amendment will simply provide incentives for States to impose sanctions on youth who buy or possess tobacco products illegally. We are taking all kinds of steps in the bill to keep cigarettes out of the hands of teens. We are creating new boards and agencies, we are seeking that the tobacco industry limit advertising, we are planning ad campaigns to discourage teens from smoking, we are holding convenience stores accountable for selling cigarettes to teens illegally. About the only people we are not holding responsible are the teens themselves. I ask support for my amendment that will do that. 
Teen smoking is on the rise at a time when older adults are reducing tobacco consumption. there is more information out there than ever before about the risks of smoking, but teens continue to smoke. Some of that may be rebelliousness. How should we handle that rebellion? Quite simply, by holding teens accountable for their actions. Teens need to know that their actions have consequences. If they purchase tobacco illegally, they should have a penalty to pay--perform community service or kick in with some money to the General Treasury of the entity involved. 
Mr. President, I ask support for my amendment. If others want to cosponsor the amendment, I welcome having them contact us. We are already working with several Members who are interested. I hope we can get this amendment accepted on both sides. I think it is a responsible and appropriate response to the problem that this measure seeks to address. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and, seeing no other Senator present wishing to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Hannibal Courier-Post on it's 160th Anniversary. Several years ago, a Courier-Post reporter, Gene Hoenes, was quoted as saying, `People listen to facts announced on the radio and see news on television, but they don't really believe it until they read it in the newspaper.' 
From the beginning, this newspaper has provided important information for the people of Hannibal in my home State of Missouri. In the early days, just about anyone who had a cause started a paper, although few survived. Eventually, several of the small and struggling papers merged into what is now the Hannibal Courier-Post, the oldest existing newspaper in Missouri. 
It is truly impressive that Hannibal Courier-Post is having it's 160th Anniversary. I commend all of the people who have helped to make the Courier-Post succeed throughout it's many years of existence.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a serious challenge to law enforcement, to communities, to our youth, and to the future of our country. 
Methamphetamine, as most of us in this body know, is a growing danger in many of our communities. We have the dubious distinction in Missouri of having achieved the highest ranking in the number of clandestine methamphetamine labs busted in the last year. Seven hundred labs were busted where they were cooking up this deadly brew to endanger their neighbors, to threaten the lives and the future of our young people and our adults. Methamphetamine, or crank, is a hot new drug, and it is supposed to have a wonderful temporary feeling. The problem is it destroys the body and the minds of the users. It also, when it is prepared, leaves a deadly residue and threatens explosion and fires that have injured many innocent people. 
Methamphetamine dealers are the very worst kind of social predators, far worse than even an average drug dealer, and that is saying something. They have the same disregard for young lives they seek to spoil, but they also possess a callous indifference to the entire public. Meth cookers prepare their drugs in homes, in rented apartments and hotel rooms, but the meth cooking process is a very dangerous one because it produces dangerous byproducts including carcinogens and toxins and combustible gases. While it is being cooked, it is highly explosive. 
I have talked with law enforcement officers who go in who have to use low-powered flashlights because a really hot flashlight could set off a spontaneous combustion in a meth lab. I have seen the pictures of young children who have been on cooking sites with their parents or care givers when the mess caught fire and burned them horribly. The aftermath of the process is a mini toxic waste site. The waste sites litter my State of Missouri. 
Despite the danger, law enforcement officers in my home State continue their heroic effort every day to bring more of these labs down. They are currently outgunned because the methamphetamine production and sales have been spreading. The problem is severe, and many of the lab sites are so dangerous that local law enforcement agencies cannot handle the responsibility alone. 
We have been very gratified that many of the local police agencies and law enforcement agencies in my State have been provided invaluable assistance by the Drug Enforcement Agency, the DEA. 
As I said, last year, 700 labs were taken down. This year, it looks like they may even exceed that number. 
The lab sites must be cleaned up promptly, and that is where the problem comes in. The responsibility initially falls on local law enforcement officials, and the drug dealers are not very concerned about what mess they leave with the community. Cleaning up the waste on these sites can cost anywhere from $4,000 to $40,000. Our law enforcement agencies are not funded to do this. Our law enforcement agencies, when I talked with the DEA and the local police and the local sheriffs around Missouri, find out they have to waste valuable manpower just babysitting the sites, keeping people away from these sites so they do not stumble in and get caught in one of these dangerous meth sites. 
For that reason, I believe we should embark on a State-Federal partnership to ensure that these labs are fully cleaned up and the nuisance is removed immediately from local communities. In the HUD-VA appropriations bill, we have included a pilot project for $2 million to go to our Department of Natural Resources for the State of Missouri, to institute a cleanup partnership between the State and local law enforcement. 
With these valuable resources, the State environmental expert will team up with local law enforcement agencies on the sites promptly and rid the town of toxic waste. The State will have funds to outfit a cleanup detail, expand that detail, and equip itself to respond to all corners of the State. The State will also have the resources to share with local governments, who must move in and respond to emergency cleanups, a process that could otherwise bankrupt many small communities. 
On a broader basis, we recognize this problem is a nationwide problem. In the Superfund measure that has been reported out of the Environment and Public Works Committee, that I hope this body will be able to take up, we provided that brownfields money can be used for toxic waste cleanups of methamphetamine sites because, in fact, they are toxic waste sites and, in essence, may be more dangerous than many of the sites already classified as toxic waste sites. 
What happens when one of these sites becomes a site for cooking meth is deadly. The meth labs can blow up--blow the front off the building. If they are in a motel, people innocently taking a room in the adjacent room may find themselves victims of a blast. But whoever comes on a site, a methamphetamine site, after cooking has occurred there, is in a very dangerous position. 
We need to crack down to the fullest extent of the law on these predators, but until we win that war we must protect our community. This effort will go a long way toward helping our law enforcement fulfill that responsibility. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I particularly thank my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts for yielding to me. I am very pleased to join with him in offering this critically important amendment. 
Late last year, Senator Kerry and I introduced legislation, which is bipartisan legislation aimed at providing support to help families give their children the kind of encouragement, love, early training and a healthy environment they need to develop their social and intellectual capacities. I have had the opportunity in my years both as Governor and in the Senate to work with children and work in the development of children. I am convinced that many of society's problems today--the high school dropout rate, drug and tobacco use, juvenile crime, even adult crime--can all be linked to inadequate child care and early childhood development opportunities. 
Let me just tell you a brief story about the first really broad-based early childhood development program that we put into effect in Missouri. Our Parents As Teachers Program was designed to provide assistance through educating and informing and giving helpful advice to parents of children from birth to 3 years old--how they could relate to the children, how they could establish better contact with the children, how they could excite the child's curiosity, to get involved with reading and learning. I was having a difficult time getting it through the Missouri legislature. I recommended it in 1981 and 1982 and 1983, and someone always had a reason to vote against it. I never got it through. 
Finally, in my last year as Governor I said we are going to make an all-out push because this program is making a difference. We were seeing in the pilot projects in four school districts that children whose parents had been in Parents As Teachers came to school ready to learn. Their parents had taken responsibility. The parents were involved in their education. They had developed the pattern of involvement. The program itself identified potential learning disabilities or physical disabilities early on, which could be best corrected at those early ages. 
I told everybody I was going to focus attention on early childhood development. Without my direct suggestion or intervention, the Director of Corrections, the Missouri Department of Corrections, the man who managed all of the prisons and the parole and probation efforts in Missouri, Dr. Leroy Black, on his own, came before the committee that was hearing testimony on Parents As Teachers. We had just gone on a major prison-building exercise in Missouri. In that 4 years of my second term we had increased the prison spaces 88 percent. People were wondering whether we could ever catch up with the prison population. 
He came before that committee with a very simple, straightforward message. He said if we want to cut down on the need to keep building prisons in the future, we are going to have to deal with early childhood development. He said the failures in early education, the failures of parental responsibility, the failures of the parents to be involved--for some care giver to make sure these children were getting an education, being taught responsibility--is the greatest cause of the increase in crime and the increase in prison population. 
He was successful. He was a great help in getting this program established on a Statewide basis. Yes, as Senator Kerry mentioned, we now have studies based on this program and others 
that show a child's social and intellectual development is deeply rooted in the early interaction and nurturing a child receives in his or her early years and the scientific research shows that infant brain development occurs much more rapidly than previously thought. 
We used to think of those cute little infants, birth to 3 years old, as being cuddly, wonderful things without much going on. But brains are developing--50 percent of a child's mature learning capabilities are developed by the age of 3. They are in a very rapid mode of development. 
Anybody who has tried to teach a child to speak two languages instead of one language will find a very small child--you think they would learn English slowly--but they will learn another language, too, just as quickly, where an adult is having a great deal of difficulty trying to learn another language. They are in a rapid mode where they can accept new inputs and they are learning rapidly. 
The role parents and adults play is critical. That is when the patterns are established for the future learning of future responsibility of the children. I had long said the first 3 years of life was the greatest learning experience for a child. I found when our son Sam was born, that the first 3 years of his life were the fastest learning experience in my life. I learned a lot more in those 3 years than I had learned in many years as Governor and various offices that I had held. 
Learning about a child and learning how important that education is, is quite an experience. Frankly, some of the people who attacked our early childhood development program, Parents As Teachers, were accusing it of being subversive. They thought it was subversive because we were encouraging government to come in and take over the raising of children. That is not the purpose of the program. We provided the parents the tools to be the first educators of the children. 
Guess what happened. It was subversive in that it hooked the parents into the child's development and well-being and welfare and education. When we are talking about discouraging children from using tobacco, and as we did in the amendment adopted this week, from using drugs, from using alcohol, parental responsibility is a vitally important part of that program. 
We believe establishing responsibility can best occur with assistance through early childhood development. Parental responsibility is very important. Yet, there are times when parents need some help. That is what the other part of this bill does. Parents today face a variety of stresses that were unheard of a generation ago. Many families with children rely on more than one paycheck. That doesn't necessarily mean two 9-to-5 paychecks. Many families are working tag-team shifts or part-time only, or own home-based businesses so one parent can always be with the children. The challenges are tremendous and the challenges are not going to get any easier. 
As we all know, the most dangerous time of the day when children engage in harmful activities, such as tobacco or drug use or crime, is between the hours after school and before parents get home from work. 
In an average week in America, over 5 million children under the age of 13 come home to an empty house. These are the kids who are most vulnerable and who engage in activities which may threaten their future. 
Providing increased funding for early childhood development and constructive after-school activities will serve as a powerful deterrent to these damaging behaviors. 
Ultimately, however, it is important to remember that the likelihood of a child growing up in a healthy, nurturing environment is most impacted by his or her parents and family. While government cannot and should not become a substitute for parents and family, we can help them become stronger by equipping them with the resources to meet every day challenges. 
The Kerry-Bond amendment achieves that goal. 
This amendment will lay the foundation needed to realize meaningful reductions in tobacco and drug use, juvenile crime, and other social ills which plague our society. 
Again, prevention is the key. Investing in early childhood development initiatives and before and after school activities is an important weapon in our fight against our Nation's unhealthy and life-threatening activities. 
The future well-being of our children is too important for us to break continually along partisan lines. I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment, and I thank my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts for his hard work and dedication to this cause.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I introduce a measure on behalf of myself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Grassley, and others which sends a strong message to the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) that the United States Senate disapproves of the agency's recent rule regarding surety bond requirements for home health agencies. 
The surety bond regulation, coupled with HCFA's implementation of the Interim Payment System (IPS) for home health, are crippling the ability of our Nation's home health agencies to provide high quality care to our Nation's seniors and disabled. 
Over this past month alone, in St. Louis, Missouri, the two largest home health providers decided to get out of the home health business--leaving hundreds of elderly and disabled patients searching for a new provider. The invaluable, dedicated services provided by the largest independent provider in St. Louis , the Visiting Nurses Association (VNA), will no longer be realized by the approximately 600 home care patients the agency has served. 
It is regrettable that a government bureaucracy is forcing a home health agency, that has served the St. Louis area for 87 years, out of the home health care business. 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires that all Medicare-participating home care agencies hold surety bonds in an amount that is not less than $50,000. This provision was modeled after a successful Florida Medicaid statute which imposes surety bonds on home care providers as a way of ensuring that only reputable businesses entered Florida's Medicaid program. 
This needed and modest idea, however, has been severely distorted by HCFA. HCFA's surety bond rule deviates from Florida's program in two major ways: 
First, the Florida program requires a $50,000 bond. HCFA's rule requires the bond amount to be the greater of $50,000 or 15 percent of the home care agency's previous year's Medicare revenues. 
Since HCFA issued its initial rule back in January of 1998, constituents in my home State have reported numerous problems in securing these bonds. These reputable individuals inform me that most bond companies are refusing to sell home care bonds under the regulation's requirements. Those few companies that are selling bonds are requiring backup collateral equal to the full face value of the bond, or personal guarantees of two or even three times the value of the bond. 
Second, the Florida program requires only new home care agencies to secure these bonds. Agencies with at least one year in the program and with no history of payment problems were exempted from the bond requirement. HCFA's rule, however, requires all Medicare-participating home care agencies to hold bonds, regardless of how long an agency has been in Medicare and regardless of the agency's good Medicare history. Further, HCFA's rule requires every home care agency to purchase new surety bonds every year. 
HCFA's rule is outrageous. These requirements and costs are unaffordable, especially for the smaller, freestanding home health agencies. HCFA's surety bond regulations threaten the existence of many small business home health providers and the essential services they provide to the most vulnerable and most frail of our society. 
The surety bond requirement reflects HCFA's attitude that all Medicare providers are suspect. Rather than keeping unscrupulous providers out of the home health business, HCFA's rule will penalize and put many decent home health agencies out of business. 
In promulgating this rule, HCFA did not consider the long-standing reputation of most home health agencies, their years of compliance with Medicare's regulations, or their history of managing and avoiding overpayments from the government. These providers have worked long and hard within the convoluted Medicare program, have abided by the rules and regulations, and have been subjected to numerous audits by fiscal intermediaries. 
HCFA's careless disregard, which has already put many conscientious law-abiding companies out of business, must be dealt with immediately. It is especially incomprehensible when the small businesses at risk provide a service so valued by the disabled and older Americans who receive it. 
On Tuesday, June 8, the Regulatory Fairness Board for Region VII held a public meeting in Frontenac, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. My Red Tape Reduction Act of 1996 created ten Regional Fairness Boards to be the eyes and ears of small business, collecting comments from small businesses on their experience with Federal regulatory agencies. The Ombudsman, created under 
the same law, is to use these comments to evaluate the small business responsiveness of agency enforcement actions. 
According to Scott George, a small business owner from Mt. Vernon, Missouri who serves on the Region VII Fairness Board, this particular meeting of the Fairness Board was dominated by testimony from smaller, freestanding home health care agencies that will be driven out of business by the HCFA regulations. They testified that more than 1,100 home health care providers nationwide have already closed their doors this year. Mr. George noted that every company that testified before the Region VII Fairness Board said they would be driven out of business by year-end. One couple traveled from Michigan to Missouri to testify that they will be out of business by the time of the Regional Fairness Board for their area holds a hearing absent relief from the HCFA regulations. 
Mr. President, concerns similar to those expressed in Missouri this Tuesday were raised with HCFA during its rulemaking. Regrettably, HCFA reacted like a quarter horse down the home stretch with blinders on, ignoring the comments submitted by small business as well as the agency's statutory obligations under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 as amended by my Red Tape Reduction Act in 1996. 
In April, at the urging of myself and other Senators, the Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy sent a letter to HCFA to advise the agency of the significant NEGATIVE impact this rule would have on small home health care providers. SBA's letter documents the deficiencies in the HCFA efforts to implement the bonding requirement. As set forth by the Chief Counsel of Advocacy, HFCA appears to have: exceeded the Congressional mandate in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, inappropriately waived the APA's requirement for a general notice of proposed rulemaking with the opportunity for comment, and bypassed the procedural and analytical safeguards provided by the Regulatory Flexibility Act as amended by my Red Tape Reduction Act in 1996. 
The SBA Office of Advocacy petitioned HCFA to exclude the provisions requiring the 15 percent bond requirement and the capitalization requirement pending a `proper and adequate analysis' of the impacts on small businesses. HCFA did not exclude these requirements. Not only does this exceed the scope of the 1997 Congressional directive, but it also imposes an undue financial burden on reputable home health agencies. Furthermore, in its June final rule, HCFA did not conduct a Regulatory Flexibility analysis of the rules impact on small home health care agencies. Instead, HCFA certified that the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. HCFA's certification is in direct conflict with the comments submitted by the Office of Advocacy and the home health care industry regarding the small business impacts of the rule. 
In 1996, Congress voted to enhance its ability to put a stop to excessive regulations and sloppy agency rulemakings. Enacted as Subtitle E of my Red Tape Reduction Act, the Congressional Review Act enhances the ability of Congress to serve as such a backstop. Senators Nickles and Reid sponsored the bipartisan, Congressional Review portion of the Red Tape Reduction Act to provide a new process for Congress to review and disapprove new regulations and to make sure regulators are not exceeding or ignoring the Congressional intent of statutory law. 
The simple fact is that HCFA has ignored everyone--Congress, the SBA, the home health industry, and most importantly the beneficiaries of home health services. Congress must therefore move expeditiously and exercise its authority under the Congressional Review Act to pass a resolution of disapproval to strike the June 1 HCFA rule because HFCA exceeded the Congressional mandate and issued this rule in total disregard of its statutory obligations under the APA, Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Red Tape Reduction Act. Although Congress did direct the agency to develop surety bonding requirements and provide a deadline for such a rule to be issued, this does not relieve the agency of its responsibility to conduct such a rulemaking in accordance with existing laws intended to ensure procedural fairness in the rulemaking process. 
The practical implication of Congress expressing its disapproval of the June rule is to require HCFA to go back and to conduct rulemaking in accordance with the intent of Congress as expressed in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and in keeping with the APA and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. As part of the rulemaking, HCFA should conduct an appropriate initial and final Regulatory Flexibility analysis in accordance with Sections 603 and 604 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Congress enacted these procedural safeguards to require agencies to assess the impact of rules such as HCFA's on small entities and to ensure that agencies choose regulatory approaches that are consistent with the underlying statute while minimizing the impacts on small entities to the extent possible. We should pass the resolution we are introducing today to ensure HCFA implements its statutory responsibilities in accordance with the law. 
While I strongly support the vigorous routing of fraud and abuse whenever and wherever it is found, Congress and HCFA must ensure the highest access to appropriate, high quality home care--because in-home care is the key to fulfilling the desire of virtually all seniors to remain independent and in their own homes. Home health provides a safety net for our Nation's elderly and disabled, and Congress must ensure that these protections continue long into the future. 
Many of the elderly and disabled being cared for at home would not be able to remain there if it were not for the services provided by this vital industry. We should clean up the fraud and abuse, not shut the industry or cut off these critical services.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the new tradition of `Father's Month' in St. Louis, Missouri founded by Mayor Clarence Harmon. Being a father myself, I know the important role that a father's nurturing can make in a child's life. A father's influence can help a child grow into a healthy, happy, well-adjusted adult. 
The purpose of `Father's Month' will be to encourage the community to actively work toward a common goal of fathers who take a larger role in the development of their children. I agree with Mayor Harmon that merely providing financial support is not enough. With the continuing efforts of St. Louis to promote events that teach positive family values and family togetherness, there is no telling how much the community can achieve. I offer Mayor Harmon and the community of St. Louis support and gratitude during `Father's Month.'

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as we speak, there is work going on on redrafting the Gramm-Roth amendment to add what I think is a vitally important provision to provide tax relief through full deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed. To me that is another very, very significant step that we should take for the purpose of fairness, the purpose of assuring that all people in this country have health care, to ensure that those who may suffer illnesses or disability as a result of the use of tobacco have adequate care when they become ill. 
The revised amendment has not yet been offered, but I rise in strong support of the Gramm-Roth amendment, because it will return a portion of the revenues raised from the tobacco tax to taxpayers who are bearing the burden of this tax increase. I am pleased to be a cosponsor. 
The objective is to discourage use of tobacco by raising the price, and certainly tax increases will do that, but the purpose of the bill should not be to raise the taxes and produce massive new Government spending. I think it is appropriate that we use this bill to provide tax relief to the people who are going to be paying increased taxes on tobacco. 
The amendment's phaseout of the marriage penalty for couples with incomes of less than $50,000 is a solid first step to eliminating the marriage penalty completely. We should be encouraging people to marry and raise their children in a marriage. 
Under current law, many two-income wage earners, particularly if they are both earning good wages, are penalized by paying higher taxes as a result of being married than they would be paying if they were single. In addition, I think it is fitting that part of the tobacco tax revenues will be used to ease the burdens of the tax increase which will be borne by Americans in the lowest tax brackets. 
I am also extremely pleased that part of these revenues will be used to eliminate another inequity in the Tax Code--the deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed. This amendment will finally--finally--make full deductibility a reality beginning next year. 
Again, it is fitting to use tobacco revenues for this purpose since two-thirds of families headed by a self-employed individual with no health insurance earn less than $50,000 a year. That is from a March 1997 Current Population Survey. I don't have in hand the statistics on the number of those people who may be tobacco users, but I suspect that it is a significant number who would be taxed by the increased cost of cigarettes who would find it difficult to make commitments, like buying health insurance, if they don't have this relief. 
Today, while the self-employed, as a result of our actions in the last couple of years, which I led and strongly supported, can deduct 45 percent of their health insurance costs, they are still not on a level playing field with large businesses which can deduct 100 percent. 
While the self-employed are slated to have full deductibility in 2007, and I am very grateful to the Members of this body who supported our efforts to get that goal, what self-employed person or family members can wait 9 more years to get sick? It just isn't going to happen. Nobody is willing to wait 9 years to get their health insurance, and we should not wait 9 years to give them fair tax treatment for buying health insurance for themselves and their families. 
An immediate increase in the deduction to 100 percent would make health insurance more affordable and accessible to 5.4 million Americans in families headed by self-employed individuals who currently have no health insurance. Full deductibility will also help bring insurance to 1.5 million children who live in households headed by self-employed individuals where there is no health insurance. 
Coverage of these self-employed individuals and their children through the self-employed health insurance deduction will enable the private sector to address the health care needs of these individuals rather than having an expensive, intrusive, and burdensome Federal bureaucracy to do it. 
It has long been my goal that the self-employed have immediate 100 percent deductibility of health insurance costs. I have sought every opportunity to achieve that goal. 
In 1995, my amendment to the Balanced Budget Act, which President Clinton vetoed, would have increased the health insurance deduction for the self-employed to 50 percent. 
In 1996, I worked with Senator Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy to include in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act an increase in the self-employed health insurance deduction incrementally over 10 years to 80 percent. 
In 1997, provisions of my Home-Based Business Fairness Act were included in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, finally increasing the deduction to 100 percent in 2007 and accelerating the phase-in over existing law. 
This year, I and others who have been strong supporters, on a bipartisan basis, of this measure worked with Chairman Domenici to include language in the budget resolution calling for funds to be available to accelerate the 100-percent deductibility of health insurance by the self-employed. 
If this tobacco bill is signed into law without full deductibility, I intend to be back--and I will be back as many times as it takes--to finish the job. Right now, full deductibility is available in 2007. I intend to be here to see it move up to an immediate deductibility to end the glaring unfairness of the discrimination against people who have to buy their own health insurance who are not provided health insurance by their employer. 
The goal of providing full deductibility of health insurance costs for the self-employed has long enjoyed broad bipartisan support. My colleague who was just on the floor has long championed it. We do have support on both sides of the aisle. We have support from small business, we have support from agriculture, because it is right, it is necessary. 
We are talking about health care. We are talking about eliminating a penalty, a tax penalty that discourages people from being able to acquire their own health insurance for themselves and their families. 
Let us continue the spirit of bipartisanship by adopting this amendment and not miss an opportunity to help the self-employed get the insurance coverage they need and deserve. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this amendment when it comes to the floor. I intend to be a cosponsor. And I trust that we will have a strong bipartisan majority for the amendment when it is offered. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. BOND. He sent a message in asking to be listed as a cosponsor. 
I want to follow up on the comments of my distinguished friend from Massachusetts, a distinguished veteran himself. He talks about the purpose of this bill being to deter teenage smoking. And I believe that we must keep our focus on that as the principal goal. 
Personally, I believe that raising the price of cigarettes alone is not going to be enough. I think we have to have 
advertising restrictions and a counteradvertising campaign. But we also must have sanctions on teenagers. If it is illegal, and if they purchase--knowingly purchase--cigarettes in violation of the law, there ought to be sanctions; there ought to be graduated sanctions. There ought to be sanctions that apply to their parents as well, because just raising the price and putting burdens only on the sellers may make this a thrill-seeking opportunity for some teenagers. I believe that among the amendments, we need to adopt that there be tougher sanctions on teenagers. 
Let me address this amendment that Senator McCain and others have presented. I was one who strongly objected to the use of the particular offset from the veterans smoking program for the highway measure. I was joined in that by my colleague, Senator Specter, the chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. And as I think all our colleagues know, Senator Specter has been temporarily sidetracked with an operation. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. We expect him to be back very shortly. 
Before he left, he and I discussed the need to offer an amendment on this measure to provide adequately for veterans health care issues. And this is a very good start. I will want to confer with Senator Specter's staff and others to find out what else we can do to make sure that the veterans of this country are adequately cared for in terms of their health care. 
Let me go back and tell people where this came from, because a lot of people were surprised when this became the offset. Well, this was the offset because it was insisted upon by the administration in its negotiations with the Congress. The smoking program for veterans came about as a result of an official in the Veterans' Administration, and yet the OMB and the White House said, `We're not going to pursue this program.' 
I have the pleasure and the responsibility of appropriating money for the Veterans' Administration. And over the last several years, I have routinely put more money in, with the support of my ranking member, Senator Mikulski. The committee, and the full committee, put in more money than has been recommended for veterans health care by the administration to make sure we keep our word to the veterans to take care of their health care needs. And in this instance, the White House has told the Veterans' Administration not to proceed with the program. When the VA officials came before our committee, I asked them if they were prepared to implement the program. They said they were not. 
I asked what they needed. They suggested hundreds of millions of dollars in administrative costs to handle the claims. They said they were not planning on administering the program. 
So they started the program through the action of an official in the Veterans' Administration, and then the higher political authority said it was time to cut it off. In negotiations with the relevant committees in the House and the Senate, they said this must be the offset for the highway bill. The highway bill was passed by both Houses and it was time that we spent highway money on highways and transportation needs. 
I do oppose the use of spending offsets from the veterans health care to pay for it under the budget rules, but in this amendment, and perhaps in additional amendments, we will have an opportunity to restore from the proceeds of the tobacco taxes money badly needed for veterans health care programs. We have met with the veterans budget group, the representatives of veterans who have suggested about a billion a year in addition is needed for veterans health care programs. That is the target that Senator Specter and I have. We will work to see if we can, through this piece of legislation, restore funding for veterans health care to make sure that we do care for our veterans. 
Our veterans are going through a time of change. The veterans' needs are different. There is more need for outpatient facilities, more need for veterans homes, more need for long-term care rather than acute care. I commend Dr. Kizer, the head of the veterans health side, for his extraordinarily strong efforts in spite of the difficulties posed in reforming the Veterans' Administration health care to make sure that the health care being provided to the veterans is what they need. 
There have been some tough measures taken. In my State, they cut off the surgery center in one community on our southern border because they said they weren't doing enough surgeries to maintain proficiency. Frankly, this was not popular when you looked at it from the community as a whole. But I can tell you, the veterans who were to receive surgery, and their families, are certainly better served if those veterans can be given that service in an area where they perform frequent operations and maintain their proficiency. We have opened, instead, veterans primary health care facilities around the State so veterans don't have to travel 100 or 150 miles one way to get primary health care. 
I commend the Veterans' Administration for moving in the right direction to make health care readily accessible to those veterans who are entitled to health care programs. We need to continue on that path. We need to continue to see that we are providing the kind of health care services in the location and in the format where they are most needed. This amendment by Senator McCain is an excellent step in the right direction. 
I will go back to work in an hour with the Environment and Public Works Committee, which is having a meeting on the technical corrections, because I agree with the comments of Senator McCain that putting phraseology about willful misconduct as it relates to cigarette smoking is totally uncalled for. At this point, no one seems to be able to pinpoint the draftsmanship of it. But wherever it came from, it was wrong. I think it was wrong to take the money as an offset in the first place. But it is certainly unacceptable for us to have a policy statement saying that veterans who smoked the cigarettes that were given to them by the military--at smoking times designated by the military when they turned the smoking light 
on, when they provided cigarettes, the C rations, when they provided cigarettes in smoking areas--to say they were doing something wrong when they took advantage of the cigarettes and smoked is not only nonsensical, it is outrageous. We apologize to the veterans of America. We need to change that. That is totally unacceptable. 
We hope by passing this amendment that we will begin to get the resources that are needed to the Veterans' Administration to provide for the health care needs of our veteran population. The Veterans' Administration is doing some wonderful things. They have made great advances, treating injuries that came out of wartime. They are now becoming more and more experienced and more skillful in dealing with problems that aging veterans have. We do have a significant aging veterans population. That makes the localized, primary care facilities, privately contracted health care clinics for veterans much more accessible and therefore convenient to veterans. We need to have these additional resources available to the Veterans' Administration so we can meet our commitment to the veterans and make sure that they receive the kind of health care they have a right to expect and which we think they have earned. 
I appreciate very much the leadership that Senator McCain has provided on this. With all of the other cosponsors, I am confident we will have an opportunity to get a good, strong vote on behalf of this measure. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment when it comes before the Senate on Thursday. As I indicated, we will be conferring with Senator Specter as he recuperates. I know he has strongly supported veterans and wanted to be here for this amendment. We are doing this in his behalf and will continue to work with him to provide additional resources for veterans as and where we can find them and they are necessary. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to say a very quick word or two about the TEA-21 , I believe, Transportation Efficiency Act of the year 2000 and to express my deep appreciation for the leadership that Chairman Chafee, Chairman Warner and Senator Baucus have provided. This, as has been said, is one of the very largest bills that we have acted upon. It has an impact on each of our States and will have for the next 6 years. 
It has been a very difficult fight to raise the dollars necessary and to allocate them fairly. I express the deepest appreciation to all three of my colleagues I mentioned. 
I want to say what tremendous work has been done by the staff on the majority side, Jimmie Powell, Ann Loomis, Dan Corbett; on the minority side, Tom Sliter and Kathy Ruffalo. 
On my own staff, Tracy Henke has worked literally hundreds of hours and has had very little sleep, as all of the staff on Environment and Public Works. They have done an outstanding job. 
When we started this process, I said there were five essential goals: Increase the funding for highways. We need a bigger pie. We need, for the State of Missouri, to get a fair share. We must upgrade and repair deteriorating bridges. We need to put the trust back into the highway trust fund so that people who pay gas taxes into the trust fund will know that those gas taxes are coming back to build better roads, bridges, highways and transportation system. Finally, there should be flexibility so the States and localities can get the most for their money. 
I am delighted they have approved all those principles. I note for the Record what I have noted in committees, in conferences, in individual discussions. I have grave and deep problems with and do not agree with the use of the funds from a newly and administratively created veterans' smoking program to offset the expenditures of the highway fund. I believe the highway fund should be spent for highways; veterans' funds should be spent for veterans. I have fought those battles; I have lost those battles because the President has insisted on using that as an offset. I intend to come back and work with colleagues, such as Chairman Specter of the Veterans' Committee, Senator McCain, Senator Smith and others to put a good veterans health care measure into the next vehicle, and I believe that is probably going to be the tobacco bill. 
We are going to see that our veterans are cared for. I realize that offsets are needed. I do not think we should have taken this one. But for our State, we are going to receive tremendous benefits in Missouri. This is nearly a 53-percent increase in the annual funding for the State of Missouri where our roads, highways and bridges are not just a matter of convenience, they are a matter of life and death. Safety depends upon adequate roads. 
For the first time, we are going to see our share of the funds moving up from the low 80 cents per $1 sent in to almost 92 cents. We will see a structure to ensure the gas taxes will be used for highways and transportation. The flexibility is expanded and for good measure. 
I thank the leaders for agreeing to my wetlands banking amendment which will enable us to ensure improved protection for wetlands in accommodating the highway construction. 
Last year, I worked with people on both sides to put through the Bond extension which kept the highway funding flowing until May 1 of this year. We have not had contract 
authority, obligation authority for the last month. I believe the President, through his Secretary of Transportation, expressed great appreciation for this measure, and I hope that we can pass it today and get it signed by the President so we can go back to rebuilding the roads, bridges and highways that are vitally important for our country. 
I thank the leader and thank the leadership of the committee.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on January 31, 1998, a long time friend and a true hero of the agriculture world retired. I rise today to pay tribute to B.L. `Bud' Frew who presided over MFA, Inc. for twelve years as President and CEO. Bud has been a most-trusted advisor when it comes to policy and issues that impact production agriculture and rural America. 
Bud says that one of the most important accomplishments of his tenure was to instill the idea that everyone has the opportunity to make a contribution to MFA. He felt that the honor in farming had reached a low in the 1970's. Bud took it upon himself single handedly to raise the pride of farmers back to the level of old days when a handshake was a handshake and your word was your word. Maybe that is why he received Missouri Farm Bureau's highest award, Agricultural Leaders of Tomorrow's Recognition of Leadership Award, Ag Leader of the Year from Missouri Ag Industries and Man of the Year for Agriculture from Missouri Ruralist magazine. 
He is experienced, wise, practical, honest, reflects the collective common-sense views of rural Missourians' and has the courage to fight for a position that may not be fashionable. Additionally, he has the quality that any doer and great leader has. He knows how to pick his battles and he knows how to win those battles he picks. Those closest to him know that Bud has the two things it takes to be a successful businessman: character and integrity. 
I am sorry to see him go because he has been a hero for MFA and a critical leader for Missouri agriculture. However, besides all this, Bud is my friend so I am glad that he may have some time for himself and his family. I hope I am on his fishing invitation list. However, I warn him that he will still be called upon by me and my staff when the tough questions arise. On behalf of rural Missouri, I say to Bud, congratulations and thanks.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, every year Ebony magazine pays tribute to thirty leaders ages thirty and younger who are working for the betterment of their communities. They all represent the caliber of talent that is being groomed to move to the fore front of society and lead the United States of America into the 21st century. This year Metro East Family Church of East St. Louis, Illinois will be honoring the `30 Young Leaders of the Future,' featured in the December 1997 issue of Ebony Magazine. It is a great honor to congratulate each of Ebony magazine's selection of young leaders of the future, but especially the two from my home State of Missouri. 
Reverend Eric Mason, 25, is the pastor of Administration at the Metro East Family Church. Formerly, he was a case manager at the Nebraska Health and Human Services Department, then an assistant pastor and education director at Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church and was appointed by the Governor of Nebraska to the Affirmative Action Commission as chaplain. He served as the Chair of the Omaha Police Department, on the Legal Redress Committee, was a member of Omaha NAACP, and the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance. Reverend Mason personifies everything positive in the St. Louis community and I am excited to learn of his influential leadership. 
Faustenia Morrow, 25, is the development administrator for Team Sweep, a youth-at-risk program run by the City of St. Louis. She also is President of Young Organized Political Action Committee and fundraising chairperson of Metropolis St. Louis, an organization with the goal of attracting and retaining professionals in St. Louis. In addition, Ms. Morrow is assistant campaign advisor for Missouri State Representative Betty Thompson, founding member of the Sisters of High Tea, an organization of professional women and a member of the Professional Organization of Women. Her continuing commitment to the St. Louis community is a positive example for all and I am extremely pleased to have her as a role model for others. 
Dedication to one's community has become an increasingly rare quality in our society. However, Ebony's selection of young leaders has shown that the most effective approach to enriching a community is to give back rather than to take. Their unselfish commitment has set a precedence for the generations before and after them to follow and implement. I salute the contributions made by these leaders, and join the Metro East Family Church of East St. Louis in paying tribute to the `30 Young Leaders of the Future.'

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Missouri radio and television stations for their contributions to public service. This year, in a survey conducted for the Missouri Broadcasting Association by Public Opinion Strategies, it was determined that Missouri Broadcasters aired $44 million worth of public service announcements (PSA) in 1997. This amount was fourth best among the thirty-eight states who participated. 
The survey reported that Missouri television stations air an average of 175 PSAs each week and radio stations air an average of seventy-five per week. That comes to a total of 18,775 PSAs weekly. Every television station and 94 percent of radio stations in Missouri participated in fundraising efforts for charitable organizations last year. Those organizations received a total of $17.3 million in charitable donations because of the on-air PSAs made by Missouri's broadcasters. 
The most frequent PSAs dealt with drug and alcohol prevention and abuse. Other common PSAs covered anti-crime efforts, hunger, poverty, the homeless, anti-violence and AIDS prevention. No other industry can make the impact that broadcasters can make. I am proud to say that the Missouri broadcasters are some of the best. 
I commend the Missouri broadcasters for their untiring dedication in helping charitable causes in Missouri. It does make a difference and people are benefitting from these broadcasters' efforts. I join the many who thank the Missouri broadcasters for their support throughout the year. Whether it be charities, weather warnings or public health announcements, I know the Missouri broadcasters will be on-air to lead the cause.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, a very popular Sunday night television show, entitled, `Touched by an Angel' focuses on stories where people's lives have been affected in a positive way by angels who are sent from Heaven to serve among us. 
I rise today to pay tribute and honor a very dear friend who might just qualify as one of those angels that serves to minister to his fellow man. 
This past week, a former Presiding Commissioner of Cape Girardeau County, Gene Huckstep, completed his successful service on Earth just before reaching his 70th birthday. 
Gene Huckstep was widely loved and universally respected, but he was at first appearance not one you would figure to be an angel. Gene was a powerfully-built man who could be as rough as he needed to be. He laughingly told stories about his educational career, which at times bordered on juvenile delinquency. He was sent in the military to shape up. 
Then, in a career fueled with brushes with death, by his calculation he used up about 39 lives. In the Army as a tank driver he once was badly burned when the tank caught fire when it was being refueled, and another time when his tank went into water 25 feet deep he barely escaped drowning. 
After his service career he returned to his native Cape Girardeau and saw death and destruction first-hand when the May 21, 1949 tornado struck. After taking a baby from the hands of a dying man impaled on a two-by-four, he searched for other survivors and fell into a cellar fracturing three vertebrae and leaving him in a body cast from hip to neck. 
His outstanding service to his fellow man began in 1965 when his family-owned body shop bought a gas-powered saw which led law enforcement agencies to begin to call on Gene to rescue victims in serious car accidents. 
He faced many life and death situations cutting people out of burning automobiles to save their lives; in some cases losing the battle to flames before he could extricate them. 
One time he was trying to retrieve a drowning victim when friends on the bank saw swarms of cottonmouth water moccasins coming toward him. They pulled him out with a grappling hook that saved him from potentially fatal snake bites. 
Over his career in 22 years he personally extricated victims from 1,976 serious car accidents. For these victims and their families, Gene Huckstep truly was an angel. 
His service to mankind continued well beyond his extrication business. In 1978 he was elected Presiding Commissioner of Cape Girardeau County with strong bipartisan support and led the way on many improvements in the county including a new jail, a veterans home, and many other worthwhile benefits. 
In the private sector he led the drive for a new emergency room at St. Francis Hospital, and he served as Chairman of the Board of Cameron Mutual Insurance Company. 
His specific charitable contributions are far too many to recount, but it is safe to say he left his community a far better place because he touched so many things for the good of the community and his fellow man. 
As one who was blessed by his friendship as well as his political support, I shall always remember his generosity, his good humor, and his genuine concern for others. Our thoughts and prayers are with his lovely wife Betty, his family, and his many close friends. I shall always treasure his memory and the fact that he was spared from dangerous situations so many times to carry on his work among the people of southeast Missouri.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, On May 31, 1998, Ross P. Marine, DHL, MHA, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Trinity Luthern Hospital, Kansas City, Missouri, and former Administrator, Truman Medical Center East (Truman East), and the Director of Public Health for the Jackson County Health Department (JCHD), is receiving the Citizen of the Year award from UNICO/Kansas City Chapter. As the recipient, he may select a charity of his choice to receive half the proceeds from the awards dinner. Mr. Marine has chosen to give his donation to the Truman Medical Center East Auxiliary's commitment to the renovation of the Obstetrics Unit into a new Labor, Delivery, Recovery and Post-partum wing at Truman East. 
UNICO stands for Unity, Neighborliness, Integrity, Clarity and Opportunity and is a national organization made up of men and women of Italian descent who work for positive community service. A Board member or current officer nominates the candidate, for Citizen of the year. Candidates must have an interest in their community and working with others to make their community a better place. 
Mr. Marine has continually shown that he not only has concern for the betterment of his community, but has also taken a leadership role. He made health care more accessible by starting five public health outreach facilities. Truman East received $38 million in renovation and expansion because of Mr. Marine's efforts. While embracing the credo of UNICO, `Service above Self,' he has helped his community and therefore Missouri as a whole. He has been appointed to numerous Boards of Directors and received many awards for all his outstanding achievements. 
Commending Mr. Marine for his many years of service to his community and the field of medicine, I am glad to say that the State of Missouri is enriched with his wisdom and leadership. I join the many who congratulate and thank him for his hard work and wish him continued success in future years.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, across our great nation there are thousands of teachers dedicated to the development of young minds. In Missouri, as a former Governor and U.S. Senator, I have had the opportunity to meet many educators and have a great deal of admiration for their commitment to our youth. 
I have found, however, some teachers are special and go beyond the call of duty to lead their students toward a rewarding and productive life. Today, I rise to speak about one such teacher who is retiring this year, Nicholas `Nick' Leist. 
For thirty-six years Mr. Leist has dedicated his life teaching music to young people in Missouri. Mr. Leist has not only been an educator, he has been a friend and inspiration to literally thousands of students. Over the last thirty years, he has taught more than 9,000 students at Jackson High School, and his musicians have had a phenomenal record, having achieved twenty-seven consecutive number one ratings at district music contests. More than eight dozen students have gone on to become teachers themselves, following in the steps of their mentor. 
On May 5, 1998, Mr. Leist conducted his last Jackson High School band concert which brought tears to the eyes of students and their Mr. Leist. They will miss Nick Leist at Jackson High School next year; however, the impact he had on students will live on for generations through the people he inspired to greater personal heights. I join the many who wish Mr. Leist happiness in the years to come.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an exemplary program in Missouri, the Leadership Training Institute for Youth (LTI). Every year at Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, Missouri this leadership camp is held for youth from all over America. This camp inspires youth to work toward their goals and to achieve personal excellence. 
With the leadership of Dr. Pat Briney, the attendees learn leadership skills through Christian values. LTI helps to guide youth through their most confusing years and teaches them coping mechanisms for future problems. 
LTI represents the kind of spirit, honor and integrity that belong with today's youth leaders. I commend LTI staff and participants for their energy and faith to Christian values and hope they continue their important mission for years to come.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Earth Angels in my home State of Missouri. Earth Angels received the Award for Environmental Sustainability from Renew America. They were among twenty-eight winners from more than 1,600 applicants who exemplify Earth Day. 
Earth Angels is a branch of the Guardian Angel Settlement Association in St. Louis, Missouri. The group is made up of more than 150 inner city children and led by Neil Andre, Director of Earth Angels. Their projects range from recycling to planting trees in their Forest of Life to collecting money for other environmental groups. The group is supported by selling `Earth Angel stock.' People who buy into the group get a quarterly newsletter with their latest project updates. Earth Angels gives `at risk' children a chance to be part of an important cause and organization. 
Commending Neil Andre and the Earth Angels for their Award for Environmental Sustainability, I wish them continued success in the future. It is extremely gratifying to learn of a group of children doing so much to help our environment. Congratulations for a job well done.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my colleague and co-chair of the Senate National Guard Caucus, Senator Ford to introduce a bill today to bolster the recognition of the National Guard and reserve components by the Department of Defense. The bill entitled the National Guard and Reserve Components Equity Act of 1998. 
Since the Senate National Guard Caucus was established in 1987, Senator Ford and I and the sixty five other members have worked tirelessly to insure the adequate resourcing of the National Guard and reserves. This year will be Senator Ford's final year as Caucus co-chair. I will sorely miss his advise and counsel. The legislation we lay before you this day is testimony to his commitment to improving the quality of life standards for our nations active, Guard and reserve component service members. He and I have worked to include major quality of life and resourcing issues highlighted by reserve and National Guard Associations. 
This bill seeks to provide overdue recognition and benefits to the nation's reservists and Guard personnel and their families. For too long, the nation's reservists and National Guardsmen and women have been the recipients of less than a full commitment by the Department of Defense. The bill we have introduced will stir some controversy I am sure, but these men and women deserve our support. As we ask more and more of our reserve and Guard we owe it to the people who we ask to go into harm's way, to provide them with equality in pay, equality in fielded equipments and equality in training. We owe it to their families to provide them with equal access to commissaries and space available travel. We owe it to them to continue reservist eligibility for VA home loans and repeal Montgomery Bill limitations for Selected Reservists. We need to do all this and more. We must also recognize the sacrifices made by reservist and Guard employers. This bill addresses each of these issues. We must remove any semblance of second class status from the shoulders of these professional and dedicated individuals. 
Reserve and Guard components are being called upon to integrate themselves into the tactical operations of the nation's defense plans, in order to do this effectively, the systems used by the components must be compatible. That is not the case today. In many instances, radios and data transfer equipments are incompatible. For instance many artillery units operate independently because they are unable to coordinate their operations. I could hardly believe it, but many fighter aircraft units suffer the same fate, and you can imagine that the theater commanders don't care to have independent fighter units involved in heavily coordinated and multi-national operations. Digitization, situational awareness data link upgrades and avionics modernization of reserve and Guard units is imperative. This bill directs the Secretary of Defense to develop a master plan for the modernization of these components. 
The bill also addresses the use of Guard and reserve component personnel in response to an emergency involving a weapon of mass destruction; to include their integration with efforts of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
Family issues are addressed, as well. As I mentioned earlier, there are provisions for demonstration program for unlimited use of military commissionaries by reserve component members, and for the development of rules governing Space Available Travel for reservists and their families. 
I urge my colleagues to review this bill, sign on and help us to provide these and other long overdue measures to bring equity in individual recognition and resource allocation to these vital components of our national security.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the conference report and urge my colleagues to oppose the motion to recommit. For those in agriculture, it is critical that we move this in a prompt and expedited fashion and avoid any additional delay. The time for passage is now. 
I congratulate Chairman Lugar, Senator Harkin and their staffs who have labored for months to bring this legislation before us. Simply put, agriculture needs this now. Included in it are urgent reforms and funding necessary to avoid a crisis which would undermine the viability of crop insurance--a safety net that farmers in my State and across the country cannot do without. This legislation is fully offset and paid for and is supported by a united agriculture industry. After months of careful and deliberate negotiations, a bipartisan agreement with the administration has been developed. It was an agreement with the administration and it takes into account the need to get the President's signature on it. I believe the work of the conferees should be applauded and endorsed with our support today. 
I am particularly interested in the research title. We expect to see the world's population double in the next 30 years. The demand for food is expected to triple in the next 50 years. The world's population wants more food, cheaper food, more nutritious food, safer food, food that is easier to prepare and they want it produced on less land with fewer chemicals and in a more environmentally sensitive manner. 
Those individuals who produce food and fiber for this world today--encumbered with what otherwise would be conflicting mandates--have never faced a greater challenge. Technology is the answer. 
Remarkably, plant technology in this half-century has helped make it possible for the farmer, who in 1940 fed 19 people, to feed 129 people today. 
Nobel prize-winning chemist Robert F. Curl of Rice University proclaimed that: `* * * it is clear that the 21st will be the century of biology.' The March 27 article in Science Magazine entitled: `A Third Technological Revolution,'--after the Industrial and Computer-based revolutions--contends that: `Ultimately, the world will obtain most of its food, fuel, fiber, chemicals and some of its pharmaceuticals from genetically altered vegetation and trees.' 
The possibilities are breathtaking and the U.S. is poised to lead the third technological revolution as we unlock the secrets plant-by-plant and now, genome-by-genome. 
Simply put, this research is about meeting the world's growing nutritional needs, protecting U.S. jobs and preserving the environment. 
The legislation before us looks ahead to the challenges of the 21st century by providing additional funding on what all of us back home say is a priority; research. It provides $600 million for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems. This will augment our federal commitment to undertake cutting-edge research in priority areas such as genome studies, biotechnology, food safety, precision agriculture and new use development. 
I cite as an example, the University of Missouri has just tested a new hybrid corn which when fed to swine reduces phosphorous in manure by a whopping 37 percent. The Monsanto Company, in my State, is using biotechnology to produce cotton plants with genes that produce colors to reduce the need for chemical dyeing. From the corn plant, they have produced a human-like antibody that holds promise for allowing cancer patients to tolerate more frequent doses of a tumor-shrinking drug. The possibilities are breathtaking and the U.S. is leading the charge. 
Let me say one thing to those who represent agriculture states. Almost 70 percent of the USDA budget is not for research or export promotion or conservation or for subsidies to farmers--it is for food and nutrition programs, primarily the food stamp program. For those who have watched over the years as a greater and greater percentage of USDA funds have gone to welfare, often at the expense of programs that assist farmers and conservation, this legislation moves $1 billion back to agriculture. 
While I understand that some here today would like to see less money for food stamps for legal immigrants, others would like to see more. I recall that the Administration proposed in their budget that all this administrative savings go for legal immigrants and have threatened to veto crop insurance and research if it didn't also include funding for food stamps for legal immigrants. 
The food stamp provisions of this act are an essential step to providing much needed assistance to certain legal immigrants. Attempts to undo this carefully-crafted bipartisan compromise will result in delay and ultimately undermine the entire bill. 
The bipartisan leaders have worked hard to craft a bill that the President will accept. There should be no further delay and I urge my colleagues to reject the motion to recommit and move swiftly to final adoption of the conference report.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on May 19, an endowed lectureship, at Washington University in my home State of Missouri, will be named in honor of Louis Avioli, M.D., for his contribution to the field of bone and mineral metabolism. Washington University and St. Louis University employ the largest group of bone research scientists in the world. Dr. Avioli is known as a legend in this field and for good reason. 
Dr. Avioli is the founder of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR), and is responsible for individually combining the growing research interests beginning from a large range of disciplines into what is now the top scientific society devoted to bone and mineral research. The membership of ASBMR has grown to more than 3,000 scientists and more than 5,000 attend the annual convention. Dr. Avioli has been appointed to numerous positions, been published countless times and has several honorary degrees. 
With so many impressive accomplishments, it is no wonder an endowed lectureship is named in his honor. Commending Dr. Avioli for his many years of service to the field of bone and mineral metabolism, I am glad to say that the State of Missouri is enriched with his wisdom and leadership. I join the many who congratulate and thank him for his hard work and wish him continued success in future years.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. Inez Kaiser for being named 1997 National Minority Advocate of the Year. She received this prestigious award from the United States Department of Commerce's Minority in Business Development Agency (MBDA). Dr. Kaiser is president of Inez Kaiser & Associates, Inc., the oldest African-American female-owned public relations firm in the United States. 
Dr. Kaiser was chosen for the award based on her forty+ years of advocacy on behalf of minority business development. In addition to her untiring efforts to expand minority roles in the business industry, she was a consultant and advisor to former Presidents Nixon and Ford on minority women's business issues and organized the first nationwide conference of Women in Business for the United States Department of Commerce. Over the years she has strived to help other minority businesses by identifying their problems and offering advice on how to address those problems. Being the only African-American female in the National Hall of Fame of Women in Public Relations, she is also the president of the National Association of Minority Women in Business. 
Dr. Kaiser has set a positive example for minority business people everywhere and it is a pleasure to see her impressive accomplishments receive the recognition they deserve. My home State of Missouri is extremely fortunate to have such a shining example of success and hard work. I wish her continued prosperity and achievement in the coming years.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today with an amendment, which I offer for myself and my colleague, Senator Moseley-Braun, to improve electronic filing of tax and information returns. After working with the managers, I believe we now have an agreement on this amendment, and I send that amendment to the desk. 
The bill we are now considering contains far-reaching provisions that will encourage the Internal Revenue Service to expand the use of electronic filing. My amendment improves those provisions in two ways. First, my amendment makes it absolutely clear that electronic filing of tax returns should be voluntary--not another burdensome government mandate on American taxpayers. While the bill calls on the IRS to make electronic filing the `preferred and most convenient means for filing,' it also establishes a goal of 80 percent electronic filing of tax returns by 2007. Without a clear statement of congressional intent, it will be too easy for the IRS to interpret those provisions as requiring electronic filing by certain taxpayers or in certain circumstances. 
As the Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have heard over the past 2 years from hundreds of small businesses about a similar government mandate--the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System or EFTPS. Under the statute establishing this system, the Treasury is required to collect certain percentages of tax electronically each year. To implement that requirement, the IRS established thresholds based on a business' past employment tax deposits. Regrettably, the IRS established the thresholds to serve its convenience rather than the taxpayer's. As a result, it now appears that far more taxpayers are required to pay their taxes electronically than the law requires. 
While EFTPS deals with electronic payment of taxes, as opposed to filing of tax returns as we are addressing in this bill, it is a clear example of how the intent of Congress can be misinterpreted and result in an onerous mandate, in this case on America's small businesses. My amendment cuts that misunderstanding off at the pass. As the IRS develops new programs and procedures for electronic filing, they must not be forced down the throats of the country's taxpayers. If they are truly convenient and cost effective, taxpayers will volunteer in droves to file their tax returns electronically, just as they have with the IRS' TeleFile program. And those taxpayers who, for one reason or another, decide that electronic filing is not practical, should be permitted to continue filing paper returns. 
Second, my amendment expands the reporting requirements under the bill to ensure that the IRS pays particular attention to electronic-filing issues pertaining to small business. The bill currently requires that the Treasury Secretary, the IRS Commissioner, and the advisory group on electronic filing to report annually to the Congress on the progress made in expanding the use of electronic filing. 
I commend the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee for including representatives of small business on the advisory group as I proposed. My amendment capitalizes on that small business voice, by requiring that the report to Congress include an analysis of the effects of electronic filing on small enterprises. If we are to prevent another burdensome program like EFTPS, I believe we must require the IRS to focus on how electronic-filing programs will affect small business. It will be of little benefit to the government if new electronic-filing programs include new requirements, like a substantial investment in new equipment, since most small businesses will not be able to participate. In addition, if the IRS pays particular attention to the issues facing small businesses in this areas, the agency will be better equipped to market and promote the benefits of electronic filing--a 100 percent improvement over the agency's initial efforts to encourage small firms to use EFTPS. 
I fully endorse the intent of this legislation to make electronic filing widely available, cost effective, and an attractive option. My amendment fine tunes the bill to ensure that the intent becomes a reality. With the continuing advances in technology, we have an enormous opportunity to make all taxpayers' lives easier. But with technological advances comes the risk of imposing even more burdens on taxpayers, and Congress must make sure that these improvements are not implemented at the expense of the taxpayers, and especially the small businesses, who are expected to benefit from them. My amendment is designed to achieve that goal.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as an original cosponsor with Senator Bob Kerrey of the `Children's Hospitals Education and Research Act of 1998.' This bill seeks to address an unintended inequity in federal support for graduate medical education. If not addressed, this inequity will jeopardize the future of the pediatric health care work force as well as the pediatric biomedical research enterprise for our nation's children. 
Specifically, this bill will provide capped, time-limited, interim commensurate federal funding for the nearly 60 independent children's teaching hospitals, including the children's hospitals in Kansas City and St. Louis, which are so important to the training of the nation's physicians who serve children. They are equally important to the conduct of research to benefit children's health and health care. 
Let me illustrate the magnitude of the inequity in federal investment in graduate medical attention (GME). In 1977, the federal Medicare program reimbursed teaching hospitals, on average, more than $76,000 for each resident trained. In contrast, Medicare reimbursed independent children's teaching hospitals--children's hospitals that do not share a Medicare provider number with a larger medical institution--less than $400 per resident, because children's hospitals care for children, not the elderly, and therefore do not serve Medicare patients, except for a small number of children with end stage renal disease. 
Until recently, this inequity was not a problem as long as all payers of health care were willing to reimburse teaching hospitals enough for their patient care to cover the extra costs of GME. As the health care market has become increasingly competitive, it has become harder and harder for all teaching hospitals to generate patient care revenues to help cover their GME costs. But only independent children's teaching hospitals face these competitive pressures without the significant federal GME support, which the rest of the teaching hospital community relies upon. 
This is more than a problem for the financial well-being of the education programs of a small number of children's hospitals--less than one percent of the nation's hospitals. It is a problem for our entire pediatric workforce and pediatric research enterprise, because these institutions play such a disproportionately large role in academic medicine for children. On average, their education programs are equal in size to the GME programs of all teaching hospitals, but they train twice as many residents per bed as do other teaching hospitals. 
As a consequence, independent children's teaching hospitals train about 5 percent of all physicians, 25 percent of all pediatricians, and the majority of many pediatric subspecialists who care for children with the most complex conditions, such as children with cancer, cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy, and more. 
Recommendations to address the inequity in federal GME support for children's teaching hospitals are supported by the National Association of Children's Hospitals as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs. Last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote to President Clinton, to express support for the establishment of interim federal support for the GME program of freestanding, independent children's hospitals. The AAP said, `(w)e regard the education programs of independent children's hospitals as important to our pediatric workforce and therefore to the future health of all children, because they educate an important proportion of the nation's pediatricians.' 
Last year, many members of the Senate, including myself, recommended that any comprehensive reform of graduate medical education financing should include commensurate federal GME support for children's teaching hospitals. Instead of enacting GME reform, Congress directed the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare and the Medicare Payment Assessment Commission to prepare recommendations for the future of GME financing, including for children's teaching hospitals. 
Since it will be at least another year before Congress receives those recommendations and potentially several years before Congress is able to act on them, the `Children's Hospitals Education and Research Act' will provide interim funding for just four years. It will be commensurate to federal GME support for all teaching hospitals. Specifically, the bill provides, in a capped fund, $100 million in FY 1999 and $285 million in each of the three succeeding fiscal years, for eligible institutions. It will be financed by general revenues, not Medicare HI Trust Funds. 
I know what a critical role children's hospitals play in the ability of families and communities to care for all children, including children with the most complex conditions and children on families with the most limited economic means. Through their education and research programs, they are also devoted to serving future generations of children, too. Certainly, the children of Missouri as well as Kansas and Southern Illinois, depend vitally on the services and research of independent children's teaching hospitals such as Children's Mercy in Kansas City, St. Louis Children's Hospital, and Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital, and the care givers they educate. 
Children's hospitals are places of daily miracles. Healing that we would never have thought possible a few years ago for children who are burn victims, or trauma victims, or even cancer victims now occurs daily at these hospitals. And while I am sure divine intervention plays a role in this healing, it is also due to the very hard work of skilled doctors, nurses, and dedicated staff that is second to none. We must therefore ensure that these facilities have the resources to continue their noble mission of saving children from the clutches of death and disease. 
I know trustees, and medical and executive leaders of these institutions. All are committed to controlling the cost of children's health to the best of their ability. But their future ability to sustain their education and research programs will also depend on commensurate federal GME support for them. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the enactment of the `Children's Hospital Education and Research Act.'

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act that we are now considering. Over the past several months Senator Roth and his Finance Committee have done an exemplary job of reviewing the legislation sent to us by the House and identifying ways to improve and strengthen that bill. And it's been well worth the wait. I also commend my colleague from Delaware and his committee for including a number of the proposals that I introduced as part of my Putting the Taxpayer First Act, earlier this year. They represent suggestions that I received from Missourians and small business owners across the country, who have called, written, and stopped me on the street to stress the need for IRS reform and greater taxpayer rights. 
While I believe we have made substantial progress toward that goal, one aspect of this bill continues to trouble me--the creation of the so-called oversight board. As currently proposed, a majority of this board will consist of six individuals who must split their time between watching over the IRS and running their private-sector businesses--each of which can be more than a full-time job. And even if these individuals can dedicate sufficient time, their ability to make real changes for the benefit of taxpayers amounts to little more than advice to the Commissioner, which he may or may not decide to take. 
Despite these issues, the creation of a part-time board has been portrayed by many as the linchpin of solving the problems at the IRS. But when has such a part-time advisory board ever turned around a governmental agency as vast as the IRS and with such a poor record of service to millions of Americans? I have searched for a comparable success story within our government, and came up dry. And while some point to Canada's Revenue Office as an example, Canada's part-time board is still on the drawing board. Consequently, I think we are placing too much reliance on the untested and unproven concept of a part-time board to bring fundamental change to the IRS. 
If we are going to create a board to steer the IRS back on course, let's do more than add some window dressing to this troubled agency. America's taxpayers deserve a well-managed agency committed to service. The amendment I offer today establishes the framework to accomplish that goal. 
Mr. President, my amendment creates an independent, full-time Board of Governors for the IRS, which will exercise top-level administrative management over the agency. The Board of Governors will have full responsibility, authority, and accountability for the IRS' enforcement activities, such as examinations and collections, which are often at the heart of taxpayer complaints about the IRS. In addition, the Board will oversee the Office of the Taxpayer Advocate and the new independent appeals function required by the bill. 
Under my amendment, the Board of Governors will consist of five members appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, each with a staggered five-year term. Four of the members will be drawn from the private sector. Overall these members will bring private-sector experience critical to the management of an agency like the IRS. Of equal importance, they will bring the perspective of the diverse group of taxpayers the IRS must serve, including individuals and small and large businesses. The fifth member of the Board will be the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who will also serve as the Chairman of the Board of Governors. 
The board I envision through this amendment corrects the major weaknesses of the bill's part-time advisory board. First, my full-time Board of Governors is a permanent solution to the management difficulties that have plagued the IRS for years. It seems like little more than a token gesture to create an oversight board for the IRS and have it expire after 10 years, as set out in the bill. If a board is expected to turn the IRS around, wouldn't it make sense to continue the reason for that success story? 
Second, my full-time Board of Governors will have real authority to make a difference. The Board's direction is to `oversee the Internal Revenue Service in the administration, management, conduct, direction, and supervision of the execution and application of the internal revenue laws or related statutes and tax conventions to which the United States is a party.' The only exception to this broad authority is that the Board will have only a consultative role in developing tax policy. 
In contrast, the part-time advisory board recommended by the Finance Committee starts with broad authority but is quickly whittled down essentially to an advisory role. For instance, the part-time board would have no responsibility or authority with respect to tax policy. In my view, good tax policy must take into account more than just revenue and collections; it must consider the burdens that the law imposes on the taxpayers and the corresponding burdens involved in administering and enforcing those laws. A full-time Board of Governors managing the IRS will be uniquely qualified to provide critical perspective and feedback to the Treasury Department in crafting future tax proposals. 
Similarly, the bill's part-time board would have no responsibility or authority over specific IRS law enforcement activities or personnel actions. 
These restrictions fly in the face of the testimony that the Finance Committee received just last week, not to mention to committee's hearings last fall. Each of us was shocked by the taxpayers and IRS employees who came forward with accounts of poor service and abuse, and many of these cases involved IRS examination or collection activities. Moreover, these horror stories merely echo the countless letters and calls that each of us receives from taxpayers embroiled in disputes with the IRS in our home states. 
Can any of us suggest, with a straight face, that creating a part-time advisory board will `fix' the IRS when that board cannot know about or address specific enforcement or personnel problems? While I am not suggesting that the IRS board should address every taxpayer grievance, the board should be able to take action with respect to specific types of examination and collection problems and those that involve IRS personnel. 
Some will argue that the expansion of the taxpayer-confidentiality rules addresses this issue. I must disagree. The information that the part-time board will receive under this provision is dependent on the discretion of the Commissioner and the Treasury Inspector General. For too long, `section 6103' has been a convenient shield for the IRS to hide behind, and it will be too easy for that practice to continue leaving the board in the dark about the types of problems described all too clearly in the Finance Committee's hearings. In addition, limited access to taxpayer information won't help the board address personnel problems in the agency, which is critical if we are to restore credibility to the term `service' in its name. 
My amendment resolves this problem. As full-time employees, the four members of the Board of Governors drawn from the private sector will have access to the same information available to the Commissioner. Moreover, the Board under my amendment will have authority to address personnel issues. As a result, their hands will not be tied when it comes to restoring taxpayer service and respect in all IRS enforcement activities. 
The bill's part-time advisory board also starts out with authority to review and approve reorganization plans for the IRS. Yet tucked away at the end of the effective date section is a provision barring the part-time board from approving the current plan to reorganize the IRS along customer lines. This contradiction simply defies reason. 
I am a strong advocate of reorganizing the IRS into divisions that serve particular taxpayers with similar needs, like individual taxpayers and small business owners, and I included such a plan in my Putting the Taxpayer First Act that I introduced. IRS Commissioner Rossotti has also embraced this approach. With so much support, why should we restrict even a part-time advisory board from approving such a fundamental restructuring of the IRS but require its review and approval for all future plans? The full-time Board of Governors under my amendment would be required to evaluate and sign-off on all plans to reorganize the agency--it only makes sense! 
Mr. President, besides giving the IRS board real authority to run the agency and make critical changes, my amendment also ensures that the members of the Board of Governors are sufficiently committed to the task. Having been governor of my state of Missouri, I have some appreciation of the time and energy it takes to run a large organization. But I can't begin to imagine how I could have hoped to make a difference if I spent only a few days a year commuting to our capital, Jefferson City, to govern the state, and spent the rest of my time running a successful business or even a not so successful law practice. That is the trap we will create with a part-time advisory board for the IRS. 
The IRS has over 100,000 employees spread across the country and around the world. The agency has a budget of over $7 billion, and it collects more than $1 trillion each year from millions of taxpayers. It is an imposing task for even a full-time Board of Governors to reform an institution of this size-- common-sense suggests it is an impossible task for a part-time advisory board. 
What's more, the proponents of the bill contend that its part-time board will improve accountability within the IRS. But take, for example, a part-time board member who is an executive in a major corporation headquartered on the west coast. He flies to Washington several times a year as part of his IRS oversight responsibilities. How can he be accountable for the daily actions of this enormous organization when he is little more than a hostage to its bureaucracy on his occasional visit to Washington? If we are going to make changes to the IRS' management structure, we should give them a real chance for success and give the taxpayers confidence that reform can be achieved. 
Mr. President, while not everyone will agree with my proposal, let's take a moment to look at some arguments I've heard so far. Some have commented that we won't get the best people to serve on the IRS board if they have to leave their private-sector jobs for a tour of government service. As an example that just the opposite is true, I point to our current IRS Commissioner. In my assessment, Commissioner Rossotti has outstanding credentials and has been very successful as a business owner in the private sector. In addition, I think most of my colleagues would agree that he has done an exceptional job during his short tenure at the helm of the IRS. 
This criticism also rings rather hollow when we look at the individuals who have served on similar full-time boards and commissions throughout the government, like the Federal Reserve, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, to name a few. I've never heard it suggested that we scrape the bottom of the barrel to find people qualified to serve in these full-time positions. Just the opposite is true. As Commissioner Rossotti, Treasury Secretary Rubin, and many others have demonstrated, there are business leaders in this country who are willing to take leave from their private-sector lives to serve the public. 
Others have argued that the IRS Commissioner doesn't need a full-time board to run the agency, especially since the bill gives the Commissioner broader authority to bring in senior management talent. If that's true, why do we need a board at all? Why not have just Alan Greenspan run the Federal Reserve or Arthur Levitt oversee the securities markets? 
Surely the same arguments would apply to those boards and those commissions. 
I believe there is value in having a core group of individuals who bring important talents and experience to complement the Commissioner's management of an agency like the IRS. Just as with other boards and commissions throughout the government, these individuals can share the top-level management burdens and allow the Commissioner to focus on the most pressing issues completely and quickly. 
A third issue raised by my opponents is that a full-time board with real authority will make the IRS too independent. So what exactly is the problem? Sadly, there have been allegations in recent years that the IRS is being used for politically-motivated audits. Whether true or not, such assertions severely undercut any efforts to instill confidence in our tax-administration system. While I applaud the provision in the bill that prohibits Executive Branch influence over taxpayer audits, we can further ensure that result by establishing a board with representatives of both political parties, as my amendment requires. In the end, there should be nothing partisan about helping taxpayers to comply with the tax laws in the least burdensome manner possible. 
Mr. President, my amendment offers a straight forward, common-sense solution for the management of this troubled agency and it cures the inherent weaknesses of the part-time advisory board called for in the bill. With a vast number of agencies across this city, including the city itself, managed under full-time boards and commissions, we have ample evidence that this structure can work for the IRS. In my opinion, if we want more than window dressing on the current management structure, a full-time, full authority, full accountability Board of Governors is the answer. 
A part-time advisory board will not make a difference in how the agency is run. If we need a board, we need a full-time board. We don't need a part-time advisory board. Otherwise, if we do not want to have a full-time board, let's leave the agency's management alone, because when has a part-time advisory board ever turned an agency around? I suggest never.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. I thank my colleagues from both Iowa and Nebraska for their very thoughtful comments. As I said earlier, I appreciate 
so much the excellent work the Finance Committee has done on restructuring of the IRS. Truly, it is a very important issue. 
Primarily, I hear them raising the point that we can't get people to serve if we have a full-time board. We are making it a small board. We need four individuals who want to serve. 
Some say you can have part-time people who can come in and get the big picture authority. The problem is, we need them to work on specific law enforcement activities and personnel actions. We are not talking about somebody giving them the big picture; we are talking about somebody taking management responsibility. If individuals would serve, is their question. They say we can't get good individuals to serve. 
We have the Commissioner of the IRS. He came from the private sector. He was willing to move in. Private-sector individuals have served, and have served with great distinction, in related areas, where they do an excellent job. Why should we think it is harder to get people to serve on the IRS board than it would be to serve on the FTC board or on the SEC? These are issues that I think are very closely related. If we can't get good people to serve on that board, I would be very much surprised. We would not see a part-time advisory board dealing with actual cases of taxpayer abuse. They would have to do so only when the Commissioner or the Treasury Inspector General said they could. 
Let's just take an example--the alarming revelation last week that former Secretary Howard Baker and former Congressman James Quillen were the targets of a vendetta by a rogue IRS agent. Even more troubling, more troubling is that the agent's activities were covered up by numerous officials in the IRS district office. 
This case clearly demonstrates a pattern of bad behavior in one office, but it may be indicative of structural or procedural defects throughout the agency. Are we really going to tie the hands of the IRS board and only permit it to review such problems as the Commissioner or the Treasury IG permit it? I say not. If we are going to do the job, we ought to do it right. Without this authority, the board will only find out about the problems like the rest of us--when the press points them out or when we have to go through a congressional hearing. 
The problems of the IRS are well known. Now we need to make sure we fix them, not just tinker around the edges. The Bond amendment replaces the IRS management structure of a Commissioner plus a part-time limited authority board with an independent full-time board of governors, including the Commissioner. It is not an accident, as I have said earlier, that the SEC, the FTC, the Federal Reserve, are all run by boards or commissions. These agencies carry out sensitive regulatory and enforcement duties, and they must be insulated from political motives. Insulation from political motives is one of the objectives we must achieve in this IRS restructuring. The American taxpayer deserves the same level of protection as the people who are governed by and are subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the FTC and the FCC. 
Who has not heard of the allegations that the IRS has targeted out-of-favor groups or those who seem to have nothing in common but their opposition to various White House policies? No American should have the enforcement powers of the IRS unleashed on them because they don't agree with the White House on an issue. I think that is simply why my amendment is so necessary. Under the current bill, the only way the part-time board would have known about the abuses we learned about last week is the same way the rest of us did when we watched Senator Roth's hearing on television. That is how limited the authority of the part-time board is. 
We need real reform of how the IRS does its business. I believe putting a full-time, independent board in place to run the agency is the best way to do that. I say to those people who really want reform, if you really believe a board is essential to restructuring the IRS, then I say let's get out and run with the big dogs; let's get a full time, independent board. Otherwise, get back up on the porch, because a part-time advisory board is not going to even have a large bark; it will have a minor meow. 
If we are going to put some teeth into it, we need to have the teeth that a full-time, independent board governing the IRS can give to managing the agency, to make sure it does not abuse taxpayers. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I, again, commend my colleague from Delaware for his outstanding leadership. I will only say that Commissioner Rossotti is going to leave sometime. I think it is important for us to make a structure which gives us the possibility of real reform in the IRS. An advisory board, in my experience in dealing with advisory boards, cannot and will not make a difference in the day-to-day management, the selection of IRS audits and the running of the agency which is the issue on the minds of American taxpayers. We need to do the job right, and I believe we need to make the change now. 
Mr. President, if the distinguished manager of the bill has no further people wishing to speak--the ones who wanted to speak in support of the amendment are otherwise occupied--I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time. We have 1 minute on each side prior to the vote. If the manager is finished with his speakers, I will join him in yielding back whatever time remains.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we all know the problems of the IRS. They are well known. This is a troubled agency. It needs to be turned around. This is a good bill, but I think we need to do one thing to make it better. When has a part-time board ever turned around a troubled agency? A part-time board will not do the job. We need a full-time board if they want to change the culture of the agency. A full-time board such as the FTC, the SEC, even the Federal Reserve, can draw the people from all walks of life across the country to make sure the culture of the IRS is changed. 
If you want to do something about the IRS, you have to put into the field a big dog that can back up his bark. Otherwise you have a little puppy on the porch that is meowing with the cats. It is not going to change the IRS to put a toothless puppy in as an advisory board. I believe a full-time board can give us the strength we need for vital reform. I ask for support of my amendment.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I will be offering, after the 3 o'clock timeframe, an amendment to the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act. I commend the chairman of the committee and the members of the committee who have done so much good work in crafting a measure that I think is a strong measure that will do much to resolve the questions many citizens of America have about whether the IRS is treating them fairly, whether they are getting a fair shake. 
I have talked with a lot of people in my State, and I can tell you that there are a very large number of people in the IRS who have the confidence of the private sector folks, the taxpayers, and their representatives who work with them. 
Coming from Missouri, we can say that the overwhelming number of IRS agents who are dealing with the public are dealing on a fair, evenhanded basis. But we have had examples brought forth in the Finance Committee of abuses that are clearly outrageous. Something needs to be done to shape up the system so that a rogue agent cannot give the entire agency a bad name and that a rogue agent cannot impose or inflict upon a taxpayer burdens and penalties and requirements that are nowhere in the statutes. 
I will be offering an amendment which changes the proposed structure for the advisory board. I believe if you are going to have an advisory board, if you are going to put the IRS into some kind of board, then you need to do the job all the way. It is clear from the hearings and from the testimony that there is significant support for saying the IRS ought to be run by a board, it ought to have an insulation from political influence--it should be kept free from direct interference by the White House or even guidance out of the Treasury in terms of enforcement of the laws. Not tax policy. Tax policy is rightly one in which we expect the Secretary of the Treasury and the President to offer advice, counsel, and work with the Congress on carrying out the policy. 
But given the example of audits which at least raise the question of whether they have been conducted or directed by political influence, I think the only safeguard for the American people is to make the board a full-time professional board composed of five members--four from the private sector plus the Commissioner of IRS--and give it the full authority to run the day-to-day operations of the IRS. It would have a consultative role in developing tax policy. But let's take a look at it. We have full-time boards that conduct some agencies with very sensitive responsibilities--the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Communications Commission. These are boards which run agencies with very important economic powers over the economy and over citizens in the economy. To the extent that we have entrusted powers to them, we see that they are able to provide a buffer between political influence and the work of the agency. 
On the other hand, if you are concerned about reforming an agency and you find that the agency is out of control, as the committee has found the IRS to be, then how can you expect a part-time advisory board to get the job done? Nobody has been able to cite me an example where a part-time advisory board came in and got control of the agency. The purpose of a part-time 
advisory board is to give advice which can be accepted or ignored, and, from the hearings, we have seen that a part-time advisory board type of advice is not what the IRS needs. 
I think the time has come, if we are going to fulfill the mandate given to us by our constituents to do something about the IRS, to reform it, then we ought to set up a full-time board so the members do not have to split their time between private activities--between their own jobs and their own responsibilities--and looking over the IRS on a day-or-two-a-month basis. It just does not make any sense. 
As a former chief executive of my State, I know that agencies can run a unit of Government and they can do so without political interference. In my experience, sometimes agencies of State government were too immune to interference or guidance or leadership from the Governor. But if the question here is to make sure that there is not improper influence on tax audits and tax investigation targets, the only way to do the job and to do it properly is to put the management and the authority over the work of the IRS in the control of a board with full-time members on an equal footing with the Commissioner so that they can insulate the IRS from any political influence. I believe this is a very logical step to ensure that the reformed IRS meets the standards we would all expect to see for this agency. If we are going to go for a board, let's go big time. Either go for an independent, full-time board with executive authority or get back up on the porch and let the existing agency run itself. 
Mr. President, I look forward to discussing this amendment when the time ripens for its consideration in the Chamber. I appreciate the chairman and the manager on the other side bringing to the floor a very good bill. I believe this provision will make it an even better bill, and I look forward to debating it, I hope this afternoon. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, every year in St. Louis, Missouri, May Day is especially important in paying tribute to what can be achieved through collective action. This year, the Annie Malone Children and Family Service Center, as well as, the St. Louis African American community will celebrate May Day on May 17. The first of these celebrations occurred more than eighty years ago and since that time they have continually grown. The celebration serves as a reminder of all that has been endured and the prosperity that it now reflects. 
Annie Malone Children and Family Service Center began its service more than 100 years ago. Its predecessor was the St. Louis Colored Orphans' Home and was established in 1888 by a group of prominent women concerned about the welfare of neglected and orphaned children. The president of the Board of Directors from 1919 to 1943 was Annie Malone. In honor of her loyalty and dedication to the goals of the institution, it was renamed for her in 1946. Through the years, the Center has continued to expand its services and programs to meet the needs of a changing society, but the mission, `to improve the quality of life for children, families, and the community utilizing education, social services, and developing positive values and self esteem,' has remained the same. 
Annie M's has several programs including residential treatment, therapeutic services/family crisis center and its evaluation and diagnostic services. The programs have helped to make the quality of life more complete, fulfilling and successful for African Americans in the St. Louis Community. I salute the contributions made by Annie M's beneficial programs and join the community in paying tribute to the woman that helped in their growth and success, Annie Malone.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in observance of Home Education Week, May 3-9, I rise to pay tribute to the eight regions of Families for Home Education (FHE), in my home State of Missouri, for their excellence and continuing efforts to better the home education system. I have always recognized the importance of family involvement in the education of our youth and applaud the efforts of home educators to make a difference in the lives of their families. 
In today's complex society it is especially significant to have guidance in the development of our children and their continuing education. Through adult mentors, home schoolers develop, not only a close relationship with their families, but also acquire the much needed interpersonal skills through involvement in civic and community organizations in form of apprenticeship opportunities. 
The support home schooling receives helps to cultivate its success through family participation in our communities. My home State of Missouri especially relishes the high quality of home education and the strong family values it teaches. I commend the energies of FHE and the families that help make it possible. I wish FHE continued success and growth in future years.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize a truly unique leader and educator for his exemplary service to my home State of Missouri at the time of his retirement. Dr. Lloyd Pelfrey has been President of Central Christian College of the Bible (CCCB) in Moberly, Missouri, for the past twenty-five years. Dr. Pelfrey will be honored this year at the College's Commencement exercise this coming May 8. 
CCCB first opened its doors in September of 1957. Lloyd started teaching at CCCB the same day it opened. He has held several positions including Professor of Old Testament, Academic Dean, Dean of Faculty, Executive President, Acting President and President. As the fourth President in the history of the school, he has served the longest of any other President of the College. He became an ordained minister in 1953 and co-founded the Missouri Christian Convention and the Missouri Operation for Vigourous Evangelism (MOVE), an organization which establishes new churches in Missouri. Lloyd serves on the National committee of the North American Christian Convention. 
During his tenure at CCCB, Lloyd boasted several accomplishments including construction of the Memorial Building, increased awareness of the need for a Development Department as an integral part of the college, development of an Admissions Department, accreditation of the college with Accrediting Association of Bible College, first fundraising banquet with Paul Harvey as speaker and the implementation of a major capital campaign. 
Commending Dr. Pelfrey for his many years of service to CCCB, I am glad to say that the State of Missouri is enriched with his wisdom and leadership. I join the many who congratulate and thank him for his hard work and wish him continued success in future years.

Mr. BOND. As you know, in large part to your help, the conference report to the FY 1998 Supplemental appropriations bill includes $130 million for emergency CDBG funding that is intended to meet unmet emergency disaster needs by supplementing the existing, more traditional disaster programs administered through FEMA, the SBA and the Corps of Engineers. While there remains significant concerns over HUD's administration of emergency CDBG funding, buyout funding is an eligible activity under both FEMA disaster relief and HUD emergency CDBG funding, and I expect any request for buyout funding for Alabama to receive the full consideration by both FEMA and HUD. Nevertheless, the term `buyout' has become overused and has come to mean different things to different people. The federal government should be providing communities with a menu of flexible approaches to address emergency disaster needs. This flexibility is critical to the people of Alabama. In addition, I urge both FEMA and HUD to develop comprehensive yet flexible requirements for buyouts, including eligibility and cost requirements.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on Thursday, April 30, 1998, the St. Louis Jewish Community will be celebrating Israel's 50th Birthday. My home State of Missouri is especially excited for the event since President Harry S. Truman played a large role in the formation of the State of Israel. 
The 50th anniversary is very significant because it marks the reestablishment of Jewish Sovereignty in the ancient Jewish homeland, the reasserting of Jewish peoplehood after the devastation of the Holocaust, the fulfillment of the Zionist vision, the blossoming of Jewish creativity and community. The Jewish Federation of St. Louis is the central planning and fundraising agency of the St. Louis Jewish Community. This outstanding organization has coordinated the St. Louis Israel 50th anniversary celebration congregation. 
I congratulate the State of Israel and the Jewish community for 50 years of democracy. Additionally, I commend the Jewish Federation of St. Louis for its leadership during this exciting time. I wish them continued success in future years of Statehood.

Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished manager. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coverdell measure and in support of the Gorton-Frist amendment and in support of the Ashcroft amendment. We have an opportunity as a body to make some very clear statements about education that the people in our States are asking us to make. 
I firmly believe that education is a national priority but a local responsibility. This leads to a fundamental difference between this side and what might be referred to as a Washington establishment on education. 
I believe that those who know the names of the students personally are better at making decisions than those who don't know them. Unfortunately, Federal involvement in education over the years has started off with a great idea of providing resources in support for what we believe for our children is the highest priority, and that is getting them a good education, but it has mushroomed into burdensome regulations, judicial intrusion, unfunded mandates and unwanted meddling. 
The results have been that local school officials who are accountable to parents and communities have increasingly less and less control over what goes on in their classrooms. In some cases, parents really feel that they have lost control of their child's education. They have told me horror stories about how their children are not getting an education because of requirements that the Federal Government has put on the schools. 
I believe that parents and local school boards are and must be the key to true educational reform, not big Government. We should be empowering parents and teachers and school districts and States to develop challenging academic standards, programs and priorities, not making their jobs of educating children of America more difficult. 
As my colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, said, we already have standards, we already have tests. As a result of those tests, we know where the problems are in education, and we need to do something about it. Yes, nationally we ought to focus on the problem, but we ought not to try to solve with a `Washington, DC, solution' the problems we face in every community and every city throughout Missouri and throughout America. 
I have had a very interesting and informative experience over the last year and a half talking to school board members, talking to teachers, talking to principals and talking to parents across my State of Missouri. It is from these discussions that I come back here with a renewed commitment to keep local control over education. 
We have school districts in Missouri hiring hordes of consultants and grant writers instead of teachers because they know they have to play `Mother May I?' with Washington, DC. We have some schools, the smaller schools, that say they don't even bother to apply for the Federal funds because they don't have the time and the resources to prepare the application. 
Leaders in school districts have told me of the unforeseen consequences of getting a grant. They get a grant development program and the grant expires and the school district has to determine whether to take local money from existing resources to continue the program or to eliminate it. 
One of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said very, very convincingly today, and I love these words, `The Federal Government doesn't run schools, and the Federal Government doesn't fund schools.' I agree with those principles. I just wish that he were correct in the facts. 
The Federal Government should not be micromanaging school districts. In Missouri, 67 percent of the funds that go to the school districts come from the Federal Government. These are general funds for K through 12. They tell me, depending upon the school district, that anywhere from 40 to 85 percent of the red tape and the hassle and the regulations come from Washington. 
I don't think that is right. Last year, when we adopted the Gorton amendment to send money directly to the schools, some of my colleagues very eloquently said, `We don't want to have Federal dollars going directly to school districts because the school districts will waste the money; they might build athletic facilities; or they will waste it in some other way.' 
Mr. President, I have spent my adult career working with parents and teachers and school boards in Missouri. I have watched them work. I have watched their education decisions. I have spent about the last 11 years in this body watching Congress debate issues and watching the Federal bureaucracy administer programs. And when it comes to who wastes money, Mr. President, it is not even close. It is not a contest. The Washington way wastes more money by far. The locally controlled schools are far better at applying those dollars to the needs of the children in their schools. 
There is no disagreement that in some cases a local school district may need money to build some more schools or it may need money to hire more teachers. For some schools, new textbooks should be the top priority. For others, additional computers might be needed or a school safety program might need to be implemented. 
Who knows best? Those at the local level, held accountable by those they serve, or the bureaucrats in Washington? A one-size-fits-all approach does not and will not work in education. Let us give our schools, our teachers, and our parents the resources and flexibility they need to educate our children for a lifetime of achievement and accomplishment. I urge my colleagues to support the amendments and to support the bill, and I urge that they give a sound, strong endorsement to local control over education. 
I reserve the remainder of the time on this side and yield the floor. Again, I extend my sincere thanks to my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts.  
Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on April 23, in a ceremony held in Kings Bay, Georgia on the U.S.S. Maine, Exercise Tiger veterans will be honored. Following the dockside ceremony, there will be a 24 hour embark on the nuclear missile submarine of the United States Navy's Sub Group 10. In addition, my home State of Missouri will receive a memorial anchor commemorating the D-day dress rehearsal turned battle that took place during World War II. 
This week in 1944, German `E' boats, patrolling the English Channel attacked Eight American tank landing ships near the Devon coast killing 749 United States Army and United States Navy soldiers. Of Tiger's death toll, 201 men were from the 3206th Quartermaster Company in my home State of Missouri. Due to the secrecy of this mission, to see the soldiers, who fought so bravely, finally received the acknowledgment they deserve. 
Knowing that I cannot adequately express my admiration and respect, I join in the opportunity to say thank you. I hope the raising of the anchor memorial will in some way compensate the brave soldiers who risked or lost their lives during this crucial exercise. This week will be a great occasion for the survivors of Exercise Tiger and I pay tribute to their courage and service to the United States of America.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on Sunday, April 19, 1998, a new math, science and business classroom building on the campus of Southwest Missouri State University-West Plains campus (SMSU), will be dedicated to former State Senator Emory L. Melton. Emory, a long time friend, has done much to help my home State of Missouri. 
Elected to the State Senate in 1972, Emory had no opposition five of the six times he ran, which is a State record. Originally, he involved himself in politics because of a strong feeling that the State government was growing much too quickly. As a Senator, he was known for reading every bill that came to the Senate floor and could point out even the slightest of errors. Many of his colleagues felt him to be one of the truest fiscal conservatives ever to serve in the Senate. I had the pleasure of witnessing his great leadership while serving my two terms as Governor. 
Before his service to the State Senate, Emory was the Barry County prosecuting attorney and a newspaper publisher in Cassville, Missouri. He served as Missouri Tourism Commission chair for many years. Emory received the St. Louis Globe-Democrat award for public service and was named one of the top ten legislators by Capitol press corps. 
With so many impressive accomplishments, it is no wonder the new campus building is named in his honor. I am extremely pleased to see Emory recognized for his great service to the State of Missouri. Congratulations Senator Emory Melton on a tribute well deserved.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a tremendous accomplishment by the Community Betterment Committee of Mt. Vernon, Missouri, On April 23, 1998, a project that began almost 2 1/2 years ago will be dedicated at a lighting ceremony. Lighting the Lawrence County Courthouse, once just a dream to many citizens, has now become a reality. 
Through the perseverance of the Community Betterment Committee, private funds were raised to complete the project. The hard work put forth by the Mt. Vernon Community is impressive. Because of these efforts the Lawrence County Courthouse, for years to come, will be lit at night for people to enjoy. 
I congratulate the Community Betterment Committee for their outstanding achievement. Additionally, I commend the Mt. Vernon community for their generosity, without which, none of this would have been possible. I wish them continued success in all future endeavors.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the section 202 Elderly Housing Program is the most important housing program for elderly low-income Americans providing both affordable low-income housing and supportive services designed to meet the special needs of the elderly. The President's budget request proposes reducing the funding from a current year level of $645 million to $109 million, an 83 percent cut. 
On behalf of myself, Senator Mikulski, and numerous other colleagues, we offer this sense-of-the-Senate resolution to say that we must maintain the section 202 program. The alternative is to provide vouchers. Vouchers for the typical resident, an elderly woman, frail, in her seventies--to give her a voucher to go out and walk to find a new apartment, or new dwelling place, is simply unacceptable. 
I urge my colleagues to show an overwhelming vote in support of the program that maintains housing that our frail elderly so badly need. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Let me just offer my thanks and congratulations to the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee for presenting a budget resolution which balances a large number of competing interests without a lot of resources to do it. The discretionary caps are getting tighter, no question about it. The path of least resistance would have been to loosen them. 
I am pleased to say the Budget Committee, under Senator Domenici's leadership, avoided that path. Now the real test of leadership is before the full Senate to see whether we can keep those caps and move the budget--at long last--into balance. 
Even with the limits we face, the Budget Committee managed to assemble a good package that meets a number of critical priorities. That is what budgeting is about--setting priorities. These priorities call for funding the public needs of the current generation, but they also call for self-discipline to avoid increasing the debt burdens on our children and grandchildren. 
The budget resolution before the Senate sets those priorities--keeping our obligations to both the present and the future. The best deals are those in which everybody wins without neglecting any critical priorities. I think this budget resolution is one of those kinds of deals. 
When you look at who wins, first, future generations win. We will keep our commitment to our children and grandchildren, get control over the Federal budget and stop piling on heavier and heavier debt burdens. We do this by putting the budget into balance and resisting the temptation to spend a surplus that we haven't even seen yet. If we keep to our current path, we may even get to lighten that debt burden a little bit. 
We have lived fairly comfortably at the expense of our children. We have borrowed from them about $5.5 trillion and spent it for our own needs and comforts. The living standard we now enjoy will be paid, to a great extent, by our children. I think that is worth saying again. Our children have bought or will buy $5.5 trillion worth of our current prosperity. They will pay for it in higher taxes, higher interest payments, and less funds to pay for the public needs and priorities they face. We certainly should not increase the debt any more. 
Now, it appears likely that we will run a small surplus for the next decade or so. Now we have a few crumbs to give back to our children in appreciation for what they have already lent us. Incredibly, some folks around here want us to spend that as well. We owe it to our children, Mr. President--we literally owe it to them--to pay down this massive debt. 
We certainly should not increase the debt even more. That's why it's so important to keep to the discretionary spending caps and to keep the budget moving into balance. The budget resolution achieves this goal. It keeps within the discretionary spending caps that the Congress and the President agreed to just last year. 
Unfortunately, the President's budget would have broken those caps by $12 billion in 1999, according to the Congressional Budget Office. I find this remarkable. Why is it so hard to keep to an agreement we made just last year? 
Breaking the discretionary caps, putting the balanced budget in jeopardy--these would have neglected the priority we have placed on the prosperity of future generations. The budget resolution avoids that temptation, keeps to the caps, and keeps our commitment to stop borrowing from our children and grandchildren. 
So, future generations win under the budget resolution. Who else wins? Well, current generations win, too--at every stage of life. 
For example, children already born--not just the children of the future--win under the budget resolution. Under the committee version, funding for the child care and development block grant will increase by $5 billion in budget authority--doubling its budget authority over the next 5 years. 
I am pleased also that the Budget Committee, on both sides of the political aisle, agreed with my proposal to designate savings from assuming the President's reduction in the School-to-Work Program for local early childhood development initiatives. This would provide another $1.5 billion for our Nation's children. 
Clearly, children are winners under the budget resolution. Adults are winners, too. Hardworking American taxpayers come out ahead under the committee plan. 
The budget resolution envisions $30 billion in tax relief. Some may criticize that amount for being too little. Of course, we would always like to find more ways to lighten the tax load on America's taxpayers. Let me note a couple of things about the committee's actions on tax relief. 
First, we need to keep in mind that any specific tax cut measure will be the responsibility of the Finance Committee. Nothing in the budget resolution dictates to that committee what it must do. In fact, if the committee finds additional offsets, it may cut taxes even more than the budget resolution proposes. The budget resolution includes a `tax cut reserve fund' to make deficit-neutral tax relief--of whatever size, as determined by the committee of jurisdiction--possible. 
Second, the Budget Committee's $30 billion in expected tax relief would allow long-needed relief in some crucial areas. These could include $10.5 billion in relief from the marriage penalty and $9 billion in child care expenses. 
I am particularly grateful that Chairman Domenici included in this chairman's mark an acceleration in the deductibility of health insurance for self-employed persons. This idea, which the full Budget Committee 
subsequently endorsed, is critical to achieving parity between self-employed persons and their large competitors. 
I have long advocated full deductibility as the only fair policy. Although current law now calls for that to be achieved in 2007, full deductibility needs to be achieved sooner. Current practice still places a relative disadvantage on self-employed persons, since employers do have full deductibility. People who pursue the American dream through independent self-employment should not be penalized or discouraged from getting health insurance by treating them differently. 
I am going to support the budget resolution because it is a step forward on this issue and on so many other issues. I urge my colleagues who have their own concerns about the tax package to look at it in the same light. Is it an improvement over current law? Yes. How can we oppose it just because it doesn't include everything we might like? I remind my colleagues of the political adage of not making the perfect into the enemy of the good. 
Finally, the budget resolution helps all American taxpayers by endorsing reform of the Internal Revenue Service. My distinguished colleagues from Iowa and Oklahoma Messrs. Grassley and Nickles, joined with me in the Budget Committee to propose that a tax relief package include improvement of taxpayer rights--especially in IRS property seizure cases--and reform of IRS penalty rules. This proposal was also endorsed by the full Budget Committee and it appears in the budget resolution. I thank the committee for its attention to, and concern for, the rights of our Nation's taxpayers. 
The budget resolution is a winning package for American taxpayers, as well as our children. Another group that wins under the budget resolution is our nation's seniors. The budget resolution provides needed support for both Social Security and Medicare. 
The Budget Committee's package adopts the President's call to set aside the expected budget surplus until we reform Social Security into a sound and reliable program for the long-term. Social Security, as the President knows, is a key source of support for our seniors as part of their total retirement strategy. That's why the President was right to demand that we `Save Social Security First.' 
The Budget Committee adopted the President's view. Remarkably, the President himself did not. As the Congressional Budget Office noted, the President's own budget submission would have reduced the expected surplus by $43 billion. 
Forty-three billion dollars. That's money spent to `Save Big Government First.' 
I commend my colleagues on the Budget Committee for including language in the budget resolution to remind the President of his promise to `Save Social Security First' and stating the sense of the Senate that these surpluses should be set aside until we reform Social Security for future generations. The surpluses should not be frittered away on higher spending in violation of last year's budget agreement. 
The Budget Committee also resisted the temptation to spend any Federal revenues that might arise from a tobacco settlement, despite numerous amendments from the committee minority to do so. Instead, the committee's plan earmarks those revenues for bolstering the Medicare Program. Given the health care costs that tobacco has placed on Medicare, I can think of no better way to use tobacco revenues. Those costs are part of the reason why Medicare is a troubled program. 
The seniors who rely on Medicare are counting on us to take the necessary steps to shore up that program. We took some preliminary steps in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. By slowing the annual rate of Medicare growth from 8.8 to 5.5 percent, the Balanced Budget Act extended the life of the Medicare part A trust fund through 2006, an improvement over the program's previous expected bankruptcy date in 2001. 
However, we all know the effect that the baby-boomers are going to have on the program when they start to retire in 2011. Let's start planning ahead by allocating any Federal tobacco revenues to keep Medicare in business for the customers--our senior citizen constituents--who need it. It would be irresponsible for use to do anything else. 
I sum, I say again that the best deals are those in which everybody wins. The Budget Committee has assembled a package that meets that standard. Future generations win, and current generations--children, working Americans, and senior citizens--also win. 
Who doesn't win under the budget resolution? Those who would break the discretionary caps, those who would push the budget out of balance, and those who would `Save Big Government First.' Anyone who observed the Budget Committee's markup of the budget resolution would have to note the alarming number of proposals from the minority that sought to spend, spend, spend. They no doubt will be the loudest in condemning the budget resolution for failing to adopt the President's new spending schemes. 
I find this astonishing. Frankly, the minority should be pleased with this resolution. The Budget Committee kept its word to the President to protect certain functions at funding levels the President agreed to in last year's bipartisan budget agreement. 
That agreement designed five budget functions as `protected functions.' These are International Affairs (Function 150); Natural Resources and Environment (300); Transportation (400); Education, Training, Employment, and Social Services (500); and Administration of Justice (750). In every case, the budget resolution meets or exceeds the levels we agreed to last year. 
With this in mind, it is amazing that the President could attack the committee's budget resolution by claiming it `shortchanges our nation's future.' By reducing the debt, by preserving Social Security and Medicare, the plan actually plans for the future. Apparently, the only problem for the President is that we could not keep the deal he signed just last year--and that he wanted to spend, spend, spend, even more than he agreed to last year. 
A deal is a deal, Mr. President. I supported the bipartisan budget agreement last year. I will support this year's plan, too, since it complies with what we agreed to last year. 
I do think there are a couple of areas where the budget resolution can be fine-tuned. I emphasize that the amendments I will propose are friendly amendments, intended to make a good budget plan better--not to attack it. 
The first of these related to housing for elderly persons. The President's budget request proposed slashing this program by some $500 million. In a hearing before the VA/HUD subcommittee, Secretary Cuomo did not explain why the administration is seeking this cut. Senator Mikulski and I committed to restoring the cut funds to avoid jeopardizing the supply of specialized rental housing for the elderly poor. We welcome the support of other Senators who share our concerns. 
I comment on two particular points. Chairman Domenici has included an acceleration in the deductibility of health insurance for self-employed persons. This idea, which the full Budget Committee subsequently endorsed, is critical to achieving parity between self-employed persons and the people who work for the large competitors. I fought this battle on the floor in the past session and in this session, and with the tremendous support of colleagues, we are moving in that direction. I think it is good news that the budget now provides that we move that up. 
I will offer one amendment now, and a second amendment I will propose will nudge the Immigration and Naturalization Service to establish circuit rides in the former Soviet Union to recognize the enormous cost imposed on refugees having to travel to Moscow. The amendment is a sense of the Senate, and it states that the budget resolution assumes $2 million in the INS budget. 
Again, I emphasize that these are offered in a friendly and cooperative spirit, seeking to make a good budget resolution even better. The budget resolution reported from the Budget Committee is a deal in which everybody wins, and I will be pleased to support it on the floor as I did in committee.

Mr. BOND. Deja vu all over again. Senator Mikulski and I rise one more time to fight to fulfill our commitment and the commitment of the Senate to fund fully the section 202 Elderly Housing Program at no less than $645 million for each of the next 5 fiscal years. 
I want to emphasize our commitment to this program and the elderly housing as the chairman and ranking member of the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, the Appropriations subcommittee with the responsibility for funding the section 202 Elderly Housing Program, as well as all other programs under the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The purpose of this amendment is to set a floor of $645 million for the section 202 Elderly Housing Program, 
the amount that Congress appropriated for this program for fiscal year 1998, as opposed to the President's budget request of $109 million for fiscal year 1999--a cut of over $500 million from this $645 million program. The President's budget request is plainly wrong. I cannot state this in strong enough terms. We have an investment in the elderly and our Nation here just as we must invest in the youth of this Nation through good education and good, available health care. I want to be clear that we are not going to shortchange the elderly. 
The section 202 Elderly Housing Program is the most important housing program for elderly low-income Americans, providing both affordable low-income housing and supportive services designed to meet the special needs of the elderly. This combination of supportive services and affordable housing is critical to promoting independent living, self-sufficiency and dignity, while delaying the more costly alternative of institutional care. Section 202 elderly housing is more than just housing--it is a safety net for the elderly, providing both emotional and physical security and a sense of community. 
Moreover, since the inception of the program in 1959, the section 202 Elderly Housing Program has funded some 5,400 elderly housing projects with over 330,000 units. Nevertheless, by the Department of Housing and Urban Development's own estimates, there are over 1.4 million elderly families currently identified as having `worst case housing needs' and in need of affordable housing. 
Despite the need for and the success of the section 202 Elderly Housing Program, the President proposes to slash funding for this program from $645 million in fiscal year 1998 to $109 million in fiscal year 1999. This is a cut of over 83 percent in funding and will mean a reduction from building some 6,000 units with fiscal year 1998 funding to building only 1,500 units with the President's proposed fiscal year 1999 funding. We cannot afford this critical loss of housing. 
Moreover, the President is proposing to merge section 202 elderly housing into the HOME program. I am a great supporter of the HOME program because it does a good job by providing affordable housing with decisionmaking at the local level. But there is no rational justification for merging section 202 into the HOME program. Not only is section 202 extremely successful and critically needed, a recent General Accounting Office report indicated that the HOME program has provided few elderly housing units since enactment. In particular, from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 1996, over 1,400 section 202 elderly housing projects were developed with some 52,000 rental units for over 47,800 elderly individuals. During that same 5-year time period, the HOME program produced 30 elderly housing projects with 681 units which serve some 675 elderly individuals. In case you missed the figures, section 202, in 5 years, provided 52,000 housing units; the HOME program provided 681 housing units. 
However, the problem with the President's request does not stop here. The President also requests funding for 8,800 vouchers for the elderly. Over the last several years, this administration repeatedly has attempted to voucher out assisted housing, including housing for the elderly. Vouchers are a very important housing tool and work well in many instances, but the elderly deserve to have decent, safe, and affordable housing as well as needed supportive services. Section 202 elderly housing accomplishes these purposes, and vouchers do not. 
Think with me for a moment about this recurring nightmare image I have of an elderly woman in a walker with a voucher in her hand, searching dark and dangerous streets for needed shelter. That is what they are proposing we do. To put it in context, I remind my colleagues that the average tenant in section 202 housing is a frail, older woman in her seventies, living alone, with an income of less than $10,000 per year. Do we want to tell her to get out of the housing? Do we want to say, `Here is a voucher, start walking up and down the streets and maybe a friend will go 
along and help you with your walker or push your wheelchair; you are going to have to hit the streets to find new housing'? That is not a comforting image, but it is a compelling one. 
Again, the need for section 202 elderly housing: There are currently 33 million Americans aged 65 and over. This is some 13 percent of all Americans. That number will grow to over 69 million elderly by the year 2030, which would be some 20 percent of all Americans, and will continue to grow to almost 80 million elderly Americans by 2050. Cutting back and remodeling the section 202 program will do these Americans a disservice. 
I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the section 202 Elderly Housing Program and the need for Congress to stand by elderly families. Over the years, millions of Federal dollars have been saved by providing elderly families with access to supportive services in their homes and their communities. Without this housing and these services, many elderly persons and families would have had to be relocated to nursing homes and other institutions where care would be more costly and the loss of personal dignity more compelling.

for all kinds of people in need, but particularly housing for the elderly. I had the pleasure of beginning my service on the VA-HUD committee under her chairmanship. She has been absolutely invaluable in helping to guide, teach, and cooperate with me as we moved forward. Her statement on the importance of elderly housing is very compelling. 
I hope that we will have overwhelming support on both sides of the aisle for this amendment. Since some people are not getting the message, I ask that when a vote is scheduled on this amendment, that the yeas and nays be requested.

Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. 
I believe our message has not been getting across that elderly housing works under the section 202 program. You can't expect elderly housing to be covered by the HOME program where there are many competing local needs that must be met. Most of all, do not put Grandmother or Aunt Effie out on the street in her walker with a voucher and expect that she is going to be able to find decent, affordable, appropriate housing. 
We need an overwhelming vote. I welcome the fact that we have had a number of cosponsors. I hope we will have a unanimous vote, or an overwhelming vote, to express the sense of the Senate that we are not going to change this program. This is a program that is meeting the needs of the elderly today. We must continue that program, because the needs are only growing greater and we need to do all we can to try to keep up with those needs. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I particularly thank my colleague from Maryland. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay tribute to a truly outstanding University in my home State of Missouri, Lincoln University. Lincoln has played a large role in African American education in my home State of Missouri, as well as across the nation. 
Lincoln was founded in 1866 by the Caucasian officers and the African American enlisted men of the 62nd and 65th United States Colored Infantries who fought for the Union during the Civil War. These men wanted to establish a school that would devote itself to educating freed African Americans. By soliciting funds and donating their own salaries, they raised $6,000 within a few days. With these funds, the soldiers were able to open the doors of Lincoln Institute on September 17, 1866. In 1869, Lincoln began to receive $5,000 in aid from the State of Missouri for teacher training. By 1940, Lincoln Institute had become Lincoln University and had evolved from a teacher training school to a full University offering Graduate instruction. In each of the decades Lincoln has continually added programs, expanded its facilities and opened its doors to all applicants that meet its entrance criteria. 
This past year the University has come under the new leadership of Dr. David Henson. Dr. Henson became the seventeenth President of Lincoln on July 2, 1997. I am excited about continuing my close relationship with this outstanding University by working with Dr. Henson. He has held many leadership positions during his 25 years of higher education and I know he will continue to strengthen the University's already impeccable reputation. 
It is an honor for the entire State of Missouri to have a University like Lincoln, whose service and character-building programs, along with the new guidance of Dr. Henson, will continue down the road of success. I commend Lincoln's President, Dr. David Henson, for his commitment to excellence and hope for continued prosperity in the future.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate approved an amendment to S. 1768 that would provide $260 million for emergency Community Development Block Grant funding for disaster relief, long-term recovery, and mitigation in communities affected by Presidentially-declared disasters in FY 1998. 
This funding is designed to complement the funding currently provided through the traditional emergency disaster programs under the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Small Business Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers. Contrary to the apparent belief or desire of some Members and constituents, CDBG funding is not intended or designed to be the primary source of federal funding for natural disasters. 
In particular, the emergency CDBG program has become a catch-all program and a slush fund for natural disasters that is seen by some as an entitlement. This is wrong. We need to change how we view and respond to disasters--we need to develop policies that are based on state/federal partnerships and are designed to prevent and prepare for disasters. 
I say this because it is good policy, but also because we cannot keep dipping into the different funds which support the many important programs under the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee. For example, over the last 3 and one-half years, the Congress has offset the cost of emergencies out of HUD section 8 housing assistance at a cost of some $10 billion. Last year alone, the Congress used $3.6 billion in excess section 8 reserves to pay for disaster relief. Well, the bill has come due. For this year, all available section 8 reserve funds are already committed as part of the FY 1999 Budget to renew expiring section 8 housing contracts. Without these funds, many elderly and disabled persons and families will be without housing. 
In addition, natural disasters are not going to go away and the cost of disasters likely will continue to escalate. In the last 5 years, we have appropriated a staggering $18 billion to FEMA for disaster relief, compared to $6.7 billion in the prior 5-year period. 
As I have already noted, I have many concerns about using CDBG funds for emergency disaster purposes, especially since the Department of Housing and Urban Development has failed to provide adequate data and accountability concerning the use of these emergency CDBG funds in the past. 
Nevertheless, while I continue to have reservations, the emergency CDBG legislation in the emergency supplement is intended to ensure that emergency CDBG funds are used appropriately and where needed. In particular, this legislation is designed to ensure that the funds go to disaster relief activities that are identified by the Director of FEMA as unmet needs that have not or will not be addressed by other federal disaster assistance programs. 
In addition, to ensure accountability, states must provide a 25 percent match for these emergency CDBG funds and HUD must publish a notice of program requirements and provide an accounting of the CDBG funds by the type of activity, the amount of funding, an identification of the ultimate recipient, and the use of any waivers. I also want to make it clear that I intend to monitor fully the use of these emergency CDBG funds. 
I expect these emergency CDBG funds to be used fairly, equitably and to the benefit of the American taxpayer, especially, as required by the CDBG program, to the benefit of low- and moderate-income Americans. 
I also want to make clear that these emergency CDBG funds are not intended as a substitute for the state/local cost-share for dams and levees. The purposes of a state/local cost-share are to ensure accountability, local investment and to underline the importance of the federal/state partnership. Using CDBG funds as a state/local cost share in levee and dam projects defeats these purposes and undermines state and local responsibility. As a result, the VA/HUD FY 1998 appropriations bill limited the amount of CDBG funds to $100,000 for the state/local cost-share of the Corps of Engineers projects, including levees. That standard still applies.

It was a pleasure to work with you to ensure that the Supplemental Emergency Appropriations Act contains sufficient funding to help impacted areas recover from natural disasters. Specifically, I commend the Senator from New York for his diligence in ensuring that the full scope of the impact of the ice storm in the Northeast was made known to the Appropriations Committee. Without his efforts, and those of his colleagues, many of the needs of the people of New York and the entire Northeast region might not have been fully addressed. Given the circumstances which have been brought to our attention, the committee believes the additional $60 million is fully justified and will help the residents of the area recover from the ravages of the ice storm.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, while I appreciate the concerns of the Senator from Oklahoma, let me clarify one point that I think may be somewhat confusing. The funding in this amendment is to reimburse FEMA and to cover costs for disasters occurring in this and prior fiscal years, not in future fiscal years. It would simply allow us to begin fiscal year 1999 without an enormous, outstanding disaster relief requirement. In particular, this $1.6 billion appropriation includes funds to cover the costs of disasters anticipated to occur in the balance of fiscal year 1998. This amendment is not about advance funding, but is intended to provide the necessary funding only for disaster relief requirements for fiscal year 1998 and prior years. 
The Senator from Oklahoma has expressed his concern about the cost of disaster relief. No one has been more concerned about the cost of disaster relief than I. In our subcommittee, we have held a number of hearings focused almost solely on FEMA reform and the exploding costs of disaster relief. In response to these hearings, we demanded that the administration and FEMA submit a responsible package of Stafford Act amendments. While FEMA has provided a package of FEMA reform amendments, these are a difficult sell, although we remain hopeful that the authorizing committees will work to implement these and other reforms. 
I have been joined by my distinguished colleague and ranking member from Maryland, who had the great privilege and high honor of chairing this subcommittee previously and has been an absolutely essential part of the committee deliberations. I will ask her in just a moment to address some of these. 
I emphasize that we need to amend the Stafford Act. We also need administrative changes. Nevertheless, at the same time, these FEMA funds of $1.6 billion are needed now to meet current FEMA requirements. This appropriation is needed to ensure that we have adequate funding for disaster relief. 
Nevertheless, there are a number of us who are very much concerned about the cost of disaster relief. Each year, we see the costs of disaster relief rising exponentially. The need for cost containment is paramount. For example, in the last 5 years, we have appropriated a staggering $18 billion to FEMA for disaster relief, compared to $6.7 billion in the prior 5-year period. While I know we have had some major disasters in the last 5 years, we also had significant disasters in the previous 5 years. The costs are clearly out of control. 
As I have noted, for several years, I requested that FEMA submit a legislative plan to control disaster costs. After cajoling and arm twisting, threats of reduced funding, FEMA finally submitted a proposal for reforming the Stafford Act last summer. The proposed amendments address several very important areas, including new incentives for mitigation, streamlining the grant process, and eliminating certain facilities currently eligible for disaster relief, such as golf courses. 
This is how we must address the cost of disaster relief. It is far better for authorizing legislation to say what we are going to replace and for what we are going to provide assistance. It is very difficult to address disaster relief issues after the fact when people come to the floor and there is a great outpouring of sympathy. I have been here, I have done that, I have seen it. We have a T-shirt with it emblazoned on it. Once there is a disaster, people come in and they have all of these needs for disaster assistance. And I might say that this body has been extremely generous and, in some ways, we have opened the floodgates. 
Well, we are not talking with this amendment about what we would do in the future. We are talking about requirements that have already occurred. I strongly agree that in the future we 
should limit disaster aid to those truly in need, to people, to entities, to communities that cannot protect themselves against disaster. If they are a profitmaking business, if they are a revenue-generating business, then let them purchase insurance, let them take care of their needs in advance. We need to come in and help those who truly cannot help themselves. However, until we do that, we have to do something to fund and to provide the resources for the commitments already made. 
If the Nickles amendment succeeds or if this amendment is not adopted, we are going to be facing in the VA-HUD Subcommittee a $4 billion lien against the bill. And there will be some very untenable choices. We are the ones, Senator Mikulski and I, who have to take the first cut at funding the programs in the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee. To be clear, without this amendment, it will be very difficult for us to even meet the President's request for Veterans Administration medical care, which is $40 million less than the fiscal year 1998 level. We would be shorting veterans medical care which is not acceptable. In addition, we would be forced to make drastic cuts to low-income housing, including elderly housing, EPA, and Superfund, as well as important space and science programs. 
I can tell you that this will not be pretty. I can tell you that the disasters have occurred and that commitments have been made. The question is, will we, in this measure, replenish those funds and carry through on the obligations FEMA has made for this year? 
As we look to the future, I would love to see us get disaster relief under control with an appropriate authorizing reform measure and also adjust the budget for regular and timely disaster appropriations. Disaster relief needs are running over $3 billion a year--to some $3.6 billion a year. If we are serious about meeting FEMA disaster requirements in the future, I would love to see the budget take account of the needed $3.6 billion worth of FEMA disaster relief requirements each year. We are not there yet, but I am committed to getting FEMA disaster relief and disaster relief requirements under control. 
Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague on the floor. I yield the floor.  
Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.

Mr. BOND. Madam President, let me get in on this very elucidating discussion my colleagues are having. It seems to me that if the emergency designation was taken off the FEMA amendment without offsets, I believe this bill would be subject to a point of order. In particular, we would have to come up with offsets of $1.6 billion in budget authority for the current year. Plus, we also would have to offset the outlays. 
If you are trying to take $1.6 billion in budget authority out of a program 7 months into the year, the impact on any one program would be devastating and, in many cases, would defund the program. If there are programs with such offsets which my colleague can identify where there is totally wasteful spending, we would be happy to discuss those offsets. Frankly, I don't know of any program from which we could take $1.6 billion in budget authority out of this year's appropriations in the current fiscal year 1998. 
I agree with many of the things the Senator from Oklahoma has said. He is very eloquent. I look forward to going into battle with him to trim down and to rationalize the emergency funding process. We need a champion like the Senator from Oklahoma. I really appreciate him reading the plaintive words we put in the committee report. I did not think anybody read committee reports. I am deeply indebted to my colleague for laying them out for the Senate, because nobody would have believed me if I had read them. 
But this process of putting money into CDBG has gotten out of control. Frankly, what we said in the committee hearings was far stronger than what I said in that committee report. The $500 million we appropriated for the CDBG emergency program in FY 1997 was more than I recommended. This was for the disastrous flooding in the Upper Midwest. I thought CDBG emergency funding was out of control, and, frankly, nobody has yet been able to tell us where the money has been spent. I wish that everybody who so strongly supported and steamrolled the passage of that emergency designation and that emergency CDBG funding would come and help us look through the debris of the accounting systems and find out where the money went. 
But that does not change the fact that we have, in this measure, tried to establish for emergency CDBG funding some criteria and some guidelines to make sure that the money is not totally wasted. We say the money has to go to disaster relief activities identified by the Director of FEMA as unmet needs that have not or will not be addressed by other Federal disaster assistance programs. To ensure accountability, States must provide a 25 percent match for these emergency funds and HUD must publish a notice of program requirements and provide an accounting of the CDBG funds by the type of activity, by the amount of funding, and a listing of each recipient. That is our effort to get a handle on these things. 
The Senator from Oklahoma has identified a much larger problem. We need to get a handle on our disaster program. We have attempted to establish reforms. I lost out. I was steamrolled last year, and I am sure someday we will find out where the money went. But in response to emergencies, we come through again and again and we are very generous. For example, in July of 1995, we put in $39 million in CDBG funds for the Oklahoma City bombing, which was a real disaster. That was put in as an emergency and it was offset. 
Now, the problem of offsets is a problem that we have faced every year. Over the last 3 and a half years, we have offset the cost of emergencies out of HUD section 8 housing reserves at a cost of some $10 billion. Last year alone, Congress used $3.6 billion in excess section 8 reserves to pay for disaster relief. 
Madam President, the well has run dry. We are at the bottom. If you want to start throwing people out of publicly assisted housing and say that rather than designate the FEMA amendment as an emergency, we are going to walk down the street and tell a sweet little lady in section 8 housing that we need to balance the budget, that we are sorry, but your section 8 assistance is no longer valid and you have no housing--well, that is harsh and not acceptable. However, these are the kinds of decisions we have to make. Nevertheless, I am delighted to know that we will be working with the Senator from Oklahoma in an attempt to reform FEMA programs and get FEMA expenses under control. 
I urge my colleagues to support a motion, which I must regrettably make, to table the second-degree amendment. I certainly want to give my colleague the opportunity to conclude, and the Senator from Maryland, if she wishes.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, NATO has been the keystone for Western Democracy for the past 50 years. It has stood solidly as a successful deterrent against the spread of Communism and as a community of democracies where markets have flourished and where differences are settled without drawing a sword against one another. NATO's key alliance was based upon a mutual pact of deterrence from external threats . . . and lets be honest--it was and I stress was, an alignment to offset the voracious behemoth called the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is dead. We need to keep it so. Expansion of NATO to include nations who have struggled to extricate themselves from years of slavery under the yoke of Leninist/Stalinist dictatorial regimes will insure the eternal demise of a world-communist conspiracy. 
NATO was a major contributor to the successful end of the Cold War and was in fact responsible for a 50 year period of peaceful coexistence in Western Europe; the longest such period in modern history. In order to continue to fulfill its purpose of ensuring peace and freedom, NATO needs to adapt to a new Europe, a Europe without a Soviet-alliance but a Europe which faces a myriad of other challenges. 
As our country adapts to a changing world situation, a world without a Cold War, so must our alliances. NATO must change or become a mere relic of the Cold War. Those who advocate the status quo ask us to live in a non-existent past. 
To those who claim that the expansion of NATO will be a threat to the Russian people, I note that the 50 years of relative peace on the European continent extended to the Russian border, as well. Stability in the region has been and will be stability for the Russians. NATO poses no offensive threat to any other nation. It is a gathering of countries who want to break the cycle of war. 
For those who are afraid of Russians who threaten their neighbors because these nations desire peaceful alliances, I say, `Do not bow to the will of a few radical extremists; stand up for those who strive to join a community of free and democratic nations who are our neighbors. Do not let the Russians run our foreign policy.' 
For those who say that the nations of Central Europe face no threat today, I say that this expansion is the most likely way to preserve this situation. 
For those who claim that this will dilute NATO, I say that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, whose people have demonstrated their embrace of democracy, will add a renewed strength of purpose to the alliance. 
Yes, there are questions which must be answered concerning the costs to the United States of this expansion. I have stated time and again that the costs must be defined and we will hold NATO to those numbers. Our coffers are not limitless. But any costs which insures peace and stability will be less than the costs of the anarchy and chaos of medieval conflicts or a resumption of the Cold War. To have set a list of conditions for admittance to the organization, and then to change our minds to those countries which have achieved those conditions is isolationist, elitist and shortsighted. It could drive them to make other alliances for their own collective protection and rather than resulting in a series of treaties the likes of which have fostered the most fruitful 50 years in history, we will set the stage for a complicated entanglement of alliances which will look curiously like those which precipitated World War One. We do not need to learn that lesson all over again. 
I am very comfortable in joining the company of such individuals as General Collin Powell, General Norman Swartzkopf, Former Sec Def Richard Cheney, Former Secretaries Baker, Eagleburger, Haig, former Ambassador Kirkpatrick, and a host of other Secretaries, Generals, Admirals and other distinguished personages. So, I call upon my colleagues to support an expansion of freedom, democracy and peace vote to support including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic in the NATO family of nations.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to say what the distinguished bill managers have already said, and that is a sincere thank you to the many people who made this bill possible. But I want to say it again. It is appropriate that Chairman Warner and Senator Baucus express their appreciation, but I want to do so as well. 
Mr. President, highways and ISTEA debates are not an academic debate from Missourians; they are more life and death matters. The State of Missouri has always been a leader in the area of transportation. One example is that the first construction contract awarded under the Interstate Highway System some 40 years ago was for part of I-70 near St. Charles, MO. But the problem is that Missouri has been shortchanged in the past. Missouri has been a donor State putting in more than a dollar for every dollar they get back. 
This final bill that has been crafted through a great deal of work is `rough justice' and demonstrates that reasonable people with passionate differences can reach compromise. My State of Missouri stands to gain $1.2 billion--that is not `million'; that is `billion' dollars--more over the next 6 years than during the last 6 years to improve highway safety and infrastructure. That amounts to a 50-percent increase to Missouri for Missouri's essential transportation infrastructure. 
I have worked long and hard on this bill with my distinguished friends and colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee. The underlying bill that the committee reported addresses the priorities I have had all along--increased funding overall, increased funding for the State of Missouri, fairness, and flexibility. 
I express my sincerest thanks to Chairman Chafee, Chairman Warner, Senator Baucus, and to all members of the committee for their assistance on things like my wetlands mitigation amendment, the triple-trailer amendment, and especially the amendments that we put in with respect to bridges, which are vitally important to my State. I look forward to the House passing the bill so we can get to conference and send to the President a transportation bill that will take us into the 21st century. 
I would like to offer my own special thanks, among others, to the fine people who were mentioned. I need to mention my assistant, Tracy Henke, who worked I don't know how many hundreds of hours per week and over the weeks on this bill, and prior to that time. I express my thanks to Jimmie Powell, to Dan Corbett, to Ann Loomis, Cathy Ruffalo, Ellen Stein, Tom Sliter, and Abigail Kinnison. As has already been said, these people put in untold hours, and they did what I think is a good job. It is a job that makes nobody perfectly happy. But it is a job that lays the foundation for the kind of transportation system that we need to have in this Nation for the 21st century. 
I am proud to have worked on this measure, and I thank my colleagues, and particularly their staffs who worked so hard to bring us to this point. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, thank you for giving me this opportunity to explain very briefly my amendment. 
This amendment simply says that the status quo regarding the operation of triple trailers--these are the long trucks with a cab and three trailers behind them--shall stay in place. States that currently allow the operation of triple trailers on certain roads within their own State restrictions can continue to allow them, but the operation of triples should not be expanded. 
Under the current Federal freeze enacted in ISTEA in 1991, triple trailers may not operate in any additional States on any routes on which they could not operate in 1991. 
Now I have no interest in getting into a debate on the statistical merits of triple trailers. Supporters of triples tell you they are perfectly safe, environmentally friendly, less damaging to the highways, and help keep consumer costs low. Supporters of triples will also tell you that the State requirements make them as safe or safer than other trailer operations. 
On the other hand, opponents of triple trailers will tell you they are unsafe for the drivers as well as other highway users, they damage roads, especially bridges, and they have little beneficial impact on consumer costs. 
As a Senator representing a State with the second and third largest rail hubs in the country, I can tell you railroads hate triples. As a Senator representing a State that allows triples on a small portion of roadways in the Kansas City and southwest Missouri areas, as home of the third largest trucking center in the country, I can tell you that trucking companies love them. 
As a Senator, as a driver, and as the father of a teenaged driver, I can tell you that triple trailers scare me to death. Triple trailers can be as long as 120 feet. They are as long as a 10-story building is tall. These trucks can weigh up to 64 tons. For comparison, the cars most of us drove to work this morning are about 14 to 15 feet long and only weigh 1 ton or so. The 120-foot triple trailer is equivalent of seven full-sized passenger cars end to end. Triple trailers require a full football field and a half to come to a stop. Anybody who has driven on a road with triples knows that triples can be intimidating. 
Let me be clear, I am a strong advocate and supporter of the trucking industry. I have said that Kansas City, MO, is the third largest trucking center in the country. Trucks based in Missouri move over 200,000 tons of outbound freight and over 250,000 tons of inbound freight every day. Because of the hard work, dedication, and quality service that the trucking industry provides, because of the skill and the ability and the dedication of truck drivers, our lives are made easier, and truck drivers are generally among the very safest drivers on the road. I think all of us can tell many stories of assistance, accommodation, and courtesy by the drivers of trucks, but we have also heard from drivers of trucks that they are very much concerned about the safety of triple trailers. 
When I, along with the chairman and other members of this committee, first spoke of this amendment last fall, we were joined by truckers, independent operators, who have had experience with triple trailers and they told us some horrifying tales about the dangers and the difficulties of running a triple trailer. Triples are not the answer. Expanding their operation into areas where they are not now present is not the answer to anyone's question. Sometimes bigger is definitely not better. 
I ask the support of my colleagues that this body go on record saying that we will maintain the status quo, that we will not expand the ability of triples to go beyond those areas where they were operating and were grandfathered in in 1991.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President--I will reluctantly vote against the McConnell amendment. I am concerned that if this provision is included in this bill the President will veto the bill or it will cause delay in enactment of this important legislation that is imperative to saving lives in this country. 
This ISTEA legislation is a matter of life and death to Missourians. Highway fatalities in the state of Missouri increased 13 percent from 1992-95; 77 percent of the fatal crashes during this time frame occurred on two-lane roads. In Missouri, 62 percent of the roads on the National Highway System, excluding the Interstate, are two lanes. I have had too many friends die on Missouri's highways. We need to make certain that this legislation is enacted at the earliest possible date! 
I want to make clear that since I became chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business I have strived to make certain that government contracting opportunities are available to ALL small businesses. I know that the engine driving the economic growth of this country is small businesses. Small businesses and the entrepreneurs of this country, regardless of race or gender, should be given every opportunity to succeed. 
For example, last year this body passed the HUBZones legislation which I authored. It passed unanimously and has been signed into law. The law provides government contract set asides to small businesses that are located in HUBZones, which are economically distressed metropolitan areas and poor rural counties. To be eligible for a contract set aside, 35 percent of a small business' workforce must be residents of HUBZones. This program is designed to help small businesses grow, while creating jobs and investment in urban and rural communities that are suffering from economic neglect. 
I do have some concerns that the McConnell amendment could inadvertently eliminate the HUBZone program. 
It is my hope that I can work with my friend and distinguished colleague, Senator McConnell, on this issue in the future. But, I will not hold up $3.6 billion for my State of Missouri.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Rosella Schnakenberg for her fifty years of service to First Community Bank in Ionia. On March 18, 1947, Rosella began working as a teller for the First Community Bank, then the Bank of Ionia. At the time she received a salary of $75 a month. Today she is Vice President and Facility Manager of the Bank and oversees the day-to-day operations. 
Through the years Rosella has watched the economic ups and downs of the bank and through it all has made sure that people have received quality service and the assistance they need. Watching people start businesses, purchase homes and pay for their children's college education has allowed her to see first hand the help she has given to others. 
In addition to Rosella's faithful service to her work, she is a community leader in Cole Camp, Missouri. She has been playing the organ at St. John's Lutheran Church in Cole Camp for more than fifty years and volunteers much of her free time to visiting nursing homes so that residents have company. I wish her continued success and congratulate her for fifty years of loyal service.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
I say in response to my colleague from Minnesota, be careful about relying on the Tufts study. The officials in charge of public assistance in my State and other States have pointed out some rather serious flaws in that study. We all share concerns about assuring there is adequate transportation, adequate day care, child care, for people moving from welfare to work, and I am not here to debate that amendment. At the appropriate time, we will review that amendment. 
What I wanted to call to the attention of my colleagues is the fact that yesterday my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, along with Senator Baucus, Senator Gramm, Senator Byrd and the very distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, announced agreement on funding levels for the highway authorization for the next 6 years. It will be $171 billion for highways. 
Let me explain what that means for my State of Missouri. Under the formula that was passed out of the committee as a committee amendment today, Missouri would receive $3.6 billion--that is billion dollars--compared to $2.4 billion that Missouri received over the last 6 years of the 1991 transportation bill. Missouri's average allocation per year would be around $600 million, as opposed to the $400 million the State was receiving under the old. 
That is tremendous progress. I am deeply indebted to the leadership of our committee and particularly to the budget chairman for making these dollars available. This is vitally important. Everybody in this Chamber knows how important funding for transportation is. 
I was not a cosponsor of the Byrd-Gramm amendment, but I have always made clear and reiterated my support that highway money and transportation money should go for highways. In Missouri and across the country, when people go to the gas pump, buy gas and pay a tax, they think it is going to the highway trust fund. They think it is going for transportation purposes. And that is a reasonable assumption, except that in this body we have divorced the revenue from the spending stream and in the past we have had that money siphoned off to cover overspending elsewhere. In the 1993 major tax increase, a 4.3-cent tax was levied for deficit reduction. 
Now, I believe that the transfer of the 4.3 cents back to the highway trust fund instead of deficit reduction has not only made a significantly increased amount of money available for transportation needs, but it has, I think, put the `trust' back into the highway trust funds. That is what we ought to be about; that is what we ought to be telling the people who are paying those taxes. We are recommitting ourselves to the basic principle and promise that we made, which is that when we provide the revenues to the Government under the dedicated gas tax money, we are going to use it for roads, bridges, highways and transportation when it's collected. 
In Missouri, these funds are desperately needed. I daresay that I have heard stories from other States where they understand the importance of highway dollars. I came to the floor last week and explained that the debate over transportation funding and policy was not just an academic debate for Missourians. It is about, obviously, convenience and ease of transportation. It is about economic growth because, in our State, you can see where jobs occur. They occur where there are good highways. But most important, good highways and bridges are matters of life and death in Missouri. Highway fatalities in the State of Missouri increased 13 percent from 1992 to 1995, and many of us in Missouri know somebody or several people who have lost their lives on highways. And 77 percent of the fatal crashes during this timeframe occurred on two-lane roads. 
Mr. President, it is a simple matter. When you have heavy traffic on two-lane roads, you have traffic delays, somebody gets anxious and pulls out to pass, and if there is a hill, if there is a curve, or if there is an unseen hidden spot in the road, a head-on crash occurs. That has happened too many times, and it happens because the two-lane roads that we are driving on are carrying traffic that everybody agrees should be carried on four-lane roads. This is why I say it is a matter of life and death. 
In Missouri, 62 percent of the roads on the National Highway System, when you exclude the Interstate System, are two-lane roads--two-lane roads that are supposed to be part of our National Highway System. We are in the top 10, in terms of highway count, in the number of cars traveling those roads. Many of those National Highway System roads don't even have shoulders on them. So if somebody comes across the line and you are passing a large truck, if you move too far to the right, you are off on the shoulder, and that can be deadly. 
In addition, my State of Missouri has the oldest--I repeat, the oldest--bridges in the country. There are a number of things that we like to be No. 1 in, but having the oldest bridges and some of the worst conditions in the country is not one of them. This is a dubious distinction. We are sixth from the bottom in the condition of our bridges. These are the reasons that the highway funding formula and the transportation bill is so vitally important in my State. The potential funding that this bill provides is a huge step in the right direction to save lives on Missouri's highways, roads, and bridges. Last week, I told the story of driving across some of the bridges in our State where you can look down and see the water. That is not reassuring. They don't design them as `see-through' bridges. Years and years of decay have opened up gaping holes, which is a frightening prospect when you are crossing the Missouri River or the Mississippi River. 
I urge my colleagues to work through the budget and the appropriations process to determine that we will make the real funding commitment and that we will meet that funding commitment that we put forward in this bill. 
When I began this process, when I started work on it, I had two primary goals. One was for the transportation bill to increase the overall size of the pie for highways, and getting that 4.3 cents in is vitally important. Secondly, Missouri, as one of the donor States, needed to get its share up. I believe these two conditions are met. 
You may recall last fall when filibusters held up the bill I crafted a bipartisan interim solution that enabled highway funding to continue through May 1 of this year, which means, as the distinguished occupant of the chair knows, we will be the bedeviled by those orange and white barrels this year. They will be springing up on our highways like the summer road flowers along the highways. They are going to be blossoming. I am pleased to be causing those headaches. But we need to continue the orange and white barrels; we need to continue that construction. 
I know the funding debates are far from over. As I mentioned last Friday, there are reasonable people who have passionate differences, and there is nothing like a highway funding fight to bring out those differences. We hope that it is merely a matter of verbal debate. But when it comes to highway funding, these differences have been visible and audible. I want to express again my sincerest thanks to Senator Chafee, Senator Baucus, and Senator Warner, for their leadership in working with committee members to avoid the `guerrilla warfare' that has been known to erupt on the highway bill in the past. I told the committee that I thought the leadership had achieved a rough system of justice that would make it possible for us to move this bill forward. 
Nobody is going to get everything that they want, but I believe that reasonable compromises have been made, and there may still be more made. We need to get this bill moving. I look forward to working with the members of the committee and my other colleagues throughout this process to achieve the goals that we all have for our States, that I have for my State of Missouri, but, most important, that we all must have for our national transportation policy. 
Again, my thanks to the leadership and my congratulations for the great staff work. We look forward to working on it. It will be an interesting debate. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Rhode Island. Let me begin by saying it is high time. I am anxious for this bill to move forward. I am very pleased to be here today with my colleagues to talk about this very important highway and transportation legislation and to offer an amendment which I believe has been cleared on both sides. 
Mr. President, this past October, November, I had the pleasure of working with our distinguished committee chairman, Senator Chafee, and the subcommittee chairman, and my good friend, Senator Warner, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus, to forge an interim solution that produced a short-term extension for this vital highway and transportation legislation that 
provided necessary resources to make certain that the orange cones and barrels that signal highway construction underway would continue to drive drivers nuts and show them that progress is being made. 
But as already has been pointed out on the floor numerous times over the last couple weeks, we only passed an extension, one that does expire. Let me tell my colleagues that getting agreement in passing the extension was not easy. However, it did give us an idea of the complexity of what we have ahead of us. 
We all know the importance and the role that transportation plays in our everyday lives and especially in our economy. We absolutely must improve upon the existing infrastructure--that is, the roads, the bridges, the transportation systems--and determine better ways to meet our transportation needs. That is why I worked with the distinguished chair and ranking member and the subcommittee leaders to produce the bill that is now pending. 
I am very pleased to support and urge the adoption of that measure. As Senator Chafee said yesterday, this bill was reported unanimously out of committee--I repeat, unanimously out of committee. This happened because the bill, called ISTEA II, builds our new policy solidly on our commitment to the concrete and asphalt reality that roads and bridges are and will continue to be the foundation of our transportation system. 
Mr. President, for me and for the people of my State of Missouri, highways are not an academic debate. They are a matter of life and death. All of us have heard the statistics about how our inadequate highways contribute to 114 deaths on our Nation's highways each day. Missouri's highway fatality rate is above the national average. I am reminded of these tragedies every time I go home. Every time I travel to a new part of the State, they have lost someone or several people on the highways. 
Missouri has roads designated as part of the National Highway System that have no shoulders. We have two-lane roads carrying traffic meant for four lanes. These are real death traps, because somebody who is not familiar with the road, too often an out-of-State visitor to our State, makes a mistake and crosses over the center line with tragic consequences to them and to some other innocent party as well. And our bridge needs are perhaps greater than any other State. 
I drove last Friday over the bridge at Hermann, MO. It is an eerie feeling driving over a highway bridge and looking down at the river below and seeing it through the bridge that you are driving over. Mr. President, that is not fun. That gets your attention. The people know that these bridges are not going to last forever. 
Missouri has too many highways marked with white crosses along the side where people have died. The white crosses are in memory of the loved ones who will never return because of our inadequate highways. 
Reauthorization of this measure, this highway transportation measure, is imperative. We must move forward. I know that maintaining our Nation's roads and bridges is not always a glamorous issue or undertaking. Too often we hear discussions about priority items that take our attention away. But as with the debate raging in education circles about improving our Nation's crumbling schools, so goes the equally important debate about improving our transportation infrastructure, our roads and highways and bridges. Here it is lives we are talking about. 
Mr. President, reasonable people do have passionate differences. We see that every day on the Senate floor. All of us who were here in 1991 can recall that debate can get ugly over those differences, especially when money is involved. Overall funding has proven to be one of the difficult issues already, and the floor debates have not even started on formulas yet. 
We all know there are tremendous challenges in meeting our aim of balancing the budget and our commitment to the American people to do so. I am ever mindful of and support achieving this goal. However, I do know the importance of the transportation infrastructure, the roads and highways and bridges and transportation needs of this country and the desire to provide for increased funding to meet those needs. 
As a member of the Budget Committee, the Appropriations Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am committed and pledge my support in working to find a solution that will provide the increased funding necessary for transportation while maintaining our commitment to a balanced budget. 
I expressed my appreciation to the majority leader, Senator Lott, and to our Budget Committee chairman, Senator Domenici, who are working together and working with us to provide the resources we need to put the `trust' back in the highway trust fund. 
I do support the highway money going for highways and transportation needs. My goal has always been to increase the size of the overall pie for highways and transportation and, as well, to increase Missouri's share. I will do everything possible to ensure that the State of Missouri gets a full, fair share back. 
Maybe S. 404, which is known as the Bond-Chafee Highway Trust Fund Integrity Act, introduced with the distinguished chairman a year ago, is part of the overall funding solution. It does not take the highway trust fund off budget, but it does ensure that the `trust' is put back in the trust fund. That is a goal that I believe we all share. 
I hope that negotiations on the overall funding level continue. If we can get a $28 billion highway program, let us do it. Let us work to achieve the allocation and the commitment of the highway trust fund moneys going back to highway trust fund purposes. 
Mr. President, unfortunately, when we talk about Federal money and formulas, there are always clear-cut winners and losers. I know Missouri has been on both sides, too often on the losing side. But none of this goes away if we wait. I thank the majority leader and I thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this up. 
Now, Mr. President, unless the chairman has other matters, I wish to introduce an amendment that I believe has been cleared on both sides.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment on wetlands mitigation banking has been cleared by both sides, and has been reviewed by EPA and the Corps who have no objection. It is, I believe, consistent with administration policy. It is supported by the Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials and the National Wetlands Coalition. I believe this amendment is good for wetlands protection. It promotes private sector efforts to protect wetlands, and it saves money that can be used on highways or other authorized uses under this act. This is a win-win-win amendment. 
Now, let me tell you what the amendment does. It simply provides, when highway projects result in impact to wetlands that require compensatory mitigation--a big word saying: If you take away a wetland here, you have to restore a wetland there so we do not have any loss of wetlands. That is required under current law. Here in this amendment we say that preference can be given, to the extent practical, to private sector mitigation banks. 
The amendment mandates that the banks be approved in accordance with the administration's Federal guidance on mitigation banking issued in 1993. It requires that the bank be within the service area of the impacted wetlands. 
Mitigation is usually accomplished by restoring or creating other wetlands. Isolated, on-site mitigation projects are expensive and often costly to maintain. Wetlands mitigation banks, on the other hand, are typically large tracts of land that have been restored as wetlands. A State department of transportation building a highway project which impacts wetlands near a bank buys `credits' generated from the bank based on the acreage quality of restored wetlands in order to satisfy its obligation to mitigate the harm to impacted wetlands. 
The bank sponsor assumes full responsibility for maintaining the restored wetland site, and the State Transportation Department has fulfilled its mitigation requirement and can get on with the work on much-needed projects. 
The amendment does nothing to change the mitigation requirement. It simply provides that mitigation banking will be the preferred alternative, where available, once mitigation requirements are found to exist. 
In 1996, the Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing where witnesses from the administration, the private sector, the environmental community, and the scientific community spoke to the promise of mitigation banking as being an important instrument to protect wetlands and to do so with less expense and less red tape. 
Robert Perciasepe, Assistant Administrator in the Office of Water at EPA, testified to `EPA's strong support for mitigation banking.' 
In his testimony, he said, `It's a unique win-win proposition. It's great for landowners because it makes the permitting process simpler and easier. . . . It's great for the environment because the consolidation of multiple mitigation projects into a single, large mitigation bank leads to greater environmental benefit in terms of the enhancement of wildlife habitat and the improvement of local water quality and flood control.' 
I will add that as a matter of policy, we have a great opportunity with mitigation banking to protect wetlands by making wetlands protection a profitable private enterprise. 
This effort is supported by the Missouri and Ohio Departments of Transportation and by AASHTO. Let me quote for you a September 1997 letter from the Director of the Ohio Department of Transportation:  
ODOT's costs for onsite mitigation have ranged as high as $150,000 per acre, when cost of design, real estate, construction and mitigation monitoring are combined. These costs are not out of line with the high-end costs experienced by many other DOTs around the country. Our lowest costs for onsite mitigation have generally exceeded $35,000 per acre. The cost of banking, in our experience, has ranged from around $10,000 to $12,000 per acre and includes all of the above cited cost factors. This equates to about one-quarter the cost of our average onsite mitigation. 
The States of Florida and Illinois, in the Chicago area, have already had a similar experience. 
This savings is significant and it can be achieved because of specialization and economies of scale. As a result, less federal highway money is spent on mitigating impacts to wetlands, and more federal highway money is made available for highway construction. 
Many agree that mitigation banks, approved in accordance with Administration guidance, will have a greater long term rate of success in protecting wetlands because: (1) they are in the business of wetlands protection and have the expertise; (2) banks are easier to regulate and be held accountable; and (3) because there is more time and flexibility for a bank to identify and procure high quality wetlands. 
I appreciate the assistance of the chairman, Senator Chafee, and Senator Baucus with this amendment. 
Again, this is good for the environment and the efficiencies will permit more of our precious highway dollars to be spent on highways. I urge the adoption of this bipartisan amendment. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to the late Harry Caray. Last week baseball lost one of its legends, but Harry's memory and spirit will live on for many years in the hearts of his fans. 
Harry grew up in my home State of Missouri, an orphan in St. Louis. Although he finished with the Chicago Cubs, Harry started his memorable career with the St. Louis Cardinals announcing for the organization for twenty-five years. Harry never left our hearts when he left to go to Chicago. I grew up listening to his undying energy and remember that he was an integral part of my developing a love of the sport. 
We will best remember Harry for his rendition of `Take me out to the Ball game,' his `Holy Cow!' and of course his pronunciation or perhaps mispronunciation of several players. I hope that people know that he brought a lot more to the game than just those things. He could bring excitement to a dull game and was as unpredictable as he was brash. People of all ages felt as though they were part of the game when Harry was announcing. Fans everywhere, myself included, will miss him.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished colleague from Alabama Senator Richard Shelby in sponsoring legislation to restore Congressional accountability to the regulatory process and improve the likelihood that Federal agencies will be more accountable to the voters for their rulemaking actions. The authority Congress has delegated to these agencies is the source of their power to issue rules, regulations, guidelines and the like. While this delegation of authority to Federal bureaucracies may be a necessary evil until we can make more progress to reduce the size and scope of government's expanded role in our daily lives, this unfortunate regulatory state of affairs calls for increased oversight and renewed involvement by the elected officials who pass the legislation that empowers the bureaucracy. 
The size of the regulatory burden is staggering. According to a study for the Small Business Administration by Thomas D. Hopkins, an Adjunct Fellow of the Center for the Study of American Business in St. Louis, the direct, annual cost of regulatory compliance in 1997 was $688 billion--which is approximately $6,875 each year for a family of four. At the same time Congress exercises fiscal restraint in order to achieve a balanced budget, we must also be vigilant to ensure that the Federal government does not impose additional `hidden taxes' in the form of regulatory costs on American citizens. 
As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, I have worked especially hard to reduce the burden imposed by government regulations on our nation's small businesses. In 1996, legislation I authored was enacted as an important step in our efforts to reduce red tape and increase fairness in the treatment of small businesses by Federal agencies. Enactment of this law was a victory for small business and for the consumers and workers who rely on small businesses for goods, services and jobs. Because the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act offers such great potential for improving the regulatory landscape, we refer to it as the `Red Tape Reduction Act.' 
The bill Senator Shelby and I are introducing today builds on the work initiated by the Red Tape Reduction Act. Specifically, Subtitle E of that important law, known as the Congressional Review Act (CRA), enhances the ability of Congress to serve as a backstop against excessive regulations. Senators Nickles and Reid sponsored the CRA portion of the Red Tape Reduction Act to provide a new process for Congress to review and disapprove new regulations and to make sure regulators are not exceeding or ignoring the Congressional intent of statutory law. 
Despite strong support for the CRA, Congress thus far has been hesitant to use the streamlined procedures for reviewing a regulation provided under the CRA. In fact, since enactment of the Congressional Review Act, more than 7,400 new regulations have been issued--on average 25-30 per day. While many of these rules are routine and others certainly would have survived Congressional scrutiny, the fact remains that more than 110 major final rules have been issued, each having an annual affect on the economy of $100 million or more. 
In the 104th Congress, one of two resolutions of disapproval introduced in the Senate reached the floor for a vote and was defeated. In the 105th Congress, only one resolution of disapproval has been introduced in the Senate. Consequently, Congress has been criticized for not fulfilling its role under the CRA. The fact is that, without a separate, reliable, source of in-depth analysis of these new rules, Congress has been limited in its ability to exercise its new authority over these rules. With Federal regulations costing our constituents $688 billion last year, and proposed and final rules accounting for more than 68,000 pages in the Federal Register in 1997 alone, it is time for Congress to take aggressive steps to ensure that the regulations flowing from Congressionally-passed legislation are fairly and reasonably fulfilling the purposes Congress intended. 
To provide Congress with the information needed to review new regulations and access whether a resolution of disapproval under the CRA should be considered. Senator Shelby and I are today introducing legislation to create a Congressional Office of Regulatory Analysis (CORA). CORA would provide an objective source of regulatory analysis to assist Congress in its review of new regulations. This small office will provide the missing information required by Congress to utilize better the potential oversight powers provided under the CRA. 
Patterned after the Congressional Budget Office, but on a smaller scale, CORA would be a professional, nonpartisan office, using available information to analyze major and non-major regulations. The sponsor of the companion bill in the other body estimates the cost of such an office at $5 million, comparable to the Office of Management and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). Consistent with the limited resources available to CORA, the bill places first priority on analysis of major rules, second priority on non-major rules recommended for analysis by a Congressional Committee, and third priority on non-major rules recommended for review by individual Members of Congress. 
The bill we introduce today also would consolidate within CORA certain activities assigned to the Congressional Budget Office under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 and the Governmental Accounting Office under the Congressional Review Act. This would provide Congress with one office, dedicated to the analysis of regulations and their costs. Finally, the bill instructs CORA to provide an annual report on the estimated total cost of regulations--a valuable piece of information the Administration failed to provide adequately despite Congress requiring such a regulatory accounting. 
With regulation expanding, Congress must re-take the reigns of accountability and good governance. CORA provides an essential tool in that effort and is consistent with the advances made by Congress in passing the Red Tape Reduction Act, the Congressional Review Act, and Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. I urge all my colleagues to review this legislation and join in our efforts to ensure that Congress has the information it needs to fulfill its responsibilities under the Congressional Review Act and the Constitution.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill --Putting Taxpayers First. In the next few weeks the Senate will have a historic opportunity to make far-reaching changes to the operation of the Internal Revenue Service and to strengthen taxpayers' rights. For too long, taxpayers have had to put up with poor service when dealing with the IRS--often to the tune of larger tax bills because of interest and penalties that accrue during the lengthy delays in resolving disputes. While our ultimate goal must be a simpler and less burdensome tax law, taxpayers need help today when dealing with the IRS. We must put taxpayers first. 
For my part, I have asked the people of Missouri for their suggestions on how to fix the IRS and better protect taxpayers' rights. In addition, as chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have asked small businesses across the country for their recommendations on this issue. I am pleased to say that a great many people have taken the time to call or write with their suggestions for improving this country's tax administration system. 
Over the last several months, the Finance Committee has focused extensively on abuse of taxpayers and the need to reform our tax administration system. In addition, my committee has held hearings on this issue and the importance of reform for entrepreneurs and small business owners throughout the country. The House has also completed its package of reform measures. That legislation provides a good start, but I believe we can make it even stronger. 
With the input and recommendations from all these sources in mind, today I am introducing the Putting Taxpayers First Act. This bill will provide critical relief for a broad spectrum of taxpayers from single moms and married couples to small business owners and farmers. It is based on two fundamental principles. We must create an IRS and a tax system that are based on top-quality service for all taxpayers, and we must act swiftly to restore citizen confidence in that system. 
My bill tackles these goals in three ways: by improving taxpayer rights and protections, restructuring the management and operation of the IRS, and using electronic filing technology to help taxpayers, not complicate their lives. 
For more than 200 years, Americans have had the right, guaranteed by the fourth amendment, `to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,' and have enjoyed the constitutional protections against being `deprived of * * * property, without due process of law' under the fifth amendment. 
My bill will make the IRS fully respect these rights by requiring, as part of the Tax Code, that the IRS must obtain the approval by a judge or magistrate with notice and a hearing for the taxpayer before seizing a taxpayer's property. The Government ought to be required to treat ordinary taxpayers at least as well as they treat common criminals. It is way past time to level the playing field and preserve the constitutional rights of all taxpayers. 
My bill also stops the runaway freight train of excessive penalties and interest in two ways. First, the interest on a penalty will only begin after the taxpayer fails to pay his tax bill. Today, interest on most penalties is applied retroactively to the date that the tax return was due, which may be as much as 2 to 3 years back. That is just not fair. Second, my bill eliminates multiple penalties that apply to the same error. Penalties should punish bad behavior, not honest errors that even well-intentioned people are bound to make now and then. 
Next, with respect to restructuring the IRS, the second part of my bill addresses the need for structural changes within the IRS. I believe that the operations and staffing of the IRS should be based along customer lines, an idea supported by the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS. The IRS' current one-size-fits-all approach no longer meets the needs of taxpayers and is inefficient for the IRS as well. 
By restructuring the IRS along customer lines, the agency could provide one-stop service for taxpayers with similar characteristics and needs, such as individuals, small businesses and large companies. As a result of these changes, a married couple could go to an IRS service center designed for individuals and get help on the issues they care about, like the new child tax credit and the Roth IRA. Similarly, a small business owner could resolve questions about the depreciation deductions for her business equipment with IRS employees specifically trained in these areas. 
I was extremely pleased to hear IRS Commissioner Rossotti embrace this one-stop-service proposal early this month. While the Commissioner has signaled his interest in a customer-based IRS, I want to make sure that it does not become one of the many reorganization ideas that lose favor after a few short years. 
To protect against this risk, my bill that I introduce today will make this structure a permanent part of the Tax Code. But reorganizing the IRS front lines, however, is only part of the task. The top-level management of the IRS here in Washington must make taxpayer service a reality throughout the 
agency. My bill takes that step by creating a full-time board of governors, which will have full responsibility, authority and accountability for IRS operations. 
This board composed of four individuals drawn from the private sector plus the IRS Commissioner will have the authority and information necessary to ensure that the agency's examinations and enforcement activities are conducted in a manner that treats taxpayers fairly and with respect. 
The board will also oversee the service provided by the taxpayer advocate and will ensure that the IRS appeals process is handled in an impartial manner. 
An independent, full-time board of governors will protect the IRS from being used for political purposes. Any efforts to instill confidence in our tax administration system are severely undercut when there are allegations that the IRS is being used for politically motivated audits. Regrettably, there have been recent reports suggesting the IRS has undertaken these types of audits with regard to certain individuals and nonprofit organizations like the Christian Coalition and the Heritage Foundation. An IRS board of governors with representatives of both political parties will help ensure that the agency is used for one purpose and one purpose alone: helping taxpayers to comply with the tax laws in the least burdensome manner possible. 
Mr. President, in addition to redesigning the agency, my bill also creates a commonsense approach for redesigning IRS communications. Too often we have heard from constituents, especially small business owners, that the notice they receive from the IRS is incomprehensible. As a result, one of two things usually happens: The taxpayer pays the bill without question just to make the IRS go away, even if they are not sure they owe taxes; or the taxpayer has to hire a professional to tell him or her what the notice means and then spend vast amounts of time and money getting the matter straightened out. This no-win situation has to end now. 
My bill creates a panel of individual taxpayers, small entrepreneurs, large business managers and other types of taxpayers who will review all standardized IRS documents to make sure they are clear and understandable to the taxpayers who must read them. Any notice, letter or form that does not meet this minimum standard will be sent back to the IRS with a recommendation that it be rewritten before it is sent to the taxpayer. And clear communications, I believe, are essential for good customer service. America's taxpayers deserve no less. 
Mr. President, as I said, in the next few weeks the Senate will have an historic opportunity to make far-reaching changes to the operation of the Internal Revenue Service and to strengthen taxpayers' rights. For too long, taxpayers have had to put up with poor service when dealing with the IRS--often to the tune of larger tax bills because of interest and penalties that accrue during the lengthy delays in resolving disputes. While our ultimate goal must be a simpler and less burdensome tax law, taxpayers need help today when dealing with the IRS. We must put taxpayers first. 
For my part, I have asked people across Missouri for their suggestions on how to fix the IRS and better protect taxpayers' rights. In addition, as the Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have asked small businesses across the country for their recommendations on this issue. And I am pleased to say that a great many people have taken the time to call or write with their suggestions for improving this country's tax-administration system. 
Over the last several months, the Finance Committee has focused extensively on abuse of taxpayers and the need to reform our tax-administration system. In addition, my Committee has held hearings on this issue and the importance of reform for entrepreneurs and small business owners throughout the country. The House has also completed its package of reform measures. That legislation provides a good start, but I believe we can make it even stronger. 
With the input and recommendations from all of these sources in mind, today I am introducing the Putting the Taxpayer First Act. This bill will provide critical relief for a broad spectrum of taxpayers, from single moms and married couples to small business owners and farmers. And it is based on two fundamental principles. We must create an IRS and a tax system that are based on top quality service for all taxpayers, and we must act swiftly to restore citizen confidence in that system. My bill tackles these goals in three ways: by improving taxpayer rights and protections, restructuring the management and operation of the IRS, and using electronic filing technology to help taxpayers, not complicate their lives.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I share the concerns of the Majority Leader regarding the shortcomings of the Section 404 program. In light of the recent and pending court cases, as well as the ongoing controversy over the scheduled demise in December of Nation Wide Permit 26, I agree strongly that Congress must address the Section 404 program legislatively. We should not continue to let the program bob and weave and stray in response to interpretations or policy preferences of each successive court decision or agency action. The law is unpredictable and it is not fair to the agencies administering the law or the landowners impacted by the law. 
Based on accounts of the oral arguments in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and subsequent conversations my staff has had with various officials, it appears very possible that the lower court decision on the `Tulloch' rule will be upheld. The `Tulloch' rule extends regulation under the Section 404 program to activities like `drainage' and `excavation' that harm wetlands. The lower court held that expanding the Section 404 program to cover these activities might be very good public policy, but the current statute does not cover these activities. Legislation expanding the program will be needed. In its successful attempt to obtain a stay of the lower court decision, the Federal government filed documents suggesting that the failure to regulate `drainage' and `excavation' would be an environmental catastrophe. Thus, if the Court of Appeals upholds the lower court decision, legislation will be necessary to cover these activities. 
My colleague from Louisiana and I have released a series of proposals in a `discussion draft' to encourage discussion of these difficult issues. One proposal in the draft would expand the activity regulated under Section 404 to include `drainage' and `execution.' This draft signals our commitment to engage in a constructive process with all parties to develop legislation that will stabilize the Section 404 program, expand the program to cover activities that are destructive to wetlands and make a number of common sense changes to the program that will make it more acceptable to private landowners on whose property 75% of these regulated areas are located. 
Senator Breaux and I released our discussion draft last summer. Time is growing short in this session of Congress, yet there is still time to act if there is a willingness of the various stakeholders to negotiate constructively and the will for us to legislate. I believe that I speak for my colleague from Louisiana when I pledge our cooperation in any reasonable process to develop Section 404 improvement legislation that will earn the support of a majority of our colleagues and will be good both for the environment and the regulated community. 
Mr. President, I agree with the Majority Leader. Twenty years without legislative attention is long enough for the Section 404 program. The time has arrived to tackle this difficult issue.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on cloture so that we may proceed to debate an issue which generates many profound ethical and moral questions, ones which demand our immediate attention. 
Let me be quite clear. This bill does not stop existing scientific research. I am as concerned as anyone here about the need for research on a whole range of diseases, things that can be perhaps cured or at least dealt with by stem cell research, by many other techniques that are now in progress today. Our bill does not stop any of that research. 
Let's be quite clear, our bill does not stop any of that promising research now underway. The measure places a very narrow ban on the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a human embryo. That is what we are talking about. Everybody said, `We agree we shouldn't be creating a human embryo by cloning,' and that is what this bill does. 
Over the past week, we have had a lot of distortion and, unfortunately, inflamed rhetoric by some of the big special interests, the likes of which I have not seen in my many years of public service. We have asked our opponents on numerous occasions, we have sat down with them, Senator Frist, Senator Gregg, our staffs and I sat down and said, `OK, if we all agree we shouldn't be creating a human embryo by cloning, how do you want to tighten it up?' 
They are not willing to come forward because there are some rogue scientists, maybe some big drug companies, big biotech companies, who want to create human embryos by cloning. They think that would be a great way to be more profitable, to do some research on cloned human embryos. I think that is where we need to draw the line. 
People say we want to have hearings. We have had hearings on the whole issue last year. We have debated it, and it comes down to the simple point: Do you want to say no to creating human embryos by cloning, by somatic cell nuclear transfer, or do you want to say, as my colleague from California would in her bill, `Oh, it's fine to create those human embryos by somatic cell nuclear transfer, so long as you destroy them, so long as you kill those test tube babies before they are implanted'? 
There are a couple problems, very practical problems. Once you start creating those cloned human embryos, it is a very simple procedure to implant them. Implantation of embryos is going along in fertility research now, and it would be impossible to police, to make sure they didn't start implanting them. 
But even if the objectives of the bill of my California colleague were carried out, it would mean that you would be creating human embryos by cloning, researching with them, working with them and destroying them. Do we want to step over that ethical line? I say no. 
It is not going to be any clearer 3 months from now, 6 months from now than it is now. What is going to be different is that in 3 or 6 months, the rogue scientist in Chicago or others may well start the process of cloning human embryos by somatic cell nuclear transfer. That is why we say it is important to move forward on this bill. 
If we bring this bill to the floor, we are happy to listen to and ask for specific suggestions from those who are concerned about legitimate research, but we have been advised time and time again that there is no legitimate research being done now in the biotech industry that uses somatic cell nuclear transfer to clone and create a human embryo as part of the research on any of these diseases. 
We have heard from patient groups, people who are very much concerned, as we all are, about cancer, about juvenile diabetes, cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's--the whole range of diseases. We can deal with those diseases. We can deal with the research without cloning a human embryo. 
The approach of my colleagues from California and Massachusetts would lead us down the slippery slope that would allow the creation of masses of human embryos as if they were assembly line products, not human life. How would the Federal Government police the implantation of these human embryos? 
By allowing the creation of cloned test tube babies so long as they are not implanted, our opponents' bill calls for the creation, manipulation and destruction of human embryos for research purposes. 
I have a letter that I will enter into the Record from Professor Joel Brind, Professor of Human Biology and Endocrinology at Baruch College, The City University of New York. He addresses the question of stem cell research. I quote from a portion of it:  
Industry opponents also correctly point out that S. 1601 would ban the production of human embryos for research or other purposes entirely unrelated to the aim of cloning a human being. And well it should . . . In fact, it is in this area of research and treatment, to wit, the generation of stem cells, from which replacement tissues or organs could be produced for transplantation into the patient from whom the somatic cell originally came, which is most important to the biotech industry, for obvious reasons. For reasons just as obvious to anyone with any moral sense, such practices must be outlawed, for otherwise, our society would permit the generation of human beings purely for the purpose of producing spare parts for others, and thence to be destroyed. Some may call this a `slippery slope'--I believe `sheer cliff' would be more accurate. 
Mr. President, I will add one other thing. He said: 
. . . S. 1601 would, in fact, place real restrictions on stem cell research. Stem cell researchers would have to continue to work with somatic cell nuclear transfer technology in animal systems, in order to learn how to transcend the need for producing zygotes first. However, this is no different from restricting cancer research by prohibiting the injection of cancer cells into human beings (instead of rats) and then testing potential anticancer drugs on them. As a civilized society, we do have to live with meaningful ethical constraints or we end up with the likes of the Tuskegee experiment.

Science has given us partial-birth abortions and Dr. Kevorkian's assisted suicide. We should say no to these scientific advances and no to the cloning of human embryos. If you vote against cloture, you are saying yes to human cloning.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have observed the debate over the nomination of Dr. David Satcher over the past couple weeks. It has been a very productive, yet intense, discussion which has raised some critical questions. 
Today, there is an unmistakable need for a capable individual to fill the position of United States Surgeon General--a position which has been vacant for over three years. Marked increases in smoking and substance abuse by our nation's youth, combined with the continuing plague of disease such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and others, have made it imperative for the nation to have access to advice that is both scientifically accurate and trustworthy. 
The person who occupies the Surgeon General's Office is our Nation's number one doctor and public health leader. Kids around the country will seek and heed the advice of the Surgeon General, and for this reason alone, thorough scrutiny of Dr. Satcher's qualifications and views is well-placed. 
Dr. Satcher has proven that he is an effective leader. Under Dr. Satcher's direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, child immunization rates have increased from 52 percent to a record 78 percent. As a result, vaccine-preventable childhood diseases are at record lows. Dr. Satcher also has led CDC's efforts to strengthen our nation's defenses against infectious diseases and food-borne illnesses. These are just a couple of significant results that have been achieved under Dr. Satcher's guidance. 
Despite Dr. Satcher's remarkable credentials and achievements, there have been some questions raised by my colleagues concerning his positions on partial-birth abortion and gun control. I have known and worked with Dr. Satcher on numerous occasions, especially in the area of birth defects prevention. In fact, I just met with him last week to discuss these grave concerns that have arisen since his nomination. Dr. Satcher has personally assured me that he will rely on science, instead of politics, to influence his decisions--thereby preserving the independence of the Office of the Surgeon General. 
Let me make it clear. I will continue the battle to ban partial-birth abortion, and have consistently voted to prohibit federal funds for abortion. In addition, I have consistently fought efforts to restrict the ability of law-abiding citizens to purchase and own firearms. 
Dr. Satcher has exemplified the utmost dedication, ability, and professionalism throughout his distinguished career. I am satisfied that he will continue to operate in this manner as Surgeon General of the United States. We may not agree on all issues, but I have the utmost confidence in his character and ability to serve with distinction. Dr. Satcher is a strong choice for this position, and I look forward to witnessing Dr. Satcher's efforts to preserve the independence of this office. 
With an issue as important as our nation's health, which rises far above partisan politics, I am confident that Dr. Satcher will serve America well.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I welcome the initiative on the part of Mr. Netanyahu and the Israeli government to significantly reduce the amount of aid we annually send to Israel. Our countries have a long-standing relationship which has been witness to the maturing of a fledgling democracy in an area intolerant of its presence. In a very real sense, we have supported Israel's right to exist as a nation and we have supported its economic development. 
I note that Mr. Netanyahu's plan which calls for the complete elimination of $1.2 Billion in economic aid, is testament to the successful implementation of our past years' investment. The funds we provided have not been squandered. The Israeli economy is strong and growing. Mr. Netanyahu is doing the right thing at the right time. We do not need to continue the current level of these funds into the future. However, Mr. President, we must also take care not to undermine the economic stability of this democracy and we must continue to insure its military strength. For those reasons, I support a gradual phasing out of the $1.2 Billion of economic aid and the gradual increase to its military aid by $600 Million. Israel has been and remains a strategic ally, both in the region and as an important partner in developing technologically advanced civilian and defense systems. We must do all in our power to not just merely maintain that relationship, but strengthen it. I firmly believe that a strong Israel is the cornerstone for a stable and peaceful Middle East region. 
The cost of defending itself has been a tremendous burden on the Israeli economy. The threats to its borders and its people are very real. The Israelis have looked to the United States not only for funding assistance but for the hardware with which to defend itself. I note with pride that the new centerpiece of the Israeli Air Force is none other than the Boeing McDonnell Douglas F-15 I, known as the Stirke Eagle here, and as the Thunder, in Israel. This is the most advanced operational tactical aircraft in the world today. It will increase Israel's security and in turn promote regional stability. This is very much in our interest. 
Mr. Netanyahu's proposal will solidify our military partnership and bring an end to Israel's status as an economic dependent. Mr. President, as Israel strengthens its economic house, we must remain committed to preserving that house so that it might remain as a democratic beacon in the region. A strong Israel is good for America.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thought before we got into a full-fledged debate saying this is bad, perhaps my colleagues would like to know what it is that we propose to do, speaking for the sponsors of this measure. It is obviously one that is going to take some discussion and debate, and it's very helpful to know some of the objections that are raised to it. Again, for the sake of the Record, let me say what this is. 
This measure is a very carefully and narrowly targeted provision that places an outright ban on the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer for human cloning purposes. It defines one technique, the technique that was used to create, by cloning, the sheep Dolly and says that you shall not do that for human beings --quite simply. 
Why is this necessary? Why is it necessary that we move forward on this? Well, frankly, recent reports show that a Chicago-based scientist is prepared to move forward with human cloning experimentation. I think this forces an immediate debate on how far out on a moral cliff we are willing to let science proceed before we as a nation insist on some meaningful constraints. We no longer have the luxury of waiting around for this morally reprehensible act to occur. 
That scientist is proposing to raise huge sums of money and promise infertile couples that he can clone human beings for them. The time for the debate and action is now. If creating test tube babies by cloning a human embryo is morally, ethically, and practically wrong, as I strongly believe it is, we need to stop it now. To delay it, to filibuster it, to postpone it means that not only this scientist and others who, perhaps, are not holding news conferences, can go forward with a process that I believe the overwhelming majority of American people believe is wrong, as I believe it is. To those who say we have not studied this or debated this, I only say that since we had this story about the cloning of Dolly the sheep, and stories of organizations and individuals pursuing human cloning, they have kept the debate alive. The American public is asking if similar techniques can be used to clone human beings, and they are concerned very deeply whether something which was thought only to be science fiction is now closer to reality. 
Now, there are some distinguished books that oppose a prohibition on human cloning. They suggest that we cannot put the genie back in the bottle and we cannot stop progress. I suggest that we have come to the point where our technological capability may be outrunning our moral sense. We have, in this body, carried a prohibition against Federal funding of cloning human embryos. We have prohibited the research and experimentation with Federal funding because we thought it was way down the line. We didn't want to see money used. Last year, after the cloning of Dolly the sheep, we held hearings; tremendous amounts of testimony were presented. I personally testified before Senator Frist's subcommittee. This is not a new debate. The reason this debate is important, and the reason that action is important is that now we are faced with scientists of, I believe, questionable judgment, who would go forward with something that is morally reprehensible. 
This measure is targeted narrowly to one specific process that was used to clone the sheep Dolly. It is the somatic cell nuclear transfer to create a human embryo. In addition to prohibiting that, we have, at the urging of my distinguished cosponsor, Senator Frist, provided for a commission to study the ethical implications of related technologies. And I believe we have made it clear that ongoing legitimate activity, short of this one specific process, cleaning out a human embryo and putting in a nuclear cell transfer, and starting the process of differentiation of the cell toward creating a test tube baby is unacceptable. 
The ethical implications of human cloning are staggering. I believe that we would have the overwhelming understanding and support of the American people that we should never create human life for spare parts, as a replacement for a child who has died, or for unnatural or selfish purposes. How many embryos or babies would we tolerate being created with abnormalities before we perfect human cloning? It took Dr. Wilmut, the Scottish scientist, 276 tries before creating Dolly, and we still do not even know if Dolly is the perfect sheep. For humans, those results are unacceptable--creating tremendously deformed human embryos or human beings. Dr. Ian Wilmut, the lead Scottish scientist who created Dolly, himself stated that he can see no scenario under which it would be ethical to clone human life. And he is right. 
In September of 1994, a Federal human embryo research panel noted that, `Allowing society to create genetically identical persons would devalue human life by undermining the individuality of human beings.' Further, the panel concluded that there are moral concerns about the deliberate duplication of an individual genome, and that making carbon copies of a human being is repugnant to members of the public. `Many members of the panel share this view and see no justification for Federal funding of such research.' 
I emphatically argue that those statements apply to private sector research as well. That is what we are trying to reach. 
It is important to note that the legislation is narrowly drafted, and its sole objective is to ban the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer for human cloning purposes. We worked overtime to ensure that this language was specific so that it would ban only the technique used to create Dolly. 
This technique has also been criticized by a representative of the pharmaceutical industry, who in a prepared statement for Members of Congress, dated January 13, 1998, stated:  
While conventional cloning technology has been used extensively worldwide to meet global medical needs, nuclear transfer technology is fraught with untold failures for each partial success and has major scientific and significant ethical issues associated with it. Furthermore, it has no strong therapeutic or economic-based need driving it at this time. The concept that it is a viable alternative to infertile parents is cruel and completely unjustified. I would challenge you not to confuse the two as the Congress considers its options here. 
Well, Mr. President, myself, Senator Frist, Senator Gregg, and others, have met with and consulted with representatives of the pharmaceutical industry, researchers, representatives of patient groups, and we have told them what we are proposing to do, and we have listened to them discuss all of the implications. We know that in vitro fertilization, plant and animal cloning, cloning of DNA cells and tissues, stem cell research, gene therapy research, and other activities taking place at the Human Genome Center offer great hope in addressing how to prevent, diagnose, and treat many devastating diseases. These types of research will continue to thrive, that is clear, because we have targeted our ban so narrowly, and we intend only to prohibit, by cloning, the creation of the human embryo. 
This is a technique characterized by industry, researchers, theologians, ethicists, and others, as fraught with failures and lacking therapeutic value. This bill, however, does allow the important and promising research to continue. I have long been a supporter of biotechnology. I have supported biotechnology efforts. I continue to support everything from human genome mapping to all of the other human research efforts. We have no problems with and support cloning of animals. But there is a bright line between those activities and human cloning, and we must draw that line. There is a line, Mr. President, and that line is clear. 
You can do all the research you want. You can create organs, you can do all kinds of experimentation. But you should not be able to create a human embryo by cloning, starting a test tube baby. Now, there are some who say that it is all right so long as you don't implant that cloned human embryo, so long as you destroy it. Once you start the process of creating this test tube baby, it is OK to destroy it. As a matter of fact, they would have us believe that we would start all these human embryos, start the cell differentiation, and then wipe them out. Well, I think that raises serious questions with many people, and I am included in that. But it also raise also the prospect that once you start cloning these human embryos--they are very small --they can be transported very easily, picked up and taken from this country to someplace else in the world in large numbers, where there may be no ban on implementation. The difficult science is creating the human embryo. Once you do that, you have opened a whole area. And to say we are just going to prevent them from being implanted so a baby is brought to term, 
that won't get it because that is too late. I have heard the arguments of those who oppose this bill. And, quite frankly, let me tell you what those arguments are. 
They are that some scientists would like to be able to create human embryos, play with them, and experiment with them, experiment with a human embryo that is differentiating and starting to grow, and say, `OK. Time is up. We will toss this one away and we will start playing with another one.' Once you get into that process, Mr. President, you have stepped over the moral and ethical line. There is a clear line. There is a very clear line. 
We are ready to have the argument because I believe a significant majority of the Members of this body reflect a significant, overwhelming view of the American people that that is unacceptable. There may be well-intentioned scientists who say we need to play with human embryos and start these embryos growing and let us play with them. They may get something. They may develop some scientific knowledge. But the statements I have already presented show that there is no really legitimate, scientific need, and, in fact, there are grave moral and ethical reasons not to. I strongly hold the belief that all human beings are unique and created by God. And I think billions of people around the world share it. Human cloning, a man's attempt to play God, will change the very meaning of life, of human dignity, and what it is to be human. Are we ready for that? I don't think so. 
Mr. President, the Washington Post in October of 1994 in an editorial said:  
The creation of human embryos specifically for research that will destroy them is unconscionable. Viewed from one angle this issue can be made to yield endless complexities. What about the suffering of individuals and infertile couples who might be helped by embryo research? What about the status of a brand new embryo? But before you get to these questions, there is a simpler one. `Is there a line that should not be crossed even for scientific, or other gain, and, if so, why is it?" 
That is the quotation from the Washington Post. In case you missed it, let me give you the first sentence again. `The creation of human embryos specifically for research that will destroy them is unconscionable.' 
That is a simple, straightforward statement with which I agree, and I believe when the Members before the body have an opportunity to reflect on it and consider it, they will agree that is right. 
Let me quote President Bill Clinton, 1994. 
The subject raises profound ethical and moral questions as well as issues concerning the appropriate allocation of Federal funds. I appreciate the work of the committees that have considered this complex issue, and I understand that advances in in vitro fertilization research and other areas could be derived from such work. However, I do not believe that Federal funds should be used to support the creation of human embryos for research purposes. 
That is the President. He said don't create human embryos by cloning for research. 
That is the question. Those who would delay and filibuster want to avoid that question and delay it. I know they are well-intentioned. I know they may have great reservations. They may not agree with that simple moral standard. But there are people out there who want to start that process, who may as we speak be engaged in that process. 
We have debated whether cloning of human embryos is a good idea. I think there is a clear consensus. We have drafted a narrow bill, a targeted one that I hope we can move forward to enact. There is a lot of smoke and mirrors, and there are a lot of discussions about a whole range of other options. These are very technical. That is why we set up a commission to review all of these things. What we are targeting right now is the one procedure that has been used with sheep, and could be used, if it is not stopped, to start creating human embryos. For those people who want to create human embryos for research purposes and destroy them or implant them, I say you are going across the line. I don't care what your motives are. I don't care whether it is profitable. I don't care what you think might come out of it. At this point we are saying, `No, you cannot cross the line.' 
Mr. President, that is what this debate is all about. I believe that we may have an opportunity, if discussion continues, to bring this debate to a close. At such time I will be back on this floor to say, if you want to allow the scientific community and some people with different sets of standards and different sets of judgments to go ahead and attempt to create human embryos by cloning by a somatic cell nuclear transfer, go ahead and support the extended discussion. Vote no against cloture. But, by doing so, you are providing a green light. You are saying, go ahead and use this technique that I believe is unacceptable and should be made illegal in this country as it is in the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and many of the other developed and leading countries in the 
world. 
Mr. President, I appreciate very much the Senator from California allowing me to explain what the bill is and what it is not. I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today, I rise to announce that we are introducing a measure that places an outright ban on the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology for human cloning purposes. Recent reports that a Chicago-based scientist is prepared to move forward with human cloning experimentation forces us to engage in an immediate debate on how far out on the moral cliff we are willing to let science proceed before we as a Nation insist on some meaningful constraints. When the announcement was made last month that these efforts to raise funds for human cloning were going forward, we stated that we would move on an emergency basis to deal with this and to express, through congressional action, a strong sense that this is unacceptable and we must prohibit it. I am pleased to be joined by the distinguished cosponsors, Senators Frist, Gregg, Lott, Hutchison, Shelby, Nickles, Lugar, Abraham, Grams, and Hagel. 
I believe we no longer have the luxury of waiting around for this morally reprehensible act to occur in the United States. Less than a year ago, the cloning of Dolly, the now famous sheep, provoked a debate of unprecedented proportions, a debate which to this day generates polar feelings of fascination and fear. We have in this body adopted prohibition on the use of Federal funds for research on or experimentation in human cloning. The time has come for us to make that a flat prohibition and to put our country in league with other civilized countries, which are saying human cloning is not acceptable and will not go forward. 
Daily news accounts about the successful cloning of animals and stories of organizations and individuals pursuing human cloning have kept the debate alive. The American public is asking if similar techniques can be used to clone humans, and they are concerned whether something that was once thought only to be science fiction is now closer to becoming a reality. 
Those opposing a prohibition on human cloning suggest that we cannot put the genie back in the bottle, and that we cannot stop progress. I suggest that in this case our technological capability may be outrunning our moral sense. 
The ethical implications of human cloning are staggering. We should never create human life for spare parts, as a replacement for a child who has died, or for other unnatural and selfish purposes. 
How many embryos or babies would we tolerate being created with abnormalities before we would perfect human cloning? It took Scottish scientists over 276 tries before they created Dolly, and we still do not even know if Dolly is the perfect sheep. What would have happened had those 276 been badly deformed potential humans? For humans, these results are entirely unacceptable. Dr. Ian Wilmut, the leading Scottish scientist who created Dolly, himself has stated that he can see no scenario under which it would be ethical to clone human life. I believe he is right. 
Moreover, in September of 1994, a federal Human Embryo Research Panel noted that `allowing society to create genetically identical persons would devalue human life by undermining the individuality of human beings.' 
Further, the panel concluded that `there are broad moral concerns about the deliberate duplication of an individual genome. The notion of cloning an existing human being or of making carbon copies of an existing embryo appears repugnant to members of the public. Many members of the panel share this view and see no justification for federal funding of such research.' 
And I would emphatically argue that those statements apply to private sector research as well. 
It is also important to note that this legislation is narrowly drafted, and it's sole objective is to ban the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer for human cloning purposes. We worked overtime to ensure that this language was specific so that it would only ban this technique which was used to create Dolly. 
This technique has also been criticized by a representative of the pharmaceutical industry. In a prepared statement for members of Congress, dated January 13, 1998, the representative said,  
While conventional cloning technology has been used extensively worldwide to meet global medical needs, nuclear transfer technology is fraught with untold failures for each partial success, and has major significant ethical issues associated with it. Furthermore, it has no strong therapeutic or economic based need driving it at this time. The concept that it is a viable alternative to infertile parents is cruel and completely unjustified. I would challenge you not to confuse the two as the Congress considers its options here. 
In addition, our bill is straightforward and clear. It prevents a specific technology that is characterized by industry, researchers, theologians, ethicists, and others as `fraught with failures and lacking therapeutic value.' This bill, however, does allow important and promising research to continue. 
In vitro fertilization research, plant and animal cloning, the cloning of DNA, cells and tissues, stem cell research, gene therapy research and other activities taking place at the Human Genome Center offer great hope in addressing how to prevent, diagnose, and treat many devastating diseases. And these types of research will continue to thrive. 
I have long been a supporter of biotechnology; however, there is a bright line between those activities and human cloning. And we must draw that line. 
The belief that all human beings are unique and created by God is shared by billions of us around the world. Human cloning, or man's attempt to play God, would change the very meaning of life, of human dignity, and of what it is to be human. Are we ready for that? Hardly. 
I heard a profound statement from a leading bioethicist. He said, `I have heard from many who wish they could be cloned, but I have never heard someone say that they wished they were a clone of someone else'--because cloning threatens human dignity, of what it means to be a unique individual. 
There is a bright line between those activities--the legitimate activities and investigations to improve human life, to deal with the significant diseases that we have that might be ameliorated by technological research. We have to draw the line between legitimate research in medicine and human cloning. 
Human cloning would devalue human life by undermining the individuality of human beings. We must show the moral courage and have the will to say no to human cloning.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the crisis in Iraq has been created because of the appalling behavior of a man bent on defying the legitimate directives he agreed to as the defeated leader of a ruthless and rogue army. For months, if not years, Saddam Hussein has been developing and hiding the very weapons he explicitly vowed to excise from his country's arsenal. These are weapons which he has demonstrated the will to use and which, in a slightly more sophisticated delivery system, may threaten the entire world. He has starved his people in order to gain sympathy from a compassionate world community, he has gassed his own citizens to silence their cries for freedom, he has ruthlessly attacked his neighbors, massacring thousands through chemical warfare, and he has threatened to incinerate an entire people of a neighboring sovereign nation. 
This crisis needs to be ingrained into our psyche as a case study of how a bellicose and unrepentant government can circumvent its obligations to the world community and world peace, and avoid the reasonable consequences for those actions. Even more so, this is an object lesson of how our `allies' will respond to such behavior. They seem willing to curry favor with a dictator by compromising and redefining critical enforcement procedures. Compromise? What is there to compromise? Saddam has broken his covenant with the world. We know it. The world knows it, and our collective governments have been ineffectual in dealing with him. To the President and the leaders of the other nations of the world, I ask three very basic questions and give you three very basic `heartland of America' responses. 
First, has Saddam honored his commitment to the world in freely and openly ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction? No. 
Second, will he? Not if we don't have the courage to force him, with extreme prejudice to his military, if necessary. 
And third, is he more dangerous today than yesterday because of a basic weakness and willingness to compromise something which should be enforced without compromise? And that answer is, yes he is more dangerous. 
We have wasted critical time. We have allowed Saddam the opportunity to develop the very things he has sworn not to and the very things we swore we wouldn't permit. The current situation must not continue. We must and I believe we can, convince a nervous and wary cadre of allied nations to stand up for what is right and what is demanded to preserve the stability of the world. But if not Mr. President we may have to go it alone or with but a few courageous colleagues from the league of nations. 
I am sure we will support the President's decision for decisive action, whatever it may be. Therefore, I join with the majority and minority leaders of this great body and ask that they would consider adding me to the list of co-sponsors of their concurrent resolution number 71 concerning the current crisis in Iraq.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a tremendous accomplishment by the Zion Grove Missionary Baptist Church and Reverend Frank L Selkirk III, Ph.D. As of December 31, 1997, the Church has raised enough money, from members and the Kansas City, Missouri, community to pay their mortgage. 
The Zion Grove Missionary Baptist Church Family will commemorate this achievement with a `Mortgage Burning Ceremony' on January 18. The hard work and perseverance of all the members at Zion Grove Missionary Baptist Church will begin to show in 1998 when money becomes available for new programs and possible expansion. 
I congratulate Zion Grove Missionary Baptist Church for their hard work and success. Additionally, I commend staff and members for their spirit and energy throughout their many years of existence and wish them continued success in enriching the Kansas City community for years to come.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Missouri State Representative Bonnie Sue Cooper for her outstanding contributions to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). As last year's Chairwoman, Bonnie Sue set a new leadership standard that will be a challenge for all future Chairpersons. 
ALEC is the largest bipartisan, individual membership association of state legislators in the country. After serving as Vice-Chairwoman for two years, Bonnie Sue was voted Chairwoman for the 1997 term. According to Arkansas Speaker of the House Bobby Hogue, `In the year Bonnie Sue has been Chairman there has been progress on every front at ALEC. It has strengthened its policy making operations and raised its profile among both legislators and the private sector.' Speaker Hogue replaced Bonnie Sue as Chairman. 
Bonnie Sue has been an incredible leader, not only in the State of Missouri, but also at a National level. I enjoy seeing leadership of Bonnie Sue's caliber and know that there are only bigger things to come for her. I congratulate Representative Cooper on another outstanding year and wish her success in the future.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Steven Miller whose dedication to Missouri athletics has earned him a place in the Missouri State Track and Cross Country Coaches Hall of Fame. For more than 20 years Coach Miller has strived to make his Francis Howell High School team in St. Charles, Missouri one of the best. 
Under Coach Miller's guidance, The Francis Howell track team has won 22 out of 39 Conference titles and the Cross Country team has won 10 out of 18. Even more impressive are the individual accomplishments by his former athletes. Coach Miller has coached one pole vaulter who proceeded to the 1996 Summer Olympics, a woman distance runner who became a two-time NCAA Division I All-American, more than 50 athletes who have become coaches, 14 state champions and a girl's cross country team who won the state championship in 1987. 
High school athletics is an area that I believe helps to teach very important values to young people and it is always encouraging to learn of a coach with the drive and commitment to excellence shown by coach Miller. Coaches, athletes and parents at Francis Howell High School are fortunate to have such an inspirational role model and educator. 
I congratulate Coach Miller for his hard work and success. Additionally, I commend his undying energy throughout his many years of coaching and wish him continued success at Francis Howell High School.

 Mr. BOND. Mr President, Congress has the `power to promote the progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.' If that phrase sounds familiar to my colleagues, it is because I lifted it straight from the Constitution. Article 1, section 8, known to many as the inventors clause. 
This section of the Constitution is the result of the foresight that our Founding Fathers had to cut a deal with the creative minds of a fledgling country. The deal was rather simple, in exchange for sharing their ingenuity and their creations with the citizens of this new country, the Congress would grant these inventors temporary monopolies on their products and permit them to enjoy the proceeds of their invention for a period of time, with the weight of the law of the land to ensure those rights were protected. 
This was a carefully thought out concept by rather brilliant individuals with unquestioned foresight. In my opinion, this compromise has been a smashing success. In the past 220 years, the United States has become an economic, industrial, and intellectual superpower. The creative product of the U.S. is unmatched the world over and I believe that the United States patent system has played a central role in this success. 
Why am I sharing these thoughts with my colleagues, because it is just like the Federal Government to take a good idea and turn it on its head. There is legislation pending on the Senate Calender, with the strong backing of the Clinton administration, that would gut the protection and the incentives offered inventors by our patent and trademark laws. This country's inventors have been an indispensable force in the success of which I have spoken. But this legislation would tip the balance of protection offered by patent laws away from these inventors and thinkers and open them to the hostile environment of intellectual property piracy and idea predators--commonplace in other parts of the world. Our inventors will be jerked from a protective environment, known for nurturing creativity and advancing practical knowledge, and be cast into a far harsher arena where it will be eminently more difficult for inventors to secure their rights and enjoy the rewards of their creativity and entrepreneurship--and possibly be driven from their work all together. 
I am hear to speak out on behalf of the inventors and the small guys of this country. People with ideas. I would suspect that scattered throughout the bill there may be some good ideas that may improve the efficiency of the Patent and Trademark Office, but taken as a whole the changes proposed would stifle rather than promote the sciences and the useful arts. I believe the legislation is ill-conceived and I will fight it should it see Senate debate. 
The past couple of weeks, the Senate has been debating the state of manufacturing in the United States. Many of my colleagues have registered their concern that much of our manufacturing base has left the country and they fear that this trend will continue. I believe that there is a future for manufacturing and industry in this country. I am very encouraged by the number of small businesses and startup companies presently thriving in the United States. Much of our future lies with these startup businesses and small business people that are creating new technology, starting companies, and expanding employment opportunities. But I believe we need to seize the opportunity and continue to encourage it. 
This is where the patent comes into the equation. A great idea can come to anyone, regardless of his or her capital or financial resources. This is the point at which the magnificence of our system becomes clear to me. Should a person be the first with an idea and successfully document that idea, that person can be granted a patent. The patent secures a monopoly and if it is a good idea it can be shopped around the venture capital markets. Should the financial assistance be secured, the inventor can build a prototype, start a business, hire people, and perhaps even build a successful company and make money. 
I believe that strong patent protection is central to that equation. First, those with capital are not inclined to fork over some money because it is the nice thing to do, they want assurances of return. The legally protected monopoly provides that assurance. The fact that our patent laws offer the strongest possible protection also contributes to that assurance. The inventor's idea is held in secret at the patent office until it is granted, which by the way prevents theft. The law also grants a legal right upon which an inventor can bring a civil action for damages should that idea be infringed upon. Strong patent protection lends value and certainty to this temporary monopoly. 
Without the patent protection, ideas that are not backed by financial resources may never see the light of day or else they may be gobbled up by a large company for pennies on the dollar. If one does not hold a realistic belief that they can make a go of it with their own idea, I believe that stifles important incentives present in America to pursue an idea or invent. But even more so, I do not believe this is the American way. This is a great country because anyone with an idea and the fortitude to pursue that idea can make a go it. This country is full of companies that began under just such circumstances. 
This country needs its entrepreneurs, they are essential if we are to continue to enjoy economic growth. Think about the role of entrepreneurs and startup companies in our economy. They come up with new ideas, they promote competition, they shake up old establishments, they force competitors to be smart and competitive, they inject vigor and dynamism into our capitalistic system. They create manufacturing jobs right here in the United States. They create secure and well-paying jobs for Americans. And they give you, me, and our children new technology and news ideas for all our use. This force is essential to our strength and continued growth and the patent laws are essential to allowing these start-ups to begin and then thrive. 
Many of those that are pushing for this bill are large companies with vast financial resources. Before they put forward their arguments in favor of the legislation, I must challenge them to ask themselves some important questions. Did not their companies begin with a single person with an idea? Did they not seize the opportunities offered in this country to grow and flourish? Did not the patent offer protection needed to pursuing that idea? Pulling the ladder up once you have made it to the top is not the American way, but that agenda is underlying much of this legislation. 
I support the inventors who are fighting these changes. I believe they are correct and courageous in their stance. Unfortunately, they have been ridiculed and vilified in the press by the Commissioner of the PTO, the individual running the agency responsible for licensing billions of dollars in intellectual property rights here in the United States. In fact, I read that he said that the opponents of this bill, that would include myself, reside on the lunatic fringe. He also compared our sanity to that of Timothy McVeigh--on behalf of the hardworking inventors of this country, I find such comments outrageous and demeaning. But rather than dignifying those ridiculous comments by responding on the merits, I will share with my colleagues a sampling of those that Mr. Lehman is saying reside on the lunatic fringe. 
First, I have been contacted by countless inventors registering their opposition, their creations include medical devices, drugs, machinery, electronic technology, computer technology, and agricultural products--to mention a few. They share a fear that this will open them up to litigation, theft, and harassment while closing down their opportunities to continue their work. I have also been contacted by men and women of science, economists, doctors, and professors. The most notable group of objectors is a group of over 20 Nobel Laureates in science and economics who have signed an open letter to the U.S. Senate opposing the bill. These great minds all agree that this legislation could result in `lasting harm to the United States and to the world.' They also concur with the concerns I am advancing today that this bill will be very harmful to small inventors and `discourage the flow of new inventions that have contributed so much to America's superior performance in the advancement of science and technology.' Finally, these great scientists and economists have expressed concern that this bill will create a disincentive to rely on the limited life of a patent to share their creations with the public, an occurrence which will sap the spirit of the inventors clause. 
I think that opposition should be enough to convince just about anyone. But 
respected others, including the New York Times, have spoken out. The Times editorial page has concluded that this bill will `dampen the innovative spirit that helps sustain the American economy.' The Times also correctly notes that the American patent system generates more and better patent applications than any other country's, but that this bill terribly threatens the incentives present in our system that stimulates that creativity. 
I have also been contacted by Ross Perot, who has expressed in no uncertain terms his absolute objection to this legislation. As Mr. Perot reminded me, patents are a constitutionally guaranteed right which have been essential to countless Americans in their fulfillment of the American dream. But rather than celebrate this success story unique to America, we are proposing selling our inventors down the river. Mr. Perot has called upon the Members of Congress to ask themselves a simple question when considering this bill, is it right or is it wrong? We both agree it is wrong. And we are ready for a fight. Mr. Perot, whose dedication to America and success as a businessman cannot be questioned, has said, in the words of Isaac Hull, `If that fellow wants a fight, we won't disappoint him.' 
There are other well-respected groups, small business groups and groups of concerned citizens that believe this legislation is bad policy and are lining up for a fight. 
I will take the collective contribution of those that oppose this bill and stack them up against Mr. Lehman's arguments any day. The inventors of this country should derive confidence because they have the Constitution and many great minds of science on their side and rhetoric on the other. 
For those reviewing the bill, I would like to point out some issues. 
First, the proponents of the bill want to create an infringement defense, known as a prior user right. The prior user right is a bad idea for many reasons. Foremost, it starts down a road that changes our `first to invent' system and overturns 200 years of U.S. patent policy. The defense would not only permit inventors to keep their ideas secret, but it encourages them to keep them secret. Our first to invent system protects small inventors. If they document their invention, they will not have to engage in a race to the patent office. They will have time to tinker and perfect their inventions without being forced to file early and then file for all perfections, a costly process for a small inventor. 
The defense will hurt small inventors in the capital markets because it will undermine the certainty of the patent. As I said this certainty is important to attracting capital and the capital is important for underfunded inventors to take their products to market. Should one have an invention that requires expensive testing, the idea can not be perfected without finances. Capital is essential for inventors to role out their own ideas. This section poses many problems about which I could speak for quite some time, but I will refrain. The reasons will be aired fully in time. 
Many proponents want to force all inventors to publish their ideas after 18 months, regardless of whether the patent review process is completed. Some changes have been made to scale this back, but many are laying in wait to see this implemented. I believe this would open our inventors to theft. Small inventors would have to go to court to recoup their just rewards and would have to depend on costly litigation. Many say, `We won't steal ideas,' I hope not, but this is the business world. I am unwilling to put small inventors at this sort of a risk. 
Proponents are looking for changes in the system for challenges to patents, this may open small inventors to unnecessary expense and litigation. Taken as a whole, there are profound changes proposed. The collective weight, I believe, will hurt our small inventors. 
A quick word about an argument forwarded by the bill's proponents. They will come to your office saying that this bill is necessary because there is a pariah lurking in the world of intellectual property. He uses what is called a submarine patent to manipulate the patent review process to reap unjustified rewards from honest, hard-working men and women. His greed and treachery could potentially destroy thousands of businesses and deal a crushing blow to our economy. 
To that I respond--hogwash. Let's engage in an honest debate. When we in Congress agreed to the implementing language in the GATT agreement, we agreed to change the U.S. patent term from a guaranteed 17 years to 20 years from the date of filing. Supposedly, that was done to get at submarine patents. It does take away most if not all of the incentive for an inventor to game the system and should drive a stake into the heart of wrongdoers. 
In the process we made a tremendous sacrifice that will cost many of our inventors patent protection. Today, for each day beyond 3 years that a patent lingers in the patent office, our inventors will lose a day of patent protection. Should someone invent a better potato peeler or candy wrapper, it probable won't be in the office today. But the change could have a significant affect on those attempting to get a patent on breakthrough technology. Such technology can often stay under review in the office for years and subsequently our inventors have lost years of protection compared with what they enjoyed before the change. Our inventors have made a great sacrifice to root out the wrongdoers in the system. But the proponents of this bill want more. 
They do have more. The PTO has a computer system designed to track patent applications that appear to be those of one attempting to game the system. The Commissioner also has the power to order that the application of one attempting to game the system is published, further curtailing the possibility of the submarine patents. Finally, the Commissioner himself has said that only 1 percent of 1 percent of patent applications could be considered submarine patents. 
The Commissioner has plenty of tools at his disposal to curb this problem if it in fact exists. If the problem is out of control, then I believe the problem lies with the Commissioner and those with complaints would be better served leveling their concerns at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. 
I will conclude by saying that brilliant minds have been drawn to this country and the brilliant minds native to this country have flourished. I do not believe it is an accident. We in America have chosen our own path. The goal of our patent system is to protect and reward entrepreneurs and innovative businesses, to encourage invention and advancement of practical knowledge. The goal of many of our competitor systems is to share technology immediately, not to protect it. That results in preserving the corporate hierarchy without giving innovators the opportunity to compete. 
In other countries thoughts and ideas do not receive the level of reward that they do here. The system works, let us not destroy it. If we want to improve the Patent Office, let's get on with it. But let us not organize a systematic assault on the very system that has contributed so much to this country becoming the greatest Nation on Earth.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on Tuesday, November 18, 1997, Beverly Cathcard will be honored at the American Royal Event in Kansas City, MO, in recognition of her lifelong devotion to the equine community throughout the State of Missouri. 
Beverly's Hidden Valley Stables have been the beginning of several area equestrians who have ridden for enjoyment or for the love of the sport and competition. Her horses have won such prestigious races as the Morgan Grand National Horse Show, the American Royal, UPHA Chapter Five Horse Show and many other local, regional, and national level events. She has been in charge of the children's horse show at the American Royal and has served on the State and local boards of directors for the Missouri Horse Shows Association and the Longview Horse Park Board as well as many others. 
Beverly represents the kind of spirit, honor, and integrity that belong in the equestrian community. November 18 will be a great occasion for the American Royal and I join them in paying tribute to Beverly Cathcard.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand before you today to recognize a tremendous individual who has exemplified citizenship, character, and service to humanity throughout his life, Reverend Walter J. Keisker. 
This special servant of God and man was bestowed an honorary degree of doctor of divinity in 1993 by Concordia Seminary in St. Louis for 70 years of faithful service. In accepting the honor Reverend Keisker stated, `There are others more deserving of the degree, but I am humbly grateful for it.' Anyone ever associated with Reverend Keisker will acknowledge the humbleness of this special gentleman, but they will know the unique spirit and tenacity that brought about a rich lifetime of accomplishments. Whether it was the Boy Scouts, Ministerial Alliance, Chamber of Commerce, Historical Society, or one of his many other activities, Reverend Keisker was totally dedicated, an enduring example of service, integrity, faithfulness, and love in the best spirit of American citizenship. 
On November 12, 1997, the Lutheran Family and Children Services [LFCS] of southeast Missouri will host the Second Annual Walter J. Keisker dinner. I commend LFCS for the foresightedness in choosing Reverend Keisker to lead the LFCS mission. I can think of no better example to inspire others to assist in building family life.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay tribute to a truly outstanding university in my home State of Missouri, Southwest Missouri State University [SMSU]. SMSU was one of 135 schools in 42 States selected to the John Templeton Foundation Honor Roll, a designation recognizing colleges and universities that emphasize character building as an integral part of the college experience. 
Being the only public institution in Missouri to earn the 1997-98 honor roll distinction, SMSU is also one of the eight State-funded schools to receive the award nationwide. Schools competing for the honor roll were judged on 5 criteria and out of 2,208 4-year accredited undergraduate institutions only the top few were chosen. One of the categories where SMSU stood out was in community service. During the 1996-97 school year the SMSU campus, including the faculty and students, volunteered more than 69,500 hours. 
It is an honor for the entire State of Missouri to have a university like SMSU, whose service and character-building programs have earned it this distinguished award. I commend SMSU's President, Dr. John Keiser, for his commitment to excellence and hope for continued success in the future.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the members of Missouri Task Force One, which this year achieved Federal designation as an FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Force, and in October received the Memorandum of Understanding that places them in deployable status. 
What a great team. They don't call Missouri the `Show Me' State for nothing. Missouri Task Force One began as 1 of more than 150 applicants. They coordinated, cajoled, planned, `recruited'--a euphemism for the arm-twisting for which they've become famous--begged, borrowed, purchased, trained, and triumphed. What was only a dream 5 years ago became a reality this year. 
This team, its members and equipment underwent a rigorous evaluation including a full-blown, onsite inspection from technical experts in search and rescue. They scored the highest in the Nation, and clobbered the competition. I know this may be a sore subject with some of my colleagues in the Senate, but the numbers do not lie. 
Missouri Task Force One was head and shoulders above the next-highest applicant for new teams and scored ahead of already-designated teams as well. This is one of the most exciting, dedicated groups of volunteers I have ever seen. They earned this designation in every category evaluated, from the quality of the team members to their excellent equipment. 
The country won when Missouri Task Force One achieved their designation. Some of us have learned the very hard way that disasters can happen any time, anywhere. I rest easier knowing that the Midwest now has access to the Federal search and rescue teams once concentrated on the east and west coasts. I am honored to have the privilege of getting to know some of the members of Missouri Task Force One, who take the time from their `day jobs' and their families to train, take risks, pack, unpack, and train some more; for a nightmare we all hope will never happen but for which we must be prepared.

Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator for raising this issue. It is the intent of the appropriations legislation to allow a second refinancing to save section 8 funds. I am hopeful that owners working in cooperation with the bond issuers will voluntarily refinance their FAF properties, where existing laws and bond documents permit. Owners and bond issuers will hopefully take advantage of the historically low interest rates and refinance their properties.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I express my sincere appreciation to Chairman Chafee, Chairman Warner, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus. 
When it became clear that we were not going to pass a 6-year reauthorization of the ISTEA, or Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, it was obvious to everybody that something had to be done to make sure that we didn't run out of safety programs; that we didn't shut the doors on the operations of the Department of Transportation; that we didn't leave the States without the authority to contract. 
Finally, when I suggested that we merely extend the obligations based on a half of last year's obligation authority up to 75 percent, it was designed, as Senator Baucus so ably said, to be totally formula neutral. We are not going to engage in a formula battle. We have some very strong differences of opinion over formulas, and over allocations among States. That will be played out at great length on this floor I hope very early in 1998. But I have never seen anything unify this body more than the agreement by all of the Senators with whom I have spoken--and I have spoken to almost all of them--that we must do something to keep the doors open; to keep construction going; to keep safety and to keep transit programs. And the only way we can do it is to do something that is formula neutral. 
This merely extends the obligational authority, and it has overwhelming support. We hope it will have support in the House so that we can send it to the President and make sure that we don't shut down operations in the very near future. 
I wish to expressly thank staff which has worked night and day--some with almost no sleep: Dan Corbett, Jimmie Powell, Ann Loomis, Kathy Ruffalo, Tom Sliter, and the staff of the Banking Committee, Commerce Committee, and the Environment and Public Works Committee; and on my own personal staff, Tracy Henke who did the initial work of putting this all together. 
I hope they can all get some sleep and some rest, and that we can put this measure to bed. 
Mr. President, this does not open up any fights. It merely leaves in place vitally needed safety transit, Department of Transportation operations, and the ability to contract while we revisit in early 1998 the very important and very controversial formulas for allocating highway money. 
I thank all Senators whose cooperation was necessary for us to bring the measure to the floor, and pass it this evening. But the agreement of all Senators shows what a high priority and what a tremendous importance we place on assuring that our citizens have adequate transit, that we have the highways, the bridges, and the roads that we need for convenience, for our economy, and, most of all, for the safety of our traveling public. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to enhance, preserve and protect habitat for fish and wildlife on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. This new 5-year $50 million authorization is a win-win approach that will implement and expand the use of new and innovative measures developed by the Corps of Engineers to improve habitat conservation without impacting adversely private property and other water-related needs of the rivers including navigation, flood control and water supply. 
As I have always maintained, fish and wildlife conservation and commercial activity are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, we cannot afford to abandon either river commerce or the species that live in and on the river. This new approach is a win for man, for nature and for the river. 
This legislation is supported by Missouri Farm Bureau, MARC2000, American Rivers, the Missouri Soybean Association, the Missouri Corngrowers Association, and Farmland Industries. While these groups have not always agreed on river policy, that should not preclude us from seeking common ground and working together to address the questions of resource management and I am delighted that we can all come together in support of this commonsense approach. 
Without specific authorization and only scarce dollars, the St. Louis Corps of Engineers has been developing and testing ways in which navigation structures used to guide the river and maintain the channel may be modified to meet environmental as well as navigation goals. These innovations have proven successful earning wide acclaim including a Presidential Design Award and Federal Design Achievement Award. 
This legislation seeks to put these successful innovations to work on the Missouri River and expand their use on the middle Mississippi by providing a specific authorization and a dedicated and substantial source of funds. In other words, we are giving the corps the tools they need to put their ideas to work to improve the rivers to benefit fish and wildlife. 
The legislation authorizes $10 million per year to protect, create and enhance side channels, island habitat, sand bars, and other riverine habitat. For example, by notching rock dikes that run perpendicular to the shoreline, sandbars develop between the dikes which has been provided nesting habitat for the endangered least tern and valuable spawning ground for the endangered pallid sturgeon. The Missouri Department of Conservation has run tests validating an increase in diversity and numbers of microinvertebrates surrounding the notched dikes. 
Chevron dikes have been developed to improve river habitat and to create beneficial uses of dredge material. These structures are placed in the shallow side of the river channel pointing upstream which improves the river channel while serving as small islands. These islands encourage the development of all four primary river ecosystem habitats and additionally, various micro-organisms cling to the underwater rock structures, providing a food source for fish. 
Changing the gradation of rock revetments, used to stabilize eroding riverbanks, has proved to provide greater bank stability and precluded the need to remove bank vegetation so that, for the first time, trees and rock revetment could coexist providing greater habitat diversity. 
The draft legislation authorizes $10 million per year over 5 years to develop and implement a plan including the following activities: Modification and improvement of navigation training structures to protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat; creation of side channels to protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat; restoration and creation of island fish and wildlife habitat; creation of riverine fish and wildlife habitat; establishment of criteria to prioritize based on cost-effectiveness and likelihood of success; and physical and biological monitoring for evaluating the success of the project. 
The draft provides that the project be coordinated with other related Federal and State activities and that there be public participation in the development and implementation of the project. It requires a 25-percent non-Federal cost share and limits the Federal cost of any single project to $5 million. Finally, the draft legislation confers no new regulatory authority and requires compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act. 
The legislation is designed to work between the banks of the river and forbids expressly any adverse impacts on private lands and water-related activities including flood control, navigation, and water supply. Additionally, it is designed to compliment other existing programs such as the Missouri River Mitigation project and the Environmental Management Program on the Mississippi River. 
I intend to work with the administration and with other Senators and interested groups to build the broad support necessary to enact this legislation in an omnibus Water Resources Development Act the Senate is expected to consider in 1998. 
Mr. President, the problems experienced in the Midwest and elsewhere with railroad bottlenecks highlight the need for diverse transportation options. As the fall harvest proceeds, there are reports of grain being piled on the ground in neighboring Kansas and Nebraska. Notwithstanding that I must continue working on behalf of Missouri to preserve river navigation as a transportation option, our joint efforts to pursue this new legislation is a strong indicator that we may be experiencing an episode of domestic detente on river policy between groups that have pursued differing approaches in the past. This legislation offers a significant boost for our need to make the various river uses compatible and an important step toward unifying the river's stakeholders behind a realistic approach for the future. 
I thank and congratulate the various groups who have come together behind this legislation and look forward to enacting this consensus legislation.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Members on the other side. We all know that, because of matters which we won't continue to debate here, our ISTEA or highway reauthorization measure has not gone forward. We will not be able to resolve the many difficult questions over funding allocations and funding formulas this year. 
Several days ago, I said that I was working with the EPW, the chairman, Chairman Chafee, Chairman Warner, Ranking Member Baucus, and the members of the committee to permit our highway departments in our States to continue obligating funds, continue transit and safety operations and DOT operations for the next 6 months. 
Mr. President, just a brief report. We are now working on a formula which would say to each State that, for the next 6 months, you may obligate up to half of what you had in the past fiscal year for contracts for the coming summer construction season. There will be no changes and no impact on the formula, but there will be complete flexibility. So if you have unpaid, unspent obligations in one category, you can spend them wherever you need to. We are working with the House. I appreciate the cooperation of all Members, because I believe we all understand that we cannot leave highways and transportation without the ability to go forward in the summer construction season. 
I thank the leadership of the Senate. We are working with the House to have a proposal that I believe should be acceptable. It does not involve any funding allocation changes or reestablish any formulas, but it does permit the work to go forward. It is vitally important. I appreciate the time of this body. I invite any comments personally that Senators may have about this vitally important measure.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I commend the chairman on his herculean effort to address the myriad of policy issues he has faced this year, but I am wary about the fast track we seem to be on to decrease our defense resourcing while simultaneously increasing our operational tempo. I am concerned that because of the dramatic cuts our total force has taken in the past few years, that we are hollowing our force. I am concerned that in spite of our downsizing efforts we are spreading our forces out more than any other time in our history. 
Because of this fact, we must squeeze every ounce of bang for our bucks, and I believe that the Reserve components, the Guard in particular, does this very well. Guard units are posted all around the world in addition to performing their duties in their home states. Guard members come from all parts of the population, including former active duty members of the active force. They bring with them, a wealth of experience and training. They are also inextricably woven into the fabric of their local communities, a point which we have come to realize is all important, that our military be connected to our citizenry. Our Army, our military, is the finest in the world, bar none. It is composed of the finest young men and women, provided the finest training and the most well resourced in the world. Our history, our legacy demands the support of our citizens for the institution, and the Guard provides a critical link between our civilian community and the military which protects them. Don't eviscerate the Guard and sever that link. This bill makes a cut of 5,000 Guardsmen and women, troops who we have already voted to fund in the appropriations bill. These troops funding remained within the budget constraints and were apparently desired by the Pentagon and the President as he approved the appropriations bill. I believe that this is an ill-advised reduction in force. 
Mr. President, I make the following points to explain my objections to the National Guard policy decisions reflected in this bill. 
The Guard is unique of all the Reserve components; having both Army and Air Force components under a unified command, and the Guard performs State oriented missions under title 32 and Federal missions under title 10. The Guard has been the neglected step-child of the National Command Authority for as many and more years than I have been in the Senate. No one can say that the Guard has received a fair share of the budget pie without direct input from the Congress. Each year we are required to inject hundreds of millions of dollars to keep the equipment accounts adequately funded as well as the training and operations funding accounts. I believe that a four-star position along with the elevation of the directors of the Army Guard and Air Guard would provide the Guard Bureau with much needed and appropriate upper echelon infrastructure and departmental and congressional vetting. I believe the Department of Defense has been disingenuous in its characterization of the National Guard's participation during the Quadrennial Defense Review. I believe that the current command structure of placing the Air Guard under authority of the Army is convoluted to say the least. 
Mr. President, as a four-star, the chief of the Guard bureau will have the rank required and the subsequent authority to actually have a place at the table. Now the Guard Caucus would like to see that table be at the JCS level, because that is from where our uniformed personnel delivers recommendations to the National Command Authority. However, it is our main concern that the operational and force employment decisions have a Guard input. So, we are open to constructive and statutory alternatives. But whatever the result, the status quo is unacceptable. The provisions in this bill do nothing to alter seriously, the status quo. I predict that next year, in spite of this well intentioned but wholly inadequate compromise with rogue and obstinate members of the House, we will once again see resourcing problems in the Guard and Reserve accounts. We will continue to see them until we, here in the Congress, do something to recognize and reflect our increased reliance on our reserve components because of the force structure changes we are forcing our military to make. 
I disagree strongly with the measures in this bill dealing with National Guard policies but I will grudgingly accept them for I do believe that we do need an authorization bill and these are issues which may be addressed at a later date. And I guarantee you, that come next year, I will be here again arguing for policies which will recognize the relevancy of the Guard and which will position it appropriately within the Department of Defense hierarchy.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to present to my colleagues what I think is a compromise that will help us get over a very difficult situation. I am very proud to be a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and to have joined with the leadership of that committee--Chairman Chafee, Senator Warner, Ranking Member Baucus, and the other members of the committee, in reporting out what I believe is an excellent transportation reauthorization bill. 
I think this is a bill that we need for the next 6 years. We need it for transportation, for safety, for economic development. The simple fact of the matter is, without discussing the whys, the `where we are' is we are not going to get that passed this year. There, in my view, is no way that we can get agreement, get it passed on the floor of the Senate, and agree with the House on a very different approach they are taking prior to the time we adjourn for the remainder of the year. 
If we don't--and we had a hearing today in Environment and Public Works--No. 1, the Department of Transportation operations cannot continue, vitally needed safety programs cannot continue, transit programs cannot continue, and many States will not be able to let the contracts they need for major construction projects in the coming months because they will not have the obligational authority. 
There is a lot of money in the States--over $9 billion--that is unobligated that has been authorized, but the problem is very often it is in the wrong category. The States have money, but it may be in CMAQ when they need it in STP or the various different programs. 
The question is, what are we going to do about it? Some in the House have presented a proposal that is sort of a 6-month extension. It keeps the old formula and tries to jam everything into 12 months. Frankly, that is very unfair to my State and quite a few other States that are known in this body as donor States. 
I can assure you that any time we try to do something in the highway and transportation area that gets us into a formula discussion, we are going to spend some time at it. I feel very strongly about the formulas, and I intend to express myself about them, as other Members should. 
What are we going to do about it? What are we going to do about the fact that safety and transit programs run out and many States will not be able to let contracts they need for major projects at the end of the winter when they have to get ready for the summer construction season? 
Today I presented to my colleagues in the Environment and Public Works Committee a compromise which I think enables us to continue these vitally important operations. Certainly highways and transportation are right at the top of the list of things that my constituents in Missouri want to see us do. It will enable us to come back after the first of the year, pass a 6-year reauthorization and do so without penalizing the States and the transit and the safety programs. 
What we would do under my bill is provide 6 months of funding for the safety programs, the Department of Transportation operations and transit. For the unobligated balances, we would give the States complete flexibility. If they want to put surface transportation money into construction mitigation, they could do so, and they would be able to continue their operations and issue contracts through March 31. 
Some States do not have enough unobligated balances to be able to continue their contracting authority through March 31 at the same rate they had done in this year or the previous year. So for those States, my measure would provide them an advance, an advance against what we are going to authorize in the bill that we must pass and that the President must sign so transportation can go forward in this country. 
For most States, it means a small amount, but we would advance fund that money without regard to the formula. Say, for example, you had $250 million in unobligated balances, but in the first 6 months in one of those years you obligated $290 million. We would have the Department of Transportation advance $40 million to that State so that between now and March 31, the State would be able to obligate $290 million for transportation purposes. 
Later on in the year, when that State's allocation is determined and, say, under the formula that State would get $500 million from probably, say, $800 million for the year, that $40 million would be deducted from the allocations under the new authorization, and they would get $760 million. 
What this does, Mr. President, is allow us to keep things operating, keep contracts being let, keep transit programs and safety programs operating without getting bogged down in the formula fight. 
As I said earlier, when I say `bogged down,' I look forward to the very active discussion of the funding formula. It is one of the most important things that we need to do around here in terms of economic development, transportation and safety. But it will take some time. I would envision that whenever the majority leader wants to schedule it, it would take at least a couple of weeks and maybe more. So while we are doing that, we should not cut off the transit, the safety, or the contracting obligation that the States would normally do. 
As I said, we presented this at the EPW hearing this morning. We had a very good discussion with representatives of the National Governors' Association and the Department of Transportation. 
Mr. President, the National Governors' Association has sent a letter signed by 39 Governors. Getting 39 Governors--having been one--I can tell you, to sign on a letter is not easy. But the Governors very simply said:  
. . .it is imperative for the Senate to consider and pass short-term legislation providing funding for highway, transit, and safety programs and to complete a conference on that legislation with the House of Representatives. Such legislation would minimize the interruption in funding to State and local governments. It would also avoid the disastrous effects that a several-month lapse in authorization would have on many States' transportation programs.

I hope this is something that we could agree on and move forward on quickly so that our States and the traveling public will not suffer while we go through the very important discussions on coming up with a new highway funding formula. 
I invite comments. I look forward to working with my colleagues. This one I hope we can do on a bipartisan basis without the regional differences that will inevitably arise when we begin discussion of the funding formula.

<TEXT>
Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I advise my colleagues that after long negotiations, I think we have reached an agreement on the measure to reauthorize the Small Business Administration for the next 3 fiscal years to continue vitally important programs and to add new programs which we think will be of significant benefit to our country. The measure before us now is similar to the bill we passed in early September, and it includes changes passed by the House of Representatives. 
The negotiations have been very detailed, and we think if we can get to passage of this measure on the House side prior to the adjournment for the remainder of the calendar year that our Nation's small businesses will be greatly aided by this bill. 
There are certain programs in the Small Business Administration that need to be reauthorized, and that cannot occur without this legislation. Some of the loan programs will continue even without the reauthorization, but the Small Business Technology Transfer Program, known as STTR, the Microloan Program, the 504 Loan Program, the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, and SBA's cosponsorship authority will expire if there is no reauthorization passed and signed by the President. 
In addition, the measure that we passed unanimously in early September includes provisions relating to the very important issue of bundling of large Federal contracts. The bill adds a new outreach program for disabled veterans. It also includes significant changes in the Microloan Program, which was a top priority of Senator Kerry and others. The bill contains my HUBZones Program which is designed to encourage small businesses to provide welfare-to-work opportunities in inner cities and in rural areas of high unemployment by providing small business contracts set-asides in HUBZones, which are historically underutilized business zones marked by high rates of poverty and high rates of unemployment. We believe the HUBZone Program can do a tremendous amount to assist us in the goal which I think is generally agreed upon around here, and that is to provide more opportunities for people who need want to move from welfare or dependency upon public assistance to gainful employment. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased that we can accomplish passage of this important legislation today. We hope that the House will move on it expeditiously next week so that we can get the measure to the President for his signature before we adjourn for the year.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure on behalf of myself, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Warner, Mr. Reid of Nevada, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Mack, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Leahy, Mrs. Collins, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Allard, Mr. Baucus, and Mrs. Feinstein. 
This vital, bipartisan legislation would establish a demonstration project to evaluate the feasibility of using the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program [FEHBP] to ensure the availability of adequate health care for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries under the military health care system. 
Current trends, such as base closures, the downsizing of military treatment facilities, and the introduction of TRICARE, have all hindered access to health care services for military retirees aged 65 and over. In theory, Medicare-eligible retirees can receive health care services at military treatment facilities on a space available basis; however, active duty and their dependents have priority. 
Therefore, in reality, space is rarely available--resulting in military retirees being locked out of the Department of Defense's [DOD] health care delivery system. And because of their considered secondary status, many retirees are forced to travel great distances to receive even the minimum of care. 
Further, when compared to what other Federal and private sector retirees receive in terms of health care options, it is easy to note that the current health care choices for military retirees are woefully inadequate and downright inexcusable. 
This measure will rectify the inequity of the current system and take the guesswork out of the financial viability of an FEHBP option for military retirees. 
Scheduled for no more than 3 years, the FEHBP pilot program would be tested at two different sites. One site will be within a military treatment facility catchment area and the other in a noncatchment area. Up to 50,000 Medicare-eligible military retirees will be able to participate in the demonstration, with each site capped at 25,000 retirees. 
Mr. President, this legislation represents an active step toward honoring our Nation's obligation to those military retirees who faithfully and selflessly served our country in times of war and in times of peace. Furthermore, this measure will provide retirees more dependable, consistent, and affordable care while simultaneously applying equitable standards of health care for all Federal retirees. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues on this bipartisan piece of legislation.

Mr. BOND. It is my understanding that some people have stated that this program will be administered in a manner similar to the national research initiative, the NRI. While the NRI plays a valuable role in the discovery of scientific information related to agriculture, it is not a directed, coordinated program. It is my understanding, however, that the plant genome initiative will be coordinated and focused on the most economically significant crops. Is that correct?

Mr. BOND. The report accompanying S. 1150 makes clear that the committee intends that the Secretary utilize funds from the initiative for future agriculture and food systems, established under title III of the bill, for the plant genome initiative and the animal genome initiative. Under the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems, there is no provision for coordinated, directed, and focused programs. Am I correct in assuming that while the funds for the food genome strategy may be derived from the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems, it is the intent of the managers that the food genome strategy would, in fact, be a coordinated, directed program?

Mr. BOND. In addition, under title III, the Secretary is required, in making individual grants, to give higher priority to a proposal that is multi-state, multi-institutional, or multidisciplinary. While the overall Food Genome Strategy will be multi-State, multi-institutional, and multidisciplinary, there will be many aspects of the program that will not facilitate multi-State, multi-institutional, and multidisciplinary grants, especially in the first couple of years. For example, the development of expressed sequence tags and high-resolution physical maps may, of necessity, be done by one entity. Expressed sequence tags and physical maps are the critical foundation of the food genome strategy. If the Secretary is required to give higher priority to multi-State, multi-institutional, and multidisciplinary proposals, this very basic information may not be developed. It is my understanding, however, that the managers do not intend for this to happen. Rather, since the entire Food Genome Strategy will be multi-State, multi-institutional, and multi-disciplinary, all aspects of this program could receive a higher priority.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have been waiting all week to talk about some very, very important things in the highway and transportation reauthorization bill, also known as ISTEA or NEXTEA. I am disappointed we have been unable to move to that bill because I think everyone here can agree we have journeyed far in the transportation area not only over the last 6 years under the just-expired ISTEA bill but over the last century. We are ready to embark upon the next leg of that journey. I am very distressed and saddened that our colleagues are not willing to move forward on it. 
I think everyone in this body and certainly most of our constituents around the country know the importance and the role that transportation plays in our everyday lives and especially in our economy. Our economic stability and progress is tied directly to transportation. 
In my opinion, what really worked, what really got us moving on transportation infrastructure in this Nation was President Dwight Eisenhower's vision of an interstate system. That succeeded in building the first network of modern high-speed roads linking our States with each other and with markets around the world. 
As my dear friend and colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, often says, this is one world market. Our country's transportation infrastructure makes it so. 
Mr. President, my home State of Missouri has always been a leader in the area of transportation. As one example, the first construction contract awarded under the interstate system was awarded for part of Interstate 70 near St. Charles, MO. In fact, the first three contracts awarded under this system were Missouri contracts. I think this demonstrates one more time Missouri's fundamental commitment to and belief in essential infrastructure. 
Even though my friend and colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, and I had some differences of opinion during the 1991 debate, I do agree with many of my colleagues when they give Senator Moynihan and the 1997 ISTEA bill credit for moving our transportation policy forward. The 1991 bill was landmark legislation that enabled us to craft a new generation of highway and transit programs. 
Now, let us all recognize that transportation in this country includes everything from transit systems, rail, waterways, air, pipelines, et cetera. However, as we move forward, we must build our new policy solidly on our commitment to the concrete and asphalt reality that roads and bridges are, and will continue to be the foundation of our transportation system. The new policy will be only as good as the foundation on which it is built. 
This country has an inadequate highway infrastructure that contributes to 114 deaths on our Nation's highways each day. This is the equivalent of a major airline disaster each and every day of the year. And, tragically, many of these fatalities are our Nation's children. As a matter of fact, motor vehicle accidents are the No. 1 cause of death of American children of all ages. That is truly a remarkable and distressing and tragic fact. 
I have to share with you, Mr. President, the fact that Missouri's highway fatality rate is above the national average. I was reminded of these highway tragedies just this past week during the Columbus Day work period in the State, as I have been on every opportunity I have had to travel around the State of Missouri. As I went back and forth across the State, I saw along the roads the little white crosses that had been marked for deaths of motorists and their passengers on Missouri's highways. Some of the highways have very, very frequent intervals of white crosses. And at every stop where I talked with people and listened to them talk about transportation, they told me of friends, neighbors, and loved ones who had been lost in highway accidents. Almost everyone of us in Missouri have experienced or know somebody who has experienced the loss of a loved one or a dear friend. Earlier this year, my good friend Gary Dickenson of Chillicothe, MO, was driving from Chillicothe toward Kansas City where he had business interests, where he traveled frequently on Highway 36, a highway that, because of the traffic, should have been a four-lane, divided highway. It was, in fact, a two-way, two-lane highway. He met a car driven by a stranger to that part of the road who had crossed over the center line and he was killed. 
We have had hearings in Missouri where families who have come to testify for the needs of highways have told us about the tragedy that their families have felt, like the Winkler family in Moberly, and many others, who lost a loved one because someone not familiar with that highway, not realizing that that heavily traveled road was a two-way road rather than a divided highway, crossed the center line and was in the wrong lane and crashed head-on into a fatal traffic accident. 
Now, some fatalities on our roads are as a result of drunken driving and improper child safety restraints. But it is clear to me that the major role in these fatalities is the unsafe condition and inadequate capacity of our highways, and we really can't allow this to continue. It is totally unacceptable and we have to do something about it. We must improve upon our existing infrastructure and we have to determine better ways to manage our transportation needs, not only to address the tremendous safety needs, but for our economic competitiveness. 
We must not forget that Americans depend upon our transportation infrastructure, mainly our roads and bridges, each day, to get to and from work, school, the shopping center, doctor appointments, ball games, to see friends, and to go to church. But we also know that those highways and byways, those roads and those bridges are vitally important to maintaining economic prosperity. They take workers to and from jobs, and bring goods and supplies into the workplace, and they bring the finished products out. And only if they do so in an efficient and effective manner can we make sure that our products are competitive against the products of other nations in the world. 
Well, the condition of our roads and bridges, once the envy of the world, should embarrass all of us. I have listened over the years, and just recently on the Senate floor, to my colleagues from Northeastern States talking about their transportation needs and how they think they are somehow more deserving of additional highway funds than are the Southern and Midwestern and the Western States. On this floor, before the Columbus Day State work period, a Senator from the Northeast alluded to that part of the country as `the crux of our economic mix.' 
Well, Mr. President, I have to disagree and, like my colleagues who make those statements, be a little parochial because I argue that the crux is the middle part of the country. It is Michigan, it is Missouri, it is Iowa, it is Arkansas, it is Illinois, it is Kansas, it is Oklahoma, it is Louisiana, it is Minnesota, it is Wisconsin, it is Louisiana, it is Mississippi, and Texas. Why, Mr. President? Because not only is this the heartland of the country, but in my opinion this is where the country's current and future growth will be. 
Now, my State of Missouri is `geographically privileged' to be located not only near the geographic center of the United States, and it not only has the demographic or population center of the United States, but it is at the center or at the confluence of our Nation's two greatest waterways, the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. Not only has Missouri proven itself to be the gateway to the West, but today it is the gateway to the North, South, East and West. Like spokes from a bicycle wheel, Missouri's roads and bridges are fast becoming the arteries that feed not only our country's heartland, but the whole of North America. 
Already, according to the Federal Highway Administration, Missouri has the country's sixth largest highway system. According to the Road Information Program, vehicle travel in Missouri grew by 51 percent between 1985 and 1995, compared to a national average of 37 percent. It is the home of the second and third largest rail hubs, the second fastest-growing airport in the world, and the second largest inland port in the United States. 
A further example of the dynamic growth in Missouri is Branson, MO, population 4,725. I hope my colleagues--and not just those of us who enjoy country music--know about Branson, because in 1996 alone, Branson was visited by 5.8 million guests. That requires a lot of transportation to bring that many people into a community of less than 5,000 residents. 
In addition, we look at our two largest trading partners, Canada and Mexico. One of the main north-south highway routes in this country is Interstate 35 from Loredo, TX, through Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, and Duluth, MN. 
Unfortunately, many coastal States forget about inland States when it comes to the global economy. But for our State of Missouri, and many other `inland' States, our highway infrastructure, coupled with rail, air and waterways, makes us strong players in `our one-world market.' 
Missouri alone serves over 100 different countries around the world with our exports. In 1995, our exports exceeded $5.5 billion. 
Not only does Missouri export electronics, machinery, and chemicals, but Missouri is one of the largest exporters in the country of agricultural products. In overall agricultural exports, Missouri is ranked 15th among all 50 States in the value of its agricultural exports. Missouri is the sixth largest soybean producer and eighth largest feed corn producer in the country. Missouri ranks 6th in rice production and 13th in wheat production. 
If we in Missouri are going to continue to compete globally for foreign trade opportunities of the next century, not only do Missourians need `fair' trade to compete, but we need a `fair' return of our transportation dollars so Missourians have `fair' access to global markets which coastal States now dominate because they already enjoy such access. 
A fair return to Missouri is imperative because Missouri's highways and bridges are in tremendous need of more dollars--more of our dollars that we have been sending to Washington, more of our dollars that we have shared in large measure with other States. It used to be, prior to the 1991 act, that we were getting about 75 cents back on every dollar we sent to Washington. We got it up to 80 cents after 1991. And we are hoping--hoping against hope--that maybe we can pass a measure which will get us up to 92 cents, still sharing 8 cents of every dollar that we send to Washington with other States for their transportation needs. 
Permit me to quote from testimony provided by Tom Boland, a good friend and chair of the Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission, at a field hearing we held in which the chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, and the Senator from Virginia, Senator Warner, were kind enough to participate. Mr. Boland said:  
In Missouri, we can demonstrate the need for increased Federal funding to improve the safety of our highways and bridges all too well. Let me take you on a short tour down the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. The Missouri River enters the State at our far northwest corner, flows southward to Kansas City, then crosses the entire State and joins the Mississippi River at St. Louis. The Mississippi River forms the entire eastern boundary of Missouri. 
More than 40 bridges on the State and Federal highway system cross these two rivers in Missouri. More than half of these bridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete when evaluated by Federal criteria. They are too narrow or have severe weight restrictions, or both, that prevent commercial vehicle use and obstruct the economic vitality of many of our communities. 
Using the Federal Highway Administration rating system, Missouri has approximately 11,000 centerline miles of highways rating fair or worse, or a lower rate. This is nearly one-third of the total State highway system. According to the Surface Transportation Policy Project Report, 81 percent of Missouri's urban highways alone are not in good condition. Over 42 percent of Missouri's 23,000 bridges are substandard. 
Missouri has transportation needs that need to be met. 
Ever since my arrival in the U.S. Senate, I have worked on transportation issues, mainly on getting my State of Missouri a fair return on its highway dollars. I will be honest; it has been an uphill battle. Even under the bill as reported from the Environment and Public Works Committee, Missouri, and several others, are still donor States. As a member of the committee, I worked with my colleagues, Senators Chafee, Warner, and Baucus, to come up with a formula that was fair. Again, let me be honest; it is not everything I would like. If I got what I wanted, Missouri would be getting a return of $1.72 or $2.15 on every dollar they sent in. That is the return that some of the Northeastern States are receiving. But Missouri is not receiving that much. 
Yet, I am the sponsor of this bill because it has moved the formula by leaps and bounds in the right direction, and I believe it is a reasonable compromise. It is a compromise that recognizes both the political realities of this place and, I think, the legitimate concerns of all the States involved. 
The bill which I am proud to have sponsored with a number of my colleagues addresses three of the top priorities I have. 
The bill, No. 1, increases the overall amount of transportation dollars that we invest in our infrastructure. 
Two, it gives a fairer return of transportation dollars to the State of Missouri. 
And, three, it provides additional flexibility to State and local planners, decisionmakers, and officials to address their specific transportation needs. 
I hope that we can move forward on this vitally important legislation so we can address the numerous issues pending, such as transit, safety, and the Finance Committee title, which includes another critically important issue to Missouri and the rest of the country--that is ethanol. 
The Finance Committee amendment includes an extension to 2007 of ethanol's tax incentives. This exemption promotes energy security by lowering our dependence on foreign oil. It is cleaner burning. It is a cleaner burning fuel, so it is good for the environment. And it is a renewable resource that really benefits our rural economy. The Senate voted overwhelmingly this summer to support this extension in the Taxpayers' Relief Act, and we defeated those who attempted to end the exemption in 1998. Senator Grassley and others have done an outstanding job of leading our bipartisan coalition. I am proud to be part of that coalition, and I expect us to prevail if and when we are challenged again on this issue. 
Another amendment that is important will reauthorize the act providing assistance to States for fish restoration, wetlands restoration and boat safety, commonly known as `Wallop-Breaux.' I am particularly interested in a new provision to authorize a new `National Outreach and Communications Program' designed to introduce additional segments of the public--especially America's youth--to the healthy fun of fishing and boating, to increase awareness of boating and fishing opportunities, and to promote safe and environmentally sound boating and fishing practices. Fishing is very important, in my State, to the recreational industry, and it is a favorite pastime of thousands and thousands of enthusiasts. I was out there, I confess. Most people with good judgment wouldn't be out on a wind-blown lake in 35 degree temperature getting their feet wet, getting cold to the bone but going after the mighty sport fish, a tremendously important part of our heritage, and I am going to keep doing it until one of these days I quit being outsmarted by the fish. 
Mr. President, moving our transportation policy into the 2lst century will be a challenge. There is no denying that. I hope we can move forward and move forward soon on this vitally important legislation so that these amendments that I have mentioned and other important amendments can be debated and voted on. 
It is important to realize that maintaining our Nation's roads and bridges is not a glamorous undertaking, but as with the debate raging in education circles about improving our Nation's crumbling schools, so goes the equally important debate about improving public infrastructure. 
Mr. President, as we prepare and plan our transportation policy for the 21st century, I hope all of us remember four basic principles that our new policy must ensure. First and foremost is safety, but also fairness, efficiency, and economic competitiveness. 
Mr. President, when we do move to the consideration of this bill--as I said, I hope that will be soon--I intend to offer 
an amendment with Senator Breaux, an amendment that has been cleared on both sides of the aisle, because it makes good sense. This is an amendment that affects both the EPA and the Corps of Engineers. They reviewed the amendment. They have no objection to it. It is consistent with administration policy and its Federal guidance issued November 1995. It is supported by the Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. And, beyond that, it is good for wetlands protection. It promotes private-sector efforts to protect wetlands. And it saves money that can be used on highways or other authorized uses under this act. Truly a win-win-win amendment. 
Now that I have your rapt attention, let me tell you what this amendment would do. 
This amendment provides that when highway projects result in impacts to wetlands that require compensation mitigation under current law, preference should be given, to the extent practicable, to private-sector mitigation banks. The amendment mandates that the banks be approved in accordance with the administration's Federal guidance on mitigation banking issued in 1995, and it requires that the bank be within the service area of the impacted wetlands. 
The administration's definition of mitigation banking is 
. . . the restoration, creation, enhancement and, in exceptional circumstances, preservation of wetlands and/or aquatic resources expressly for the purpose of providing compensatory mitigation in advance of authorized impacts to similar resources. 
Mitigation is usually accomplished by restoring or creating other wetlands. Isolated, on-site mitigation projects, however, are expensive and costly to maintain. Wetlands mitigation banks are typically large tracts of land that have been restored as wetlands.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President. I rise today, along with my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Senator John Kerry, to introduce the Early Childhood Development Act of 1997. Let me thank all who have worked so hard to develop this legislation. 
The most important thing we can do to address the many social problems we face, is to recognize that the family is the centerpiece of our society and take steps to strengthen families and mobilize communities to support young children and their families. 
This legislation follows up on recent scientific research showing that infant brain development occurs much more rapidly than previously thought, and that early, positive interaction with parents plays the critical role in brain development. 
Not surprisingly parents have known instinctively for generations what science is just now figuring out: that reading to a baby, caressing and cuddling him, and helping him to have a wide range of good experiences will enhance his development. When children fail to receive love and nurturing at home when they do not receive quality child care, whether it is provided by centers, family child care homes, or relatives, they are far more likely to develop social and academic problems. 
Yet parents today face burdens that were unimaginable a generation ago. Half of all marriages now end in divorce, and 28 percent of all children under the age of 18 live in a single-parent family. One in four infants and toddlers under the age of 3--nearly 3 million children--live in families with incomes below the Federal poverty level. 
Many women, particularly in low- and moderate-income families, are essential in helping support their families financially and have entered the workforce in record numbers during the last generation. In many families, both parents work. Each day, an estimated 13 million children younger than 6--including 6 million babies and toddlers--spend some or all of their day being cared for by someone other than their parents. Children of working mothers are entering care as early as 6 weeks of age and spending 35 or more hours a week in some form of child care. Whether by choice or necessity, parents must try to find quality child care--which is not always available. 
We are seeking, through this legislation, to provide families with support through early childhood education and more child care options. Our bill will support families--not bureaucracy--by building on local initiatives that are already working for families with infants and toddlers. We will help communities improve their services and supports to families with young children by expanding the thousands of successful efforts for families with children from birth to 6, such as those sponsored by the United Way and Boys and Girls Clubs as well as State initiatives such as Success by Six in Massachusetts and Vermont, the Parents as Teachers programs in Missouri and 47 other States, and the Early Childhood Initiative in Pennsylvania. 
The Early Childhood Development Act will provide funds for early childhood education programs for all children that emphasize the primary role of parents and help give them the tools they need to be their children's best teachers. Parents are the key to a child's healthy development and as we all know, we will never solve our social problems unless we involve parents in the process and in their children's lives. 
In addition, the bill will expand quality child care programs for families, especially for infants. And we will begin the Head Start Program earlier--when its impact could be much greater--at birth. 
While Government cannot and should not become a replacement for parents and families, we can help families become stronger by providing support to help them give their children the encouragement, the love and the healthy environment they need to develop their social and intellectual capacities. 
Our legislation balances the desire to provide support with the need to do so responsibly. I am proud that we have come together on a bipartisan basis to invest in programs that encourage family responsibility and obligation while helping families in need to reach those goals. 
I am very optimistic that the spirit of bipartisanship will guide our consideration of this legislation and move it forward. Recent polls have shown that the overwhelming majority of Americans want early childhood development issues to be top priorities for our country. We must all work together to ensure that our most vulnerable citizens are given the care and protection they need and deserve.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today on a very, very important mission, and that is to highlight the important work of the March of Dimes and its over 3 million dedicated volunteers across America. I thank and congratulate them on the most worthwhile of endeavors. 
During the month of October, the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation is celebrating Campaign for Healthier Babies Month by stepping up its efforts to reach more women of childbearing age with valuable information which will give every baby a better chance of being born healthy. 
These efforts are critical to prevent birth defects, low birthweight and prematurity, which are the leading causes of infant death and morbidity and also a tremendous cause of heartbreak and tragedy for so many families in the United States today. 
As all of us know, the March of Dimes is a national voluntary health agency whose mission is to improve the health of babies by preventing birth defects and infant mortality. Through its campaign for healthier babies, the March of Dimes funds programs of research, community services, education and advocacy. To enhance these efforts, the foundation has started the March of Dimes Resource Center. 
The resource center provides accurate up-to-date information and referral services to the public. It consistently offers high-quality, reliable, and prompt responses. It is staffed by highly trained professionals. The March of Dimes helps people one on one to address personal and complex problems relating to maternal and child health. The center provides information on numerous topics in which the March of Dimes has been in the forefront, such as the dangers of drug and alcohol use and other hazards during pregnancy. And most important, it is promoting the use of folic acid by women of childbearing age. 
We know now that 400 micrograms of vitamin B folic acid taken regularly by women of childbearing age before they become pregnant can reduce by one-half, or even 70 percent, the incidence of neural tube defects in babies born in America today. I don't know how many of my colleagues know of a family that has been afflicted with the loss of a child who was born with a severe and fatal neural tube defect. Many of us know good friends who were born with spina bifida and other problems which could be substantially reduced if women of childbearing age regularly take 400 micrograms of vitamin B folic acid every day. 
The March of Dimes professionals and the resource center answer questions from parents, health providers, students, librarians, Government agencies, health departments, social workers--people from all walks of life. The good people at the March of Dimes estimate that through the resource center, they will provide information to almost half a million individuals in the first year alone. 
The center is a state-of-the-art facility which can be contacted by people around the world through both a toll free number and e-mail. March of Dimes is shortened to MODIMES, M-O-D-I-M-E-S. MODIMES. The toll free number is 1-888-MODIMES, or by e-mail, the Web site is www.modimes.org. I urge people to take advantage of the toll free number or the Web site. 
I congratulate the March of Dimes on the success of the resource center, and I thank them for the years of dedicated work to prevent birth defects and to reduce infant mortality. 
Mr. President, we rank far too high in infant mortality in this country. Many, many countries do better than we do because we don't provide the care and the attention that expectant mothers need. 
Many of my colleagues in this body know that I have been a long-time supporter of a particular priority, the March of Dimes and the Birth Defects Prevention Act I first introduced in 1992. It has been passed time and time again by the Senate. In June of this year, this vital piece of legislation passed the Senate by a unanimous vote. A House companion bill currently has over 130 cosponsors. Both bills have strong bipartisan support in our body, the majority leader and the minority leader both, along with most of the people on all the relevant committees. The groups endorsing this include the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the American Hospital Association, the National Easter Seals Society, the Spina Bifida Association of America, and numerous others. 
I urge all of my colleagues and people who may be listening around the country to urge the House to take up this important legislation and pass it this year. As we get to the end of a particular year's session, there are always so many things, so many other bills that people think are priorities. Let me ask anybody to name me a priority that would be higher than helping the families of America of each of our States avoid the tragedy of the loss of an infant through birth defects or the permanent disability of a child born with birth defects. 
America's families and all of us have waited too long for this measure because it can go a long way in preventing birth defects, which is the leading cause of infant death. Quite simply, a little prevention goes a long way in avoiding family pain and heartache. It is up to Congress, it is up to us to seize this excellent opportunity to protect our most valuable resources--our children. I urge all of my colleagues to pay attention and to take an interest in this vital matter. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the Senate with the conference report accompanying H.R. 2158. The bill provides a total of $90.7 billion in new budget authority, including $21.5 billion in mandatory spending, which is $855 million less than the President's request. 
As with most legislative activity in this body, the bill is not perfect, but I do think it reflects a very balanced approach to a number of particularly difficult funding and policy decisions. In achieving that balance, I owe a special debt of gratitude and express my sincerest thanks to my hard-working ranking member, Senator Mikulski, whose cooperation, guidance, and wise counsel has helped to craft a consensus in reaching many of these difficult decisions. 
We have done our best to ensure that both the spirit of the budget agreement and the highest priorities of the President have been met without jeopardizing key programs, such as veterans' medical care and the space program which were not protected in the budget agreement. 
For the VA, the highest priority in the VA-HUD conference report is afforded to veterans' programs which total $40.45 billion and veterans' medical care in particular. The conference report provides $17,060,000,000 for VA medical care, which is $100 million more than the President's request and more than $300 million above the amount assumed for veterans' medical spending in the budget agreement. This level should ensure continued care to all eligible veterans and continued improvements to the VA medical system. Increases also are provided for the State Nursing Home Program construction and research. 
For the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the conference report provides close to $25 billion for fiscal year 1998, including full funding of $8.2 million for section 8 contract renewals as provided through the budget resolution. 
Other key programs include $310 million for drug elimination grants; $1.5 million for HOME; $4.7 billion for community development block grants; $600 million for the Native American Block Grant Program; $823 million for homeless assistance programs; $35 million for Youth Build; $25 million for Brownfields; and $138 million for the economic development initiative. 
Unfortunately, we were unable to fund the preservation program due to the high cost of the program, reported fraud and abuse, and HUD's lack of capacity to administer the program. To continue the program would cost some $2 billion over the next several years. Therefore, we have included instead $10 million to reimburse costs expended by project owners and nonprofit and tenant purchasers under the program. 
This bill also authorized enhanced--or `sticky'--vouchers which will protect tenants from being forced to move if an owner chooses to prepay a mortgage and higher rents are charged. 
Mr. President, I also point out that we have worked with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and colleagues in the authorizing committee to craft an ongoing solution to the high-cost rental program under multifamily projects in a program known as mark-to-market. 
We believe that the Senate's position, which finally has been accepted by the House, to deal with these programs to provide a continuation of housing services to those residents in particularly elderly and other projects funded under a multifamily basis, is the best approach to dealing with what otherwise would be a budgetary nightmare and potentially totally disruptive to the residents. 
For EPA, the conference report provides $7.4 billion for fiscal year 1998, an increase of over $400 million over fiscal year 1997; and an additional $650 million for fiscal year 1999 for the Superfund program. The appropriation includes $3.3 billion for the operating programs, an increase of $200 million or 6 percent over fiscal year 1997. 
State revolving funds would receive a total of $2.075 billion, including $1.35 billion for clean water and $725 million for drinking water. The President's proposed reduction of $275 million from the clean water State revolving fund was fully restored. 
For Superfund, the conference report includes $2.1 billion, an increase of $750 million over the current level. This funding includes an advance appropriation of $650 million to be made available on October 1, 1998, so long as a Superfund reform bill is enacted by May 15, 1998. This reflects the budget agreement which assumed this additional funding only upon a comprehensive reform of the Superfund program. 
In addition, given the priority the administration places on funding for Boston Harbor, the conference report provides $50 million, which is $27 million more than proposed by the House. 
For NASA, the conference agreement recommends $13.6 billion, the same amount as proposed by the House and an increase of $148 million over the Senate level and the administration's budget request. This amount will help NASA deal with the recent problems with the space station program without jeopardizing critical programs, such as space science, earth science, and aeronautics. 
For the National Science Foundation, appropriations would total almost $3.5 billion, a $60 million increase above the budget request. This funding includes an additional $40 million for plant genome research. Mr. President, this new comprehensive initiative is critical to the future of U.S. crop production, the ability of our strong agriculture sector to provide the food and fiber needed in this country and the world. 
For the Federal Emergency Management Agency, this agreement recommends $830 million, including $320 million for disaster relief and $30 million for a new predisaster mitigation grant program intended to improve the Nation's ability to reduce the costs and impacts of natural disasters, particularly in communities with significant disaster risks. 
For the National and Community Service Program, funding is $425.5 million, an increase of $25 million over the current year. Despite continued concerns many of us have with this program, we have acknowledged the priority the President has placed on the program. And, in addition, the $25 million is targeted directly to the critical issue of child literacy. 
Community development financial institutions are provided $80 million. While this funding is $45 million less than the 
President's request of $125 million, the conference report funding represents a compromise which reflects significant concerns raised in the last several months over the lack of administrative capacity and accountability at CDFI, including concerns relating to the contracting of services. We expect that the Treasury Department will continue to put in systems, procedures and policies that will ensure that the CDFI program will be administered appropriately in the future. 
As I said before, on the section 8 mark-to-market reforms, title V of the bill provides, beginning in fiscal year 1999, a comprehensive reform program that provides a mortgage and rent restructuring program to reduce the costs of oversubsidized section 8 multifamily housing properties insured under the FHA. Under this mark-to-market program, FHA-insured properties with above-market rents are eligible for debt restructuring to reduce the rent levels to market-rate rents or the project base rents needed to support operations and maintenance. 
In response to concerns about HUD's capacity, the legislation shifts the management, administration, and restructuring of the portfolio to capable local entities with a public purpose. In most cases, State and local housing finance agencies will be responsible for the restructuring of projects and consultation with project owners, the tenants and the affected community. 
In addition, the legislation requires the continuation of project-based assistance for projects that serve elderly and disabled families, thus ensuring the availability and affordability of low-income housing for the elderly and disabled. 
I note that a number of provisions, some of which I do not support, were added in conference to ensure the passage of the bill in both the House and the Senate and to promote signing by the President. 
In addition, we reached a number of accommodations with the White House with the cooperation and assistance of Senator Mikulski, Congressman Stokes, Congressman Obey, and other members of the conference. We are grateful for their assistance. 
I yield to Senator Mikulski for her opening statement.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, to respond to my good friend, I first commend him for calling attention to some of the abuses that occurred. When we accepted on the floor his proposal, it was in light of the abuses and the problems that were uncovered. As I have advised my colleague from Washington, the House had grave concerns about the breadth of this issue, fearing that it might bar not only people actively engaged in fraud but people with other problems in their background or in other time periods or in other areas. I cannot do a good job of explaining their objection because it was not my objection. We were unable to include it because we did not have adequate support from our side to overcome the resistance of their side. 
I point out to my colleague from Washington that HUD currently has authority under this program to address fraud and abuse in this program and they have assured us that they will. 
Having said that, Mr. President, I assure my friend from Washington, I am from Missouri, and assurances--frothy substances do not satisfy me; I am from Missouri, and you must show me. 
I expect that the new Native American Housing Block Grant Program which is under consideration in the Banking Committee will include program administrative and oversight requirements. At this point we must defer to the Banking Committee which is currently looking at native American housing block grant reforms as part of a HUD extender bill which would extend the authorization of a number of the programs such as FAA and multifamily risk programs. We expect this bill will be considered by the House and the Senate before the end of the session. 
I hope there would be an opportunity once again, for the Senator from Washington to address the very real concerns he noted.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my friend Senator D'Amato, the chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, is entirely correct. His statements are consistent with the intent of the conferees to devolve decisionmaking responsibility to the State and local level. Clearly, the conferees recognize that participating administrative entities in some jurisdictions may find it necessary to take into account rents on units which are subject to local rent stabilization regulations in order to determine comparable market rent levels. 
The conferees are mindful of the unique circumstances of New York rental markets. For that reason, the legislation was crafted to allow the consideration of rent stabilized apartments within the definition of comparable properties for the purposes of determining market rent levels.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the statements of the chairman of the Committee of Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs are indeed consistent with the intent of the conferees. Indeed, devolving responsibility and decisionmaking to the State and local level is one of the primary goals of this mark to market legislation. Not surprisingly, that is also the reason for the priority in selecting State and local housing finance agencies to be PAE's. 
The decisions made by these entities will have long-term consequences. The PAE's therefore should be granted great deference in assessing the impact of these decisions on local housing markets. Also, I would reiterate the Senator's statement on the importance of resident and owner involvement in the decisionmaking process. We believe the local PAE's will be in a better position to make these determinations than Federal officials at HUD or the Office of Management and Budget.

Mr. BOND. In addressing the Senators' concerns, it is my expectation that the Secretary of HUD will use the same procedures outlined in the mark-to-market legislation for those properties affected by the nonrenewal policy. The Secretary should not only explore the use sales or transfers to nonprofit organizations, but also allow these properties to retain project-based assistance if the ownership or physical condition problems are adequately addressed. I agree with Senator Mack that under no circumstances should we continue to subsidize bad landlords or bad properties, but that we need to be careful about how we handle these situations.

Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. To handle the workload and complexity of transactions under mark-to-market, a significant amount of flexibility is provided to the PAE's. However, it is expected that the Secretary establish strict and coherent guidelines to ensure that PAE's do not go beyond their restructuring duties as intended under the bill. To further prevent any abuses, the bill forbids private entities that act as PAE's to share, participate in, or benefit from any equity in the restructuring program. Last, it is expected that those most affected by restructuring, namely residents, communities, and owners, are involved in the process to protect the public interests. 
SECTION 8 RENEWAL POLICY 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-bond-mo-10-19971009</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. The bill provides renewal policies for projects which undergo restructuring under the mark-to-market program and those which do not. 
Briefly, for fiscal year 1998, the conferees have approved a 1-year extension of the basic rent renewal policies in section 211(b) of the fiscal year 1997 VA-HUD Appropriations Act and the mark-to-market demonstration program to cover contracts expiring in fiscal year 1998. 
This means that projects which undergo restructuring under the demonstration program--those with rents in excess of 120 percent of the fair market rent [FMR]--will receive rents determined under the restructuring plan. For projects that do not enter the demonstration program, contracts will be renewed at rents in effect upon expiration, but not to exceed 120 percent of FMR. The 120 percent of FMR limit, however, does not apply to rents for certain exception projects enumerated in the bill. These projects, which include section 202 elderly projects and publicly financed projects, for example, will be renewed at existing rent levels. 
The legislation also establishes permanent renewal policy for fiscal year 1999 and beyond when the permanent mark-to-market program is implemented. Projects which are subject to the program--those with rents in excess of comparable market rents--will receive rents in accordance with the restructuring plan. For projects that do not undergo restructuring, the Secretary may provide section 8 assistance for all units assisted by an expiring contract at rents up to comparable market rent. 
I also note to the Senator that to ensure consistency with the permanent mark-to-market program, we expect that the Secretary will use the definition of comparable market rents in section 514(g)(1) of title V of the bill when establishing guidelines for the permanent renewal policy. 
Under the permanent renewal authority, there again will be certain exceptions. Generally, these contracts would be renewed at the lower of existing rents--subject to an operating cost adjustment factor--or budget-based rents--subject to a budget-based rent adjustment. 
The approach agreed to by the conferees provides policy continuity for the expected 1 year period during which the new mark-to-market program is being developed, provides an incentive for projects to participate in the mark-to-market program, and makes clear a cost effective permanent renewal policy which will take effect in fiscal year 1999.

Mr. BOND. I agree with my colleagues. In accommodating HUD's desire to streamline the tenant participation process, the Congress in no way intends to minimize the importance of meaningful and effective participation of project residents and others with a stake in the restructuring process, including local governments. I agree with my colleagues that this must be done in a way that also ensures that the mark-to-market process is completed in the 3-year window created by this legislation.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the concerns and efforts of the Senator from Iowa in this area. I share his concern about preserving elderly rural housing and that any adverse effect on elderly residents be minimized. Clearly, we expect that there will be instances in which participating administrative entity may need to look at rents outside the jurisdiction to best determine comparable rents. This concept is borne out in the definition of `comparable properties' in section 512(1) where such properties are defined as meaning `properties in the same market areas, where practicable, that (A) are similar' in various indicated ways to the project at issue, including `type of location,' `unit amenities,' and `other relevant characteristics.' The addition of the words `type of' was added to meet the concerns you and others expressed that the lack of comparable housing for the elderly in relatively low population markets calls for appraisers to, within the normal practices, to use comparables in similar types of locations in other markets when there are not two comparable properties in the market. 
I presume in such a case where it has been determined appropriate to look at other market areas for comparable properties, that the use of the phrase `in the same market area' with respect to comparable properties in the definition of `eligible multifamily housing projects' in section 512(2)(A) would be guided by the same standards as apply in connection with determining comparable properties, i.e., the limitation to the same market area would be to the extent it was practicable and that as indicated in the statement of managers, the participating administrative entity may look at rents outside the project's jurisdiction. 
And, we expect that the Secretary will grant the waiver authorities allowed to him regarding the 20 percent limit on properties receiving an FMR of up to 120 percent and for granting appropriate properties FMR's in excess of 120 percent up to the limits allowed in the legislation. 
Again, I thank you for your efforts in this area.

The funding and direction provided in the bill will put into place a needed mechanism to establish a comprehensive, peer-reviewed research program which will benefit all parties involved with the decision-making activities regarding particulate matter in the years to come. The EPA was one of several organizations that worked with us to develop the research directives in this bill and I fully expect the EPA to follow the direction and spirit of the statement of managers.

The research program is intended to build on the research that is planned or underway at the EPA, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Academy of Sciences [NAS], Health Effects Institute and several other public and private entities. Within 30 days of the enactment of this legislation, the EPA is required to enter into a cooperative agreement with the National Academy of Sciences [NAS] to develop a comprehensive, prioritized, near- and long-term particulate matter research program, as well as a plan to monitor how this research program is being carried out by all participants. All parties, including Congress, will be apprised of the research plans and all subsequent steps throughout the process. The EPA is expected to implement NAS's plan, including appropriate peer reviews. NAS will monitor the implementation of the research plan and periodically report to Congress as to the progress of the research program. We believe the language included in this bill set forth a realistic and thoughtful plan to address the numerous scientific questions that need to be investigated prior to the next NAAQ's review for particulate matter.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senate committee report on the fiscal year 1997 VA/HUD appropriations bill regarding HUD's regulation of insurance stated that: 
The Committee intends that funds appropriated to the fair housing initiatives program for enforcement of title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended, which prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of housing and in the provision of housing and in the provision of brokerage services, be used only to address such forms of discrimination as they are explicitly identified and specifically described in title VIII. Recognizing that there are limited resources available for FHIP activities, the Committee believes that FHIP funds should serve the purposes of Congress as reflected in the express language of title VIII. 
The Committee notes that HUD's Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity has undertaken a variety of activities pertaining to property insurance under the authority of the Fair Housing Act. HUD recently testified that, due to congressional concern about such activities, it does not intend to focus its regulatory initiatives on property insurance. The Committee is encouraged by this statement, but remains concerned about HUD's use of funds for other fair housing activities aimed at property insurance practices. 
HUD's insurance-related activities duplicate State regulation of insurance. Every State and the District of Columbia have laws and regulations addressing unfair discrimination in property insurance and are actively investigating and addressing discrimination where it is found to occur. HUD's activities in this area create an unwarranted and unnecessary layer of Federal bureaucracy. 
The Fair Housing Act makes no mention of discrimination in property insurance. Moreover, neither it nor its legislative history suggests that Congress intended it to apply to the provision of property insurance. Indeed, Congress' intention, as expressly stated in the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945 and repeatedly reaffirmed thereafter, is that, unless a Federal law specifically relates to the business of insurance, that law shall not apply where it would interfere with State insurance regulation. HUD's assertion of authority regarding property insurance contradicts this statutory mandate. 
Near-identical language was contained in the House Committee report on the fiscal year 1997 appropriations bill. Both reports make it clear that Congress does not intend for HUD to use any fiscal year 1997 FHIP funds for activities targeted toward the regulation and practices of insurance companies. 
Nevertheless, on September 30, 1997, HUD announced 67 awards of fiscal year 1997 grants under the FHIP. Out of the total of $15,000,000 in funds awarded, HUD announced that almost one third, an amount of $4,170,002, was awarded for activities including investigations, testing, and other enforcement-related projects specifically targeting insurance companies. This is in contradiction of the intent expressed in both the House and Senate Committee reports on HUD's fiscal year 1997 appropriations. I am very concerned about the improper use of these limited and precious resources in a manner inconsistent with the law and urge HUD to revisit these grants to ensure all awards are consistent with the intent of Congress.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, a number of items in the conference report or statement of the managers require further clarification or correction due to printers' errors. The items are as follows: 
Within the housing certificate fund, the legislation requires HUD to provide enhanced or sticky vouchers to residents to prevent displacement where an owner of a property chooses to prepay the outstanding indebtedness under a preservation mortgage (which prepayment can now be authorized at the option of a property owner). These enhanced vouchers, including those provided in prior years, are not just for the first year after prepayment but must renewed for each subsequent year so long as the assisted family continues to live in the property. 
Within the $32 million for section 107 grants under the CDBG Program, $4 million for technical assistance, $7.5 million for the Community Outreach Program, $6.5 million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, $6.5 million for Community Development Work Study, with a $3 million set-aside for Hispanic-serving institutions, $7 million for insular areas, and $500 thousand for the National Center for the Revitalization of Central Cities. 
Within the Economic Development Initiative grants, there is a grant to Arab, AL. The statement inadvertently refers to Arab, IL. 
Within the Economic Development Initiative grants, the grant to the city of Jackson, MS, should be used for the acquisition and rehabilitation of facilities and related improvements for a downtown multimodal transit center in the city of Jackson. This project was incorrectly identified in the statement of managers. 
In addition, with respect to EDI, the intent of the conferees is for HUD to use the maximum flexibility in funding the specified EDI grants in the statement of managers. HUD is not expected to establish special requirements but should work with the entities specified in each grant to ensure that activities can be funded and completed in an expeditious manner. 
Within the Superfund research appropriation, there is a $2.5 million appropriation for the Gulf Coast Hazardous Substance Research Center. This item was included in both the House and Senate versions of the bill but not expressly identified in the statement of the managers. 
Within NASA Science, Aeronautics and Technology is a $2 million appropriation for the Bishop Museum in Honolulu, HI. This item was included in the Senate version of the bill, and the House receded to the Senate in conference, but it was inadvertently not included in the statement of the managers.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this year marks the culmination of a distinguished career in health care for an individual whose name has become synonymous with the respect and appreciation accorded Missouri hospitals. Charles L. Bowman joined the Missouri Hospital Association staff on October 1, 1975, as vice president of legislative services. He assumed the presidency in January 1986. During his 22 years of service, his word has been his bond, and he has established a solid reputation of integrity in the legislative arena for himself, the association and the hospital industry. 
Charles Bowman helped shape activities of the Missouri Hospital Association at a time when the health care delivery system was undergoing dramatic changes and health policy was assuming a greater importance on the country's public policy agenda. During this period, he charted an advocacy course for Missouri's hospitals through upheavals in the State tort reform laws, massive changes in reimbursement for the Medicare Program, and complete redesign of Missouri's Medicaid Program. 
His interest always has been in developing sound health care policy that helps hospitals serve their communities more fully. He advanced landmark legislation in Missouri that provided consent for emergency health care to be rendered to minors, and legislation that provided a definition of death. He also provided the impetus for a statewide voluntary initiative among hospitals to release hospital charge data so that consumers might become more familiar with the price of health care services. 
Charles Bowman has championed equity in reimbursement policy designed to preserve vital access to health care in rural and inner-city communities. And he has been a proponent of health system reform that gives hospitals and other providers the opportunity to organize local delivery systems of coordinated care that will allow seniors and others to continue the relationships with health care providers they have trusted over the years. 
Charles Bowman has forged a remarkable partnership between Missouri hospitals and State agencies that led to expansions in health funding for poor Missourians, development of an innovative scholarship program to help increase the number of health care providers in underserved areas of the State, and creation of a process for assessing and improving community health that has become a model for other States. 
Through his 22 years of leadership for Missouri hospitals and health systems, Charles Bowman has kept the focus of association activities on improving health care for all Missouri's citizens--by spearheading legislative programs, forging collaborative partnerships and seeking innovative solutions to problems of health delivery. He has been a credible voice for Missouri health and an advocate for a strong, unified health care community in Missouri. 
His truly has been a distinguished career of health care service.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay tribute to Mr. Donald J. Babb. Donald recently received the 1997 Shirley Ann Munroe Leadership Development Award, by the American Hospital Association, a distinction given to the rural hospital administrator across the Nation who `displayed outstanding leadership commitment to meet the challenges faced by small/rural hospitals.' 
Donald was chosen to be the administrator by the first board of directors for the Citizens Memorial Hospital in Bolivar, MO, in the early 1980's. With his experience in hospital administration and construction, Donald has taken what was once just a dream to new heights of reality. In the last 17 years he has built a huge rural facility as executive director of the Citizens Memorial Health Care Foundation. This facility provides excellent health care to more than 75,000 individuals in Bolivar and the surrounding areas. The Citizens Memorial Health Care Foundation now consists of an acute care hospital, three long-term care facilities, a residential care facility, independent living apartments, 12 physician clinics, including six certified rural health clinics--the first created in Missouri--home health, hospice, home medical equipment, homemaker services, a wellness and counseling center, a statewide health maintenance organization, and an extensive outpatient rehabilitation program. Donald also always makes time for his staff, patients, residents, and community members. He meets individually with each new employee and makes regular rounds of all of his health care facilities in the area. 
It is a privilege to honor Citizens Memorial Hospital Administrator, Donald J. Babb, on this well deserved award. I know the hospital will continue to improve and grow for years to come. The State of Missouri is lucky to have such a facility and I want to express my sincere appreciation to Donald Babb, who makes Citizens Memorial Hospital excel.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, one of the pleasures and honors I have in this body is to serve as the chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds veterans' programs, housing, as well as environment, space, science, and emergency management. 
On the veterans side, we have a very heavy responsibility to the people who, in my State and throughout the country, have been willing to put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms, and I think they deserve the best that we can give them. That is why in past years, I have been very disappointed and troubled at this administration's approach to funding for veterans' medical care. Quite frankly, they were willing to sacrifice these important programs, at least on paper, in order to pretend that they were reaching a balanced budget. I think that is just plain wrong. 
I was also disappointed earlier this spring when the President and the congressional leadership proposed to take $300 million out of veterans' medical care as a part of the budget agreement. I said at the time that we would not let that happen. 
I am pleased to report that last night in a bipartisan, bicameral session, the Senate and House negotiators on both sides, Democrats and Republicans, approved a measure that provides more funding than the President, more funding than the 
budget agreement for veterans' medical care. The conference agreement that we hope will soon be signed into law provides $17 billion next year for medical care for veterans. This level of funding ensures that we keep our promise of continued care to all eligible veterans. 
We will also be able to continue our efforts to improve the VA medical system, which has been under great stress and which we hope is making progress toward more efficient, more effective, more humane care and treatment for our veterans who need care. 
It is sometimes easy during peace and prosperity to forget temporarily the promises that we as a country have made to those veterans who were willing to risk their lives to protect us. I said throughout this budget process I did not intend to let us forget, and I hope we will move quickly to send this bill to the President. 
In addition to the tough battles we fought in the veterans' medical care area and the difficult decisions we made, we had to make some tough decisions and take some difficult actions with respect to housing. Over the last several weeks, many elderly residents in public housing complexes in Missouri and I am sure in other States represented in this body, have expressed their deep concern about the possibility of their housing subsidies being ended. 
HUD was required by law and did send notices to thousands of senior citizens across the country over the last few months telling them that their rent subsidies were scheduled to expire this fall. That is required by law. But for most of the seniors who received the notices, it is very frightening because it threatens to tell most of them they will no longer be able to afford their homes and will be forced to move. 
I visited residences of complexes in St. Louis and Springfield, MO, and listened as the residents described their fears about losing their rent subsidies. I told them I would do everything in my power to help them stay in their homes. 
I am pleased to announce once again that last night the House-Senate conference agreed to provisions that we crafted, that I crafted to protect elderly housing. During the years I have spent as a member of the Senate Banking Committee and now as chairman of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, I made preservation of affordable, low-income housing, especially for seniors, for the elderly, a top priority and a long-term commitment. 
Unlike the administration which, for some reason, continues to emphasize the possibility of vouchers as a one-size-fits-all approach to housing needs of low-income families and the elderly, I believe that elderly housing complexes, which are good, safe places, comfortable for the elderly residents, should be maintained. Frankly, it is terrifying to seniors who may have lived 10 to 15 to 20 years in the same housing complex to tell them suddenly they must move: `Here is a voucher, go out and pound the pavement and try to find housing.' 
Mr. President, if you have visited these complexes, and I am sure you have them in your State as we have them in all of our States, all you have to do is go into one of those complexes and meet with the residents, many of them in walkers, using canes, in wheelchairs and think just a minute of giving those people vouchers and asking them to go out and look for housing. What a ridiculous thought that is. We are not going to force them to go out and look for housing. 
How many of us who have parents and grandparents or other relatives in elderly housing complexes want to see them torn away from their communities and forced to find new housing? I really believe that seniors should be treated differently from young persons eligible for subsidized housing. 
While the trend in recent years has been to provide vouchers for recipients to use for housing of their choice in a variety of neighborhoods, many seniors--most of whom I talked to--prefer to remain in senior-only housing complexes. I think it makes sense for them to remain in communities where they have grown accustomed to living and have made friends and feel comfortable. 
As chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee, I included language in the HUD-VA bill that was agreed to last night which does allow these seniors to remain in their homes, to remain in their complexes. Specifically, we provided for the renewal of project-based section 8 contracts at a rate affordable to the elderly. 
Good, affordable elderly housing, more than just an example of a successful private-public partnership, is a community of people who live together and care about each other. We cannot afford to lose this type of housing. We cannot afford to lose the type of community this housing represents. 
Washington sometimes loses sight of people and the importance of local communities. But I do not plan to let Washington lose sight of these elderly housing communities or the people who live in them now or in the future. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. BOND. Madam President, St. Louis, MO, is the location of this country's first nuclear weapons site. Unfortunately, the wastes are in the midst of the St. Louis metropolitan area and are for the most part uncontrolled. The radioactive waste at these sites was generated from the production of nuclear weapons as part of the Federal Government's Manhattan Project and Atomic Energy Commission between 1942 and 1957. Much to my dismay, St. Louis has the distinction of having the largest volume of radioactive waste in the country with over 900,000 cubic yards. 
For 15 years we have worked with the Department of Energy to clean up this site. Finally, in just the past 2 weeks, after much frustration and delay, we have come to the point were DOE has begun preliminary cleanup efforts. Given this recent progress, the news of the FUSRAP program's transfer out of DOE has, quite understandably, caused a great deal of distress in the community. While I am by no means questioning the Corps' ability to handle the FUSRAP project, I am concerned that potential delays caused by the transfer will undo much of the recent progress. 
With site recommendations already made, feasibility studies concluded, and contracts let, it is important that the Corps honor the preliminary groundwork laid by DOE in order to avoid any further delays. Will the Corps be willing to respect these studies, site plans, and contracts?

Mr. BOND. The local community has been very involved in designing a plan to clean up the site. They are concerned that the administration of the cleanup will be moved away from the St. Louis area to Omaha or Kansas City, reducing their input and influence on the cleanup process. When the Army Corps of Engineers takes over the FUSRAP program, will the St. Louis cleanup be managed out of the St. Louis Corps office?

Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Georgia and I thank the Chair. 
I rise today to address an issue of profound importance, as my colleagues have been addressing, and that is the urgent need for a complete overhaul of the tax system in this country. 
Over this past week, we have all watched as the Senate Finance Committee has held important hearings on the administration of our current tax system. The testimony has demonstrated many things quite clearly, among them the fear of many taxpayers. But it has also been quite plain that for many taxpayers the root of their difficulties starts with the enormous complexity of the tax laws as they currently stand. Clearly, there is an urgent need to scrap the current tax law and start with a new system so that taxpayers can understand and follow the law in the first place. 
As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, I have heard in hearings from entrepreneurs all across the country that their biggest obstacle to staying in business is complying with the tax laws. The tax bill that we passed last summer did much to ease the tax burden for many small businesses. But at the same time it did nothing to reduce the complexity of the law which small enterprises must navigate in order to enjoy the lower tax bills. As a result, instead of leveling the playing field for small businesses we have made it more lopsided. Unlike their larger competitors, small businesses can rarely afford a staff of full-time professional employees to maintain the tax records and fill out the dozens of forms required each year. To put these duties in context, it has been estimated that Americans spend more than 5 billion hours each year complying with the tax laws. That is a staggering amount of time spent on completely unproductive activities. 
One of the figures that we have heard in the Small Business Committee is that the average small business spends 5 percent of its revenues on figuring out how to comply with the tax laws. That is not paying the taxes, that is figuring out how much tax they owe and how to comply with the tax laws. Would it not be better for small businesses to spend that time making products, providing services, providing jobs--activities that they set out to do in the first place? 
For the vast majorities of small enterprises there is only one person who handles all the tax matters and that is the small businessowner. That is the one person who has to deal with nearly 10,000 pages of tax laws, 20 volumes of tax regulations, and thousands and thousands of pages of instructions and other guidance, issued by the IRS. Sadly, much of that burden is more than most small businessowners can do on their own. Instead, they are forced to spend vast amounts of their limited capital to hire accountants to keep the records and prepare the tax returns. 
For the small business that runs into difficulties on its taxes, the situation becomes even worse. The businessowner must spend additional funds on accountants and lawyers to handle the issue. Resolving these cases can take years, and cost tens of thousands of dollars in professional fees. Not infrequently, the end result is a tax bill that is inflated by the large amounts of interest and penalties. 
Once again, we must keep in mind that every hour the small businessowner spends trying to resolve tax problems is taken away from the actual productive business of running his or her own company. 
Madam President, the Small Business Committee will hold a hearing next month to elicit the views of small business on what the optimal tax system would look like, if we started from scratch. I look forward to constructive suggestions from the small business community. I expect they will say the system should be fair, simple, and easy for the average person to understand. It should apply a low rate to all Americans. It should eliminate taxes for individuals and families who can least afford to pay. It should not penalize marriage or families. It should protect the rights of taxpayers and reduce taxpayer abuse. It should minimize recordkeeping and reporting requirements. It should eliminate the bias against jobs, and investment. It should protect Social Security and Medicare and help ensure all Americans have access to health insurance. 
The case cannot be clearer that we need a dramatic change in our tax laws, and we need it soon. 
For the information of my colleagues, the full text of my remarks will be on the web site of the Small Business Committee at www.senate.gov/sbc. 
 Mr. President, the case cannot be clearer that we need a dramatic change in our tax laws and we need it soon. Too much time, money, and effort are now wasted by individuals and businesses in this country that could be spent to improve our economy, our society, and the environment. I ask my colleagues to join me in raising the alarm and committing ourselves to do more than just talk about the problem. It's time to act--it's time for a new, fair, and simple tax system for all Americans.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay tribute to a truly outstanding University in my home State of Missouri, Southwest Missouri State University (SMSU). SMSU was one of 135 schools in 42 states selected to the John Templeton Foundation Honor Roll, `a designation recognizing colleges and universities that emphasize character building as an integral part of the college experience.' 
Being the only public institution in Missouri to earn the 1997-98 Honor Roll distinction, SMSU is also one of the eight state-funded schools to receive the award nationwide. Schools competing for the Honor Roll were judged on five criteria and out of 2,208 four-year accredited undergraduate institutions only the top few were chosen. One of the categories where SMSU stood out was in community service. During the 1996-97 school year the SMSU campus, including the faculty and students, volunteered more than 69,500 hours. 
It is an honor for the entire State of Missouri to have a University like SMSU, whose service and character-building programs have earned it this distinguished award. I commend SMSU's President, Dr. John Kaiser, for his commitment to excellence and hope for continued success in the future.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Hispanic American population during National Hispanic Heritage Month. Every year, from September 15 through October 15, Hispanic Americans celebrate their Heritage and are honored for their many civic contributions and achievements throughout the Nation. In the spirit of Hispanic Heritage Month, I recognize two individuals, Rafael Garcia and Octavio Viveros, Jr., whom I nominated to represent my home State of Missouri on the United States Senate Task Force on Hispanic Affairs. 
Rafael Garcia is president and owner of Rafael Architects, Inc. (RAI). Honored with many architectural awards, Rafael has also received numerous Community Service awards. In 1997, Rafael earned `Entrepreneur of the Year Finalist' to add to his Hispanic Leadership award, and his `Top 25 Hispanic Leaders in Kansas City' honor given by Dos Mundos Newspaper. He is a member of several Charity and Community Boards of Directors including Heart of America United Way, Starlight Theater and the Kansas City Art Institute. Rafael volunteers for FOCUS/Odyssey 2000 West as a facilitator and for Project HOPE (Hope, Opportunity, Performance, Education through Entrepreneurship) and has been written up in several prominent magazines for his many accomplishments and contributions. He personifies everything positive in the Kansas City Metropolitan area and I am excited to have him working on this important cause for Hispanic communities across the United States. 
Octavio Viveros, Jr. is a Founder and Partner of Viveros & Barrera L.C. Law Firm and is Founder and President of LatAm Trading, Inc. Octavio has been appointed to the Board of Indigent's Defense a Gubernatorial Appointment for the State of Kansas and the Key Commission a Mayoral Appointment for the City of Kansas City, MO. He is the founder of the Hispanic Economic Development Corporation of Kansas City, a former President of the Board of Directors for the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Greater Kansas City and a member of the Kansas City Centurious Leadership Program, to name a few of his civic accomplishments. Octavio has earned many awards including recognition as one of the `25 Most Influential Hispanics in Kansas City' in 1993 by Dos Mundos Newspaper. Most recently he attended United States Senate Republican Conference as a member of the Task Force on Hispanic Affairs here in Washington, DC. His continuing commitment to not only the Kansas City Community, but also the entire Hispanic American Community is a positive example for all and I am extremely pleased to have him on my team. 
I believe that Rafael and Octavio will be able to help the Hispanic community by encouraging growth and opportunity. Each year exemplary leadership in the Hispanic Community is evidenced by achievement in the work force and community involvement. It is impressive to watch this expansion and I congratulate all Hispanic Americans, especially Rafael and Octavio, during this important month of Heritage. I commend them on their present success and hope for even more in the years to come.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there may not be many things in life on which there is a consensus but I think we all can agree on the vital importance of ensuring the safety of abused and neglected children and moving them out of the foster care system more rapidly and into permanent homes. I am proud to join with my colleagues in this bipartisan effort to develop the new, consensus legislation called the Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for Abused and Neglected Children [PASS] Act. 
The reality is that all too often children simply languish in the foster care system. Nationwide, there are more than 500,000 children in foster care. In Missouri, there are 10,361 children in the foster care system. Since 1975, the number of reported incidents of abuse and neglect has increased from less than 10,000 to 52,964 in 1995, an all-time high and frightening statistic. 
Federal law has hindered State child welfare agencies from moving more quickly to place children who are in foster care because of abuse and neglect into permanent homes. 
The PASS Act will provide incentives to increase adoptions and reduce by one third the amount of time a child lingers in foster care waiting for a permanency plan, with a review required every six months so that foster care is truly viewed as a temporary care system for our most vulnerable children. 
The bill clarifies `reasonable efforts' and establishes a federal standard so that the health and safety of the child is the primary concern, above family reunification interest. There are some parents for whom reunification with their children is not reasonable--certainly sustained abuse or neglect or danger of physical harm would fit that category. In those cases, we need to move swiftly to get the children out of harm's way and then quickly to get them into permanent homes. 
Just count the number of cases of child abuse and neglect that has been reported over the past few months. One too many! A little, five-year old Kansas City girl named Angel Hart was beaten and drowned to death by her mother's boyfriend because she could not recite the alphabet. 
Under the PASS Act, States are encouraged to enact laws that would make it easier to terminate parental rights in abusive cases and prevent abused and neglected children from returning to homes in which their health and safety are at risk. In addition, this legislation promotes adoption of all special needs children and ensures health coverage for special needs children who are adopted. 
I am very optimistic that Congress will move this bill forward this year. There are far too many innocent lives at stake and no child should be denied a loving home. Unfortunately, for thousands of kids now caught in permanent limbo in the foster care system, that is exactly what is happening. The PASS Act will improve child safety and permanency, enabling some children to return home safely and others to move to adoptive families more quickly.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleague Senator Gorton on his amendment to provide kindergarten through 12th grade education funding directly to local educational agencies. Last month, I traveled through my home State of Missouri to discuss education and the importance of parent involvement in their child's education. I strongly believe that parents are the key to educational progress. As I visited with parents, educators, and local school officials, they were in full agreement concerning the education of our children; they need the flexibility to improve the quality of education at the local level without federal intrusion. As responsible parents and educators, the need for our children to be properly educated was a top priority. 
Over the last 30 years, federal involvement in education has burgeoned and I am disturbed by the growth of federal involvement in what is constitutionally the right of states: to provide for high-quality, public education. This growth has been a wolf in sheep's clothing: states and localities have been offered additional funding in exchange for adhering to federal rules and regulations. The result has been that local school officials, who are directly accountable to parents, have experienced increasingly less control over education. 
The Gorton amendment gives local schools and States what they have been requesting for years: the flexibility to develop challenging academic standards and programs that works in each locality. States and communities are where the action should be in designing standards and programs. It is at those levels that disputes are most likely to be resolved and important local priorities recognized. We must return to the traditional role of education and reduce federal control. 
States and local school districts are making great strides in educating our young people; however, the federal government cannot continue to impede their ability to provide a high-quality education which they are perfectly capable of doing. The Gorton amendment sends us in the right direction, allowing both parents and educators to work together for quality education. It is bringing education back where it belongs: at the local level. We have lost too much already by the impositions of the federal government, and it is time to remedy this problem to prepare our children for the 21st century. 
This amendment will ease regulations that prevent teachers, school administrators, and parents from doing what is best to improve their schools. Our goal is to ensure that our children are equipped with solid academic basics, which is learning to read, write, compute, think, and speak. There is no need to reinvent the wheel because we know what works and that is parents, teachers, and local communities working together to find local solutions to local problems to educate our children. We know that our children could be doing better and I want to ensure that local schools have every possible resource to make that happen. 
Mr. President, the Gorton amendment will help strengthen our educational system by increasing local school district's flexibility and funding to improve the quality of education for our children. I am proud to support this amendment and urge my colleagues to adopt this provision in conference.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the managers of the bill, particularly my good friend from Washington. 
I have good news that an amendment that I had proposed to offer I will not have to offer on this bill. 
On behalf of the people of Seneca, MO, and really people all across southwest Missouri, I, along with my colleagues Senator Ashcroft and Congressman Roy Blunt, have been fighting against an effort by an Oklahoma Indian tribe, the Eastern Shawnee, to move into southwest Missouri and establish a gambling casino in Seneca. 
In truth, it is a New Jersey gaming operation that is behind this operation. They have claimed that they provided $25 million to the tribe because they felt that a gambling casino in the heart of the family entertainment vacation area of southwest Missouri would be extremely profitable for the corporation and its shareholders. 
Over the last several months, I have presented to the Secretary of the Interior what I thought were good legal arguments that the tribe is not entitled to use an exception in the statute that would permit them automatically to move across the border from Oklahoma into Missouri. 
The people of southwest Missouri finally have some good news. Last night Secretary Babbitt called me to say that the tribe cannot automatically move across the border and build a casino in Missouri. This means that other tribes with land bordering on our State will not be able to come in. They would have to go through the process of getting approval of the Governor and support of the local residents. 
I think this is a huge victory for the overwhelming majority of local residents who are concerned that gambling would destroy the family environment and the quality of life for which southwest Missouri is so well known. 
I assure my constituents and my colleagues that I intend to continue to fight to ensure that the entire State is protected from the invasion of unwanted gambling. I assure those people who are behind the efforts, the gambling interests, if they find or think they find another loophole, I will do my best to close it. So, Mr. President, more authorizing legislation may well be needed in this. 
I express my thanks to the Secretary of the Interior, who has advised me orally, although I have not seen the written opinion, that the tribe does not qualify for the exception, and under the circumstances that avenue is no longer open to bring a gambling casino into Seneca, MO. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  
Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1139, the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. This bill is the product of the hard work of the members of the Committee on Small Business. In particular, Senator John Kerry, the committee's ranking member, has been extremely helpful and supportive in our joint efforts to produce this legislation. 
The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 reauthorizes most of the credit and noncredit programs at the Small Business Administration. On June 26, 1997, the committee conducted a markup of this bill and voted 18 to 0 to report the bill favorably to the full Senate. 
In addition to reauthorizing the SBA programs that we are most familiar with, S. 1139 addresses two significant issues: Federal contract bundling and the HUBZone Program. 
The bundling of Federal Government contracts requirements is a trend that is increasing in the Federal procurement system. Small business owners have testified before the Committee on Small Business about the negative impact contract bundling is having on their ability to bid on Government contracts. The manager's amendment to the bill includes an amended version of the contract bundling section that was worked out in close consultation with Senator Thompson and Senator Glenn, the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. 
The manager's amendment clears up any misunderstanding over what is a bundled contract. The legislation makes clear that a bundled contract solicitation is one in which `two or more procurement requirements for goods or services previously provided or performed under separate smaller contracts' are consolidated into one larger, bundled contract. This language covers contracts that were previously performed by a small business and those that were suitable for award to small business concerns. 
The amended contract bundling section builds on the authority of the Small Business Administration to challenge a Federal agency's decision to consolidate or bundle two or more contracts into a large contract. In 1989, Congress gave specific authority to SBA's procurement center representatives to challenge a decision to bundle multiple contract actions. Importantly, under the 1989 law, the SBA Administrator was given the authority to appeal a decision to bundle contract actions directly to a Cabinet Secretary or agency head if the SBA representative and the contracting agency are not able to resolve their differences. The manager's amendment to S. 1139 adds some additional features and procedures, and today's legislation does not weaken or displace the fundamental authority of SBA. 
I thank both Senator Thompson and Senator Glenn and their staffs for their cooperation in helping us to address certain issues within the jurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee relating to the Federal procurement system and governmentwide acquisition policy. I believe the contract bundling section included in the manager's amendment will help our efforts to be fair to small businesses by limiting contract bundling where it is unnecessary and unjustified.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thought, as children are going back to school across the country and in our States, we ought to take a few moments to think about the education they are receiving and how we as parents, not just in our role as legislators, can make a real difference in how our children develop. 
The truth is, we have come to know the foundations of learning begin long before a child ever gets to school. Babies from birth to age 3 years old are learning fundamental language skills at this time. Research tells us that 50 percent of a child's mature learning intelligence develops by the time that child is 3 years old. We can play a very large role in determining how successful that learning function is. We do this by reading to children even before they are old enough to hold a book. We do this by talking to them. We do this by interacting with them. 
Over the August recess I traveled around the State of Missouri, focusing on the issue of literacy and working with young children who were in preschool classes or, in Missouri, in our Parents as Teachers Program. I found it to be a very exciting, a very interesting, and a rewarding experience, and one that I hope we can show--all of us, as colleagues, as others who are concerned--is a very rewarding activity for the parents. 
We have always thought that early childhood was a key learning time. That is common sense. But now we have seen it validated by science. The development of children's learning skills depends upon the child's exposure to language in the earliest years. What we do to encourage and stimulate literacy, reading ability, communicating ability, in very young children, is going to provide the basis of their success later in life. 
When you come to think about it, reading is the basic skill. Learning to understand, to read and communicate is absolutely essential, particularly as we live in a complex society. Most of us think about reading and learning as part of the economic process of getting a job. I can tell you that my experiences in job training in the years when I was Governor reemphasized the importance of that. In my second term as Governor we had an on-the-job training program for industries expanding in Missouri and creating new jobs. I will never forget visiting one facility where they were installing sophisticated computer-assisted manufacturing systems. They were very complicated. You had to understand a lot of science to do the job well. And these jobs were extremely high-paying jobs. As a matter of fact, one of the workers in one of those jobs, working a 2,000-hour year, would earn more than the Governor of Missouri would have at that time. The science had all developed since I last opened a science textbook in college. 
They had a 6-week training program for these workers. Four of the weeks were devoted to teaching these workers to read, because so many of them had not learned the basic reading and understanding skills in school. The prize there was demonstrable; the prize was visible. If you could read and understand, you could operate one of these machines and earn more than the Governor of Missouri was earning. And there is no question, as I talked to employers around the State, they are looking for and begging for workers. But the workers have to be able to read and understand complicated instructions, because the tasks that the workers will be called on to perform, now and in the years ahead, are rapidly changing. They are changing with technology. And the people who are doing the work have to learn to read and understand the changed instructions. 
So, reading is a fundamental skill, an absolutely essential skill to get ahead economically. But we ought not to focus ourselves just on the economic side. To be an informed citizen, to participate in our democratic form of government, requires that people read, be able to understand all the messages that are coming to them. Reading provides the basis for communicating and getting along in the world in many other ways--in social activities, in community activities. So, literacy really is the fundamental basis, the foundation for knowledge and for development of well-informed, well-attuned children in our communities, in our States and in our Nation. 
Former First Lady Barbara Bush has made literacy her top priority, and I take my hat off to her. I think, as I see more and more of the challenges we face in this country, the more I understand that Mrs. Bush is right. Where people do not have the fundamental reading skills, they have significant problems. 
One of the reasons I have been closely associated with this literacy project is following up on the Parents as Teachers program we have in Missouri. Parents as Teachers begins by providing assistance, on a voluntary basis, to parents of children from birth to 3 years old. We have found that parents who participate in this program with their children--No. 1, are able to avoid many of the serious learning problems that affect children today and require that they be put in remedial or special education; but we are also finding that in every measure of scientific testing, these children are scoring higher than their peers. When I talk to kindergarten teachers and elementary schoolteachers and administrators, they can see the difference 
in these children who have worked in the program where literacy is emphasized, where parents reading to their children is emphasized. 
I spent the month of August trying to encourage more and more families in Missouri--parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, caregivers--to read to their children to show that it is fun, but also to tell them that it is vitally important. 
Also, we want to expand--and this bill does provide expansion of the opportunities for more States to participate in the Parents as Teachers Program. At my request, the chairman of the committee and the ranking member included $30 million to expand Parents as Teachers programs to other States around the country and to improve on the program. Already, 47 States participate, to some degree, in the program. 
Early childhood learning and development is important, and we can do a much better job. The Parents as Teachers Program is one that has had tremendous success. Mr. President, 150,000 Missouri families voluntarily participate in that program every year, and if you want to know if the program works, I can refer you to any one of those 150,000 families, because they see it is working, they know it is working, and, Mr. President, this bill provides more resources to help start these programs in every school district in the country. 
I hope there will be a time when we find that families, wherever they are, who want help developing the child's learning skills will be able to get the kind of assistance that is now available in Missouri. It can make a difference, and it will make a difference in our children's education, their preparation for the work force but, most of all, their preparation to take the role in society as responsible adults, as responsible parents themselves. 
I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting and keeping in the money for early childhood development. I hope to work with Senator Kerry and others to provide authorizing legislation in this session to expand on the opportunities to support early childhood development. Government programs are fine, but it all comes down to the responsibility of the parents, and that responsibility is very easy to outline, because the starting point is reading to children, relating to them and showing them the excitement and the wonders that are opened through reading of books and other materials. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 2014, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997. This conference report is the product of months of effort by Members of the Senate as well as our colleagues in the other body and representatives of the administration. This legislation also represents the first real tax cut for the American people in over a decade. Today, Americans are bearing an enormous burden when it comes to income taxes. According to a recent study by the Tax Foundation, the per capita Federal tax burden has increased 36.5 percent since 1992 and 57.5 percent since 1988, largely because of the severity of the administration's 1993 tax increase. 
In simple terms, the tax burden on Americans today is too high. Many Americans now pay more in taxes than they do for food, clothing, and housing combined. This bill takes a positive step toward easing that burden in an effort to let the hard-working men and women in this country keep more of the money they earn. 
While the provisions of this bill reduces taxes in a variety of ways, I want to focus on two important groups who will benefit the most from this legislation--our American families and the millions of small businesses across the Nation.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, Today I stand before you to recognize a truly unique individual and personal friend for her exemplary service to my home State of Missouri at the time of her retirement. Betty Gregoire, has lived in Kansas City, Missouri for the past 24 years during which she has been a wife and mother, a volunteer and a public servant. Betty has shown the kind of lifelong devotion to her State that make it an honor to commend her for her many years of civic contribution. 
After receiving a B.S. Degree from State University of New York, she taught in Long Island Elementary Schools and in Rochester, New York High School System. Betty came to Weatherby Lake, a community near Kansas City, in 1973 and by 1980 had established a position as Manager of the Prosecuting Attorney's office. Later she became the Administrative Assistant to the County Commission. 
In addition to her service on the Weatherby Lake Improvement Board, as secretary, Legislative Committee, Missouri Assessor's Association, she was appointed by Governor John Ashcroft to fill the term of Assessor in 1985 and continued to serve for three terms. 
Now part of the Finance Committee of St. Teresa Catholic church in Parkville, Betty is also a member of the Mid American Regional Council (MARC) Board and has held the position of Treasurer and 2nd Vice-President. 
Betty was appointed by the Governor in 1986 to the Missouri Job & Employment Council then reappointed in 1992, and was District 3 Director of Missouri Association of Counties from 1991-94. 
As an active member of several other civic organizations, Betty is an example for her fellow Missourians. I commend Betty for her many years of service and I am glad to say that the State of Missouri is enriched with her wisdom and leadership.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a friend and outstanding member of the Missouri Highway Patrol, who is retiring after many years of dedicated service. 
You have heard the expression, `you can bet your life on it.' That was more than an expression for me during the 8 years my family and I depended on the Governor's security team. We literally bet our lives on Gary Hurt and his colleagues, just as all Missourians bet their lives on other members of the highway patrol every day. 
Gary Hurt has devoted 28 years of service to the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Of this tenure, 18 years has been spent on the Governor's security division, where Gary has served as assistant director for 14 years. He learned his craft in the time-honored way, as a road trooper for a full decade. 
Gary fought back several years ago from an injury that threatened to end his career with the patrol. An injury to his `gun arm' required two operations, extensive physical rehabilitation and tremendous grit to overcome but overcome it he did. 
As Governor, I became very close to my security team members sharing every event and most waking hours. I am particularly grateful for their patience during the endless hours that, while driving to events, I read bedtime stories into a tape recorder for my son, Sam, for those nights I could not be home in time to read to him in person. Gary and I have shared floods, tornadoes, prison riots, hangings in effigy, election night victories and defeats, births, deaths, weddings, budget crises, and fiscal triumph. As an aside, one of the weddings we most recently shared occurred when Gary's son married a caseworker in my office of constituent services. 
I regret that Missouri will no longer have Gary Hurt among its law enforcement members, but I am counting on him to continue to share his humor, insight, and experience through different avenues. Thank you, Gary, and best of luck in your retirement. You have earned the chance to do things you want to do for a change.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if the ranking member will accommodate me, I will make just a few remarks in opposition to the amendment and then we will attempt to establish a timeframe for further proceedings on this bill. 
Mr. President, we have had a very eloquent statement by the Senator from Arkansas about questions that have been raised about the international space station. Needless to say, this question has been addressed time and time again on this floor. There are those scientists who have questions and objections. Nevertheless, the vast body, I think, of scientific knowledge and scientific expertise indicates that the space station is a tremendous opportunity for us to expand our knowledge not only about space but to develop new processes, new pharmaceuticals, medical advancements, and items that can be of tremendous benefit for us here on Earth. 
Yesterday, for example, I note that the distinguished Senator from Ohio, our only space astronaut-Senator, talked at some length about the tremendous number of advances in scientific knowledge that have come from exploration in space. The bioreactor produces artificial human tissue potentially useful in treating colon and prostate cancer, production of kidney tissue and the cartilage tissue for implants. Fluid physics, which can be observed in space, help us understand the processes on Earth, such as how the soil behaves during earthquakes. There is research in microgravity to develop new pharmaceuticals and neurological research, important to patients with multiple sclerosis. The list goes on and on, and I will not go into that here because there are a number of other Senators who have expertise in this area who wish to be heard on the measure. 
Let me say that the international space station will be a world-class scientific laboratory, with the unique feature of a near-zero gravity environment. While it is impossible for us to know in advance, all of the results of this scientific research, I think the vast body of scientific expertise believes that microgravity research will lead to new and pure pharmaceuticals, medical advancements, and the production of new materials for use here on Earth. 
With the imminent demise of Russia's Mir space station, the international space station will be the only facility where these types of research can be permitted. 
The international space station will also provide operational experience necessary for operating lunar outposts on Mars bases if and when the Nation should decide to proceed with such bold plans. 
Moreover, Mr. President, the international space station is a hallmark of international cooperation between the United States and other countries. Europe, Japan, and Canada have been involved with the program since its inception, and the addition of Russia in 1993 enhanced the international participation. There is no greater symbol of the end of the cold war than the United States and Russia--arch rivals in space for decades--working together to build a space station for the 21st century. 
Despite the challenges the program has had to overcome in the past year--particularly the schedule delays resulting from Russia's failure to complete the service module on time--the space station partnership remains intact. 
Russia has faced great financial troubles and uncertainties, and it is impossible to say that all these troubles are in the past. But this spring the Russian Government, though strapped financially, fulfilled its promise to provide 800 billion rubles, and NASA reports that work is progressing on the service module. 
American taxpayers have invested significantly--$19 billion--in the space station. We are now within a year of the first launch, which will provide the benefits and the scientific advancements into that research. Certainly, this is no time to give up on an experiment that offers such potential. 
The shuttle-Mir program, the first phase of the international space station, is successfully underway. The experiments have led to improvements in the design of the international space station, and we have trained the crews. We are ready for tremendous scientific leaps, and I trust that a significant majority of our colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, will agree that the money we have invested has been a wise investment, not only for science, technology, and the exploration of the universe now, but for the developments in the scientific advances that will come tomorrow for our children and our grandchildren, who are fascinated by the opportunities of space. The exploration of this frontier can deliver tremendous benefits. This is not the time to abort the mission and say that we have gone nineteen-twentieths, or 95 percent, of the way toward the discovery of a new world and we are going to turn back now. 
Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will once again overwhelmingly support the continuation of the space station. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am delighted to be able to rise in support of the amendment and be a cosponsor with the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from South Dakota. 
As indicated, it has a modest amount of funding, $25 million, for HUD empowerment zones, $20 million for America Reads and $5 million for FEMA disaster mitigation. The funding is offset with budget authority from section 8 contract amendments, and the outlays are off set from the NASA mission support account, if anybody cares, but it is offset. And we particularly thank Senators Mikulski and Daschle for working together to make this a good bipartisan bill. 
While the funding for this amendment is modest, I emphasize that it covers a number of important issues, from child literacy to disaster mitigation to the economic development of distressed communities through empowerment zones. While I have some concerns about how programs are set up and authorized, this, I think, is a very constructive way to move the bill forward. 
Let me address the question of America Reads. We do not yet know the full outlines of the program the President is considering. I hope he will send forth authorizing legislation. That is the best way to do it, I think, is to get legislation establishing the parameters of the program. But let me say how important the objective is. The objective is to get people to read to small children, parents to read to their children. Officials in schools are engaged in teaching reading, but caregivers in day care centers and elsewhere must read to children. 
As one who has spent a lot of time working on early childhood development--and I have to say that our national award-winning and recognized Missouri Parents as Teachers Program has demonstrated how effective this can be--I believe that reading to children from the youngest age gets their interest, their attention, and their enthusiasm in the written word, and puts them on to a lifetime of reading, which will open up opportunities, knowledge, information, and great joy for their entire lifetime. 
If there is one thing that is the thread that seems to hold together all of the successful programs of getting children off to a good start, it is reading to them. It is communicating to them from the written word and attracting their attention to the written word as a means of communication. 
Were we not in the middle of a very, very important process to pass this appropriations measure, I could talk a lot longer about the importance of reading to very young children. Let me just say that reading to young children--there is no finer objective. The money we have appropriated here is a symbol of the importance that we place on this activity. 
The VA-HUD appropriations bill is a very tight allocation. We have had to have difficult funding choices. I hope that we made good consensus choices for what most Members consider the primary needs and concerns facing the VA-HUD are. I hope, however, that this amendment will keep the dialog moving on a path to enactment. 
With that, Mr. President, I do not see any other Senators wishing to speak on this amendment, certainly not in opposition to it.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Bumpers amendment be set aside, that the Senator from New York be recognized to offer an amendment for 5 minutes, that I be recognized for 1 minute; that on the disposition of the amendment offered by the Senator from New York, that there be 15 minutes of debate under the control of Senator Bumpers and 30 minutes of debate under the control of myself or Senator Mikulski, and that no amendments be in order to the amendment offered by Senator Bumpers. I further ask that following the conclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the Bumpers amendment.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, both Senators from New York have raised some important concerns regarding veterans health care in their State. Clearly, the new resource allocation system has forced some tough decisions in some networks. I believe this system is a vast improvement over previous allocation methodologies, and there are some encouraging signs that more veterans are being served in an appropriate manner. It may require some fine-tuning. That is why this committee has asked the General Accounting Office to undertake a review of the new allocation system, as I think the Senators from New York want, including what aspects of VERA may need improvement to accomplish equity and efficiency goals while maintaining quality. 
The GAO report is due to be completed, I tell the Senator from New York, by September 30. As of today, they seem to be on track toward that deadline. We will work to ensure that they meet it. I think the Veterans Administration should take GAO's analysis and recommendations into consideration in making its allocations in fiscal year 1998. 
In addition, a subsequent GAO report has been requested, which would look at quality of care in specific networks, including New York. Upon completion of this review, VA should incorporate any recommendations into the allocation methodology.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I know we have had a somewhat confused schedule and there are a number of Senators who have sought recognition and would like to speak on this. I hope that their schedules will permit them to be here. In the meantime, I thought it would be helpful since we have heard various scientists quoted to give just an idea of a few of the benefits of space research. 
First, in biotechnology, microgravity allows researchers to produce superior protein crystals for drug development and to grow three-dimensional tissues including cancer tumors for research and cartilage for possible transplant, and as a result people like Nobel laureate Herbert Hauptman addressed the biomedical research caucus of Congress on the value of orbital research for biomedicine and said, `I strongly support space research and the development of the space station.' 
Dr. T. L. Nagabhushan, Ph.D., vice president of biotechnology and development for Schering-Plough Research Institute, said 
I view the space shuttle program as a stepping stone to the ultimate program that will guarantee prolonged efforts in microgravity. Ultimately, our hope is to be able to crystallize proteins in microgravity, conduct all x ray data collection experiments in space and transmit the data to Earth for processing. This can only be done in a space station. 
Dr. Jeanne L. Becker, assistant professor, department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of South Florida, said 
The application of microgravity technology toward the development of tissue models has far-reaching potential for advancing cancer research. Like many of the new and innovative technologies, including gene therapy and immune-based treatment, space-based research must be continued and expanded in order to apply the benefits of this technology to the rapidly advancing area of health sciences. 
Dr. Milburn Jessup, Deaconess Hospital, Harvard Medical School, said 
The space program offers a chance to improve our models of cancer and to develop new drugs and treatment as well as to gain knowledge about how cancer spreads. The space program has provided a breakthrough in tools for cancer research. We feel this is the tip of the iceberg of scientific discovery for us and the beginning of a new era in the care of the cancer patient. 
Mr. President, I could go on and on. We have stacks and stacks of testimony from scientists, scientific organizations, physicians, medical researchers, health care researchers, people who do research in many areas of microgravity and physics and other related areas of science. We could bring all of those statements in. 
I cite these just as a few specific examples of why the scientific community, and the vast majority of the scientific community, believes that the space station and space research is vitally important. 
I conclude by referring to biomedical research, saying space research provides unique insights into how the heart and lungs function; the growth and maintenance of muscle and bone; perception cognition, and balance, and the regulation of the body's many systems in the field of regulatory physiology. 
That is why the American Medical Association has adopted a resolution in support of the international space station. 
The AMA supports the continuation of NASA and other programs for conducting medical research and other research with potential health care benefits on manned space flights, including the continued development and subsequent operation of the international space station. 
I thought I would conclude my remarks, Madam President, with a quote from Dr. Michael DeBakey, chancellor and chairman of the department of surgery, Baylor College of Medicine, who said, 
The space station is not a luxury any more than a medical research center at Baylor College of Medicine is a luxury. 
He said also, 
Present technology on the shuttle allows for stays in space of only about 2 weeks. We do not limit medical researchers to only a few hours in the laboratory and expect cures for cancer. We need much longer missions in space, in months to years, to obtain research results that may lead to the development of new knowledge and breakthroughs. 
Mr. President, these are just a few of the comments that the scientific community has made in support of the space station. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. 
I yield the floor.

I wound up giving them the 20, 30 cents I had saved all summer long. They are very, very compelling. 
In this instance, it is not my position, it is the position of the distinguished scientists, such as the ones whose comments and quotes I have read into the Record that outline specifically what the benefits of the space station and space exploration have been and will be.

I understand the authorizing committee is examining the potential for legislated caps. I think this is an issue appropriately to be referred to the authorizers. It deserves careful consideration, not brought forward here in the last moment on an appropriations bill debate. 
I just say, Mr. President, space station is a research and development project. It has a lot of uncertainties but tremendous promise. It is rocket science. We are dealing with rocket science. We should not lock NASA in stone with caps that are pulled out of thin air here at the last minute in the appropriations process.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think this should take care of the amendments for tonight. In the managers' amendment, the first item is a technical correction to EPA language related to cross-collateralization of State revolving funds. The language has been requested by the Environment and Public Works Committee. 
The second item, requested by Senators Mack and Graham, is to enable the State of Florida to use funds obligated and available to the State of Florida under title II of the Clean Water Act to make a grant to Monroe County, FL. This is budget neutral, and similar to other amendments on VA-HUD bills. 
Third, this would ensure that the Council on Environmental Quality use only those resources provided to its direct appropriations to support its activity. 
The fourth item deletes the prohibition on FEMA disaster relief expenditures relative to beaches. It is expected that the authorizing committee will be addressing this shortly. 
There is another amendment, a very important amendment, on page 16, which readjusts the section 8 contract renewal account from $9.2 billion to $8.666 billion, as provided by the Budget Committee, to put the bill in compliance with the budget resolution and the 602(b) allocation. 
The sixth amendment limits locality pay increases for VA employees found guilty of sexual harassment. 
The seventh amendment makes $1 million available in transition funds for the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator Program. 
The eighth amendment authorizes HUD to bar persons violating the Indian block grant housing program from participating in the program in the future. 
The other eight amendments are truly technical amendments. The HOPE Six account, the preservation account, McKinney homeless account, PHA account, account structure, demolition grants as part of HUD multifamily disposition authority, and grandfathering all existing home jurisdictions for home funding allocations. 
Mr. President, I ask my ranking member if there are any further items that she has.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of my colleagues a provision in this measure which directs $40 million to begin the new plant genome initiative to help keep U.S. agriculture on top in the 21st century. The United States currently has a robust Federal investment in biotechnology in the human health field. While this remains a national priority, I think it is critical that we begin building on the common foundation in basic science to bring the power of biotechnology to bear in agriculture. We cannot sit idly and expect to remain the world's leader in agriculture production. U.S. agriculture currently exports a record $60 billion in agricultural products with a net trade surplus of $30 billion. This is about the long-term sustainability and competitiveness of U.S. agriculture which means that it is about meeting the world's growing nutritional needs, protecting U.S. jobs, and preserving the environment. 
The future of corn and other plant species is written in the genetic code and genome mapping will give us the precise locations of genes that control important traits that can be manipulated to make corn and other vital commodities more drought tolerant; freeze tolerant; tolerant to certain chemicals, weeds, or bugs; disease resistant; less toxic and more digestible which is critical because it could lower phosphorous and nitrogen levels in animal waste. 
This action incorporates the initial recommendations of the interagency working group on plant genomes [IWG] which was formed recently at my request to develop a scientific and administrative consensus on how best to accomplish this ambitious new effort to address the needs of 21st Century. The world population wants more food, less expensive food, more nutritious food, and they want it produced on less land in a more environment-friendly way. In this half century, we have seen U.S. agriculture double production by utilizing new technologies. Biotechnology will be the key in the next century to meet the needs of a world population which is expected to double in the next 30 years while protecting the world's natural resources. 
According to scientists, today, biotechnology makes it possible to enter the genetic world of plants to gain a greater degree of control over the selection of genes than was possible with traditional breeding. It is now possible to locate the genes for certain traits, cut them from one organism, and paste them into another, even if the target organism is of another species. In order to accomplish a genetic transfer between organisms using biotechnology, scientists have to be able to find the location of the genes that control a given characteristic, such as size, color, or resistance to disease. This new initiative seeks to provide a map of these locations so that scientists and producers can capitalize on this vast potential to benefit humankind and the environment. 
The original idea was introduced to me by the Missouri Corngrowers Association who presented a comprehensive business plan to map the corn genome devised by the National Corngrowers Association working in conjunction with private and public scientific experts. With this additional money provided in this legislation the initiative can be expanded beyond corn to include other economically significant crops such as rice, soybeans, and wheat. After consulting with a number of scientists in Missouri and elsewhere, I have concluded that this is the kind of research that will unlock the information which holds the promise of addressing dramatically the challenges facing the world in the coming century. My hat is off to those who argued convincingly that this blockbuster initiative is vital to address the economic, nutritional, and environmental needs of the next century and worthy of blockbuster support from the Federal Government. I also applaud the administration's IWG for their strong support in beginning to formate the most scientifically and administratively feasible way to proceed so that we can maximize the return on the taxpayers' investment. 
The IWG on plant genomes which was empaneled at my request to make recommendations on the plant genome initiative, consists of representatives from the Department of Agriculture, National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Office of Management and Budget. In its recently-released report, while funding sources were not identified, the value of this initiative was validated and recommendations were advanced to provide for international cooperation, private-public partnerships, and open public access to all the information discovered. The money awarded under this act will be done so by the National Science Foundation on a competitive basis with peer review. 
Finally, I note that it is imperative that work continue to be done to integrate this initiative into the inter-agency effort that the IWG recommends. This means that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will have to work with us on coordinating their efforts with NSF and other agencies and they will have to provide recommendations on additional sources of funds for the effort within their budget.

Mr. BOND. I congratulate Senator Mack for his work in developing a workable solution to the section 8 contract renewal problem, and also Secretary Cuomo for his willingness to work with the Senate. Needless to say, it is my hope that this issue still can be resolved in budget reconciliation or through the regular authorization process. However, if it becomes necessary, we will pursue this issue through the appropriations process. I look forward to working with the Banking Committee as we move forward and I will endeavor to include any changes that are based on agreements between your committee and HUD. It is likely that those agreements would be incorporated during the conference with the House. 
As a member of the Banking Committee during the last Congress and as a cosponsor of the bill, I appreciate the work that the authorizing committee has done on this legislation. Multifamily portfolio restructuring is an urgent priority. I look forward to continuing our work together in resolving the contract renewal crisis.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me very briefly express my sincere appreciation to my ranking member for her great cooperation. The expeditious way in which this measure was handled is something that is rather unusual for the VA-HUD bill. When she indicated she thought we could wrap this up today, I said I am a skeptic; I am from Missouri; I have to be shown. And thanks to the cooperation of all Senators we have been able to do it. 
I really appreciate the cooperation of Senators on both sides. Senator Mikulski has been very effective. I would like to add my thanks to Andy Givens, to Stacy Closson and David Bowers, and particular thanks to my staff. This is the first time that Jon Kamarck has gone through this as the chief clerk. It is quite an experience. We appreciate the work he has done. We are delighted to have the steady hand of Carrie Apostolou guiding us on EPA, veterans, FEMA matters with great skill, and Sarah Horrigan has been a great addition on the NASA and science accounts, and I very much appreciate all of that assistance. 
Mr. President, since I think many Members are anxious to get started on the vote, and I do not expect anyone will be disadvantaged, I will now ask unanimous consent that we begin the vote and I ask for the yeas and nays.

I see my colleague from Minnesota has come in. I understand he wants to speak on another measure. But I ask my colleagues, if they have any business, if they wish to do anything, please be here before 6 o'clock. We are willing, ready, and able to do business and move forward on VA-HUD. But we do not need to hold personnel here if nobody is going to come forward. 
With that invitation, or request, that all of our colleagues who may have either amendments or colloquies advise the ranking member or myself by 10 o'clock tomorrow that we will be here for votes, it will be a good opportunity for us to determine what measures are going to come before the body so we can schedule the work on this very important bill and move forward. 
I thank my colleagues for their cooperation. I hope they will let us know what amendments they have.

Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, with my distinguished ranking member, I am pleased to present to the Senate the fiscal year 1998 VA-HUD and Independent agencies appropriations bill. This bill is not perfect, as is usually the case with the measures that we present, and not everyone is fully satisfied, but, nevertheless, every attempt was made to achieve a balanced, fair bill which meets our highest priority. 
While I am very grateful for the support of the appropriations chairman in the allocation process, it should be recognized that the allocation is slightly above the amount assumed in the budget agreement. Our job was made extremely difficult once again this year by an extraordinarily tight initial 602(b) allocation. I might add that we are awaiting final Budget Committee action, which I expect will be forthcoming shortly, to achieve the final allocation numbers. 
The allocation represents a reduction of about $1.4 billion below the President's request in outlays. Clearly, fulfilling the President's request in many areas has been impossible under these numbers. 
The bill totals approximately $69.4 billion in discretionary budget authority, plus an additional $21.5 billion in mandatory spending. 
Our highest priority was adequately funding VA medical programs, which in the budget agreement took a $300 million cut. Protecting VA medical care meant that fulfilling the President's full request for EPA, for which a 12 percent or $850 million increase was requested, simply was not possible. 
In addition, the subcommittee did not apply cuts totaling $230 million to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration or the National Science Foundation which were assumed in the budget agreement. 
Finally, the budget agreement suggested that public housing, community development block grants, the HOME Program for local governments to assist in housing, and the McKinney Homeless programs all be cut. Clearly, those cuts were unacceptable, and we did not include them. 
For the Veterans Administration the committee recommendation totals $18.7 billion in discretionary funding, an increase of $92 million above the President's request and almost $400 million above the amount assumed in the budget agreement. Increases were provided to VA medical care, research, and the State home construction grant program, the latter of which demand far exceeds available Federal matching funds. 
The recommendation for VA is predicated on enactment of reconciliation legislation giving VA authority to retain collections from third-party payers and copayments. Such collections are estimated to total $600 million next year, and together with the medical care appropriation will result in an increase over fiscal year 1997 of $617 million in available discretionary funding for VA medical care. The amount recommended will enable VA fully to continue on the path of improving the quality of health care services, increase the number of veterans served, and increase the provision of care in ambulatory and community-based settings. 
The bill would also require VA to begin implementation of a number of preliminary recommendations of the National Academy of Public Administration report regarding the Veterans Benefits Administration. These recommendations are intended to improve and expedite the processing of veterans' claims for benefits. Addressing this problem is long overdue. 
For the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the committee recommends $25.4 billion, including flat funding for most programs such as CDBG, HOME, public housing, and homeless assistance. The budget agreement assumes cuts in each of these programs. And as I indicated, the committee did not accept that budget agreement recommendation. 
In addition, the mark restores the President's budget cut of $365 million to elderly and disabled housing, with a total of $839 million included in the recommendation for this program. 
Furthermore, the bill provides $9.2 billion to fund section 8 contract renewals fully for which the budget resolution 
included a special reserve account. 
For the Environmental Protection Agency, the committee recommendation totals almost $7 billion, an increase of $180 million over the fiscal year 1997 level. While this recommendation is $680 million less than the President's request, the reduction is attributable primarily to the decision not to fund a requested 50 percent increase for Superfund. 
Given that the Superfund Program is sorely in need of reform and reauthorization, with the General Accounting Office designating it as a high-risk program subject to fraud, waste and abuse, coupled with our budget constraints previously described, a $700 million increase simply could not be justified. Senators Chafee and Smith, chairman of the authorizing committee and subcommittee respectively, have indicated their opposition to a large boost in Superfund appropriations prior to reauthorization and reform badly needed in that program. Finally, there are serious questions as to whether EPA could even spend the full amount being requested. 
In terms of operating programs, which are up almost $100 million over last year, the largest reduction--$122 million--below the request was taken from a laboratory construction project in Research Triangle Park, NC. Sufficient funds remain available to continue progress on the new building at this time. 
In addition, all major operating program accounts in the Environmental Protection Agency will receive increases. Again, this year the committee made as its highest priority EPA funding for States for implementation of environmental requirements. A significant increase is recommended for State revolving funds. 
The committee recommendation restores the President's proposed $275 million cut to clean water State revolving funds and fully funds the $175 million increase for drinking water State revolving funds, for a total of $2.075 billion. These funds are vitally needed, Madam President, with the EPA's estimate of drinking water and clean water infrastructure requirements nationally exceeding $200 billion. I believe every Member of this body, when she or he returns to their State, will find that these priority needs are there. They are critical and they are absolutely essential to maintaining the health of our populace as well as the quality of our environment. 
In addition, the committee recommends a $50 million boost to State environmental assistance grants, in part for additional responsibilities in the area of air quality standards, for a total of $725 million. The leaking underground storage tank grants are increased $5 million, for a total of $65 million. This program is vital in protecting ground water resources. 
To minimize controversy and expedite consideration of this bill, there are no EPA legislative provisions included in the committee recommendation. If Members wish to offer such amendments, we ask that you bring them forward. We will deal with those in the full body. We did not deal with them in committee. 
For the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the committee recommends $13.5 billion for NASA, the same as the President's request. The past few weeks in the news have exemplified NASA's situation, from the heady excitement of seeing the American robot Sojourner cruising the surface of Mars to the continued concerns over the safety of our American astronaut and his Russian companions on the Mir space station. We have supplied NASA with the President's request and will work with the agency to allow them the flexibility to continue their exciting research and development missions while at the same time working to control their costs. 
For the National Science Foundation, the recommendation includes $3.377 billion for the National Science Foundation, $10 million above the President's request and $60 million above the budget agreement assumptions. This subcommittee believes that research and development is essential to our Nation's future and wants to give the NSF the necessary resources. 
Included in the mark for NSF funding is the provision for a new plant genome initiative. An interagency working group convened by the President's science adviser has recently reported on the exciting prospects in genome research. Their report recommends expanding current studies of plant genomes to economically important crop species, including corn. We have supplied NSF with the resources to jump-start that effort and applaud the agency's interest and support in exploring the broader applications of the research they fund. 
For the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the recommendation totals the President's request of $788 million exactly, including $320 million for disaster relief. A prohibition on spending is included in the recommendation, consistent with legislation FEMA recently proposed to reform the disaster relief account. This is an area I have long been interested in addressing, as the costs of this program are completely out of control. The limitation on spending included in this measure as recommended by FEMA would prohibit disaster relief funds from being spent on such projects as golf courses, stadiums, parks, and recreational facilities, trees and shrubs. While the limitation on spending is modest, it is at least a first step, long overdue, and an important one that we should 
take. I anticipate the authorizing committee will expedite its consideration of FEMA's proposed Stafford Act amendments in September. 
Also in FEMA, the newly authorized dam safety program is fully funded at $2.9 million and State and local assistance grants are increased $3 million. 
I might add that, as mentioned earlier, we are waiting final action from the Budget Committee to revise the 602(a) allocation, which is anticipated shortly, after which the subcommittee 602(b) allocation will be revised so that we may be in conformance with that allocation. The action is necessary owing to the budget resolution's special treatment of the HUD section 8 contract renewal accounts.

Mr. BOND. Madam President, when major measures like this are considered on the floor, it is usually boilerplate for each side to say nice things about the counterpart. In the case of the VA-HUD bill--this is a very difficult bill--I say without reservation, and not as a matter of mere formality, that one of the great benefits I have in working through a very, very difficult bill is that I have the distinguished Senator from Maryland as my ranking member. She has helped me a great deal learn and understand many of the great challenges in this bill from her position as having chaired this committee. She has presented to us, in very workable fashion, a number of the concerns we have been able to meet in this bill, and I really could not be here with this difficult a bill in as good a shape as I believe it is without her support. It has been absolutely invaluable to me to have her assistance and that of her able staff. 
She mentioned a modest amendment that I look forward to working with her to include. 
I guess my whole concern over this bill--it was with a slight tear in my eye that I read the statement of administration policy from Budget Director Raines. He said some nice things about working with the committee. On the first page of his letter, he said, `We urge the committee to reduce funding for lower priority programs or for programs that would be adequately funded at the requested level and to redirect funding of programs of higher priority.' 
Unfortunately, we have looked at the programs. We have not funded the lower priority programs to the best of our ability. The priority funding that we have included in this bill does reflect the priorities of what I hope will be a bipartisan majority of this body. We do have the option when we go to conference, we hope, of increasing the overall allocation, so that there will be more funds available, and that we will be able to put some more money in the higher priority programs. But given the nature of the allocation and the many pressing needs, as my ranking member has outlined and as I have outlined, there are not low-priority programs funded in this bill. 
I note that on the America Reads Program, it has not been authorized. We don't really have any details on it yet. So we were reluctant to go forward with the President's full request. When I first heard about it, I thought it would be a program that would be funded in Labor-HHS if it is a reading program. But I am certainly willing to work with my minority colleagues in trying to make some accommodation of the President's interests there. 
With respect to the brownfields HUD program, I have said on this floor many times that HUD is a very troubled agency that is having a great deal of difficulty running the programs it is supposed to run. That is why I am reluctant to give it a new responsibility in the environmental area. EPA is handling that program. We have included money for the EPA for the brownfields program. We made brownfields clean up an eligible activity for the community development block grants, so that communities without an undue benefit, Federal bureaucratic interference, might be able to clean up some of them themselves. So we feel that the brownfields program is not one that ought to be added to HUD's already too-full plate. 
After speaking briefly with my ranking member, I join with her in urging our colleagues to bring forward the amendments. We hope to know by 10 o'clock tomorrow what amendments are pending. We want to be accommodating. We want to accommodate our colleagues if they do have amendments and, if possible, we would try to accommodate them. If we simply do not see the resources available, we would like to move expeditiously to a vote on it, if that is required. I am most encouraged by the optimistic thought that we could finish this very important bill by not too late tomorrow. I am from Missouri and it is the `show me' State. I will believe it when we have final passage. But I commit to working with the ranking member and all of my colleagues. 
In the past, we have been swamped at the end with a large number of colloquies and senses of the Senate. I have found, through very painful experiences, that I need to read those and make sure that we have time to consider them fully on both sides. So if colloquies or other noncontroversial items are to be inserted, it would be of great help to me and I would appreciate it, as my ranking member would, if we could see those colloquies as soon as possible, so we will be able to give them full consideration. 
Now, Madam President, I had hopes that one of our very distinguished colleagues would be able to be over this afternoon. We heard that Senator Glenn might wish to come and talk about the space station. We are open and we are ready to do business. We will be more than happy to entertain any measures. If any colleagues have an amendment that may need to go to a voice vote, we would like very much to lay it down today. We have both the time from now until 5:15 and then after the votes to do it. It is the request, I believe, of the leaders that we move forward. If there is an amendment that we can debate and set for a vote tomorrow morning, we would like very much to do so. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. I join my distinguished colleague from Maryland in thanking our friend from Ohio. No one in this body speaks with more knowledge and expertise on space issues than Senator John Glenn. To hear him talk about the exciting things that are happening in space, science and medical advances, it truly is remarkable. It gives one a sense of what we can accomplish with the investments we make. 
This is extremely helpful, as we go into the debate, because these are very tight budget times. We have taken a step of assuring that money is available for space, for investment in our future by the exploration not just of space but of the scientific discoveries that can come from utilizing the space station. 
I thank him first as one who is interested in science. I envy his background and his knowledge. I appreciate very much his description of the exciting things that can come from space exploration, not just for those of us who are worrying about the funny-named rocks on Mars but those who want to see concrete and specific medical advances here today.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend from Indiana. 
I rise to express my opposition to the Feingold amendment. I understand, as the Senator from Indiana does, the need to deal with the fiscal problems the Department of Defense will face in coming years. We are all very much aware of those, and we know that choices have to be made. We know we have to operate within a budget. 
Mr. President, the Department of Defense has just completed its Quadrennial Defense Review. Not all of us like what the QDR had to say, but it was a strategy-based plan and decision for the future. This fall and early this winter, as the Senator from Indiana has just pointed out, the National Defense Panel will come out with another review of the Department's future. Just how many strategic essays does the sponsor of this amendment want? We can run around and order more studies conducted. Somehow, conducting studies makes thin soup. We can continue to put more of a paperwork burden on the Department of Defense, but that does not change the need for us to stay within the budget that has already been adopted by this Congress, to put us on a path to balance the budget by the year 2002, or sooner, I hope. We know those numbers. We know the maximum we can allot, and another study does not change the obligation of Congress to make tough choices based on what the Department of Defense has told us. 
The Armed Services Committee has held hearings. They have asked these questions. I say for my friends that the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee has also held hearings. We have also gone over all of these items and asked these questions. The sponsor and other Members are interested in where we stand and what the best thinking of the Department of Defense is today. I invite them to review the testimony that has been presented at those hearings and also to review the recommendations of the National Defense Panel. 
Technology moves on. We need to provide our military personnel with the finest equipment available in the present, as well as in the short- and long-term future. Technology is not cheap. But it does save lives. It protects our freedom; it protects our national security and international peace. These goals are worthy objectives. It is worth the cost. If some in this body do not believe it is worth the cost, I strongly disagree with them, and I will fight them on that. 
We are currently in the process of procuring the Navy's No. 
1 priority. It happens to be tactical aircraft for its carrier fleet. This is a fleet which the Armed Services Committee, and I predict the full Senate, will shortly show its support by advancing $345 million in this bill in order to bring the ship online and to do it faster and cheaper. This is a commitment to naval aviation. We need the carriers and the airplanes on the deck. Enough strategic studies. Let's get on with the program. 
I appreciate the time. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very proud to join my cochair of the National Guard Caucus, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, in support of a very long overdue and very important provision offered by the chairman of our Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and the full committee. 
I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this measure to elevate the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to a rank of four-star general and to give that general a seat at the table as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
As has already been pointed out, the National Guard has been increasingly called upon to perform overseas deployments and other operational tasks in its role as a national defense component. The National Guard is unique from all other services in that it has a State-oriented mission as well as a national mission. The National Guard maintains a force of over 350,000 soldiers and airmen and women, fully 20 percent of our total fighting force. It is a force greater, almost double that of another military component already represented on the JCS. 
The current administrative chain of command for the National Guard at the highest levels is confusing, to say the least. Component Air Force personnel of the National Guard, who are integrated into the Air Force structure in an enlightened and seamless way, fall under the umbrella of the Chief of the Guard Bureau, specifically to address the unique requirements faced by the National Guard personnel, but the Chief of the National Guard Bureau is responsible to the Chief of the Army. 
By placing the Chief of the Guard Bureau on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, this convoluted chain of command will be rationalized. By placing the Chief of the Guard Bureau on the JCS, the unique characteristics of the Guard will receive their just due. 
As former Governors, my cochairman and I recognize as much as anyone can the truly vital State mission that the Guard provides. I have come to know and appreciate what the Guard must do in its civilian mission and its State militia role. This is a unique mission, unlike any of the missions of the other branches of the service, and for this reason as well it commends a seat at the table with the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the head of the Guard Bureau. 
My colleagues from Alaska and Kentucky have already pointed out how the Guard gets short shrift when major decisions are made. We have a couple of colonels in the room when the generals are making the decision. That does not carry a lot of weight. We have seen time and time again where agreements are reached, supposedly taking account of and recognizing the role the Guard plays, only to have the higher-ups, those people who have a membership on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, overturn or ignore those agreements. 
The President, who is advised by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, gets, in my view, a biased view, and as a result the Office of the President traditionally has habitually disregarded the legitimate procurement needs of the Guard, and the recommendations that come to us from the President do not reflect what we in this body have continually recognized as the important role of the Guard. Rather than having us try to fight that battle every time, it makes sense, in my view, to have a four-star general as head of the Guard and have that person represented on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This will force the Defense Department to recognize the needs and the unique mission of the Guard in its budget requests and incorporate them into its financial plans as well as incorporating the Guard in its utilization plans. This action will go a long way to making sure that we have a fully integrated and effectively utilized civilian militia as we meet the changing needs with tight budgets for the future. 
As well, there are those of my colleagues who have had concerns about the politicization of National Guard requirements and resources. The administration has yet to recognize the legitimate procurement needs of the National Guard. Not once has one penny been requested for the National Guard's procurement requirements. The Department of Defense has relied upon the largess of the Congress to support it. So, to my colleagues who will use the argument in the coming days during discussions on the Defense authorization and appropriation bills, that `the Pentagon has not even asked for so many dollars,' the Pentagon, doesn't do the asking, it is the President, and he has seen fit to disregard habitually, the legitimate procurement needs of the Guard. By having the Guard represented on the JCS, the Defense Department will be forced to recognize these needs in its budget and incorporate them into its financial plan. And this action will relieve a lot of that politicization we keep hearing about. 
This amendment will not increase the size of the National Guard, nor increase the administrative staffs. The rules and requirements met by the other Joint Chiefs will have to be met by the National Guard Chief. 
This is an amendment whose time has come. It is forward thinking, it recognizes the changing world situation and the subsequent change to our Nation's military force structure and requirements. It is an important step in the right direction of modernizing the military paradigms we have lived with through the cold war and goes a long way to addressing QDR concerns for the direction of our Nation's military force. 
I say again, I urge Members who have not yet cosponsored it--and there are only 53 left--to join us in cosponsoring this measure because this is an idea whose time has come. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the amendment. 
As a former chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on International Finance, it is a pleasure to rise in support of the amendment offered by the current chair of that subcommittee and the current ranking member. We spent a lot of time in the International Finance Subcommittee trying to figure out what 
export controls work and what controls do not work. 
Let me tell you something, Mr. President. The one thing that we have learned is we do not spend enough time in dealing with the truly cutting-edge technology, the major supercomputers that need to be controlled. And why? Because we spend too much time on things that are readily available in Radio Shack in the United States or similar stores throughout the world. Why are we wasting our time trying to control something that any attache from an Embassy can walk into a store here in the United States and pick up and send home or can be found in a store in almost any major city in the world. 
Two years ago, the Clinton administration put to an end the requirement that a U.S. exporter of computer technology attain a Commerce Department license prior to selling computer equipment with a capacity greater than 2,000 MTOPS to any Third Tier nation--2,000. We need to keep these numbers in mind and, unfortunately, there are a lot of numbers going to be thrown around. We are talking about the range of 2,000 to 7,000. 
Now, the administration arrived at this decision at the conclusion of a detailed study by a professor at Stanford University conducted in association with the Department of Defense and the Department of Commerce. These parties concluded that the marginal benefit to national security cannot justify requiring U.S. exporters of technology at this level to be licensed for sale to nonmilitary users. Acting on the conclusions of this very credible source and with the concurrence of the Defense and Commerce Departments, the administration rolled back the regulatory requirement that the first-degree amendment of the distinguished Senators from Mississippi and Illinois would seek to reimpose. In spite of my great respect for my esteemed colleagues from Mississippi and Illinois, let me say that rolling back the decontrols is unwise and misdirected policy, and I hope that our colleagues will join us in supporting the second-degree amendment. 
The policy of the legislative change in the first-degree amendment quite simply cannot be policed, it cannot be enforced, it is ineffective, and it does little to contribute to our national security. I might add, `harsh letter to follow.' I think if you would take those four points--it cannot be policed, it cannot be enforced, it is ineffective, and does not contribute to our national security--it does harm our economic competitiveness. It does take away jobs from Americans. 
The question here is about computer technology, but it is also about computer chips. Dozens of computer chips with a typical capacity of 650 MTOPS are available commercially all over the world--650 MTOPS. I happened to stop by the candy desk, and I picked up four pieces of candy. Each one of these could hold a computer chip wrapped in a couple of layers of protective shipping material. Four 650 MTOPS chips would give you the capacity of 2,600 MTOPS--600 MTOPS above the level. If these were four computer chips, that would give you more computing power than the minimum amount to be licensed in sales under this first-degree amendment. I am told that anyone with the know-how, basic electronic know-how, can fashion these chips together in a computer with capacity that is far greater than that which would be regulated under this amendment. 
I cite this example to show that it is nearly impossible to prevent the transport of certain technology particularly when it can be carried out of the country in somebody's pocket. It is 
simply fruitless to attempt to control technology at this level through export control measures. 
Now, the proponents and my friend from Illinois have talked about sales of supercomputers to our adversaries. If that is what we were talking about, if we were talking truly about supercomputers, I would be on their side because I do not think we ought to be selling supercomputers. Supercomputers that do military work these days are 20,000 MTOPS to 650,000 MTOPS. They are talking about computers 10 times, 10 times the range that would be covered by this regulation. 
Now, the Senator from Illinois said that the servers we have in our offices are about 200 to 250 MTOPS. I just checked with the computer center, and the Pentium server that we have in our office to do such sophisticated things as handle the mail and try to get the split infinitives out of the letters my staff prepares for me and handle memoranda and keep the books in our office is a 1,500 MTOPS computer. That server is 1,500, just under the level that would be regulated. And we do the high-technology stuff like keep the mail and send e-mail messages. I have even learned how to use it. That is how simple it is. 
With little benefit to national security, the first-degree amendment's proponents are preparing to deliver a serious blow to the American computer industry. With very little to show for it, the advocates of this amendment are advocating the subjection of the entire computer industry to a cumbersome bureaucratic process and a significant regulatory burden. Our competitors certainly will not be joining us in this effort. To the contrary. When they have concluded their celebration and breaking open the champagne bottles to celebrate their capture of this market, they will use this opportunity to leave our manufacturers in the dust. While perhaps our most dynamic industry is forced to comply with added regulatory obstacles, our competitors will be selling to our country's former customers. 
This amendment, Mr. President, is a blow because it is not regulating the sale of supercomputers. The technology we fear will be employed to upgrade weapons systems. The amendment actually regulates the sale of technology on the level of an office server or an office workstation, a tremendous market for our manufacturers. In a short period of time, this amendment will be regulating personal computers and we will be doing it by legislation that will have to be changed. You know how quickly we change things around here. Not that quickly. 
Many levels of technology far below that which pose national security risks will be subjected to this policy. Leadership in the computer industry is incredibly important to the prosperity of this country. We cannot afford to foreclose those markets. The disadvantage to our producers on the world market cannot be understated. The potential loss of U.S. jobs cannot be underestimated. And the risk to our leadership in the industry should not be jeopardized in this manner. 
I do not take lightly the reports of technology being diverted to unauthorized military users. This is a serious matter that requires our attention. That is why it is important to study the 1995 decontrol and evaluate its effectiveness. I believe that we will find that it was unlikely that these transfers could have been prevented and that they are an inevitable byproduct of the world market. 
But, should it be concluded that decontrol is a threat, corrective measures can and should be taken in a prompt fashion. They can be taken administratively. However, to backtrack today with a legislative enactment would be a mistaken rush to judgment and risks placing our companies at a significant competitive disadvantage. 
It has already been pointed out, and I believe the Senator from California has offered into the Record the opposition of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, the administration, and several of my colleagues. I note just one provision in the letter from our former colleague, the former Senator from Maine now the Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen. He says in that letter:  
I am a strong advocate for effective export controls. To be most effective, we must focus our limited export control resources on the export of goods and technologies that can make a significant difference for national security and nonproliferation reasons. 
Mr. President, that is the gist of this whole thing. We should not be focusing our efforts on things that are readily available commercially. I agree with the Secretary of Defense that we ought to concentrate our efforts on the true supercomputers and make sure that those, not office workstations, are kept out of the hands of potential adversaries. 
We need to be selling to countries like Israel workstations and office things, personal computers, that would, if the first-degree amendment were adopted, be subject to a lengthy licensing process. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the second-degree amendment of the chairman of the subcommittee, my friend from Minnesota. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to the Defense authorization bill to include authorization for funding construction of a National Guard readiness center. Military construction projects such as this will ensure that as we downsize our military, the facilities which house and service our military will not be left to deteriorate. Armories throughout the Nation need to be adequately maintained and upgraded to provide decent training facilities for the men and women assigned to units based at these armories and to protect the vital equipment stored there. In Macon, MO, there is a company of soldiers located in a facility owned by the city, which was constructed in the 1890's and is totally inadequate. In order to provide these soldiers with a facility capable of maintaining their proficiency in mission essential task training, I have requested funds adequate to complete such a facility. I also point out that it will be less expensive to create a new facility than to attempt to refurbish this 19th century structure.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in this budget agreement some of us thought there was too much spending and not enough tax relief. We find that there are even more spending proposals and less tax relief than we thought. This point of order is directed at spending on Amtrak in addition to other things. There is $2.3 billion being spent out of the tax cut section going to Amtrak. I join my colleague from Arizona in asking that these matters be referred to the authorization for Amtrak and urge that the point of order be sustained.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this bill I am introducing today is a bridge discretionary bill. We cannot forget in our reauthorization of the Nation's transportation policy the importance of maintaining our bridges. 
Missouri has approximately 23,000 bridges in total. 
Unfortunately, the State of Missouri, according to Department of Transportation statistics ranks sixth from the bottom on conditions of bridges in this country. This is a deplorable place for the State of Missouri to be. 
We must start taking better care of our roads and bridges and begin building roads for the 21st century--with new technologies, new materials, and better designs. 
According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials America must address the deficiencies of over 11,000 bridges per year just to maintain current levels of condition. 
According to the Department of Transportation, the cost to improve bridge conditions would require an annual investment of $8.9 billion. 
Let us not lose the hard-won gains in our transportation infrastructure. Let's not squander our investment. 
Postponing taking care of our bridge needs only means that our investment declines and to make repairs later will cost more. The cliche does say `Pay now or pay More later.' 
Taking care of our transportation infrastructure can be compared to taking care of your home. If you fail to fix the leaky roof, fail to re-paint, fail to adequately insulate, your costs increase and the value of your home declines. 
If we fail to maintain and reinvest in our Nation's bridges not only does the value of our investment decline, but lives are lost and our economic prosperity is jeopardized. 
I am pleased to work with my dear friend and House colleague, Congresswoman Emerson to introduce this bill in both Houses--the Safe Bridges Act of 1997. 
The Safe Bridges Act of 1997 is our marker to stress to our colleagues from around the country that bridges are an important and necessary component to this country's transportation system. 
Properly maintained and constructed bridges help save lives and provide for the efficient movement of people and goods in this country. 
If we want to secure our foundation--we must renew our investment.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of committee and the manager of the bill. 
Having been enlightened by quite a few minutes of debate on the floor, I asked for 2 additional minutes. 
First, I want to emphasize that what we are talking about here is a bipartisan bill. My friend from Massachusetts characterized it as a Republican bill. 
I particularly appreciated the kind comments by the Senator from Montana. As I listened to his praise of the measure, I was reminded of those immortal words of Mark Twain. When asked about the music of Wagner, he said, `It is not as bad as it sounds.' There was some of that in the praise that the Senator from Montana heaped upon this measure. I appreciate his support and his good words. 
When I listened to my colleague from Massachusetts, I found out why this music sounds so much better than the alternative because, Members of the Senate, I agree that we are looking for saving and protecting the working men and women of America, the small business owners. As chairman of the Small Business Committee, I have had the opportunity to listen to those people who are struggling to make a living for themselves and provide jobs for others through small business. 
I can tell you that after we dealt last year with some of the significant problems in regulatory reform, it was clear that the small businesses of America are overtaxed and overburdened by the Federal Government's desire for more money. They are the ones who are pulling the wagon. They are moving the economy. And they are paying the tariff for this Government. 
This measure, the bipartisan agreement reached between leaders of Congress and the President, provided that there would be spending reforms and that there would be tax reductions--tax reductions in the process of getting to a balanced budget. Those tax reductions are absolutely essential if we want to continue the dynamic engine that moves this country forward. 
I rise in strong opposition to the Daschle amendment because, No. 1, the Daschle amendment only provides $68.1 billion in net tax cuts-- 
a 20-percent reduction from the bipartisan plan. It goes back on the agreement reached between the leaders of Congress and the President on what we need to do to get this economy moving again. 
The Daschle plan provides $14 billion less to American families than the bipartisan plan would in the child tax credit. Families under it would only receive $350 per child instead of $500 per child, and children aged 13 and over would not even be eligible. 
The Daschle plan, moreover, is a bad deal for seniors. Seniors get about one-third of the capital gains realized in this country. They would have to pay 10 percent more in capital gains taxes under the Daschle scheme. 
But it is a particularly bad deal for small business owners and farmers. It contains less than half the death tax relief contained in the bipartisan plan, and on capital gains taxes, seniors, small business owners, farmers, and self-employed would pay 10 percent more. 
As I said, the Daschle plan is a deal-breaker. The Daschle plan is outside of the scope of the agreement under which we are working. 
Mr. President, in saying that, I want to emphasize that there is one important element which must and will be added to the measure pending before us. One of the top priorities for farmers, ranchers, truckdrivers, and small business men and women across this country is getting fairness in tax treatment of the money paid for health insurance premiums. For too long people who are self-employed have suffered because they have not gotten the same breaks that a large corporation or institution gets in being able to deduct 100 percent of what is paid for health insurance. 
Now, I fought long and hard in 1995, and I included an amendment in the Balanced Budget Act, unfortunately, vetoed by President Clinton, which would have increased the health insurance deduction for the self-employed to 50 percent from 25 percent. In 1996, I worked with Senator Kassebaum to include in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act an increase in the self-employed health insurance deduction incrementally to 80 percent. That is not far enough and that is not fast enough. Today, while the self-employed can deduct 40 percent of their health insurance costs, they are still not on a level playing field, and very few of them can wait until 2006 to get sick. 
The budget resolution reported out of the Budget Committee includes an amendment I offered that was cosponsored by every member of the Budget Committee present, which calls for a portion of the resources available in this legislation to be set aside for an immediate 100-percent deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed. As I said, it was cosponsored by all members, Democrat and Republican. 
Earlier this month, I originated a letter to the Senate Finance Committee urging full deductibility for the self-employed. That letter was signed by 53 Senators. I believe that is a majority. 
Now, an immediate deduction of 100 percent would make health insurance more affordable and accessible to some more than 5.1 million self-employed who lack health insurance, almost a quarter of the self-employed work force. In addition, full deductibility of health insurance by the self-employed will also help insure 1.4 million children who live in households headed by self-employed individuals. 
Coverage of these self-employed and their children through the self-employed health insurance deduction will enable the private sector to address these health care needs. I am proud to cosponsor the amendment put forward by my colleague and neighbor from Illinois, Senator Durbin, which would pay for the cost of this deductibility with a 10-cent increase in the tax on cigarettes. This is one way we can pay for this measure. We know that 3,000 children become regular smokers every day and start down that dangerous road at 13. By enacting this amendment, we cannot only pay for health insurance, we can provide a deterrent against children smoking and thus help save lives. In addition, the revenues raised will be used for a directly related purpose, reducing the cost of health care coverage for the self-employed and their families. 
Last week, with my colleague and neighbor from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, I introduced a measure, the Pregnant Mothers and Infants Health Protection Act, to set up a fund to discourage smoking among pregnant women and among parents with small children because of the tremendous impact of birth defects from smoking and because of the danger of SIDS for those who smoke. 
In any event, I believe that this amendment will improve the measure. I urge defeat of the Daschle amendment. The budget resolution calls for full deductibility of health insurance. I look forward to working with my colleagues to include that measure in the final bill as reported out. 
I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairman of the committee.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague and neighbor from Illinois. I commend him for his perseverance in being able to hold on to the floor. These are very difficult times and this is a very important amendment. I congratulate him on staying with it so we can bring this up and debate it while we have the attention of this body. 
I believe my experience in the State of Missouri is probably like the experience that most of us have had in our own States. As we travel around and talk to farmers, to people involved in small business, to truck drivers, day care operators, people who work for themselves, they ask an unanswerable question: Why is it that I can only deduct, now, 40 percent of what I pay in health insurance premiums for myself and my family when my neighbor next door who works for a large corporation, or in the country when my neighbor next door who works for a large corporate farm gets his or her health care paid and the employer deducts 100-percent of what they pay and they do not have to include any of the health insurance on their income tax? Why does the self-employed person only get to deduct 40 percent? 
Frankly, there is no answer, Mr. President. There is a gross inequity in this system. It is an inequity that has been pointed out by every farm organization in my State time and time again. It has been pointed out by organizations representing small business. 
At the conclusion of my remarks, I will enter in the Record a letter from the NFIB of June 26 expressing their strong support for the 100-percent deductibility for the amounts paid for health insurance for self-employed business owners. 
This is a matter of equity. This is a matter that is absolutely essential to see that the 5.1 million self-employed individuals in the country today have health insurance and the 1.3 million children who do not have health insurance and who live in a family headed by an entrepreneur, a self-employed business owner. 
This, to me, is not only an inequity, but it is a very bad policy outcome. We are talking about the health of children. One of the best things we can do is provide 100 percent deductibility. 
Mr. President, the reason I am here joining with my colleague from Illinois, we have pointed out in this tax relief bill, this tax reduction bill that is before the Senate now, with $85 billion in taxes, we have pointed out that this is one of the top priorities of small business and of farmers, of the struggling working middle class of America. 
Before the debate began, I circulated a letter signed by 52 of my colleagues, in addition, saying that this was important. Unfortunately, the three top small business priorities were excluded--the self-employed tax deduction for health care, the home office business deduction, and the independent contractor. This measure, unfortunately, is not in either the House or the Senate bill. We feel it is vitally important to put it there. I congratulate my colleague from Illinois in choosing the tobacco tax. Tobacco taxes are being raised in this bill. There is no more important place to put those taxes than this, guaranteeing health for self-employed and their children. 
In addition to the figures that my colleague from Illinois stated, about 3,000 children becoming regular smokers every day, last week when Senator Bumpers and I introduced a measure to encourage pregnant women to stop smoking, I pointed out that while tobacco use among most pregnant women is declining, tobacco usage among teenage pregnant women is on the increase. In my State it is 50 percent above the national average, and not surprisingly our birth-defect rate is 50 percent above the nationwide average. This will have an impact on discouraging teenagers from starting to smoke. It will help encourage pregnant women, particularly pregnant teenagers, to stop smoking. 
Mr. President, this is an important matter of equity. It is a matter of health care policy. I urge my colleagues to support what I know will be a required budget waiver so that this could be included.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to reform the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. There is, as I speak, a tribe that is attempting to move into the State of Missouri to build a large gambling casino. I do not believe the tribe is entitled to build this casino under the Indian gaming law, but while Secretary Babbitt has indicated he would consider our views in making his decision, he may rule in favor of the tribe and those who favor gambling. The only way to reverse his decision would be for Congress to change the law and I plan to start that process now. 
As my colleagues know, Mr. President, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act became law in 1988 to address the rapid growth of gambling on Indian tribal lands. The Supreme Court affirmed the sovereignty of Indian tribes and upheld their right to conduct gambling on their tribal lands, holding that such a right could only be abrogated by an act of Congress. Recognizing that it is the policy of the majority of the States to prohibit or drastically regulate gambling and recognizing that many of the citizens of these States regard gambling as morally repugnant, Congress passed the Indian Gambling Regulatory Act. 
The intent of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act is to balance tribal sovereignty with a State's interest in regulating and controlling gambling. The bill attempted to accomplish this by bringing parties to a mutual table to work out an agreement for regulating gambling on reservations consistent with State policy. But the spirit of the legislation is one of containment, to limit gambling and control its growth. IGRA pursues the objective by narrowly restricting the circumstances by which gaming can be conducted on land acquired by tribes after the date of passage of the statute, October 17, 1988. However, like many pieces of regulation, unforeseen circumstances arise, loopholes open and language proves to be too vague or obtusely drafted. Such is the case with IGRA. My legislation does not attempt to reopen or rewrite the bill, but it does attempt to address some of the legislative voids that affect my State and others. 
A first step for a tribe to conduct gaming on Indian land is to petition the Secretary of the Interior to have land taken into trust, this permits the tribe to benefit from the tax advantages afforded Indian tribes. While such trust petitions are under review by the Secretary, he is instructed to review the petition considering the best interests of both the tribe and the surrounding community. Furthermore, while such a petition is under review, elected officials have an opportunity to confront the Secretary with any concerns regarding gambling on that land or any objections that community members may hold regarding gambling. The statute, however, does not require the tribe to declare to the Secretary that land will be used for gambling. Furthermore, there is nothing in the statute that would prohibit a tribe from representing to the local community and the Secretary that land will be used for an unobjectionable purpose, only to begin using the land for gambling after it has been placed in trust. 
My legislation will require a tribe that is planning to begin conducting gambling on newly acquired tribal land to inform the Secretary during the trust application process that the land in question will in fact be used for gambling. Tribes with land held in trust that have not made such a declaration to the Secretary will be prohibited from using that land for gambling until such time as the tribe applies with the Secretary to have that land held in trust for the specific purpose of gambling. I believe this language will encourage the tribes to be open and upfront regarding their gambling plans for the trust land and is in the best interests of communities to be affected by gambling and in the best interests of the tribal-community relations. Communities that have serious concerns with the introduction of gambling to their neighborhoods will be given the 
opportunity to register their concerns with their elected officials and with the Secretary of the Interior. Tribes will also be disinclined to misrepresent their intentions or engage in any deceptive tactics to acquire land to begin or expand their gambling operations, which will go a long way to abating any suspicion between the tribes and the surrounding communities. 
This language also clarifies the language regarding tribes in the State of Oklahoma, a State where there is no tribal reservations, attempting to spread their gaming operations into a neighboring State. I believe such a practice was not foreseen by the original statute and is inconsistent with the spirit of that statute. Specifically, my legislation will permit an Oklahoma tribe to expand their gaming operations into a neighboring state, but only when the tribe is located in that State and the gaming will be conducted within the boundaries of a former reservation. My State is confronted with a situation where a tribe has purchased land reaching across the State border into Missouri and the tribe is attempting to use that recently purchased land to claim residency in Missouri for the purpose of the statute. To me, that is exploiting the loose drafting of a statutory language. I do not believe the tribe is located in Missouri as contemplated by the statute and, therefore, is not entitled to bring a casino into this Missouri community over the overwhelming objections of Missourians. My bill will make this section clear. 
Finally, the Indian Gaming statute authorizes tribes to conduct gaming on their reservations and other trust lands to the extent that gaming is permitted in that State. Such language is consistent with other Federal law by which tribes are subject to the criminal laws of the State but they are not subject to the regulations of the State. The Missouri constitution prohibits land-based gaming, gaming of this class may only be conducted on floating facilities on the Missouri River or Mississippi River. This prohibition was a popular referendum passed by the people of the State and the State legislature endorsed the objection to land-based gaming in a resolution. My legislation clearly states the Missouri Constitution contains a prohibition on land-based casinos and may not be interpreted in any way to permit class III land-based gaming. I might add that where a State has spoken so clearly--and the State constitution is certainly a clear statement of intent--I find it absurd that outsiders can just come in and do what the local people have said they oppose. 
Mr. President, my proposals are not an exhaustive list, but the statute has caused a situation in my State that this legislation will address. I understand that the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs will be pursuing a larger package of amendments to address the problems in the gaming laws. I encourage him to do so, I look forward to working with him and I encourage my colleagues to join us in this effort. I want to conclude by reiterating that Federal Indian gambling legislation is intended to control and contain Indian gambling. Unfortunately the legislation is riddled with loopholes that out-of-State gambling interests can exploit through tribes like the Eastern Shawnee to operate gambling parlors. The people of southwest Missouri do not want any kind of casino gambling and I am going to do everything I can do legislatively and through the regulatory process to stop it. 
I ask unanimous consent to include a copy of the bill and a brief question and answer in the Record.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mothers and Infants Health Protection Act on behalf of myself and Senator Bumpers. First, I express my sincere thanks to my colleagues in the Senate last week for having passed the Birth Defects Prevention Act. That act was a tremendous step forward in protecting the health of our Nation's most vulnerable population and in saving families from the economic and emotional hardships associated with birth defects. 
However, we must keep moving forward. After having had numerous discussions with the Centers for Disease Control and child advocacy organizations about the adverse birth outcomes and infant health problems connected with smoking during and after pregnancy, I decided we would introduce this legislation here today to carry the next step in our battle against birth defects. 
The main purpose of the measure introduced today is to provide surveillance, research, and services aimed at the prevention and cessation of smoking, both during and after pregnancy. The CDC, along with the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, is meeting today here in Washington to highlight that although the overall smoking rate for pregnant women is slowly declining, the smoking rate for pregnant teens is increasing. That is bad news. For black teenagers specifically, the rate rose 6 percent, the first increase since this information first became available in 1989. And even with this increase, smoking rates for white teenagers are still four to five times the rate for black teenagers. Furthermore, the smoking rate for those between the ages of 15 and 24 is 23 percent higher than the smoking rate among all pregnant women. 
In my home State of Missouri, this public health program is even more dramatic: 20 percent of all pregnant women in Missouri admit to smoking. This is 44 percent higher than the national average. This, unfortunately, may be connected to the fact that our incidence of birth defects and infant mortality is 50 percent higher than the national average. 
The consequences of smoking during and after pregnancy are downright horrifying. Recent studies show that this activity is a problem. Increases in maternal and fetal risk causes 20 to 30 percent of low birth rates and 10 percent of fetal and infant deaths in the United States. 
Smoking triples the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Smoking elevates the risk of a child being born with a birth defect. Smoking increases the risk of spontaneous abortion, premature rupture of membranes, and the delivery of a stillborn infant. Smoking may impede the growth of a fetus and increase the likelihood of mental retardation by 50 percent, and smoking increases the risk of respiratory illness in infants and children. 
Adding to this devastating problem, the proportion of women who quit smoking during pregnancy but then relapse at 6 months postpartum is nearly 63 percent, thereby exposing their infants to passive smoke and increasing their risk for SIDS and other health-related problems. 
These are just a few of the problems related to smoking during and after pregnancy. But in addition to the risks for the fetus and infant, smoking is associated with a wide variety of hazards for pregnant women, such as infertility and ectopic pregnancy. 
There is no question that smoking during and after pregnancy is a compelling public health problem. These facts clearly underscore the necessity for smoking prevention and cessation programs aimed specifically for pregnant women. This legislation aims to reverse these devastating outcomes on several fronts. 
First, the CDC is directed to foster coordination between all governmental levels, other public entities, and private voluntary organizations that conduct or support prenatal and postnatal smoking research, prevention, and surveillance. 
Second, the bill provides grants to state and local health departments, community health centers, other public entities, and non-profit organizations for the development of community-based public awareness campaigns aimed at the prevention and cessation of smoking during and after pregnancy. 
Third, monies would be made available to the groups just mentioned for the purpose of coordinating and conducting basic and applied research concerning prenatal and postnatal smoking and its effects on fetuses and newborns. 
Fourth, the bill calls for a procedure for the dissemination of effective prevention and cessation strategies and the diagnostic criteria for infants suffering the effects of exposure to intrauterine and passive tobacco smoke to health care professionals. 
Finally, this measure authorizes a modest appropriation of $10 million to achieve these goals. 
Similar to the Birth Defects Prevention Act, this is another stride in improving the health of our children and in reducing infant mortality and morbidity. 
Fetuses, newborns, and children are too vulnerable and cannot protect themselves. We must therefore have a coordinated effort among government, nonprofit groups and local communities to get the message out on the devastating outcomes associated with pre and post natal smoking as well as information on effective prevention and cessation opportunities. 
Again, it is important to note that overall, fewer pregnant women are smoking now that they know the health risks for themselves and for their babies. The bad news is that not everyone has gotten the message--in particular those between the ages of 15 and 24. They are moving directly against the trend. 
This is the generation coming up; and these women are likely to go on having more children. If they are smoking more, that does not bode well for their future health, or for that of their children. 
Many people still do not understand that there is a link between adverse birth outcomes and prenatal and postnatal smoking. Part of the reason is that not all women have adequate access to prenatal care. 
Thus, it is my firm belief that this legislation will ensure that all mothers will receive information on the potential tragedies of smoking during and after pregnancy and the much needed assistance in quitting their habit.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure that would provide for certain military retirees a special Medicare part B enrollment period during which the late enrollment penalty is waived. 
Major changes in the Department of Defense's [DOD] health care delivery system, including the introduction of a managed care program called TRICARE and the closing or downsizing of many military medical facilities, have hindered access to health care services for older military retirees, or those aged 65 and over. It is important to note that the TRICARE Program was designed for active duty and CHAMPUS eligible beneficiaries and the overall intent is for those aged 65 and older to receive their health care through the Medicare Program. 
Many of our country's military retirees moved close to bases in order to receive care from these facilities. Due to the fact that they had medical services available on base, before the implementation of TRICARE and base closures, many of these retirees did not sign up for medicare part B. Once their access was restricted, many elected to choose part B after the enrollment period expired and were therefore slapped with a penalty for signing up late. Others chose not to sign up at all because they were unable to afford the late enrollment penalty. 
Thus, waiving the part B penalty for those retirees who dedicated their lives to serving our country is a matter of justice. There was no way that military retirees could have anticipated the changes that have occurred within the DOD's health care delivery system. 
Further, these changes were completely out of their control. 
Mr. President, the Senate must act now. This measure rectifies the unfairness inherent in the Medicare part B penalty on certain military retirees and honors our Nation's commitment to those individuals who selflessly served our country through many years of military service. I look forward to the Senate's consideration of this proposal.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an extremely important and successful medical facility, Truman Medical Center East--Truman East--Kansas City, MO. On Friday, June 20, 1997, a special dedication will be held in honor of the new Truman East Care Center and ambulatory/emergency services renovation/expansion project. 
Truman East has been serving residents of eastern Jackson County since the mid-1800's and continues to meet the challenges of this growing area. 
Truman East is primarily a teaching institution for the University of Missouri--Kansas City School of Health Sciences. It contains the department of family and community medicine along with the large family practice residency program which provides primary care. In addition, Truman East manages the Jackson County Health Department in Independence, MO. It has an extensive gerontology fellowship which provides excellent opportunities for the elderly to enhance the quality of daily life. 
One of the biggest improvements to the facility is the replacement of a 212-room long term care residency with a state-of-the-art facility. The older buildings, from 1908 and 1930, have been converted into offices in order to keep the renovations cost effective. Students and health care professionals alike will benefit from these expansions and improvements of the Truman East facility. 
It is a great privilege to honor this high caliber medical facility. I know that Truman East will continue to improve and grow for years to come. The State of Missouri is lucky to have such a facility and I want to express my sincere appreciation to everyone who makes Truman East excel.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes of the Senate's time to discuss an issue of great importance to the self-employed throughout the country, that of making health insurance more affordable. 
Nearly 1.4 million children who live in families headed by a mother or father who is self-employed do not have health insurance. If you work for yourself, typically health insurance is very expensive for both you and your family. 
Congress has an opportunity to make it more affordable for families who work for themselves by treating them fairly under the Tax Code. 
Currently, large corporations can deduct 100 percent of their share of the employee's health care costs, while the self-employed farmer, child care provider, or truck driver can only deduct 40 percent. That is totally unfair. 
It is time that Congress changed the law to allow the self-employed to deduct the full cost of health care premiums. Last year, we worked with Senator Kassebaum to move the deductibility up gradually to 80 percent of the premiums by the year 2006. 
That is a great start. Most families cannot afford to wait until the year 2006 to get sick. We want that health care deductibility. That is part of the Home Based Business Fairness Act that is also very important in small business. 
On Tuesday, Senator Durbin and I sent a letter to the Senate Finance Committee that was signed by 53 Senators, a majority of the Senate, urging them to set aside the money to provide 100-percent health care deductibility. And we truly hope that they will. 
We are confident that with this broad support we can make health insurance more affordable for the families who depend upon the earnings of a self-employed father or mother. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has chosen finally to address this often overlooked but very compelling health care problem in the United States. 
We have been working with the March of Dimes and with colleagues on both sides of the aisle since 1992 to deal with one of the most serious and compelling health care problems in America today. Many people are not aware that birth defects affect over 3 percent of all births in America, and they are the leading cause of infant death. 
This year alone, approximately 150,000 babies will be born with a serious birth defect, resulting in 1 out of every 5 infant deaths. 
Among the babies who survive, birth defects are a leading cause of lifelong disability. Medical care, special education, and many other services are often required into adulthood, costing families thousands of dollars each year. 
Let me share with you an experience I had when I was Governor of Missouri. In the early 1970's, I appropriated dollars to fund the high-cost, but highly effective, neonatal care units at our hospitals. 
These remarkable institutions and the dedicated men and women who serve there do a tremendous job of saving low-birth-weight babies and babies with severe birth defects. But it is not enough. As I talked to the people and congratulated them on the great work they were doing, they said, `Why don't we do something to reduce the incidence of birth defects and the problems that bring these tiniest of infants to these very high-tech specialized care units?' 
And despite the large number of babies born with and dying from birth defects, we do not even know what causes most defects or where they are even occurring. 
An unfortunate situation in Texas a few years ago exemplifies how the lack of a birth defects prevention and surveillance strategy delayed the response to an outbreak of birth defects and may have needlessly cost innocent lives. At least 30 infants in south Texas were born without or with little brain tissue over a short period of time. 
Because Texas did not have a birth defects surveillance system, and because our country did not have a comprehensive birth defects prevention and surveillance strategy, the severity of the problem was not recognized until the incidence of birth defects was so high that it was difficult to miss. 
To avoid tragedies such as this from reoccurring, there is something that we can do here today. 
Passage of the Birth Defects Prevention Act will prioritize our efforts and make Congressional intent clear--more resources should be directed for the prevention of the leading killer of babies, birth defects.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to join my distinguished colleague, Senator Domenici, in introducing the Women's Business Centers Act of 1997. I appreciate the kind words, but Senator Domenici has long been the leading proponent of women-owned businesses. He has worked hard to secure the additional funding for the centers. I am delighted to work with him on the bill. 
Also I am very pleased that my ranking member on the Small Business Committee, Senator Kerry, and many of our colleagues are working together with Senator Domenici and us as original cosponsors of the bill. 
I think once again this is an opportunity for Congress to demonstrate its strong support for effective programs serving current and future women entrepreneurs. It was just 1 year ago that many of my colleagues will remember that the administration sought to zero out the budget for women's business demonstration sites, and Congress stepped in to ensure full funding. Now we are reaching for new heights--making the program an ongoing effort to fund women's business centers through 5-year grants. 
The Committee on Small Business began its work in this session of Congress with the cooperation of my ranking member at a hearing on women-owned and home-based businesses. I will talk more about that in just a few moments. But the hearing we held then and others has provided the committee with extensive testimony and letters of endorsement on the important economic contribution being made by women entrepreneurs and the role played by women business centers. With nearly 8 million firms owned by women--a third of all firms--and 18.5 million people are employed by women-owned firms, which is 1 of 4 working men and women in the U.S., the contribution of women-owned businesses to the economy, which includes nearly $2.3 trillion in sales, deserves recognition and encouragement. 
In my home State of Missouri, there are approximately 120,000 women-owned businesses. And, in 1997, the recipient of the Avon Women of Enterprise Award is Georgia Buchanan, president and CEO of All Pro Construction in Grandview, MO. In 1995, Georgia's company was also recognized by the SBA as the National Minority Construction Firm of the Year. 
Last year, Missouri's entrepreneurs were recognized as well when Phyllis Hannan, owner of Laser Mark It and Laser Light Technologies, was named SBA's National Small Businessperson of the Year. 
We have other women business leaders, including Carol Jones, of Springfield, who operates a large and well-respected realty company, in addition to her civic work and service on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and Stella Olson, who is serving as a member of the Small Business Fairness Board for SBA region 7 and is the owner of STAT Enterprises, Inc., a transcription company. 
These women are all local success stories taking an active role in expanding their own businesses with management financing and market training necessary for its success. 
The Women's Business Centers Act of 1997 recognizes the important contributions made by the 53 women's business centers located in 28 States. The bill increases the level of funding authorized for establishing additional women's business centers to $8 million per year for 3 years, double when compared to the current authorization of $4 million per year. The Clinton administration's budget request for fiscal year 1998 is $4 million. Significantly, the additional funding is intended to ensure that women's business centers exist in all 50 States. 
Other important provisions of this bill include allowing Centers receiving funds on the day prior to enactment to apply to extend their eligibility for funding for 2 additional years. Also, for all women's business centers receiving funds under this bill, the private sector match is structured to facilitate a smoother transition to self-sufficiency. The program is designed to provide seed money for women's business centers that can then flourish with the financial support of the local community. Training and services are to be tailored to the local community, and the grantees running the centers must have the requisite experience and commitment to deliver the services suited to women in the area. 
The introduction of this bill coincides with the work of the Committee on Small Business to reauthorize the programs of the Small Business Administration, the SBA. The committee has supported the creation and expansion of business development centers dedicated to the unique needs of women who are either current or potential business owners. The women's business centers created under this bill will provide the tried and true ongoing training and assistance, offered by the current demonstration sites, to ensure that their clients have the skills and know-how to build and maintain successful businesses. 
This is a win-win bill. It provides women owning businesses or those women preparing to start new small businesses with the tools necessary to support their transition and the challenges faced when trying to expand. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance this bill as part of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. The concepts endorsed today will be incorporated with other reforms so that the services delivered by SBA and its numerous resource partners are beneficial to men and women alike. The committee has important work to do in this regard, and we appreciate Senator Domenici and Representative Johnson's efforts in this regard.

I have the responsibility for the subcommittee that appropriates money for FEMA. I wonder--as has been made clear on the floor, the emergency money is now flowing. There is money --$2 billion in FEMA--that is going for the immediate needs right now. So there is money which can be paid out right now prior to the issuance of the completion of plans and assessments being available.

I guess it is the understanding of the majority leader that they are at least 2 weeks away from getting the damage assessments. The State has to have a plan submitted and approved by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Dollars then go to the State from FEMA and from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Is it the clear understanding that this is a long process which is not being held up during this day or tomorrow, but the money is needed, and we will provide it? But the time required to get the plans in place still has not been completed.

Birth Defects Prevention Act, which would deal with a very serious problem of 150,000 babies being born each year with birth defects in this country. We would like to go to it. 
It is my understanding that, even if there were no other measure on the floor, the supplemental appropriations bill would have to come over from the House. There is no reason to filibuster or delay the Birth Defects Prevention Act, because taking care of this bill this afternoon will in no way delay the disaster. It will deal with the disaster of birth defects which we can deal with today without slowing down any supplemental emergency appropriations.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, in introducing legislation to ensure that the Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service does not usurp the power to tax--a power solely vested in Congress by the U.S. Constitution. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act will ensure that the duly elected representatives of the people, who are accountable to the electorate for our actions, will have discretion to exercise the power to tax. This legislation is intended to curb the ability of the Treasury Department to bypass Congress by proposing a tax increase without the authorization or consent of Congress. 
The Stealth Tax Prevention Act builds on legislation passed unanimously by the Senate just over 1 year ago. As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I authored the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act--better known as the Red Tape Reduction Act--to ensure that small businesses are treated fairly in agency rulemaking and enforcement activities. Subtitle E of the Red Tape Reduction Act provides that a final rule issued by a Federal agency and deemed a major rule by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget cannot go into effect for at least 60 days. This delay is to provide Congress with a window during which it can review the rule and its impact, allowing time for Congress to consider whether a resolution of disapproval should be enacted to strike down the regulation. To become effective, the resolution must pass both the House and Senate and be signed into law by the President or enacted as the result of a veto override. 
The bill Senator Shelby and I introduce today amends this law to provide that any rule issued by the Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service that will result in a tax increase--any increase--will be deemed a major rule by OIRA and, consequently, not go into effect for at least 60 days. This procedural safeguard will ensure that the Department of the Treasury and its Internal Revenue Service cannot make an end-run around Congress, as it is currently attempting with the stealth tax it proposed on January 13. 
As my colleagues are aware, the IRS has issued a proposal that is tantamount to a tax increase on businesses structured as limited liability companies. The IRS proposal disqualifies a taxpayer from being considered as a limited partner if he or she `participates in the partnership's trade or business for more than 500 hours during a taxable year' or is involved in a `service' partnership, such as lawyers, accountants, engineers, architects, and health-care providers. 
The IRS alleges that its proposal merely interprets section 1402(a)(13) of the Tax Code, providing clarification, when in actuality it is a tax increase by regulatory fiat. Under the IRS proposal, disqualification as a limited partner will result in a tax increase on income from both capital investments as well as earnings of the partnership. The effect will be to add the self-employment tax--12.4 percent for social security and 2.9 percent for Medicare--to income from investments 
as well as earnings for limited partners that under current rules can exclude such income from the self-employment tax. 
Under the bill introduced today, the tax increase proposed by the Internal Revenue Service of the Treasury Department, if later issued as a final rule, could not go into effect for at least 60 days following its publication in the Federal Register. This window, which coincides with issuance of a report by the Comptroller General, would allow Congress the opportunity to review the rule and vote on a resolution to disapprove the tax increase before it is applied to a single taxpayer. 
The Stealth Tax Prevention Act strengthens the Red Tape Reduction Act and the vital procedural safeguards it provides to ensure that small businesses are not burdened unnecessarily by new Federal regulations. Congress enacted the 1966 provisions to strengthen the effectiveness of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, a law which had been ignored too often by Government agencies, especially the Internal Revenue Service. Three of the top recommendations of the 1995 White House Conference on Small Business sought reforms to the way Government regulations are developed and enforced, and the Red Tape Reduction Act passed the Senate without a single dissenting vote on its way to being signed into law last year. Despite the inclusion of language in the 1996 amendments that expressly addresses coverage of IRS interpretative rules, we find ourselves faced again with an IRS proposal that was not issued in compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act. 
As 18 of my Senate colleagues and I advised Secretary Rubin in an April letter, the proposed IRS regulation on limited partner taxation is precisely the type of rule for which a regulatory flexibility analysis should be done. Although, on its face, the rulemaking seeks merely to define a limited partner or to eliminate uncertainty in determining net earnings from self-employment, the real effect of the rule would be to raise taxes by executive fiat and expand substantially the spirit and letter of the underlying statute. The rule also seeks to impose on small businesses a burdensome new recordkeeping and collection of information requirement that would affect millions of limited partners and members of limited liability companies. The Treasury's IRS proposes this stealth tax increase with the knowledge that Congress declined to adopt a similar tax increase in the Health Security Act proposed in 1994--a provision that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 1994 would have resulted in a tax increase of approximately $500 million per year. 
The Stealth Tax Prevention Act would remove any incentive for the Treasury Department to underestimate the cost imposed by an IRS proposed or final rule in an effort to skirt the administration's regulatory review process or its obligations under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. By amending the definition of major rule under the Congressional Review Act, which is subtitle E of the Red Tape Reduction Act, we ensure that an IRS rule that imposes a tax increase will be a major rule, whether or not it has an estimated annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000. Our amendment does not change the trigger for a regulatory flexibility analysis, which still will be required if a proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. We believe the heightened scrutiny of IRS regulations called for by this legislation will provide an additional incentive for the Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service to meet all of its procedural obligations under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and the Red Tape Reduction Act. 
I urge my colleagues to join Senator Shelby and me in supporting this important legislation to ensure that the IRS not usurp the proper role of Congress--nor skirt its obligations to identify the impact of its proposed and final rules. Rules such as that currently proposed by the IRS should be carefully scrutinized by Congress. When the Department of the Treasury issues a final IRS rule that increases taxes, Congress should have the ability to exercise its discretion to enact a resolution of disapproval before the rule is applicable to a single taxpayer. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act Senator Shelby and I introduce today provides that opportunity.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Bryan in introducing the Common Cents Stock Pricing Act of 1997. I thank Senator Bryan for his leadership in this measure. As he indicated in his comments, we worked together through three sessions of Congress to pass the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Numerous members of staff came and went while we were trying to get this commonsense consumer measure passed, and I only hope, as he indicated, that we will not have a similar 6-year battle on this one, because I think the bill is very simple, very straightforward, and reflects common sense. It calls for the markets to get on in the business of trading in plain numbers, dollars and cents, instead of fractions. 
The Common Cents Stock Pricing Act will make stock prices easier to understand for the average small investor. It will also force stock dealers to compete in pennies, which should result in lower transaction costs and investor savings. 
Our Nation's stock markets use pricing methodologies which date back to the 18th century, when colonies used Spanish dollars as their currency. Traders would chisel these ancient coins into `pieces of eight' or `bits' and use them to purchase commodities. When organized stock trading began in New York in 1792, stock prices were quoted in bits, or eighths. 
Mr. President, 200 years later, the time has come to move beyond this pricing system. We don't use Spanish coins today, we don't use bits, and we don't need confusing price systems. 
The pricing system based on ancient coins is not only out of date, but it is difficult for the average investor to understand. At least one newspaper has recognized this fact. The San Francisco Chronical recently began printing its tables in dollars and cents, instead of fractions. Others, including the Boston Globe and USA Today have called on the stock exchanges to move to a penny pricing system. 
Small investors also stand to benefit financially from the move to pricing by the penny rather than by the bit. SEC Commissioner Steve Wallman estimates investors lose a minimum of $1.5 billion a year under the current system. Other experts put the figure in the $4 to $9 billion range. 
Let me just explain why small investors lose in the current environment. Stock exchange rules effectively limit the minimum spread between a stock's buy-and-sell price to one-eighth of a dollar, or 12.5 cents. This means that floor traders earn at least 12.5 cents from investors on every trade. Large investor institutions can get better deals on their trades by negotiating prices on block trades, but the average small investor has to pay the full fare. 
Penny stock pricing is also in step with the rest of the world. The U.S. is the only major market that trades in eighths; every other country uses decimal pricing. If we are going to maintain our role as the dominant player in world markets, the U.S. must keep pace and move to a system of decimal pricing. 
The bill we are introducing today is straightforward. It simply calls on the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate a rule, within 1 year after the enactment date of the legislation, to transition the stock and option markets away from fractionalized trading, bits trading, into dollars and cents pricing. 
I think the bill is an appropriate way for the Government to regulate financial markets. The Common Cents Stock Pricing Act does not micromanage the markets by dictating what the spread will be. The competition and the markets will determine the spread. The implementation of the SEC will allow competitive forces to decide what the spread will be. 
Let me close by saying I also noted the New York Stock Exchange announcement has been made that it will begin trading in sixteenths and eventually in decimals. I commend Senator Bryan and the sponsors of the companion House legislation, because their bill was cited as one of the reasons that the New York Stock Exchange was moving forward. I plan to review the language to ensure that their efforts clearly commit them to move to decimals, and that other exchanges will move to decimals. We need to do so in a reasonable timeframe and not wait until the forecasted computer crisis of the year 2000, when all of the computers go back to 1900. 
Big investors get good deals every day in negotiating stock trade prices. I think it is time for the average investor to get a good deal too. I encourage my colleagues to join me in making sure average investors are treated equitably. I thank my colleague from Nevada for his work on this issue, and I encourage and invite other Members of the Senate to join us in supporting this bill.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho. I commend him on the work he does in forestry, an area in which I have great interest. We have seen tremendous developments in this area. Agri-forestry and many related concepts are very important new ways in which we cannot only benefit our environment, but maintain profitable revenue-producing opportunities for landowners, and we think that updating the law is very important. 
I look forward to working with my colleague. I appreciate his leadership.

Mr. BOND. This editorial outlines succinctly the issues facing the National Guard in the debate surrounding its force structure and its very future. I have said before and reiterate now in the strongest of terms, that rather than bill payer, the Guard's role should be vibrant, viable, and adequately funded by the Department of Defense. 
National Guard units from every State are, today, involved in operations domestically in their State roles, and globally in their national role. Recently, units from my home State have been involved in missions in accordance with United States directives in Bosnia, Hungary, the Persian Gulf, and continue to serve our interests there. Units from States which have experienced natural disasters have traditionally been the `Cavalry to the rescue.' Even the U.S. Air Force was a recipient of the National Guard's professional response when and A-10 aircraft which had crashed in a remote area was initially discovered by a National Guard Team involved in the search. 
With the fiscal constraints being imposed on our military force while simultaneously increasing their roles and missions, we need the Guard now, more than ever. We need it to be trained, we need it to be well equipped, and we need it funded. 
Mr. President I call upon all Senators to join with me and Senator Ford along with the other members of the National Guard Caucus in a pledge to insure the robust nature of the National Guard, a service from which we ask so much.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an exceptional small business person and fellow Missourian: Marilyn Moore. Marilyn recently received the Small Business Administration's [SBA] 1997 Small Business Person of the Year Award for Missouri. As chairman of the Committee on Small Business, it is exciting for me to congratulate such a respected and dedicated leader from my home State of Missouri. 
The SBA honors one small business person from each State at national ceremonies during Small Business Week, June 1-7. These small business owners are acknowledged for their achievements and contributions to the Nation's economy. SBA uses several criteria to select the small business person from each State, these include; staying power, growth in number of employees, increase in sales and/or unit volume, current and past financial reports, innovative product or service, response to adversity, and evidence of contributions by the nominee to aid the community. The small businesses are nominated by trade associations, chambers of commerce, and business organizations. The SBA then selects from each State the business it feels has best met all of the criteria. 
Missouri's representative, Marilyn Moore, is president of TeamRehab, Inc., located in Clayton, MO. Her company is dedicated to providing therapy services to physically challenged individuals. TeamRehab uses physical, occupational, and speech therapy to help these individuals, and its services extend to more than 35 nursing home facilities, outpatient clinics, and home health agencies in the greater St. Louis metropolitan area and southern Illinois. TeamRehab was established in 1982 with two employees, and since that time has grown to more than 135 employees. TeamRehab is committed to quality care as demonstrated by its mission to enhance the quality of life and dignity of our clients. 
Marilyn's work in the St. Louis community is exemplary, and not only have TeamRehab's clients benefited from her work, but so have her employees. Marilyn is known for her fairness and commitment to a team effort. Her commitment to this team has proven successful as she continues to help her clients strive to remain as self-sufficient as possible. 
Abraham Lincoln stated `Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other one thing.' TeamRehab's success and accomplishments are testimony to her resolve. She is a role model for all small business owners and I congratulate Marilyn Moore for this well-deserved honor.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this past April 28, 1997, the Missouri and New Jersey Exercise Tiger Associations, in conjunction with Veterans of Foreign War Post 280 of Columbia, MO recognized a group of heroic men. Until recently, few people knew of the secret operation code named `Exercise Tiger,' because the details of the tragedy were not disclosed until after the Battle of Normandy and even then proper recognition was not given. 
In December 1943, several training operations began in order to prepare for the Battle of Normandy. These operations, organized by the United States Army, were undertaken off a beach in Devon, England. It was known by all participating parties the dangers they could encounter. At the time, several German ships patrolled this stretch of water looking for American and English ships. One such evening during practice operations, with only one English ship to guard, there was a surprise attack on the American ships. 
On April 28, 1944, the German Navy `E' boats, patrolling the English Channel, attacked the Eight American tank landing ships who became aware of the attack only after the U.S.S. LST-507 was struck by an incoming torpedo. Next, the U.S.S. LST-531 was attacked and sunk in a matter of minutes. The convoy returned fire and the last ship to be torpedoed, the U.S.S. LST-289, valiantly struggled to reach Dartmouth Harbor. 
Even after this frightening turn of events, to its credit, Exercise Tiger continued operations and remained on schedule. Normandy was attacked as planned and the D-day invasion was a success. 
Information of the fatalities was not released until after the D-day invasion due to the secrecy of the mission and in order to keep the Germans from becoming aware of the impending strike. It took many years, and the passage of the Freedom of Information Act, to learn of the significance of these missions. I feel now is the time for these courageous men to get the long-awaited recognition they deserve. 
Four thousand men participated in this operation and of those, nearly a quarter were killed in action. Records from the Department of Defense estimate 749 men died consisting of 551 Army and 198 Navy casualties. Of Tiger's death toll, 201 men were from the 3206th quartermaster company in my home State of Missouri. 
This Memorial Day weekend commemorates the heroic actions of the men who participated in Exercise Tiger and particularly the ones who lost their lives in this crucial preparation for the D-day invasion. The Exercise Tiger Associations and VFW Post 280 have the great privilege of being first in the State of Missouri to recognize these brave individuals. 
In the words of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, `Old soldiers never die, they just fade away * * *' I hope that through this long delayed acknowledgment of these fine soldiers, their memory will not fade away, but will remain in our minds and hearts for years to come. These men were an example for all American soldiers to live by and a credit to the United States as it remains the free and great country that it is today.

 Mr. BOND. Mr President, during the past few weeks we have all heard disturbing news coming forth from the territories under Palestinian Authority control. 
The idea that Chairman Arafat even hinted of his support much less, his embrace of a policy to sanction the assassination of his own people for selling real estate to Jews is abhorrent and beyond the pale. 
That individuals were actually murdered because of this policy should serve as a wake-up notice to those who attempt to push the principals into agreements before they are ready. 
We also have been appraised of the situation facing Mr. Daoud Kuttab, a United States citizen, who during the exercise of his right under Palestinian Authority rule, was arrested for complaining about the jamming of his radio station which was broadcasting the legislative council session of the Palestinian Authority. This activity, much like C-SPAN, I believe, is a core freedom of a democratic government. An American citizen, holding a Jerusalem identity card, as Mr. Kuttab does, is exempted from jurisdiction of the PA. 
The road to democracy is not an easy one. It is filled with what may seem to be impossible impasses, but they are not. The right of a free press to operate and the right of free speech and the right of an individual to dispose of his own property in a free and legitimate manner are core to a democratic state. 
I call upon the President of the United States to reiterate to Mr. Arafat, our Nation's commitment to those freedoms and our inability to accept anything less than a full compliance with those freedoms or face the withdrawal of our continued support. I also call upon the President to voice through appropriate channels, our condemnation of the policies and resulting actions which we have seen occur in the recent weeks in the areas under Palestinian Authority jurisdiction. 
While I am firmly committed to the principle that the United States remain a neutral and honest mediator, I must speak up when those very principles for which we stand and for which the parties claim to be attempting to achieve are ignored and violated flagrantly. 
I hope that President Clinton will be forthcoming with some initiative to address these and other issues such as the revocation of the clauses calling for the destruction of Israel within its charter, and that we hold the Palestinian Authority responsible for implementing democratic ideals which will be critical to a strong and vibrant Palestinian Government.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is easy to take for granted the freedom we have here, in the United States, and too often we lose sight of that and resort to complaining about one thing or another, but the fact is, we live in the most blessed Nation in the world, we enjoy the greatest freedom of choice, we enjoy so much, but those freedoms were purchased and protected at a very high cost. 
As we prepare to celebrate Memorial Day this year, I call upon my fellow Missourians and all Americans to pause and remember the sacrifice of our soldiers, sailors, Marines, and air men and women stationed around the world today protecting us with a blanket weaved with the battle flags from places with names like Lexington, Concord, Gettysburg, Belleau Wood, Pearl Harbor, Coral Sea, Iwo Jima, Saint Lo, Bastogne, Chosin Reservoir, Khe Sahn, Beirut, Wadi Al-Batin, and Medina Ridge in Iraq and most recently, those taken from us in Somalia and by the brutal and cowardly bombing of Kobart Towers. 
We must remember the sacrifices of those who came before us, and those whom we most recently lost--the fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters who gave their most precious of gifts, their lives, that we might continue to enjoy the freedoms we hold so dear. 
We must remember them so we will focus our determination, as a nation, that we never, ever, waste a life because it is too hard or too expensive to do the right thing. We must take this opportunity to re-dedicate ourselves to make that effort and to ensure that our military personnel are the best trained, equipped and prepared in the world, because we ask so much of them.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss a sense of the Senate amendment on behalf of myself, Senators Murray, Gorton, Ashcroft, and Hutchison, which simply states that `careful study must be made of the impact of Medicaid disproportionate share hospital, or DSH, reform proposals on children's health and on vital sources of care including children's hospitals.' 
It is our strong belief, and the sense of the Senate indicates, that any restrictions on DSH funding should not harm Medicaid coverage of children and pregnant women. 
While I recognize and strongly support the need to control Federal spending, I am deeply concerned about the impact of billions of dollars in new Medicaid DSH spending reductions. 
I know that my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, can point to some States in which there may be disagreements about how the DSH payments were used. I don't say that there has been the same kind of usage of Medicaid disproportionate share payments in other States as there has been in Missouri. 
But I do know from our standpoint that since 1981 the Medicaid DSH Program has enabled hospitals who provide care to a disproportionate share of low-income people to serve as a safety net for those with little or no access to health care. 
In Missouri, the DSH Program has been a key variable in expanding health care coverage to thousands of pregnant women and children. More than a quarter of a million, more than 250,000, people have been served as a result of the DSH payments. 
These payments have enabled my home State to successfully reduce the number of uninsured Missourians by enrolling them. It has improved access to health care services for those who remain uninsured. 
In addition to using DSH funds appropriately, our State of Missouri also uses them efficiently. 
For Federal Medicaid benefits plus DSH payments per beneficiary: The national average is $2,454; in Missouri the figure is $2,288 versus the national average of $2,454. 
Overall Medicaid spending in Missouri is also below the national average. A recent report by the Kaiser Commission illustrates the efficiency of the Missouri program. Missouri spends $3,190 annually per Medicaid enrollee compared to the national average of $3,290. 
Yet, reductions in the Federal DSH payments would be devastating for Missouri, a State which has used its Federal DSH dollars in an efficient, effective, and appropriate manner. 
Anywhere from 56,000 to 348,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in Missouri could lose health coverage if the DSH reforms that have been publicized are enacted, and there is no compensating source of revenue funding for them. 
President Clinton's proposal specifically would eliminate Medicaid benefits for 162,000 Missourians. 
This is simply the wrong approach. Reducing DSH payments does not focus on cutting the fat in the Medicaid Program. Instead, it cuts crucial health care benefits for low-income pregnant women and children whose lives depend upon this critical coverage. 
Yes, Congress should increase State Medicaid flexibility, as this budget resolution calls for. But we should not target DSH funding--funding which has allowed many States to expand health care coverage to our Nation's most vulnerable population. 
Again, I reiterate that this resolution fully recognizes and supports the need for a balanced Federal budget. At the same time it guarantees that when working out the details of achieving Medicaid savings, Congress will have sufficient information to ensure that reforms in disproportionate share payments will not threaten low-income pregnant women and children, as well as providers of health care such as children's hospitals, public hospitals, and other safety net hospitals. 
I look forward to working with the Finance Committee in the coming months regarding this issue, and I am confident that we can structure a plan that takes into consideration the health of our most vulnerable citizens.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I must start by saying that this is not an ISTEA amendment, this is not a formula amendment, this is not a 4.3 cents amendment, this is not an Amtrak amendment, this is not an off-budget amendment. 
This is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment concerning reestablishing the linkage between the revenues deposited in the highway trust fund and transportation spending. 
Mr. President, if I can take just a moment I want to read this short sense-of-the-Senate. 
The Senate finds that-- 
One, there is no direct linkage between the fuel taxes deposited in the Highway Trust Fund and the transportation spending from the Highway Trust Fund. 
Two, the Federal budget process has served this linkage by dividing revenues and spending into separate budget categories with fuel taxes deposited in the Highway Trust Fund as revenues; and most spending from the Highway Trust Fund in the discretionary category. 
Three, each budget category referred to has its own rules and procedures. 
Four, under budget rules in effect prior to the date of adoption of this resolution, an increase in fuel taxes permits increased spending to be included in the budget, but not for increased Highway Trust Fund spending. 
It is the sense of the Senate that in this session of Congress, Congress should, within a unified budget, change the Federal budget process to establish a linkage between the fuel taxes deposited in the Highway Trust Fund, including any fuel tax increases that may be enacted into law after the date of adoption of this resolution, and the spending from the Highway Trust Fund. Changes to the budgetary process of the Highway Trust Fund should not result in total program levels for highways or mass transit that is inconsistent with those allowed for under the resolution. 
This sense-of-the-Senate is self explanatory, but let me provide some background. 
Mr. President, back in 1956 the Federal highway trust fund was established as a way to finance the Federal-Aid Highway Program. This was a dedicated trust fund supported by direct user fees/taxes. It was called a trust fund because, once the money went in, we were suppose to be able to trust that money would come back out for use on our roads, highways, and bridges. 
However, the 1990 Budget Act eliminated the linkage between the revenues raised by the user taxes and the spending from the transportation trust fund. We know that we promised ourselves and our constituents that the highway user taxes deposited into the highway trust fund would be used for highways, but we now have an illogical process that does not always result in the desired outcome. With the process currently in place balances are accumulating in the trust fund and not being spent on the vitally important transportation needs we have. 
To correct the problem, we must reform our budget process. 
Mr. President, status quo is not sustainable. 
Senator Chafee and I have introduced S. 404, the Highway Trust Fund Integrity Act. I know that not everyone agrees with the revenue constrained fund approach taken in that bill. However, I think everyone can agree with this sense-of-the Senate that we must work something out. We must establish the linkage to ensure that the taxes deposited into the highway trust fund are spend on transportation. 
I share the concerns that many of my colleagues have--on both sides of the aisle--that we need to find ways to spend more on transportation. This budget resolution moves us closer to that goal. I want to thank the chairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking member for including in the budget resolution the assumption of spending all of the estimated highway trust fund tax receipts that comes in each year for highways. 
All of us share the same belief that transportation funding is critical to our individual States and the entire country. Transportation links our communities, towns, and cities with markets. It links our constituents with their schools, hospitals, churches, and jobs. An effective transportation system will help move this country into the 21st century. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that as this Congress moves forward on one of the most important and probably most difficult pieces of legislation--ISTEA--we also continue our efforts to ensure that `trust' is in the highway trust fund. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that we do.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to call on the Small Business Administration (SBA) to fulfill its role as advocate for the hardworking men and women who have made small business the backbone of our nation's economy. As Chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have heard countless hours of testimony from small businesses who look to the SBA for information assistance and advocacy. 
The SBA's role as an effective voice for small business within the executive branch recently came under fire during the final days of the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) review of an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation to expand the number of industries covered by the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) reporting requirements. The proposed inclusion of two industries, comprised predominantly of small businesses, was brought into question by the SBA and numerous Members of Congress. The affected small businesses had data to support their case for exclusion, and some of the data on which EPA had based its proposed rule was inaccurate. Despite the strength of their case, these small businesses found their views unwelcome at EPA. They appropriately turned to SBA to articulate the small business views to the administration. 
As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, I was dismayed when effective advocacy by the SBA on behalf of small business was criticized as improper. In a letter sent to SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez, efforts to communicate the small business perspective were characterized as `elements within [SBA] . . . actively working to undermine [the TRI] initiative.' The important working relationship between SBA and its small business constituency was alleged to be an improper use of `taxpayer funds to conduct lobbying efforts on behalf of private lobbyists. . . .' In response to this criticism, the SBA temporarily removed staff from working on TRI and asked the Inspector General to review the matter.

Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania. 
We are discussing the partial-birth abortion ban, a horrible procedure likened to infanticide--late-term abortions as our distinguished and knowledgeable colleague from Tennessee has described to us. 
Normally, when we come to the floor, we talk about subjects about which we have read in books or what we have learned from briefings, but we have just heard the Senator from Tennessee, who is an accomplished and distinguished surgeon, describe as best one can describe why this is an objectionable, totally unnecessary and unwarranted procedure--a fully developed fetus, viable, brought down the birth canal feet first, and then delivered all but the head. Then the abortionist takes a pair of scissors, inserts them in the back of the baby's neck, collapses the brain and the baby is delivered dead. 
The overwhelming majority of people in America and Missourians will vote against this. Last night, the Missouri General Assembly passed a ban by veto majority. When we debated the issue last summer and fall, I received over 50,000 letters and post cards supporting the ban. No other issue has generated that amount of mail. 
The issue would be settled if President Clinton had not vetoed the bill last year against the wishes of an overwhelming number of Americans. 
A word about the amendments now before us. These amendments were written by opponents of the ban, supporters of the procedure. They contain loopholes big enough to drive a truck through. The Feinstein amendment contains a loophole big enough to drive a train through. The amendments we are considering will do nothing to stop partial-birth abortions or other forms of late-term abortions, as Senator Frist has so eloquently noted. I hope the Senate will reject the Feinstein and Daschle amendments and pass the partial-birth abortion ban today. 
I yield the floor. I thank my colleague for the time.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to those law enforcement officers who have given their lives while protecting the lives of so many others. When I was the Governor, with command of the Highway Patrol of the State of Missouri, the hardest part of my job was, without question, dealing with the loss of a law enforcement officer. Not only did these men and women faithfully serve their communities in life, they imparted the greatest sacrifice of all: they gave their lives. 
In 1996, 117 law enforcement officers lost their lives in the line of duty, and 13,692 officers in total have been killed while protecting their communities. Every year 1 in 9 officers is attacked, 1 in 25 is injured, and 1 in 4,000 is killed while trying to preserve the peace and safety of the United States. 
My sincerest condolences go out to the families of these men and women who have died in the line of duty. I can only be thankful that organizations such as Missouri Concerns of Police Survivors [MOCOP] exist to help in the aftermath of such tragedy. Every year, this nonprofit support group honors those men and women who have laid down their lives for Missouri. According to MOCOP any local, State, or Federal peace officer serving Missouri as an elected, appointed, deputized, temporary, or permanent officer who was killed or died of wounds or injuries received while performing an act to enforce the law and/or keep the peace from 1820 to the present is eligible to have his or her name inscribed on a monument in Jefferson City, MO. 
Two men whose names will be added to the monument this year, Detective Willie Neal, Jr: January 29, 1997--and Deputy Sheriff Christopher Lee Castetter--November 28, 1996--sacrificed their lives within the past 6 months. It saddens me to hear of these officers in the prime of their lives killed needlessly as they attempted to do their jobs. I can only hope that it is of some comfort to their families that they will forever be remembered as heroes by being etched into this historic monument. 
The other six being honored this year include: B.H. Williamson, May 26, 1867; Horace E. Petts, August 3, 1868; Jasper Mitchell, August 3, 1868; George C. Walters, March 3, 1873; J. Milton Phillips, September 20, 1873; Ed Daniels, March 17, 1874; Anderson Coffman, February 14, 1878; and Hardin Harvey Vickery, March 8, 1879. 
As Abraham Lincoln once said, `It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us * * * that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave their last full measure of devotion; that we were highly resolved that these dead shall not have died in vain.' It is important that we remember why these men and women gave their lives and that we work to ensure that their sacrifice was not in vain. Law enforcement men and women risk their lives every day in order to protect ours. Each day we walk down the street safely or get a good night's sleep without fear of robbery or assault, we should thank those officers who protect us every day and remember the ones who lost their lives in the process.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, during the Memorial Day weekend, Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 280 in Columbia, MO will recognize a group of heroic men. Until recently, few people knew of the secret operation code named `Exercise Tiger,' because the details of the tragedy were not disclosed until after the Battle of Normandy and even then proper recognition was not given. 
In December 1943, several training operations began in order to prepare for the Battle of Normandy. These operations, organized by the United States Army, were undertaken off a beach in Devon, England. It was known by all participating parties the dangers they could encounter. At the time, several German ships patrolled this stretch of water looking for American and English ships. One such evening during practice operations, with only one English ship to guard, there was a surprise attack on the American ships. 
On April 28, 1944, the German Navy `E,' patrolling the English Channel, attacked the eight American tank landing ships who became aware of the attack only after the U.S.S. LST-507 was struck by an incoming torpedo. Next, the U.S.S. LST-531 was attacked and sunk in a matter of minutes. The convoy returned fire and the last ship to be torpedoed, the U.S.S. LST-289, made it safely to shore. 
Even after this frightening turn of events, to it's credit, Exercise Tiger continued operations and remained on schedule. Normandy was attacked as planned and the D-day invasion was a success. 
Information of the fatalities was not released until after the D-day invasion due to the secrecy of the mission and in order to keep the Germans from becoming aware of the impending strike. It took many years, and the passage of the Freedom of Information Act, to learn of the significance of these missions. I feel now is the time for these courageous men to get the long awaited recognition they deserve. 
Four thousand men partook in this operation and of those, nearly a quarter was reported missing or dead. Records from the Department of Defense estimate 749 men died in addition to 441 Army and 198 Navy casualties. Approximately 200 of these men were from my home State of Missouri. 
This Memorial Day weekend commemorates the heroic actions of the men who participated in Exercise Tiger and particularly the ones who lost their lives in this crucial preparation for the D-day invasion. VFW Post 280 has the great privilege of being the first in the State of Missouri to recognize these brave individuals. 
In the words of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, `Old soldiers never die, they just fade away * * * .' I hope that through this long delayed acknowledgment of these fine soldiers, their memory will not fade away, but will remain in our minds and hearts for years to come. These men were an example for all American soldiers to live by and a credit to the United States as it remains the free and great country that it is today.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I want to share with my colleagues some concerns and views on this very important piece of legislation, S. 717, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997. I express my appreciation to the distinguished chairman of the committee for the good work he and the ranking member and the entire committee have done on this bill. 
We all know that since the enactment of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1975, tremendous improvements have been made in the lives of millions of children with disabilities, providing them with a full array of outstanding educational services to meet their individual needs. 
Mr. President, going back about a year before that, in the State of Missouri, when I was Governor, we passed our Special Education Act in 1974, one of the first major pieces of legislation adopted during my first term as Governor. House bill 474 was an effort at the State level to assure that children with disabilities received educational opportunities and received educational services that were designed to meet their abilities and to compensate for any difficulties or deficiencies they might have. 
I think it is clear that we have come a long way. Clearly, there was much that needed to be done, and many of those children, with grave needs, were not being taken care of, they were not being served, and certainly they have a right to be served. 
I think as we move through this bill, preserving the rights of special-needs children to a free appropriate public education so that they can become productive and responsible citizens is an absolutely essential goal that we must keep in mind. 
I have had the opportunity to hear from many, many groups in Missouri who are concerned about how this bill is being carried out, how IDEA is being implemented. Without dissent, there is unanimous agreement that the goals are worthy, the objectives are right, the need is there, more needs to be done. Unfortunately, because of the way the law has been carried out, the way it has been interpreted, there are disruptions to classrooms, there is needless danger to other students and to teachers in the classroom, and there is also a shortage of funds to carry out the worthwhile objectives of this act. 
As I traveled throughout Missouri over the last couple of weekends when I was home, I talked with school superintendents, principals, school board members, special education directors, parents and others who are concerned, and the two top concerns that were mentioned just about every place I went was safety and discipline for all students in the public school system. 
The number of instances where there have been serious disruption and violent acts on students was hair raising. There was a lot of interest and focus in the St. Louis area on a tragic murder that occurred in one of the schools. A young woman was brutally beaten to death. It turns out that the young man who commited the crime was a young man with disabilities. He had transferred into that school district from another school district where he had been cited many times for bad behavior. The receiving school district did not know anything about his past activities because they did not know about his behavioral problems. So the first thing they requested was that they get information on a student's past activities, if there has been discipline, what the discipline had been and why the discipline was administered. 
Second, they told me some hair-raising stories about children with disabilities who committed violent acts. In one classroom, in a commercial art class, a young man picked up a knife and stabbed a fellow student several times and told the school administrators that since he qualified under a certain specific section of the act, they couldn't do anything to him, that they could only take him out of the classroom for 10 days, and then he would be back in there. 
They told me about another student, one of two students, who 
had been apprehended for selling drugs. The one student who did not have a disability was expelled for 175 days. The other student, a year later, was still in the classroom. His parents had retained an attorney, which the school district was paying for, and they carried on the process. A year later, that student who sold the drugs was still in the classroom. 
Earlier, I introduced legislation, the School Security Improvement Act of 1997, which is designed to do a couple of things: No. 1 is to create a safe learning environment for all children. We have to continue to provide support and assistance for disabled students, but where there is a clear-cut example of behavior that is incompatible with a decent learning environment, the schools have to be able to take some action. One principal told us, `You cannot learn in chaos. A child cannot learn in chaos. A teacher cannot teach in chaos.' 
When they have students with disabilities whose violent acts have been judged to be a manifestation of their disability and they have to come back into the classroom after 10 days, other students live in fear, teachers are apprehensive about the impact on their class and, according to the teachers, the administrators, the parents, the job of education comes to a halt. 
The measure that I introduced, the School Security Improvement Act of 1997, will eliminate the double standard that currently exists between special education and general education children. All children, disabled or not, should receive the same discipline for the same behavior. I believe this is appropriate wherein the behavior of the child is not related to the disability. Children must learn that there are consequences for violating the rules. Good education means discipline and standards of conduct. If there is a violent act that is a manifestation of the disability, if it is a dangerous act, if it is a violent act, then that child ought to be put in a learning situation where there will not be a danger to fellow students of committing a similar act. 
In addition, this measure would require schools to include in the record of a child with a disability a statement of any disciplinary action taken against the student, and that should be available for a student transferring within a State or from State to State, so that the receiving school will know if there are problems with the student who has come to them. 
The record issue, as I indicated previously, has been brought to the forefront because of the tragic murder of a young woman in north St. Louis County. 
This measure that I have proposed will enable the school administrators to remove dangerous children with disabilities who pose a threat to the safety of others from the classroom and make temporary alternative placements to ensure that the safety of all students is secure until a more appropriate placement is determined. 
In addition, the current IDEA provision requiring local school districts to reimburse attorneys fees incurred by parents who elect to initiate litigation has had what, unfortunately, is a predictable result of encouraging litigation and of driving up special education costs. It appears that the dispute-resolution procedures have become extremely adversarial and costly. Studies have found that the amount of special education litigation has dramatically increased in recent years. Too often, the litigation can be used as a fishing expedition to threaten districts with protracted litigation. 
The practice serves to reduce district funds available to meet the needs of students with disabilities, and we clearly need reforms of the dispute-resolution process to ensure that scarce educational funds are used for educational services for the children for whom they were intended. But because of the explosion of litigation in this area, educational services for students are put at risk. 
Under the measure I introduced, local school districts would be permitted to provide alternative education placements to children who threaten the safety of others. For some children, it is absolutely appropriate to remove them swiftly and permanently from the regular classroom setting. And under the law that I proposed, school officials would be permitted, on their own authority, to discipline dangerous and unruly students. 
Again, the measure I introduced would give the school districts the authority and flexibility to ensure that the students and the personnel are provided educational and working environments that are safe and orderly. 
Finally, I point out that when the Federal Government enacted IDEA, it promised to fund 40 percent of the national average per-pupil expenditure. Today, the Federal Government funds only 7 percent. That is why I am very pleased today to join with my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, to provide in this legislation explicit direction to Congress to fund fully IDEA. 
I congratulate the committee and its leadership for having made so many necessary reforms in the reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. I hope we can take the next very important step and assure the funding. Congress only recently has come up with 7 percent of the funding rather than 40 percent. 
Last week, a major network news story featured a story on a school in my home State in Maryville, MO. The Maryville R-II School District did not have the revenue to repair its deteriorating classrooms. After six unsuccessful attempts to pass local bond issues, the district was able to pass a bond issue to renovate the schools. 
The Maryville school district spends approximately $434,800 on special education, of which $68,200 is Federal funds, all of which is spent on mandates. If the district were not bound by the paperwork requirements and other costly mandates of the law, they would have more money to improve their facilities and their classrooms. 
The skyrocketing costs of our special-needs children being served by IDEA places local school districts in a bind with little assistance from the Federal Government. 
An Economic Policy Institute study on school funding found that new money for education went disproportionately to fund deficits in special education funding caused by increasing requirements for services coupled with the Federal failure to meet its promised commitment. 
We have been in this body in an effort sometimes called devolution, sometimes called enhanced federalism, more often, in my view, called the commonsense approach of letting the level of Government which delivers the service make the decisions. 
Over the last few years, it says we ought to be allowing the school district if it is an educational decision, or the water district if it is a water-related problem, or the justice system if it is a justice problem make the decisions of how it works. 
We need to be providing more resources and less good ideas to local governments. That is particularly important in this field with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. I can tell you that the goals and the objectives are understood, they are strongly felt by the people who serve in the school system and who support the school system, but they have too many requirements that prevent them from getting the job done. That is why I think we need to provide some flexibility for local school districts. We need to reestablish and restore to local school districts, to school administrators, and others the ability to use common sense in maintaining discipline and order and safety in the classroom. 
We also in this body need to step up to the plate and make sure that we come through with the funding that is needed to carry out these mandates. 
When I talked with the school principals, administrators, and teachers, I said, `After what you have told me, we need to give you some freedom to do these things.' They said, `Well, how about a little money to help us with the burdens you put on us?' I said, `That makes sense.' They said, `Look, to handle these children with disabilities who are violent, we need to have the resources to provide them the alternative education which is appropriate for them and which will not subject their fellow students to risks.' It is going to be more expensive, and there is not the money there yet. 
I am hoping that if we can increase the funding that is needed for these services, we are going to see not only order and discipline and conduct restored in the normal classrooms but a much higher quality of educational services delivered to the children with disabilities. 
Again, I commend and thank the committee for making the many reforms it has done in this bill. And I say that the School Improvement Security Act of 1997, which I described briefly, most of which is very significantly incorporated in this measure--I have been advised that the following organizations strongly support the provisions of it: The Missouri School Boards Association, the Missouri Association of Elementary School Principals, the Missouri Association of Secondary Principals, the Missouri State Teachers Association, the Missouri Federation of Teachers & School Related Personnel, the Fort Zumwalt School District. 
I think, I say to the chairman, that we could get a list a half-mile long of organizations in my State that are behind you in the efforts to reform and reauthorize this measure. I know they are going to be behind Senator Gregg's and my efforts to get more funding. 
So I congratulate you on the measure. We look forward to working with you. We want to see if there is a way that we can provide the funding that is so badly needed for this very important service and for the well-being of the entire educational system in our country. 
I thank the Chair and thank the distinguished managers of the bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from Iowa. 
As I hope I indicated in this case, the Christine Smetzer tragedy was not a case where a student was kept in the classroom as a result of IDEA. I think I attempted to point out that the past disciplinary records of the student had not been transferred.

Mr. BOND. The school district and the parents and everybody associated with it are still in great shock. They feel that they may have had a much better opportunity to prevent that had they been advised. That is why I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa and the chairman of the committee, particularly my colleague, Senator Ashcroft, for getting that records provision in there. 
The teachers who have been on the front line, some stated to me, and, frankly, with fear in their eyes, `If a child is coming in who has a record of violent behavior, at least let us know, at least let us know.' To me, that is just--I mean, that is an unanswerable, that is an unanswerable position. There is no reason why we should not let them know. 
The State of Missouri has made significant changes in the policy for transfers within the State. Our State has the tremendous distinction of bordering on eight other States, including Senator Harkin's State of Iowa. About everything in the Midwest, we border on them. When a student comes in from another State, or when a student from our State goes to another State, it is only fair that the teachers and the administrators know if there is a problem. Frankly, it probably is a help for the students who have no problem because they are not treated with suspicion. If a student is without problems, it is a help to know that as well. 
But I do commend the committee and the occupant of the chair, who has taken an active role in this, particularly my colleague from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, on crafting a bill that deals with these provisions. 
I hope that you will be able to take and accommodate the provisions for funding that Senator Gregg and I support. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I wish to talk about yet another sign of the decline of American culture. 
What ever happened to the family hour? This is the complaint I have heard from many moms and dads in Missouri. 
It wasn't so long ago that parents could sit down with their school age and even preschool children to watch television from 7-8 p.m. and not be worried about the content of the programs. 
For many years, the major television networks voluntarily ran programs during the first hour of prime time that were considered family friendly, that is, without profanity, violence, or adult themes. 
Shows like `Happy Days,' `MASH,' `The Waltons,' `Little House on the Prairie,' and `The Cosby Show' gave us wonderful family entertainment in the evening, not to mention the fact that they were great revenue producers for the networks. 
Now, however, if you turn on the television at that time, you are met with images so graphic, so sexual, or so violent, that you have to channel flip to keep your children from seeing them, or have them leave the room, or turn the television off. 
The Media Research Center here in the Washington area will issue a report later today on the content of family hour programming. 
Last year they found that vulgar language was used commonly during the first hour of prime time. They found that sex outside of marriage was portrayed during the family hour eight times more often than sex within marriage. 
Mr. President, American families have enough forces working against them--struggling to make ends meet, competing priorities, not enough time together--not to be able to relax together during the evening and enjoy a television program that isn't violent, or graphic, or full of profanity. 
That is why I am joining with many other Senators and Congressmen to ask Hollywood television executives to bring back the family hour. We're not mandating this. We're not passing a law to force it. We're simply putting a little polite pressure on the networks to ask them to think about American families when they set their programming. 
Now, they may take the line that it is up to parents to make sure they monitor their children's TV watching. And I agree. But, what we are saying is, give parents some good choices. Give us programming that we can watch together, as a family.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I extend my sincere thanks to the distinguished colleague and fellow Budget Committee Member from South Carolina. 
Mr. President, as we begin the discussions today about the emergency supplemental appropriations measure, I thought it would be very important to touch on some of the important issues in this bill that reflect the spending items in the budget of the VA-HUD Independent Agency Subcommittee on which I serve. 
The full committee appropriations recommendation includes for the emergency supplemental $3.5 billion for disaster relief for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. In the committee report we have recommended $2.5 billion more than the President's request of $979 million. The amount recommended represents FEMA's current estimate of what is needed to meet the requirements of all disasters currently on the books, and those disasters projected to occur in the balance of fiscal year 1997. 
Approximately $1.1 billion of the funds provided are for disasters projected to occur based on the 5-year historical average cost of disaster relief. 
The funds recommended, coupled with the $2 billion currently available in FEMA's disaster relief fund, would enable FEMA to meet fully all of the fiscal year 1997 and prior year commitments. Certainly our hearts go out to the people of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, and other areas stricken by disasters this year. I join with others in commending FEMA for the work that it has done to respond quickly to disasters. For those of us who live in States which have been struck by disasters, we sincerely appreciate the dedicated men and women of FEMA and their ability to respond quickly to those needs. 
Having said that, I must notify my colleagues that FEMA's disaster relief expenditures are out of control. The subcommittee has been paying the price time and time again for FEMA's largess. It is as if we had a tanker truck that arrived to put out the fire. It puts out the fire but it leaves all of the valves open. So the water continues to spill out even after the fire is done, and that is what we are funding. We are filling up a tanker truck that still has the valves open. I commend the people for getting the truck there when the fire starts. But we need to get a handle on how much continues to run out after the fire is put out. 
In the past 2 years, including this legislation before us today, we have cut almost $12 billion from other VA-HUD programs--principally low-income housing--to pay for FEMA disaster relief. Yet we have learned that these funds have gone to rebuild stadiums, golf courses, yacht harbors, and to replace fully, without any State cost share--partially damaged university hospitals, such as over $400 million in Federal repair costs by FEMA for the UCLA hospital because of the Northridge earthquake. Let me make that point again. Mr. President, we have spent $400 million in Federal repair costs for the UCLA hospital, a very important facility, a revenue-generating facility, and one which, frankly, has a lot more reserves than the U.S. Government. 
In the past 2 years, hundreds of millions of dollars have paid for snow removal. There has not been a Federal disaster 
declaration for snow removal since 1979. I think there is little accountability in the program, and entirely too much discretion to waste taxpayers' dollars. 
I also point out to my colleagues that we wouldn't need a supplemental for FEMA today if in 1996 the President's Chief of Staff had not recommended a $1 billion rescission from FEMA during the negotiations on the final bill last year. We knew these funds would be needed, but instead, following the administration's recommendation, Congress rescinded these funds to pay for administration priorities in other areas. 
Moreover, equally disturbing is that to offset these FEMA costs, as well as an additional $100 million requested by the President for CDBG, community development block grant emergency funding, the bill would rescind over $4 billion from the programs and activities within the jurisdiction of the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee, including $3.65 billion from unobligated HUD section 8 contract reserves. 
The rescission of $3.65 billion in unobligated section 8 contract reserves places the renewal of section 8 contracts for fiscal year 1998 in jeopardy. As the people at HUD know full well, the cost of section 8 contracts will skyrocket over the next few years. In particular, the VA-HUD fiscal year 1997 Appropriations Act appropriated $3.6 billion to cover the cost of renewing expiring section 8 contracts for fiscal year 1997. The costs of renewing all section 8 contracts for fiscal year 1998, one year later, a total of $1.7 million expiring contracts, many of which are for the elderly and disabled, will require an appropriations of some $10.2 billion in budget authority for fiscal year 1998. The cost of expiring section 8 contracts rises to $11.9 billion in fiscal year 1999, $13.7 billion in fiscal year 2000; $15.l billion in fiscal year 2001, and $16.4 billion in fiscal year 2002. 
Just to go back, in the current year we had to find budget authority for $3.6 billion. For the coming year, $10.2 billion, almost a threefold increase, going up to $11.9 billion, up to $13.7 billion, up to $15.1 billion, up to $16.4 billion. 
My colleagues will have a right to ask. Are we paying out that much more because we have that many new section 8 contracts? The answer is no. The answer is no. The answer is that in the past we have provided multiyear contracts for the section 8 program, 20-year contracts, and they built in all of the budget authority--the commitment to spend--in prior years. Because of the budgetary constraints, we have been shortening those. I think the direction from the Budget Committee is they want to get those down to 1 year. That means that we have to pick up the budget authority--the overall obligation to spend the money--in each appropriations cycle. 
We have begun these ongoing programs that have built up. We have been spending the money on the programs. But the budget authority was appropriated in prior years. All that budget authority has expired. So we get almost a threefold increase in the budget authority required from the current year to that required for the next year just to keep the same people in the same section 8 houses. 
We have done a great deal through this subcommittee working with the authorizing committee to reform HUD. Just recently HUD announced that they were carrying forward a demonstration program to deal with some very significant problems in excess subsidies for multifamily houses--the market-to-market portfolio reengineering process. We are doing all of that. But just to maintain our commitments requires new authority. 
I am very pleased that the budget agreement recognizes--the President and the leaders of Congress recognize--that additional budget authority and some outlays have to go into section 8. But given all of that, we are looking at these tremendous increases in the section 8 requirements each year in the budget. 
Yet, suddenly HUD, abruptly on April 17, found that it had $5.8 billion in unobligated and excess section 8 contract reserves. I think that is a rather cynical act. They know that we are going to have to spend all of this money. Yet, they offered up the budget authority that was in there already appropriated for them to fund FEMA obligations. When I met with Secretary Cuomo and his staff on March 12, they told me there was probably less than $1 billion in section 8 reserves on hand. The previous year, then Chief of Staff, Mr. Katz, testified that HUD estimated in fiscal year 1996 there was only about less than $.5 billion in excess section 8 contracts reserves. 
Nevertheless, on April 17 of this year, in the middle of supplemental appropriations, HUD wakes up and finds not only $3.5 billion in excess unobligated section 8 reserves but it indicates that it will revise its section 8 contract reserve requirements so that there is in excess of $5.8 billion in unobligated reserves. It is a big jump from $460 million to $5.8 billion. That is a big problem, and, once again, it focuses our intention on the questions about management of HUD, an agency which the General Accounting Office has in the past designated as a troubled agency, the only department in the U.S. Government to have that dubious distinction. 
The bottom line is that I still have little confidence in HUD's ability to estimate the amount of excess section 8 
contract reserves, or its ability to manage the programs. 
I do know, however, that there is a vital need to fund the section 8 program next year; that 1.7 million families are depending upon the renewal of section 8 contracts to preserve affordable and decent housing, and many of these are elderly and disabled. For that reason, the supplemental appropriations we are proposing would require HUD to recapture all excess unobligated section 8 reserves and preserve these funds in an account to help this committee fund the section 8 contract renewals next year. That, I think, is critical, Mr. President. 
I honestly do not know how much section 8 assistance is unobligated in section 8 contract reserves, and, unfortunately, I don't believe HUD knows. I know that some PHA's, public housing authorities, have section 8 contract reserves and some don't. Mostly, I find it difficult to believe that HUD has audited 3,400 PHA's between March 12 and April 17 to determine, all of a sudden, that there was some $5.8 billion in excess reserves. 
I have been a defender of HUD and a defender of the role of the Federal Government as a provider of housing and community development assistance. Yet, my support has been justified on the belief that the department is capable of reform and is capable of providing a meaningful contribution to housing and the community development needs of the Nation. 
I will not belabor these issues today other than to say that we are confident that HUD has been shaken once again. We hope that the secretary and his new management team, with the assistance he is bringing in from the outside, will be able to implement a fiscal management system which will avoid these surprises and give the agency and the Congress some idea of how much is out there, what the obligations are, and how much we have built up. 
I believe strongly that Federal commitment to section 8 housing must be preserved. Renewing these section 8 contracts is an existing commitment to low-income families in need of affordable, safe, secure housing. But HUD has to be reformed. We cannot find surprises of found money as Congress takes on the serious task of reforming the budget. 
Mr. President, I said that we would have some technical amendments that we will offer before the 2:30 deadline. Those are currently being reviewed at the staff level. In consultation, we may be able to get an agreement on them. So I will not offer those at this moment. But we will submit those amendments as soon as they are ready, and prior to the 2:30 deadline. 
I yield the floor. 
I express my thanks to my distinguished colleague from South Carolina.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am introducing the School Security Improvement Act of 1997. This legislation will make some needed reforms to the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act [IDEA]. The goal of this act is to preserve the rights of students with disabilities while granting local school districts more flexibility to discipline violent and disruptive students. This legislation also focuses on reducing litigation and unnecessary attorneys' fees. 
Last week, I traveled through my home State of Missouri to discuss this measure with school district superintendents, principals, school board members, special education directors, and parents. The top two concerns mentioned, without exception, were safety and discipline of all students in the public school system. The rising incidences of school violence and current inflexible Federal mandates have made IDEA reform a high priority issue for educators and parents around the country. Current law prohibits removal of a disabled child from the classroom for more than 10 days--even if he or she becomes violent, commits a crime, or threatens other children--unless permission is granted by a parent. IDEA has created a separate category of students that are not bound by the rules of conduct required of their students, even when their behavior is not related to their disability. 
My primary concern is creating a safe learning environment for all children. In attempting to provide good education services to disabled students, which I fully support, we have unfortunately created a situation where some kids can hide behind their disability in displaying some outrageous behavior. For instance, I know a case where a young man who sold drugs at school was still in the classroom a year later, even though his crime was not related to his disability. What does that say to other kids, particularly when for them the same crime would bring an automatic 1-year expulsion? In another horrendous case, a student stabbed a classmate with scissors and was back in the classroom in just 10 days. 
The School Security Improvement Act of 1997 will eliminate the double standard that currently exists between special education and general education children. All students, disabled or not, should receive the same discipline for the same behavior. I believe this is appropriate when the behavior of the child is not related to their disability. Children must learn that there are consequences for violating the rules. Good education demands discipline and standards of conduct. 
In an effort to ensure that the students, teachers, and school employees remain safe within the educational environment, this bill requires schools to include in the records of a child with a disability a statement of disciplinary action taken against the student and allows intrastate and interstate transfer of records from one district to another. The records issue has been brought to the forefront because of several instances when disabled students have caused serious problems and school officials were unaware that the student had a record of similar activities in other schools. 
I believe that all students with disabilities need and deserve access to educational services to meet their individual needs. However, in those occasional circumstances when a student becomes so violent or dangerous, and their behavior significantly disrupts the educational process and they become a danger to themselves or others, or create an environment in which learning cannot occur, then the rights of others in the school to have a safe and effective learning environment must take precedence. 
The School Security Improvement Act of 1997 will enable school administrators, those who are closest to the problem, to remove dangerous students with disabilities who pose a threat to the safety of others from the classroom and make temporary alternative placements to ensure the safety of all students until a more appropriate placement is determined. When these students are able to behave appropriately, they will be returned to the classroom. 
The current IDEA provision requiring local school districts to reimburse attorneys' fees incurred by parents who elect to initiate litigation has had the predictable result of encouraging such litigation and of driving up special education costs. The dispute-resolution procedures has become extremely adversarial and costly. Studies have found that the amount of special education litigation has dramatically increased in recent years. Sadly, some parent attorneys seem encouraged to use due process, as a fishing expedition or to threaten districts with protracted litigation over non-issues as a tactic to force school districts to comply with parental demands. 
This practice only serves to reduce district funds available to meet the needs of students with disabilities. Clearly, we need reasonable reforms to the dispute-resolution process to ensure that scarce educational funds are used for educational services for our children. 
I firmly believe that children with disabilities must be guaranteed a free appropriate education. Yet no school district should have to cut services to any student so it can pay attorneys' fees. But, because of the explosion of litigation in this area, educational services for all students are being endangered. 
Under the School Security Improvement Act of 1997, local school districts will be permitted to provide alternative educational placement for children who threaten the safety of others. For some children, it is absolutely appropriate to swiftly and permanently remove them from the regular classroom setting. The law should not prohibit local school officials from acting on their own authority to discipline dangerous and unruly students. 
The School Security Improvement Act will give local school districts the authority and flexibility to ensure that the students and the personnel are provided educational and working environments that are safe and orderly. 
Mr. President, when the Federal Government enacted IDEA, it promised to fund 40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure. Today, the Federal Government funds only 7 percent. My bill contains a provision expressing a sense of the Senate that the Federal portion of educating students with disabilities should be fully funded. In recent years, costly regulations have dramatically increased, placing a tremendous strain on local school districts. The time and money spent on Federal mandates must be reduced, so that more time and resources can be spent in the classroom on school children. This money will help students by easing the financial burden on local school districts. 
I know the feelings run high on this issue. We have a difficult job when it comes to balancing the needs of those with special needs with our responsibility to educate all children in the classroom, free of violence and disruption. I look forward to the upcoming reauthorization of IDEA and working with my colleagues in this effort to come up with a commonsense approach to improve our Nation's schools.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on April 26-28, 1997, more than 1,200 students from 50 States and the District of Columbia will be in Washington, DC to compete in the national finals of the We the People. * * * The Citizen and the Constitution Program. I am proud to announce that the class from Westminster Christian Academy will represent Missouri. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals by winning local competitions in their home State. 
The distinguished members of the team representing Missouri are: David Bradsher, Christopher Brown, Russell Bruch, Jessica Cozad, Tony Culella, Josh Darr, Elizabeth Erkmann, Lauren Gray, Joshua Hamer, Matthew Harris, Angela Heirendt, Joshua Hendricks, Sarah Henning, Rachael Higby, Charles Hinderliter, Valerie Hopkins, Shauna Kruse, Nina Langenberg, Taylor Long, Stacey McDowell, Mark Pollitt, Kelly Reed, Jordan Reinwald, Christine Shoemaker, Anna Suh, and Megan Turner. 
I shall also recognize their teacher, Ken Boesch, who also serves as district coordinator for the program, and Terry Taylor, the State coordinator, who also contributed a significant amount of time and effort to help the team reach the national finals. 
The We the People * * * The Citizen and the Constitution Program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The 3-day national competition simulates a congressional hearing in which students' oral presentations are judged on the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles and their ability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues. 
Now in its 10th academic year, this constitutional studies program has had more than 75,000 teachers and 24 million students participate nationwide at both the elementary and secondary school levels. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers. The We the People * * * program provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an informed perspective on the significance of the U.S. Constitution and its place in our history and our lives. I wish these students the best of luck in the national finals and look forward to their continued success in the years ahead.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President I will vote against ratification of the Chemical Warfare Convention. I came to this decision, not because I am against doing away with chemical weapons, we all are. I will vote against ratification because amendments which I believe were critical to ensuring our safety and security were stricken rendering the convention more dangerous to our well being than one which would include those conditions, even if it means having to renegotiate the convention. Of the outstanding amendments which were debated through out the day today, I believe those covering Russian ratification and their compliance with previous treaties, the rejection of inspectors or inspections by states with a history of violating non-proliferation treaties or which have been designated by our State Department as sporting terrorism, striking article 10 of the treaty and amending article 11, and having our intelligence agencies certify that the treaty would be credibly verifiable were critical to making the treaty worthwhile. 
The fact that the President suggested we could withdraw from the convention if there were a compelling reason to do so, was a placebo which carried little viable meaning. I believe that it would not only be more difficult to withdraw from the convention once we ratify it, it would be much more dangerous to world stability if we were to withdraw after obligating ourselves to a flawed treaty. And so, I must, in good conscience, vote not to ratify.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 495, the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act of 1997. In the wake of World War I, nations from all around the world came together to sign the 1925 Geneva Protocol. Having witnessed the horrible effects of poison gas in battle, this agreement banned its use in interstate conflict. However, at the time no provisions were made in U.S. law to establish criminal or civil penalties pertaining to such weapons. 
Today, for the first time, legislation has come to the Senate floor that provides criminal and civil penalties for the unlawful acquisition, transfer, or use of any chemical or biological weapon and gives domestic law enforcement authorities the needed legal basis to enforce prohibitions on chemical weapons activities within the United States. Most importantly, in light of recent domestic terrorist attacks and the actual release of Sarin gas in a Tokyo subway, S. 495 allows the death penalty for the use of chemical or biological weapons that leads to the loss of life. 
From the international perspective, this legislation conditions continued United States aid to Russia for chemical and biological weapons dismantlement and destruction upon Russia demonstrating that it is abiding by existing agreements in this area. It urges enhancement of multilateral regimes to control trade in chemical and biological weapons-related materials, while requiring that the United States continue strengthening chemical and biological defenses, particularly in terms of equipment and training. Finally, S. 495 establishes, for the world, U.S. policy on the use of riot control agents and permits the use of tear gas for such things as the rescuing of downed pilots. 
The Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act of 1997 augments existing international norms and agreements by establishing a framework for U.S. sanctions against nations which use chemical or biological weapons and by directing the Secretary of State to convene an international negotiating forum for the purpose of reaching an agreement on the enforcement of the 1925 Geneva Protocol which bans the use of chemical weapons in war. 
I wish to point out that supporting S. 495 is not in conflict with the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Instead it complements the CWC by reducing the threat of acts of terrorism and armed aggression against the United States involving chemical and biological weapons. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and take a step toward making our country safer with a comprehensive plan that provides realistic and practical measures to combat the dangers of these repugnant weapons.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to designate the U.S. post office building located at Bennett Street and Kansas Expressway in Springfield, MO as the `John Griesemer Post Office Building.' 
John Griesemer was a true example of an American patriot. He loved, supported, and defended his country. 
John Griesemer was born in Mount Vernon, MO, and raised on a dairy farm in Billings, MO. After he graduated from high-school, he attended the University of Missouri--Columbia and in 1953 graduated with a bachelor of science degree in civil engineering. He then entered the Air Force as a first lieutenant, engineering officer. After being discharged from the military in 1956, he went back home to Missouri to work in the family business. He was president and director of the Griesemer Stone Co. until his death in 1993. John Griesemer didn't just work for the family business though. He also started two of his own businesses: the Joplin Stone Co. and Missouri Commercial Transportation Co. as well as serving as president of Springfield Ready Mix, director of Boatmen's National Bank, and president of the Springfield Development Council. In addition to his business interests, John Griesemer was a devoted family man. He and his wife, Kathleen, had five children and John took an avid interest in their lives holding various positions with the Boy Scouts of America and his church. 
In 1984, John made his life even busier. He was asked by President Reagan to serve on the U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors. He even served as president of the board in 1987 and 1988. 
John Griesemer is an example to us all. He possessed the qualities of perseverance, determination, and strength that allowed him to successfully manage a busy work and service schedule with a very busy family life. 
I urge my colleagues to act quickly and pass this bill by unanimous consent.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today, I rise in strong support of the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act, which would prevent Federal funds and Federal programs from promoting and paying for the practice of assisted suicide. 
We must send a clear signal that Federal tax dollars should not be used for a practice which is neither universally permitted nor accepted, and one which is clearly immoral and unethical. 
Many people may be wondering, `Why do we need Federal legislation to prohibit the use of Federal funds for such an abhorrent practice?' Let me take a few moments to lay out the reasons. 
Both the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in New York and the Ninth Circuit Court in San Francisco have struck down State laws that criminalized assisted suicide in the States of New York and Washington on the grounds that the laws violate the due process clause and the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. 
In January of this year, the U.S. Supreme Court entered this emotional debate by hearing oral arguments on the aforementioned cases. A highly anticipated decision is expected within the next couple of months. 
The plaintiffs are contending they have a constitutional right to physician assisted suicide. If these circuit court decisions are upheld, then there would be a nationwide constitutional right to assisted suicide, euthanasia, and mercy killing and the issue of whether Federal funding, under Medicare, Medicaid, title XX, and other programs, for such an action would immediately be at hand. 
Moreover, Oregon has passed the Oregon Death with Dignity Act, which makes it legal for physicians to prescribe lethal doses of drugs in certain circumstances. Although a preliminary injunction blocking the law's enactment has been granted, Oregon's Medicaid director and Health Services Commission chair have both said that once assisted suicide is legal, the State would begin subsidizing the practice under Oregon's Medicaid plan. 
The Health Care Financing Administration has said that killing patients is not a proper form of treatment and therefore should not be covered under Medicare. I am, of course, pleased that we have those administrative interpretations out there. 
But there are others who are prepared to go to court to fight for a different interpretation. A March 6 Reuters newswire story quotes Hemlock Society spokeswoman Dori Zook as saying, `Obviously, we feel that Medicaid and Medicare should be used for assisting suicide.' 
All it takes is for one district court judge to concur with that belief. Federal law uses broad language in determining what Federal programs will and will not pay for. For instance, Medicare pays for services that are `reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis and treatment of illness or injury.' If just one judge agrees with the Hemlock Society and believes that assisted suicide is appropriate medical treatment, then Federal tax dollars could fund assisted suicide in a State where the practice is legal. 
If the Supreme Court were to rule that there is a constitutional right to assisted suicide, euthanasia advocates will certainly bring suit for it to be considered just another medical treatment option that must be eligible for funding under Medicare, Medicaid, and other Federal programs. 
We need this legislation to prevent this from happening. 
And it is not too soon to do so. Far too often, Congress reacts to problems. Today, however, we have an excellent opportunity to be pro-active, not simply reactive. We do not want to wait until the money is already flowing and then try to stop it. We want to stop it before it even starts. 
On a related note, it is imperative that we focus this debate on how we, as a decent society, can support and comfort life instead of promoting destructive practices such as euthanasia and assisted suicide. We must work together to ensure the provision of compassionate care for dying persons and their families. We must practice effective pain management, encourage patient self-determination through the use of advance directives, promote the utilization of hospice and home care, and offer emotional and spiritual support when necessary. 
Five Catholic health care systems and the Catholic Health Association of the United States have set out to achieve these goals and have formed Supportive Care of the Dying: A Coalition for Compassionate Care. The coalition, including Carondelet Health System, Daughters of Charity, Franciscan Health System, PeaceHealth, Providence Health System, and CHA, is developing comprehensive delivery models, practice guidelines, and educational programs--all with the goal of promoting appropriate and compassionate care of persons with life-threatening illnesses and their families. 
These are the goals our Nation must strive for and support. We must promote death with dignity and respect, and not death by the draconian means of assisted suicide. 
Let me close with a quotation from an eminent bioethicist at Georgetown University who believes that assisted suicide, and therefore the funding of assisted suicide, tears down the moral structure of our society. He has written that rules against killing `are not isolated moral principles, but pieces of a web of rules that form a moral code. The more threads one removes then the weaker the fabric becomes.' 
And indeed, assisted suicide is a form of killing, and if we allow for the federal funding of this horrific act, then we risk minimizing the importance of life.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Tennessee, who is next in line and allowed me to go first. 
I commend my distinguished colleague from New Mexico for his great leadership on this issue. He has within his hands the needed mechanism to get to tax relief, and that is what I want to address very briefly here today. 
I follow up his point about the cost of the complexity of today's Tax Code by saying we in the Small Business Committee have figures indicating that computing taxes, figuring out taxes, takes 5 percent of the revenues of small business. That is not paying the taxes. That is just figuring out how much they are. 
Mr. President, each year the American Tax Foundation computes what they call `Tax Freedom Day,' the day of the year when the average American can quit working to pay Federal, State, and local taxes and start working for herself or himself. Last year it was May 7. This year it will be May 9. This means each day you have worked since the new year has been simply to pay your tax bill for 
the new year and you still have 3 weeks to go. If that does not make you happy, I do not know what will. 
The American people take too much of their hard earned income to pay for Uncle Sam's spending habits. Why is the tax burden on families so high? Because Uncle Sam spends too much. It is that simple. Congress has not balanced the budget since 1969. The cumulative effect of all that deficit spending is a tax burden for most families that exceeds what they pay for food, clothing, housing and automobile costs combined. We need to fix that. We are trying to balance the budget so we can reduce the tax burden for families with children, small and home-based businessowners, family farmers, and frankly, everybody else who is taking part in the economy. 
The first step in bringing tax relief to middle-class America, however, is to bring Government spending under control. A balanced budget means a healthier economy, more Government revenue and less need for taxes. As you fill in the amount of tax paid line on your 1040 form this year or as you write out your check to the IRS, think about ways you could use even a portion of that tax money and remember who is trying to balance the budget and who is not because balancing the budget and getting spending under control is the first step toward tax relief. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on Monday, April 21, 1997, the Kansas City MO Chamber of Commerce will honor the 1997 Top 10 Small Businesses of the Greater Kansas City area. The Chamber is an association of almost 3,000 businesses across the 10-county bistate area whose members employ approximately 240,000 people in the Greater Kansas City area. This honor is part of the Chamber's award-winning Small Business Week activities, which are among the country's largest Small Business Week celebrations. 
The Top 10 Awards are given in recognition of the economic contributions of small businesses which make up more than 90 percent of the Greater Kansas City metropolitan area. These 10 businesses alone contributed $104 million in annual sales and employed more than 840 people in 1996. Nearly 700 companies were nominated, but only 10 can earn the honor of small business of the year. Of the 10, the Greater Kansas City Chamber will select its 11th annual Small Business of the Year, at its luncheon on April 25, 1997. The Small Business of the Year will receive the `Mr. K' award, named for Ewing Marion Kauffman, one of the country's best entrepreneurs. 
This year's Top 10 recipients are, Accommodations by Apple, Inc., Gould Evans Affiliates, Hermes Landscaping, Inc., Arthur Clark Holding Inc., Boulevard Brewing Co., The Corridor Group, Inc., Courtney Day Inc., DARCA Inc., Data Systems International Inc., and Galvmet Inc. 
When Ewing Kauffman observed that, `Surprisingly, of all of the motivational aspects that there are, once a person has food, clothing, and shelter, the most motivating force in the world is appreciation. * * * we don't express appreciation as much as we should.' I can only speculate that he was thinking of businesses such as these. As the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, it gives me great satisfaction to see my home State thriving in the small business community and I would like each honoree to know how much I appreciate their hard work and commitment to excellence. I congratulate these companies not only for this honor, but also for the outstanding community service they provide to the Greater Kansas City area. They are an inspiration to all small businesses not only in this area, but around the country, and I applaud them.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to recognize homeschoolers in the State of Missouri. They are a part of the ongoing commitment to quality education for Missouri's youth. 
Home educators make an effort to give their children a chance for success in today's ever-changing society by personally guiding the education of their children and ensuring that all facets of their children's development are included in scholastic endeavors. 
Homeschoolers establish one-on-one relationships with their adult mentors and develop interpersonal skills with all age groups through apprenticeship opportunities and involvement in civic and community organizations. 
Home education in Missouri has enjoyed considerable success in recent years because of the tremendous support received for countless citizens who realize the significance of family participation in the educational process. The State of Missouri has resolved to commend the efforts of home educators by designating May 4-10, 1997, Home Education Week. I applaud the home educators for their commitment to quality education and taking the time to be directly involved in their children's education.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today in my hometown of Mexico, MO, a very dear lifelong friend, Tim Hagan, will be buried. Lowell Lambert `Tim' Hagan, III, owner of Hagan Clothing Co., died Sunday after a long battle with cancer, and will be sadly missed by his family and all of us who were privileged to be counted among his friends. 
Tim was a tremendous businessman and community leader. Born and raised in Mexico, MO, Tim developed a lifelong reputation as `doer'. He successfully ran the family clothing business, and was involved in numerous community organizations, including the Rotary Club, the Mexico Chamber of Commerce, and the Mexico Country Club. Out of compassion for those less fortunate, he was the former president of the Audrain County Cerebral Palsy Society, and for 6 years was chairman of the Missouri National Multiple Sclerosis Hope Chest Campaign. 
Because of his understanding of the daily challenges small business owners face, Tim was chosen to be part of the Missouri delegation for the White House Conference on Small Business in 1995. That conference was one of the most successful in history, in that some of the ideas generated by Tim and others to create small business jobs and opportunities have been acted on by Congress and many others are now being discussed. 
Tim also felt that the education of our children and youth was particularly important to securing a good future, and was instrumental in bringing the Technical College to Mexico. That contribution will benefit the youth of Audrain County for years to come. His presence and spirit in the community will also continue to be felt for many years in that his own son, John, will continue to run the fourth generation family business. 
Tim shared with his friends a love of his Irish ancestry, though his love was more frequently and forcefully expressed as a lifelong Democrat. Even in the last days of his illness, he and I engaged in many spirited, but good natured political debates. 
Our culture is quick to glorify the here and now, the `flash in the pan' celebrities, the `cause' of the day. By that measure, Tim Hagan stood apart. While he was known in the community as a `feisty Irishman' with unfailing energy, he was also a builder. He spent his entire life making life better for his family, his employees, his church, and his community. His love for others knew no racial or social boundaries. We will miss him terribly.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on Sunday, April 13, 1997, the city of Springfield, MO will dedicate a statue of John Q. Hammons in recognition of his lifelong devotion to his city, his State, and his country. 
When Thoreau observed that, `Philanthropy is almost the only virtue which is sufficiently appreciated by mankind,' he could not have imagined how impossible it has become for Springfield to show sufficiently its appreciation for the generosity of John. He has donated, built, benefactored, patroned, and supported all facets and levels of life in Springfield. When visiting the city, you are aware immediately of John Q. Hammons landmarks which grace and enrich the community. 
In raising this statue and in knowing they can never adequately express their admiration, respect, and affection, fellow Springfieldians enthusiastically embrace the opportunity to say thank you. Sunday will be a great occasion for the people of Springfield and I join them in paying tribute to John Q. Hammons.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand in strong support of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997. This bill is virtually identical to S. 2042, which was introduced in the last Congress and goes a long way toward developing a constructive and comprehensive section 8 mark-to-market contract renewal program for reducing the costs of expiring project-based section 8 contracts, limiting the financial exposure of the FHA multifamily housing insurance fund for FHA-insured section 8 projects, and preserving, to the maximum extent possible, the section 8 project-based housing stock for very low- and low-income families. This legislation builds on a demonstration enacted as part of the VA/HUD Fiscal Year 1997 appropriations bill which provided HUD with flexible authority to address the costs and the housing issues posed by this stock. 
I congratulate Senators D'Amato, Mack, and Bennett for their contribution and commitment to this comprehensive legislation, as well as their commitment to finding a bipartisan approach to the many difficult issues associated with the renewal of oversubsidized section 8 project-based contracts. This legislation is a meaningful step in developing a reasonable policy toward the concerns raised by these expiring section 8 project-based contracts. 
Over the last 25 years, a number of HUD programs were established for the construction of affordable, low-income housing by providing FHA mortgage insurance while financing the cost of the housing through section 8 project-based housing assistance. Currently, there are some 8,500 projects with almost 1 million units that are both FHA-insured and whose debt service is almost totally dependent on rental assistance payments made under section 8 project-based contracts. Most of these projects serve very low-income families, with almost 50 percent of the stock serving elderly and disabled families. 
The crisis facing this housing stock is that the section 8 project-based housing assistance was initially budgeted and appropriated through 15- and 20-year section 8 project-based contracts that are now expiring and for which contract renewal is prohibitively expensive. For example, at least 75 percent of this housing stock have rents that exceed the fair market rent of the local area. 
Since current law generally prohibits HUD from renewing these section 8 contracts at rents above 120 percent of the fair market rent, in many cases, the failure to renew expiring section 8 project-based contracts at existing rents will leave owners without the financial ability to pay the mortgage debt on these projects. This means that owners likely will default on their FHA-insured mortgage liabilities, resulting in FHA mortgage insurance claims totaling some $18 billion and foreclosures. HUD would then own and be responsible for managing these low-income multifamily housing projects. This bill is intended to avoid this potential crisis through a fiscally responsible and housing sensitive strategy. 
In addition, the cost of the section 8 contracts on these projects reemphasizes the difficult budget and appropriation issues facing the Congress. In particular, according to HUD estimates, the cost of all section 8 contract renewals, both tenant-based and project-based, will require appropriations of about $3.6 billion in Fiscal Year 1997, $10.2 billion in Fiscal Year 1998, and over $16 billion in Fiscal Year 2002. In addition, the cost of renewing the section 8 project-based contracts will grow from $1.2 billion in Fiscal Year 1997 to almost $4 billion in Fiscal Year 2000, and to some $8 billion in 10 years. 
Since the HUD appropriations account cannot sustain these exploding costs, this legislation is intended to be a comprehensive response which will reduce the financial cost and exposure to the Federal Government and preserve this valuable housing resource. The Senate bill would generally preserve this low-income housing by using various tools to restructure these multifamily housing mortgages to the market value of the housing with resulting reductions in section 8 costs. 
I also am troubled by some of the other section 8 mark-to-market proposals 
being promoted, including the position which has been taken by HUD in the past which, in general, opposes preserving this housing as FHA-insured or as assisted through section 8 project-based assistance, including the elderly assisted housing, in favor of vouchers. This position is very questionable, and I emphasize that it is widely opposed by the housing industry and tenant groups and advocates. I emphasize that we want to work with HUD on these issues, and that in appropriate circumstances vouchers may be the right decision if we can balance this decision by ensuring that by restructuring a mortgage to the market level that we also can require long-term affordablility of this housing for very low- and low-income families. This could mean more choice for low-income families and the availability of more affordable, low-income housing. I believe that a number of creative and positive approaches will need to be reviewed as this legislation is considered. 
I highlight the underlying principles of the bill which would authorize the establishing of participating administrative entities [PAEs] which would generally be a public agency, with a first preference that a PAE be a State housing finance agency or, second, a local housing agency. These entities would be contracted by HUD to develop work-out plans in conjunction with owners of FHA-insured projects with expiring, oversubsidized section 8 contracts. Each PAE would develop mortgage restructuring and rental assistance sufficiency plans as work-out instruments to reduce the section 8 subsidy needs of projects through mortgage restructuring. 
The basic tool provided in the draft bill, and the likely key to any successful strategy to preserve this housing, is to authorize the restructuring of the mortgage debt on these oversubsidized section 8 multifamily housing projects. In particular, the bill would allow the restructuring of these high-cost mortgages with a new first mortgage reflecting, generally, the market value of a project, and a soft second mortgage held by HUD or financed by the private sector, with interest at the applicable Federal rate, covering the remainder of the original mortgage debt and payable upon disposition or upon full payment of the first mortgage. This provision will reduce the cost of section 8 assistance and minimize any loss to the FHA multifamily insurance fund. In addition, this approach ensures that there is no taxable event by virtue of the mortgage restructuring. 
I also think it would be beneficial to look at some kind of exit tax relief to encourage owners, especially limited partners, to divest their interest in these properties, to encourage new investment in and the revitalization of these properties. I am hopeful that the administration will help craft some form of tax relief that balances the need of the Government to preserve this housing for low-income use at an affordable and reasonable cost to both the Government and low-income families. 
Finally, I emphasize that the time to act is now. I sponsored a section 8 mark-to-market demonstration which was included in the VA/HUD Fiscal Year 1997 appropriations bill which is similar to this legislation and represents an interim approach to the section 8 mark-to-market contract renewal issue. I am disappointed that HUD has failed to implement this demonstration because we need the information to continue to make informed policy decisions with regard to this issue. Nevertheless, the appropriation language indicates my strong belief that we can no longer afford, as a matter of housing policy and fiscal responsibility, to renew expiring section 8 project-based contracts at the existing, over-market rents. I strongly believe that section 8 reform legislation should be acted on by the authorizing committees before the end of the fiscal year, with the full benefit of hearings and discussion on these very difficult policy issues. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues on the legislation and hope that the Housing Subcommittee and Banking Committee can act in an expeditious manner on this measure. I emphasize the need to work together and I look forward to moving this legislation through Congress and onto the desk of the President.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of Senator DeWine's effort to establish a pediatric research initiative within the Office of the Director at the National Institutes of Health [NIH]. 
To achieve real progress in improving the health of our Nation's most vulnerable and valuable resource--our children--we must strengthen public investments in pediatric research; enhance Federal coordination among the NIH Institutes to ensure quality multi-disciplinary research in areas of scientific progress; develop new incentives for investment in pediatric clinical trials; support new ways to treat children with special conditions; and develop information to promote safer and more effective use of prescription drugs for children. 
The opportunity for scientific progress in combating and preventing illnesses and diseases affecting children has never been greater. To assist the NIH in strengthening its pediatric research efforts, I, along with other members of the Labor, HHS, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, successfully secured $5 million for the NIH Office of the Director to begin this new pediatric research initiative last year. 
Senator DeWine's legislation builds upon that down payment, and I look forward to working with other Members of the Senate in ensuring passage of this effort. 
Although health care spending for children is only a fraction of total health care spending, we must not turn our backs on the health care needs of our children. Pediatric research offers potential savings in health care costs as well as substantial benefits to the well-being of children for a lifetime. Moreover, pediatric research contributes to new insights and discoveries in preventing and treating illnesses and diseases among our country's adult population. 
Let me close by saying that this bill complements legislation I introduced last week which will provide surveillance, research, and services aimed at the prevention of birth defects, the No. 1 killer of babies. We currently know the causes of about 30 percent of all birth defects. With the enactment of a pediatric research initiative and the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997, we will shed new light on the causes of birth defects as well as numerous other diseases, illnesses, and other health factors afflicting our Nation's children.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join with a number of my colleagues to say there was a very important argument in the Supreme Court today over the constitutionality of the Communications Decency Act, which we passed last year. You will recall that we passed a bill to make it difficult to communicate pornography to children. The day it was passed and signed, the American Civil Liberties Union jumped in to say it was unconstitutional. I'm sorry, but I think the ACLU has it all wrong. I was very pleased to be one of a group of Senators, including the occupant of the Chair, who signed a brief in support of Congress' effort to impose reasonable regulations and restrictions to prevent the worst form of pornography from reaching our children. 
Congress can regulate speech when there is a compelling reason. That has been clear. That has been held constitutional in many instances, and I suggest that there is no more compelling need than to protect our children and future generations from exposure to explicit pornographic pictures and messages, and from the people who send them. 
The government, both the Federal Government and State and local governments, have engaged in efforts to regulate pornography. We regulate media available to children such as the sale of books and magazines, the viewing and sale of films, the use of telephone services to communicate adult messages, and the broadcast media. So, this has been done and it has been done for a very good and I believe a very compelling reason. The standard put forth in the Communications Decency Act is even more stringent than that, in terms of the limitations of it. The constraints are more severely limited than the constraints on the broadcast media. We have tightened up the definitions and made the ban much narrower. 
The Internet is clearly the latest means of communications. Any of us who have children knows how readily accessible the Internet is. If you are like I am, when you have a computer problem you ask your child how to fix it, because the children know how to make it work. My forehead still breaks out in perspiration and my hands shake when I try to send e-mail. But the kids can not only send the e-mail for you, they can tell you how to send it, fix the problems on it, and make things happen. We want to make sure that what they do not make happen is that they get access to things that are now banned to them through adult book stores, through broadcast media, through telephone communications. They should not be subject to the deviants, the pornographers, the child molesters who want to use the Internet in an interactive way to get access to our children. 
There are, unfortunately, an abundance of examples of where perverts have used Internet communications to communicate with and to lure young children to locations away from their homes. They have used pornography as a tool. Not only have they polluted children's minds with this pornography, but they have used it as a tool for their own, very sick purposes. 
In Louisville, I know there was a 12-year-old girl who was sent a bus ticket and left home without her parents knowing about it. These examples have happened time and time again. I believe this Congress had every right to say it is OK for adults to communicate anything they want but you cannot be sending material to children that is pornographic. You cannot be putting pornographic information on the kiddie chat rooms. 
Contrary to what the ACLU will tell you, the Communications Decency Act does not ban speech or interrupt the free exchange of ideas. There is technology available that can keep children from gaining access to it. And if it takes a pornographer a little more difficulty to communicate pornographic materials to another consenting adult, so they do not get the information before children, I am not going to lose any sleep over it. 
There is every reason that we can, under the Communications Decency Act, continue to use the Communications Decency Act for communicating medical information, discussing literature--these are not banned. If the purpose is getting pornography, for pornographic purposes or even personal whims of those who communicate it, to children, that the Communications Decency Act bans. 
I think this should be upheld. I am proud to be one of the signers of the brief and we will all be watching to see this very important case resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mr. BOND. 
Mr. President, home-based businesses are a significant and often overlooked part of this country's economy. Some people may be surprised to learn that over 9 million men and women in this country now operate home-based businesses, and over 14 million individuals earn income through home-based businesses. Even more impressive is the fact that a majority of these enterprises are owned by women, and the Small Business Administration estimates that women in this country are starting over 300,000 new home-based businesses each year. 
There are a number of reasons for the explosive growth of home-based businesses. Recent innovations in computer and communication technology have made the virtual office a reality and allow many Americans to compete in marketplaces that a few years ago required huge investments in equipment and personnel. In addition, many men and women in this country turn to home-based business in an effort to spend more time with their children. By working at home, these families can bring in two incomes, while avoiding the added time and expense of day-care and commuting. Corporate down-sizing, too, contributes to the growth in this sector as many skilled individuals convert their knowledge and experience from corporate life into successful enterprises operated from their homes. 
The rewards of owning a home-based business are also numerous. The added independence and self-reliance of having your own business provides not only economic rewards but also personal satisfaction. You are the boss: you set your own hours, develop your own business plans, and choose your customers and clients. In many ways, home-based businesses provide the greatest avenue for the entrepreneurial spirit, which has long been the driving force behind the success of this country. 
But with these rewards comes a number of obstacles, not the least of which are regulations and burdens imposed by the Federal Government. In fact, the tax laws, and in particular the IRS, are frequently cited as the most significant problems for home-based businesses today. Changes in tax policy must be considered by this Congress to ensure that our laws do not stall the growth and development of this successful sector of our economy. 
Mr. President, in answer to this call for help, I am introducing today the Home-Based Business Fairness Act of 1997. This legislation is the product of extensive input from actual home-based business owners and the efforts of my colleagues Senators Olympia Snowe and Don Nickles. The bill is designed to address three tax issues that currently pose significant problems for home-based businesses.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support with Senators Mack and D'Amato in introducing the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997. This legislation is substantially the same as S. 1260 which passed the Senate in the 104th Congress, but fell short of enactment in the waning days of that Congress. 
This legislation is a critical step to the needed reform of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as a major reform bill in its own right. This legislation consolidates the public housing and section 8 tenant-based assistance programs, and redirects the responsibility and authority for public housing and section 8 back to federally assisted residents, the public housing agencies, the localities, and the States. 
This bill also dovetails with many of the public housing reforms contained in the VA/HUD fiscal years 1996 and 1997 appropriations bills and reflects the need to provide streamlined programs and local responsibility as the most appropriate method to address local housing needs. 
I cannot emphasize enough the need to find a measured solution to the housing problems of this Nation and to HUD's overregulation of housing and community issues that are better addressed at the local level. This bill represents a complete overhaul of the public housing system and the section 8 tenant-based program and a move away from HUD's all too common one-size-fits-all mentality. 
The linchpin of this legislation is to place the responsibility for the decisionmaking for public housing issues, from the demolition of obsolete units to the issue of elderly only housing to the voluntary conversion of public housing to tenant-based assistance, in the hands of local public housing agencies through public housing agency plans developed in conjunction with residents and consistent with state and local housing plans. 
In addition, this legislation would continue to protect the poorest of the poor by requiring PHA's to continue to make 40 percent of all units available to families whose incomes do not exceed 30 percent of the area median income, 75 percent of all units to families whose incomes do not exceed 60 percent of median income and to make all other units available to families with incomes no greater than 80 percent of median income. 
This bill also reforms and consolidates the section 8 voucher and certificate program into a single voucher program which will reduce administrative burden and increase the acceptability of vouchers in the private housing market. 
Finally, the bill continues the Distressed Public Housing Program for the demolition of obsolete and uninhabitable public housing. Obsolete public housing has long been a drag on communities, and I consider it an absolute priority to remove these projects and provide low-income families with positive, affordable housing choices. 
I see this bill as part of a downpayment on a larger HUD reform effort which I expect to be pursued throughout this Congress. I look forward to working with my colleagues on these important issues and I am optimistic that we can address many of them.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997. I introduce this on behalf of myself, Senators Lott, Daschle, Hollings, Hutchinson of Arkansas, Cochran, Kohl, Inouye, Moynihan, Chafee, and Breaux. 
The March of Dimes and their volunteers are here today to lend support to an often overlooked, but a very compelling health care problem in the United States today. Many people do not realize that birth defects are the leading cause of infant deaths in the United States. This year alone, an estimated 150,000 babies will be born with a serious birth defect, and one out of every five of these babies will die. Nationally, birth defects affect 3 percent of all births, and among the babies who survive, birth defects are a significant cause of lifelong disability. Depending on the particular type of problem and its severity, special medical treatment, education, rehabilitation and other services may be required into adulthood, costing billions of dollars each year. 
A 1995 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report revealed that the lifetime cost for just 18 common birth defects occurring in a single year is $8 billion. Yet, only about 22 percent of those born with birth defects are included in these figures. And, of course, it is impossible to measure the pain and the heartache that birth defects cause. 
Let me share with you just a couple of experiences I have had in Missouri. I have worked for a long time to improve children's health. I appropriated money in the early 1970's in Missouri to fund the high-cost, but highly effective, neonatal care units at our hospitals. They do a wonderful job of saving very-low-birth-weight babies and babies with severe defects. But that is not enough. We can do some things to lower the incidence of birth defects, and birth defects can strike any family. 
I know, many people say one of the real problems is we have too many young women, often unmarried, who do not know that you cannot use tobacco or alcohol or drugs during pregnancy without expecting a bad birth outcome. 
But there are many other things that we have only recently learned that are extremely important. Four hundred milligrams a day of folic acid, vitamin B, for women of childbearing years can substantially reduce the risk of a child born with spina bifida. A very good friend of ours had a child born with spina bifida. He was a wonderful young man, but he has had to go through many expensive operations. His parents went through much heartache, and he still is not able to move as the rest of us can. 
Birth defects can be dealt with if we have a concerted national strategy to direct the Centers for Disease Control to collect the information on birth defects, to provide funding and support in research at the State level and to set up five regional centers to deal with birth defects. A few years ago, the incidence of birth defects became a very major concern in certain Hispanic communities in southwest Texas, and, as a result, the Hispanic caucus joined with me in past years, in past sessions of Congress, to sponsor this legislation. 
We were able to appropriate some moneys for the Centers for Disease Control, but we have not been able to establish a national strategy, maybe because there are not lobbyists for those who have not yet been born who may be at risk of birth defects, but there are effective spokespeople, like the March of Dimes, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and a long list of distinguished organizations. 
The time has come to join with them, with the Easter Seals Society, the American Hospital Association, and all of the other organizations, in developing and directing the Centers for Disease Control to work with States and local governments to survey birth defects, to bring together the information on birth defects so that researchers have a means of dealing with it. 
Mr. President, birth defects are the leading cause of infant death in the United States. This year alone, an estimated 150,000 babies will be born with a serious birth defect, and 1 out of every 5 of these babies will die. 
In addition, birth defects affect 3 percent of all births nationally. 
Among babies who survive, birth defects are a significant cause of lifelong disability. Depending on the particular type of problem and its severity, special medical treatment, education, rehabilitation, and other services may be required into adulthood--costing billions of dollars each year. 
A 1995 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report revealed that the lifetime cost for just 18 common birth defects occurring in a single year is $8 billion--yet only about 22 percent of those born with birth defects are included in these figures. 
And, of course, it is impossible to measure the pain and heartache that birth defects cause. 
It may surprise you to learn that the United States does not have a coordinated strategy for reducing the incidence of birth defects. It is both shocking and disappointing how few Federal resources are devoted to prevent this tragic, perhaps even partly preventable public health problem. 
So today, in an effort to tackle this devastating problem head on, I am introducing the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997. Congressmen Solomon Ortiz and Henry Bonilla are simultaneously introducing this bill in the House of Representatives. 
This bill will prioritize our efforts and make congressional intent clear--more resources should be directed to the prevention of the leading killer of babies, birth defects. 
An unfortunate situation in the State of Texas a few years ago exemplifies how the lack of a birth defects prevention strategy delayed the response to an outbreak of birth defects and may have needlessly cost innocent lives. Health professionals in Texas observed that six infants were born with anencephaly over a 6-week period. Anencephaly is a fetal birth defect characterized by an absence of brain tissue. 
The Texas Department of Health conducted a study after this information was reported. The study revealed that since 1989, at least 30 infants in south Texas had been born without or with little brain tissue. However, because Texas did not have a birth defects surveillance program, the severity of the problem was not recognized until the incidence of anencephaly was so high that it was difficult to miss. 
This tragic event in south Texas underscores the need for a coordinated national effort to research the causes of birth defects and to prevent such defects from occurring in the first place. A little prevention goes a long way in preventing family pain and heartache. It is up to our Nation to seize on this excellent opportunity to protect our most vulnerable resources--our children. 
To achieve the goal of protecting our Nation's kids, this legislation does several things. 
First, the bill provides Federal grants to State health authorities for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and reporting birth defects statistics. Today, only about half of the States have some kind of birth defects surveillance system. 
Second, this legislation calls for the establishment of at least five regional centers of birth defects prevention research. These regional programs will collect and analyze information on the number, incidence, and causes of birth defects within a region as well as provide education and training for health professionals aimed at the prevention of birth defects. 
At least one of the centers will focus on birth defects among ethnic minorities. 
Third, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] is directed to be the coordinating agency for birth defects prevention activities. The CDC will serve as a clearinghouse for the collection and storage of data generated from State and regional birth defects monitoring programs. 
Finally, grants will be available to State departments of health, universities, or other private, or nonprofit entities to develop and implement birth defect prevention strategies, such as programs using folic acid vitamin supplements to prevent spina bifida and alcohol avoidance strategies to prevent fetal alcohol syndrome. 
Again, when we talk about birth defects, it is important to note that many birth defects are preventable. For instance, we now know that a simple 400 mg dose of the B vitamin folic acid each day could prevent 50 to 70 percent of all cases of spina bifida and anencephaly--saving about $245 million annually and more importantly, saving some families the heart ache that many of us have witnessed friends and families go through. 
We must broaden public and professional awareness of birth defects and prevention opportunities, and we must have a coordinated national strategy to achieve this goal. 
The economic and emotional burden of birth defects on families and society as a whole presents a vivid, human picture of the need for a national research and prevention strategy. 
Although infant mortality in the United States has been falling steadily over the past few decades, 25 other countries have lower infant mortality rates than the United States. 
This bill is an important step in improving the health of our Nation. The tragedy of birth defects compels our Nation to become a stronger partner for charitable and medical groups in fulfilling our obligation to protect our Nation's most vulnerable population. Let us hope that more tragedies are not necessary to push Congress into action. 
This legislation has the support of many national organizations, including: the March of Dimes Foundation, the Spina Bifida Association of America, American Academy of Pediatrics, National Association of Children's Hospitals, the National Easter Seals Society, American Association of Mental Retardation, Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, and the American Hospital Association. 
The bill also has broad bipartisan support. 
Let me conclude by taking special note of the help of the National and Missouri March of Dimes, as well as numerous health and child advocate organizations, for their assistance in developing and advocating this legislation. Specifically, I wish to thank Dr. Jennifer Howse, Jo Merrill, and Marina Weiss of the March of Dimes for their persistence and commitment to this endeavor.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a measure, along with my dear friend and colleague, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator John Chafee, entitled the Highway Trust Fund Integrity Act of 1997. Our cosponsors are Senators Nickles, Cochran, and Gregg. 
Mr. President, I hope all of us understand that transportation and highway funding is critical to our individual States and the entire Nation. Good highways link our communities, towns, and cities with markets. They link our constituents with their schools, hospitals, churches, and jobs. 
An effective transportation system should move us into the 21st century. Back in 1956, the Federal Highway Trust Fund was established as a way to finance the Federal Aid Highway Program. This was to be a dedicated trust fund, supported by direct user fees and taxes. It was called a trust fund because once the money went in, we were supposed to be able to trust that that money would come back out for use on our roads, highways, and bridges. 
However, the 1990 Budget Act eliminated the linkage between the revenues raised by the user taxes and the spending from the transportation fund. We know now that what we promised ourselves and our constituents, that the highway trust fund user taxes would be deposited and the trust fund would be used for highways, has not been observed. We see now an illogical process that allows highway trust fund dollars not to be spent in order to permit spending more in other categories. I believe that is wrong. My constituents are telling me this is wrong and they have challenged me to find a solution. I believe we have come up with that solution. 
Let me explain, briefly, Mr. President, what the bill is: First, it is a budget bill, not a tax bill or an ISTEA highway authorization bill. This bill would ensure that the highway trust fund dollars are spent for the purposes for which they were intended and that it would be deficit neutral. The bill would reestablish the link between the highway trust fund taxes and highway spending by transferring the taxes and the spending to a new budget category--a revenue constrained fund--that is part of the unified budget. This new category would have its own budget rules to ensure that highway programs were fully funded and deficit neutral. This bill would restore the trust to the trust fund because highway spending would equal the highway trust fund taxes collected the prior year. 
It is consistent with achieving a balanced budget because it comes with its own built-in cap--the revenue received from the highway trust fund. It does not take the highway trust fund off-budget, but it also does not attempt to spend the balances that have accumulated or the interest on those balances. We do not attempt to resolve the arguments of the past. Instead we have focused on developing a workable process for the future. 
I do not believe that the status quo is sustainable, primarily for two reasons. 
First, our country has tremendous infrastructure needs. Take my State of Missouri alone. A recent report by the Road Information Program stated that Missouri has the seventh highest percentage of structurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges in the country, and that more than half of its major roads are in poor or mediocre condition and in need of improvement. My State has the third highest percentage of urban freeway congestion in the Nation, and highway fatalities in Missouri have increased by 17 percent since 1993. These statistics will continue to grow as vehicle travel continues to grow and the infrastructure crumbles. 
Second, I know that my constituents, and I would say the American public, will not continue to support a process that sentences transportation spending to compete with other discretionary programs despite its unique dedicated funding source. 
Mr. President, I do not want to take much more time, but there is one more issue I would like to address. Senator Chafee and I have focused on the highway account of the highway trust fund. The bill we are introducing today does not address the mass transit account of the highway trust fund. It is not included due to some concern transit advocates have expressed--not in regards to the budget process being proposed, but over the level of funding that transit receives. I believe it is important that a workable solution be found for transit and I am committed to working with the Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction for the transit programs, and transit advocates in developing a proposal. 
I want to thank my dear friend Senator Chafee for his leadership in the area of transportation. We will have ample opportunity to continue our work together as the reauthorization of ISTEA progresses. Senator Chafee has heard me 100 times stress the need for a formula change so I will not get into that one today. I do however want to thank him and his staff for their help on this legislation. 
Mr. President, let me close by saying that this bill is the basis for a transportation funding policy for the future--a starting point for a fairer, more forward-looking transportation funding policy. I hope my colleagues will join us and cosponsor this important bill.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Mandates Information Act of 1997. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation, and I applaud my distinguished colleague from Michigan, Mr. Abraham, for his leadership in this effort. 
The bill we are introducing today continues the work begun in the 104th Congress with the enactment of the `Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995--the 1995 act--authored by Mr. Kempthorne to ensure that Congress is well advised of the cost unfunded mandates would impose on State and local governments. I was a cosponsor of the 1995 act, and I believe the time has come for us to expand its provisions to require similar detailed information and accountability on unfunded mandates affecting the private sector--so we can protect consumers, workers, and small businesses. 
As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business, I am all too aware of the disproportionate burden Federal regulations impose on our Nation's small businesses. A 1995 study found that an average firm with less than 20 employees spent approximately $5,500 per employee in 1992 to comply with Federal regulations--compared with $3,000 per employee by firms with 500 or more employees. The overall cost to the economy is between 6 and 9 percent of gross domestic product--between $420-670 billion--in 1995 dollars--in regulatory compliance. Before we permit the Federal Government to adopt any new mandate that would add to this burden, the Congress needs to be fully informed of the new costs to be imposed on the economy so we can make an informed judgment. 
The reforms proposed in this bill are needed to ensure that the Congress gives careful and thoughtful consideration to the impact unfunded mandates impose on the private sector. The ability of small businesses to compete and create new jobs can be hindered by unfunded mandates, we need to be aware of the magnitude of any future adverse effects. The Committee on Small Business will continue its work to ensure that the Government's actions here in Washington foster the growth of small businesses located on Main Street. This bill will help to ensure that all Members of Congress are equally informed of the effects a bill would have on the customers, employees, and owners of America's small businesses, the engine of our Nation's economic growth. 
The legislation Senator Abraham and I are introducing today will ensure that the private sector impact of unfunded mandates is addressed during deliberations on legislation imposing those mandates. Consumers, workers, and small businesses will benefit from the reforms to enhance congressional deliberations on unfunded mandates affecting the private sector. The Mandates Information Act of 1997 establishes a new parliamentary point of order against any bill that will impose private sector mandates exceeding a $100 million cost threshold. The measure directs the Congressional Budget Office to estimate the impact of the proposed unfunded mandates on consumer costs, worker wages, and the availability of goods and services. 
As with the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act of 1995, the point of order authorized by the bill would bar the House or Senate from further action on a proposed measure unless a majority agrees to move forward with the initiative. By authorizing a point of order triggered by private sector impacts, the legislation introduced today puts teeth into 
the law to ensure that Congress addresses the costs that would be imposed by the unfunded mandates on small businesses, consumers, and workers. This change requires Members of Congress to go on record as either supporting or opposing an unfunded mandate that would add costs to the private sector. 
With the aid of a consumer, worker, and small business impact statement, Members of Congress will have the information required to make an informed decision on the merit of imposing a mandate without also providing funding for compliance. The impact statement would be prepared by the Congressional Budget Office--which the bill directs to estimate the economic impact of a proposed mandate on consumers, wages, and the availability of goods and services. 
All in all, this bill is about good governance. It provides information to ensure that Congress is fully informed on the impact of an unfunded mandate on the economy and the private sector in particular. By tasking the Congressional Budget Office with preparing an impact statement, the bill also provides important information to educate Congress on the effect of pending legislation. This, in itself, is an important step toward ensuring that the needs and concerns of small businesses, and the workers and customers that depend on small businesses, are given the attention they deserve by Congress. As with the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996--or the Red-Tape Reduction Act as I prefer to call it--today's bill seeks to ensure that the Government treats small business fairly. The Mandates Information Act has the support of the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Restaurant Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Association, the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, and the Small Business Survival Committee--I urge my colleagues to join our efforts to enact this bill and enhance our efforts to ensure good governance.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a measure on behalf of myself, Senator Ashcroft, and Senator Byrd which would prohibit permanently the use of Federal funds for human cloning research. I am sure most Americans by now have heard about the successful cloning of Dolly, the sheep, by Scottish scientists. Many people are now asking can similar techniques be used to clone a human being? Something that was once thought to be only science fiction is now close to being a reality. 
With the legislation I introduce today, I intend to make sure that human cloning stays within the realm of science fiction and does not become a reality. The bill that I am introducing with my colleagues today will place a permanent ban on Federal funding for human cloning or human cloning research. We must send a clear signal: Human cloning is something we cannot and should not tolerate. This type of research on humans is morally reprehensible. We should not be creating human beings for spare parts or as replacements. Moreover, a National Institutes of Health human embryo panel noted, `allowing society to create genetically identical persons would devalue human life by undermining the individuality of human beings.' 
In a September 1994 report of the Human Embryo Research Panel, the heading is, `Research Considered Unacceptable for Federal Funding.' It said: 
Four ethical considerations entered into the deliberations of the panel as it determined what types of research were unacceptable for Federal funding: The potential adverse consequences of the research for children, women and men; the respect due the reimplantation embryo; concern for public sensitivities in highly controversial research proposals, and concern for the meaning of humanness, parenthood, and the successions of generations. 
The President has said we should study the issue. President Clinton has asked a Federal bioethicist board to consider the implications of this research and report back to him within 90 days. I do not think we need to study this. I think we can save the board some effort because the President's own administration has concluded that human cloning was `research considered unacceptable for Federal funding.' There are some aspects of life which simply ought to be off limits to science. 
I think it will be helpful to go through some of the ethical considerations the board looked at. First, they asked: Is it ethical to create genetically identical individuals who can be born at different times? Is it ethical to store a frozen human embryo that is genetically identical to a born child in order to serve as a later source for organ and tissue transplantation; thus treating humans as spare parts? Is it ethical to create a genetically identical child as a replacement in case the first child dies? 
Again, these are just a sample of the ethical questions the issue poses. 
The board concluded the analysis by stating:  
There are broad moral concerns about the deliberate duplication of an individual genome. The notion of cloning an existing human being or of making `carbon copies' of an existing embryo appears repugnant to members of the public. Many Members of the panel share this view and see no justification for Federal funding of such research. 
I also should point out an important distinction with this bill. It is narrowly drafted so that it only affects human cloning research. It does not address the issue of plant and animal cloning research, and it will also allow--and I personally strongly support--NIH to continue its human genome mapping project. 
I have long been a supporter of biotechnology, genome mapping and manipulation, and even plant and animal cloning. But we can draw a clear line here. For plants and animals, it makes sense to clone your specimens to improve human health and human well-being. But when we are talking about creating an entire human being, identical to another, we are talking about playing God, and that is where we must draw the line. 
I note, the Vatican and leading ethicists throughout the country have called for a ban on human cloning and human cloning research.

 Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to recognize the Mingo Job Corps Civilian Conservation Center of Puxico, MO, for service to its community. Established in 1965 as a vocational training center for disadvantaged youth, it is one of 30 centers designated by Congress to be a civilian conservation center. 
Located on the Mingo National Wildlife Refuge, Mingo Job Corps provides a full-time year round residential program which gives students the opportunity to complete their secondary education and acquire a vocational skill. 
The Mingo Job Corps Center has completed millions of dollars worth of community service projects, such as construction and painting for local schools and museums, and supporting Earth Day and Ecology Day projects. I wish Mingo the best of luck in all future endeavors and continued success in its service to others.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I introduce the HUBZone Act of 1997. The purpose underlying this bill is to create new opportunities for growth in distressed urban and rural communities, which have suffered tremendous economic decline. This legislation would provide for an immediate infusion of cash through the creation of new jobs in our Nation's economically distressed areas. During the 8 years I served as Governor of Missouri, I met frequently with community leaders who were seeking help in attracting business and jobs to their cities, their central downtown areas, their towns, and the rural areas of the State. We tried various programs, including the enterprise-zone concept, and we met with limited success. I am proud of the successes that we achieved there. But now, as U.S. Senator and as chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I continue to receive similar pleas for help. I hear the concerns expressed to me by people from all over my State. Since we have had the opportunity to expand hearings in other States, we have heard from other States as well. 
So far, nothing that we put in place is the best formula for bringing economic hope and independence to these communities. The message, however, has changed somewhat. Although help from the Federal Government has been forthcoming, there is still high unemployment and poverty. For example, when I was talking about a summer jobs program with one very, very good community leader, he told me that the summer jobs program was nice, but, he said, `Stop sending me job training money. What we need right here in this part of the city is jobs, and more jobs. We have all the job training money we need. We need jobs to put these young people to work.' And that is a problem that I hear time and time again. 
Last March, I chaired a hearing before the Committee on Small Business on revitalizing inner cities and rural America and S. 1574, the HUBZone Act of 1996, which is nearly identical to the bill I am introducing today. Testifying before the committee were the cofounder and employees of e.villages, which has established a data management enterprise at Edgewood Terrace, an assisted multifamily housing project right here in Washington, DC. Residents of the housing project have been trained and they have established a new enterprise, Edgewood Technology Services, or ETS, which to me is a prototype HUBZone business. 
The HUBZone Act of 1997 can have an important impact on our Nation's economically distressed inner cities as housing and income subsidies are reduced and put under constraints and as we work toward the national goal of moving people off the welfare rolls and into meaningful jobs. 
Testifying in support of the HUBZone Act of 1996 was C. Austin Fitts, cofounder of e.villages, who testified about the `significant relationship between' S. 1574 and Federal housing policy. Ms. Fitts emphasized the importance of this legislation to create new inner city jobs for unemployed or underemployed residents. 
The income generated by these new HUBZone jobs can offset the reduction of housing and income supplements. Furthermore, as an employee of ETS testified in support of the HUBZone bill, `We at e.villages are encouraged that the Congress is trying to find some ways to get work for us to do, and to enhance our standard of living.' 
I do not claim that the HUBZone Act of 1997 is going to solve all the problems, but I think it is a significant step in the right direction. These people who benefited from an enterprise started up in an assisted housing development without the benefit of the HUBZone provisions know that their example of success can be expanded. It can work and it can work on a broader basis. And it can bring more and more people into productive employment. 
What distinguishes the HUBZone Act of 1997 from some other excellent proposals and well-intentioned efforts is that this bill would have an immediate impact on economically distressed communities. In recent years, numerous legislative proposals have stressed the importance of changing the U.S. Tax Code and providing other incentives to attract businesses to the needy communities. 
Many of these proposals have merit, and I have supported them. As I said, I have supported enterprise zones. I have recommended it to the Missouri General Assembly. As Governor, I signed it into law. I saw it work. I saw it could bring benefits to areas of high unemployment. I urge my colleagues on other committees to take a look at those measures which can have an impact. No one of them is going to be the total solution. Let us move forward on all of them. 
But I ask my colleagues to focus on the critical differences between those proposals and the provisions of the HUBZone Act of 1997. Under the HUBZone bill, entire communities would benefit because we would create absolute incentives for small businesses to operate and provide employment directly within America's most disadvantaged inner city neighborhoods and in the areas of high unemployment and poverty in rural areas. It is a matter of timing. The HUBZone Act of 1997 helps communities and their residents now. This bill is a matter of direct focus. This is not just incentives; this is bringing business to the areas of high unemployment and high poverty. 
Specifically, the HUBZone Act of 1997 creates a new class of small businesses eligible for Federal Government contract set-asides and preferences. 
To be eligible, a small business must be located in what we call a Historically Underutilized Business Zone--that is where HUBZone comes from, Historically Underutilized Business Zone--and not less than 35 percent of the work force must reside in a HUBZone. That is a key difference between some of the programs that are initially targeting to bring jobs to areas of need, bring jobs where social problems had flared up, such as the Watts riots many years ago. 
It is important to contrast the HUBZone proposal with the Executive order promulgated by President Clinton to establish an empowerment contracting commission. I commend the President for focusing on the value of targeting Federal Government assistance to low-income communities, but I think the program falls short of meeting the goal of helping low-income communities and their residents. For example, under the President's plan, any business, large or small, located in a low-income community, would qualify for a valuable contracting preference, even if it does not employ one resident of the community. This is clearly a major deficiency or loophole when trying to assist the unemployed or underemployed. 
A further weakness in the President's proposal is the failure to define more clearly criteria which makes a community eligible for this program. Unfortunately, we see the possibility, and it has been set forth in specific detail by the inspector general of HUD, that a lack of objective criteria may invite other influences in the political selection of an area to receive these preferences. 
We must avoid creating another Federal Government program that ends up helping well-off individuals and companies while failing to have a significant impact on the poor, the unemployed and the underemployed. 
I think the HUBZone Act of 1997 can and will make a difference. It makes a contracting preference available only if the small business is located in an economically distressed area and employs 35 percent of its work force from a HUBZone. This is a significant difference and one that is clearly designed to help attack deeply seated poverty in too many areas of the United States. 
To qualify for the program, the small business must certify to the Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration that it is located in a HUBZone and will comply with certain rules governing subcontracting. In addition, a qualified small business must agree to perform at least 50 percent of the contract in a HUBZone, unless the terms of the contract require they be located outside the HUBZone. That would happen, for example, with a service contract requiring the small business' employees and workers be present in a Government-owned or leased building. In the latter case, no less than 50 percent of the work must be performed by employees who reside in a HUBZone. 
Mr. President, the HUBZone Act of 1997 is designed to cut through Government redtape, while stressing a streamlined effort to place Government contracts and new jobs in economically distressed communities. Americans don't want another new law that creates a cottage industry of consultants necessary to fill out Government paperwork for a new Federal program. 
Many of my colleagues are familiar with SBA's 8(a) Minority Small Business Program and the sometimes cumbersome rules for small businesses seeking to qualify for the program. Typically, an applicant to the 8(a) program has to hire a lawyer to help prepare the application and shepherd it through SBA. The procedure can take months. In fact, Congress was forced to legislate the maximum time the agency could review an application in our last-ditch effort to speed up the process. 
The HUBZone Act of 1997 is specifically designed to avoid bureaucratic roadblocks that have delayed and discouraged small businesses from taking advantage of Government programs. Simply put, if you are a small business located in a HUBZone and you employ people from a HUBZone, at least 35 percent, then you are eligible. Once eligible, the small business notifies the SBA of its participation in the HUBZone program and is qualified to 
receive Federal Government contract benefits. 
My goal is to have new Government contracts being awarded to small businesses in economically distressed communities. Therefore, I have included some fairly ambitious goals for each Government agency to meet. 
In 1998, 1 percent of the total value of all prime Government contracts would be awarded to small businesses in HUBZones. The goal would increase to 2 percent in 1999, 3 percent in 2000 and 4 percent in the year 2001 and each succeeding year. 
HUBZone contracting is a bold undertaking. Passage of the HUBZone Act of 1997 will create more hope for inner cities with high unemployment, distressed rural communities where poverty and joblessness reign and have too long been ignored. Most importantly, passage of the HUBZone Act will create hope for hundreds of thousands of underemployed or unemployed who long ago thought our country had given up on them. The hope is tangible; the hope is for jobs and income. 
I think this bill can deliver. I soon hope to chair additional hearings before the Committee on Small Business on the HUBZone Act of 1997 and the role our Nation's small business community can play in revitalizing our distressed cities and counties. I firmly believe the HUBZone proposal has great merit. I urge my colleagues to study this proposal and give me their comments. I ask for cosponsors and I ask for good ideas. There are many, many ideas which have been incorporated in this bill that were presented to me by colleagues, both on the Small Business Committee and elsewhere. 
I ask all of my colleagues, particularly if they are concerned about unemployment and underemployment in areas of their States--and I know of very few States that don't have that problem--I ask them to sit down with us and talk about how we can make this a better program. I would like to see it passed. I think it could provide a very significant boost and help get our country on the right track.

Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong reservations about the administration's foreign policies as we debate the confirmation of Ambassador Madeleine Albright as Secretary of State. 
Following President Clinton's direction, Ambassador Albright signed the United Nations Rights of the Child Convention, a document which I believe is seriously flawed. As a nation, we hold our children dear. We have established laws on a national level and local levels to adequately protect our children and the rights of our families. The idea that a foreign state or an international federation knows better than we how to raise our children is abhorrent to our very essence. 
We have engaged in diplomatic and physical conflict with other nations throughout our entire history over just such an issue. The root of all autocratic regimes has been that the state knows best. We cannot, we must not let that idea insinuate itself into how we conduct ourselves as a nation. I am concerned that Ambassador Albright through her vote in the United Nations, may have done just that. 
Her support of policies which have come dangerously close to relinquishing command of our own troops to United Nations commanders who may or may not share the democratic ethic of our command authority concerned me in the past and concerns me today. 
The rules under which our troops conduct themselves while assigned to duties with the United Nations places them under extraordinary pressure. Our soldiers are required to make judgments as to appropriateness of orders received by U.N. authorities not only as to their legality but as to whether the commands are in concert with United States policy. We should never place them in such a position, ever. Currently, if the policy of the United States comes into conflict with U.N. orders, it becomes incumbent upon the individual soldier to recognize the conflict and make the proper choice as to whether to follow the order or not. Recently though, to complicate that soldier's responsibility further, U.S. policy shifts have occurred during ongoing operations; peacekeeping mutating to nation building, embargo enforcement un-enforced. Ambassador Albright must not let this happen on her watch. 
As Secretary of State, Ambassador Albright will be responsible for directing and implementing our foreign policy. I hope that if our stated policy for instance, is to impose an arms embargo on a war torn region that she would neither tacitly approve nor be a part of a plan to approve the introduction of inflammatory religious extremists and the weapons they chose to introduce into the region while hiding that fact from this body, the rest of the Congress or the American people. 
As Secretary of State she must realize that the sovereignty of the United States can never be made secondary to any country, entity or organization.
