 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the remarkable achievements of one of my constituents, Rachael Younkers, who has won the title of 1999 Maryland Teacher of the Year. This honor is a tribute to her dedication to and mastery of the art of teaching seventh and eighth grade students at Plum Point Middle School, and is even more impressive by the fact that this 27-year-old is the youngest person ever to win the award in its twelve year history. I am so proud to congratulate Mrs. Younkers, the first winner from Southern Maryland, for being named the 1999 Maryland Teacher of the Year from 23 other Maryland candidates. 
Mrs. Younkers is a native of Calvert County who, according to students and peers alike, brings a unique energy to her classes which serves to excite her students about social studies topics that may otherwise seem dull or out-of-date. Through the use of innovative teaching techniques, including learning games and exploration of the internet, Mrs. Younkers has brought a fresh perspective to her teachings. 
It has always been my firm belief that the education and training of our young people is one of the most important tasks in a democratic society. Mr. President, I would like my colleagues to join me in recognizing the hard work that has led Mrs. Younkers to receive this recognition. I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Southern Maryland Extra to the Washington Post be inserted into the Record immediately following my remarks, and I yield the floor.  
In Room, 216 at Plum Point Middle School, social studies teacher Rachael Younkers is quizzing her students on the great European explorers: Christopher Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Sir Francis Drake and so forth. You wouldn't think a roomful of 13-year-olds would be interested in a bunch of long-dead strangers, but that's clearly not the case in this class. 
Hand after hand shoots up in the air, students eager to supply the appropriate answers. Later, when the class adjourns to the library, the youngsters rush about looking for the needed information. There's a certain excitement in the air, a feeling that school and learning and even homework can be, well, fun. 
Plum Point Principal Michael Reidy sums up the situation this way: `Mrs. Younkers has a spirit about her that creates magic in the classroom.' 
That spirit has won Younkers the title of 1999 Maryland Teacher of the Year. Younkers, 27, is the youngest teacher to win the award in its 12-year history and the first from Southern Maryland. She received the award--which includes a $5,000 check and other prizes--at a ceremony Friday evening in Baltimore. 
Younkers has taught seventh- and eighth-grade social studies at the Huntingtown school for five years, her entire career in education. Younkers, a native of Calvert County, said her inspiration in teaching has been her mother, a social studies teacher at Northern High School. One of the most important lessons her mother passed along was the importance of actively involving students in their education, she said. 
`My teaching philosophy is based on an ancient Chinese proverb: `Tell me, I forget. Show me, I remember. Involve me, I understand,' Younkers said. 
And involve her students she does. During a class on Tuesday, Younkers divided her 28 eighth-graders into teams and dispatched them to the library to research a specific explorer. Among their tasks: Finding the explorer's photograph on the Internet, drawing a detailed picture of his ship and writing a daily log of weather conditions during his voyage. The students even had to compose a letter to the king and queen explaining why they should fund the explorer's trip. 
`Learning is not a spectator sport,' Younkers said. `The kids are the actual players in the game, and they need to be actively involved in their own learning. I see myself as a partner in their education, and that's how we win.' 
Her students seem to like the technique. `It's not like we're talking about a lot of dead guys,' said Nathan Bowen, an eighth-grader from Prince Frederick. `She really brings it to life.' 
Nathan said he especially likes all the fun games Younkers comes up with, including baseball and basketball matches that are played in the classroom and adapted to the subject being studied. Treasure hunts and `Social Studies Jeopardy' also are frequent occurrences in Room 216. 
Larkin Jones, also an eighth-grader, said she admires her teacher's personality. `She's always smiling and happy, and she knows a lot about you.' And that fact that she's young makes it `really easy to talk to her,' Jones said. 
Indeed, Younkers has made such an impression on Larkin that she recently confided in her mother that she might want to be a social studies teacher when she grows up, `just like Mrs. Younkers.' 
`She's been a tremendous influence on her,' said Donna Jones, Larkin's mother. Jones, a guidance counselor at Plum Point added that Younkers has a unique ability to help all students--whether they're honor roll or in need of remedial instruction.' As a counselor, it's very comforting to know that no matter what level a student is, if they have Mrs. Younkers, they'll have a wonderful year.' 
Younkers beat out 23 state semi-finalists, who were chosen from among Maryland's 49,000 teachers. She now advances to the national Teacher of the Year competition. 
For the national contest, she must adopt an issue that she will advocate. Younkers said she will work to encourage the best and the brightest students to become teachers. Maryland, like other states, will face a severe teacher shortage in coming years, and, as Younkers said, `Our students deserve to learn from highly qualified instructors.' 
The national Teacher of the Year will be selected in the spring. In the meantime, Younkers is maintaining a rigorous speaking tour--talking to other educators, as well as politicians--and her students are getting used to the extra media attention and the parents who stop by with gifts and words of praise.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to note that yesterday both Houses of Congress passed the `Africa: Seeds of Hope Act of 1998,' clearing the measure for signature by the President. This legislation, which I introduced together with my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, in July, is designed to prevent hunger and malnutrition in Africa while at the same time helping American farmers and developing lasting and mutually beneficial ties between our peoples. 
Food security is critical to establishing the basis for long-term peace, democracy and prosperity in Africa. By redirecting existing bilateral aid and investment programs toward small-scale farming and rural development, the `Seeds of Hope Act' will promote sustainable agricultural development and food security in sub-Saharan Africa. Further, this initiative will foster research and extension activities and help to build local markets, providing important opportunities for mutual cooperation between U.S. and African farmers, educators, scientists and entrepreneurs. 
The bill, as adopted, is intended to accomplish several important objectives. First, it aims at providing new opportunities for the poorest of the poor, especially women, by expanding access to credit and technology, improving information and farming techniques, and creating more efficient market mechanisms. 
Second, it is designed to maximize the efficiency of current aid programs. It directs the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to focus more of its efforts on projects that improve food security and meet the needs of the rural poor, and requires the participation of affected communities in all phases of project planning and development. The initiative strengthens coordination with non-governmental organizations, cooperatives, educational institutions and local marketing associations that have relevant expertise. In this way, it encourages the latest agricultural methods and most successful business practices, while ensuring they are appropriate to local conditions and adapted to specific climates. 
Third, this legislation mobilizes new resources for investment in African agriculture and rural development through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), working with small businesses and other U.S. entities to develop the capacities of small-scale farmers and rural entrepreneurs. Particularly in this budgetary environment, it is essential to expand the public-private partnership in this area. 
Finally, the `Africa: Seeds of Hope Act' establishes a new and more reliable mechanism for providing emergency food aid overseas. Rather than waiting until emergencies arise to purchase food for donation, the bill establishes a humanitarian trust that buys commodities when they are in surplus and distributes them immediately when they are needed. This mechanism will allow for more timely and cost-effective responses to humanitarian crises. 
Mr. President, a great deal of planning and hard work went into the passage of this legislation, not only by my colleagues and their staff members but especially by the private, voluntary organizations involved in sustainable development, such as Catholic Relief Services and Bread for the World. These organizations work directly with the African communities most affected by hunger and famine, and their input into this process was quite valuable. I commend them for their efforts, and I know they join me in welcoming the passage of this important piece of legislation.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to a man who has dedicated his life to improving opportunities for others. He is Dr. Kenneth Jernigan, who served as President of the National Federation of the Blind from 1968 to 1986 and as the Federation's President Emeritus until his death on October 12, 1998. In these capacities, Dr. Jernigan has become widely recognized and highly respected as the principal leader of the organized blind movement in the United States. 
On September 14, 1998, Mr. President, I was privileged to attend an especially moving ceremony to recognize Dr. Jernigan for worldwide leadership in the development of technology to assist blind people. The award, consisting of $15,000 Canadian and a 2-ounce gold medallion, was given by the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, and the event was held at the Canadian Embassy here in Washington. 
This recognition by our neighbors to the north was a tangible expression, Mr. President, of the respect which Dr. Jernigan has earned throughout his lifetime of service on behalf of blind people in the United States and around the world. Through his grit, determination, and skill, Dr. Jernigan achieved personal success. But more important than that, as a lifetime teacher and mentor, he gave others the chance for success as well. 
Born blind in 1926, Kenneth Jernigan grew up on a small Tennessee farm with little hope and little opportunity. But, Mr. President, in the story of Kenneth Jernigan, from his humble beginning in the hills of Tennessee to his stature as a national--and even an international--leader, the story of what is right with American is told. 
Dr. Jernigan may have been blind in the physical sense, Mr. President, but he was a man of vision nonetheless. In his leadership of the National Federation of the Blind, he taught all of us to understand that eyesight and insight are not related to each other in any way. Although he did not have eyesight, his insight on life, learning, and leading has no equal. 
Mr. President, for those who knew him and loved him, for the blind of this country and beyond, and for the National Federation of the Blind--the organization that he loved and built--the world without Kenneth Jernigan will be difficult. But the world he has left in death is a far better world because of his life. 
The legacy which Dr. Jernigan has left is shown in the hundreds of thousands of lives that he touched and the lives that will still be touched by his example and the continuing power of his teaching. This will be the case for many generations to come. Mr. President, Kenneth Jernigan will be missed most by his family and friends, but his loss will be shared by all of us because he cared for all of us. He cared enough to give of himself. With the strength of his voice and the power of his intellect, he brought equality and freedom to the blind. As he did so, Mr. President, Kenneth Jernigan taught us all to love one another and live with dignity. That is the real and lasting legacy of Kenneth Jernigan. 
Mr. President, on September 24, 1998, an article entitled `Friends Pay Homage to Crusader for the Blind, Jernigan Still Working Despite Lung Cancer' appeared in the Baltimore Sun. Because it presents a fitting tribute to Dr. Jernigan's life and work, I ask to insert the text of this article in the Record at this point. 
The article follows. 
Friends Pay Homage to Crusader for the Blind, Jernigan Still Working Despite Lung Cancer  
A steady stream of old friends--maybe 200 in the past months--have been visiting Kenneth Jernigan at his home in Irvington. Pals who followed the old fighter for the blind as he tenaciously led fights for jobs, for access, for independent living, for Braille, and for civil rights have come to say thank you and goodbye to a dying blind man they say expanded horizons for thousands of people. James Omvig, a 63-year-old blind lawyer, and his sighted wife Sharon flew from Tucson, Ariz., to visit with the president emeritus of the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), who is in the latter stages of lung cancer. `The wonderful life I've had is all due to Dr. Jernigan,' Omvig said. In the 1950s, he `was sitting around at home' in Iowa, after learning chair-making, until he met Jernigan and began studying Braille and other subjects. Omvig then graduated from college, got a law degree, became the first blind person hired by the National Labor Relations Board and later developed programs for the blind at Social Security in Baltimore, Alaska, and elsewhere. 
One topic of conversation among the friends has been Jernigan's latest project, a proposed $12 million National Research and Training Institute for the Blind for NFB headquarters in South Baltimore. 
Last week, Larry McKeever, of Des Moines, who is sighted and has recorded material for the 50,000-member federation, came to chat and cook breakfast for the Jernigans. Donald Capps, the blind leader of 58 South Carolina NFB chapters, called to congratulate Jernigan on being honored recently at the Canadian Embassy for his Newsline invention that enables the blind to hear daily newspapers. 
Floyd Matson, who is sighted and has worked with Jernigan for 50 years, came from Honolulu to be with `my old poetry and drinking buddy.' 
A dramatic example of the high regard in which blind people hold Jernigan came during the annual convention of 2,500 NFB members in Dallas in July. A donor contributed $5,000 to start a Kenneth Jernigan Fund to help blind people. 
Quickly, state delegations caucused and announced their own donations. The result: pledges of $137,000 in his honor. 
Jernigan, 71, who was born blind and grew up on a Tennessee farm with no electricity, learned he had incurable lung cancer in November. In the past 10 months, Jernigan has been almost as busy as ever. He has continued projects such as editing the latest in his large-type `Kernel Book' series of inspirational books for the visually impaired. But his focus has been the proposed four-story institute, for which $1 million has been raised. It will house the nerve center of an employment program; research and demonstration projects leading to jobs and independent living; technology training seminars; access technology, such as applications for voting machines, airport kiosks and information systems; and Braille literacy initiatives to reverse a 50 percent illiteracy rate among visually impaired children. 
In fighting for the blind, Jernigan has frequently been a controversial figure. Before he moved to Baltimore in 1978, the Iowa Commission for the Blind, which he headed, was the subject of a conflict-of-interest investigation by a gubernatorial committee. In the end, Gov. Robert Ray felt the committee's report vindicated the commission. The governor and the committee described the commission's program for the blind as `one of the best in the country.' 
There are good things in everything, even this illness,' said his wife, Mary Ellen Jernigan. `You expect to hear from old friends. But in letters and calls, we hear from hundreds of people we don't know.'

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I opposed the securities litigation preemption bill when it was before the Senate. I am sorry to see that the conference report now before us is no better. I continue to believe that this bill is a solution in search of a problem, and that it will do more harm than good. 
Why do I call this bill a solution in search of a problem? Because there has been no explosion in frivolous lawsuits filed in State court. The supporters of this bill allege that class action lawsuits alleging securities fraud have migrated from Federal court to State court since 1995. In fact, as I have pointed out previously, every study indicates that the number of securities fraud class actions brought in State court increased in 1996 but then declined in 1997. 
Why do I say this bill will do more harm than good? Because this bill likely will deprive individual investors of their opportunities to bring their own actions in State court, separate and apart from class actions. Although the bill's supporters suggest that it deals only with class actions, in fact the scope of the bill is much broader. The bill's definition of `class action' will pick up, against their will, individuals who choose to file their own lawsuits under State law. 
These shortcomings were not remedied in conference. Indeed, the one improvement made to the bill on the Senate floor was weakened in conference. Senators will remember that the Senate adopted an amendment to this bill, offered by Senators Bryan, Johnson, Biden, and myself. The amendment exempted State and local governments and their pension funds from the coverage of the bill. The conference report now before us weakens this provision. The conference report contains the House-passed version, which requires that State and local governments be named plaintiffs and authorize participation in the specific suit. This version offers scant protection to State and local officials. The Government Finance Officers Association, Municipal Treasurers Association, National Association of Counties, National League of Cities wrote to us concerning this provision on September 28, 1998. Their letter states, `many smaller governments and small pension plans are unable to keep abreast of pending actions. Thus, any affirmative steps on their part may not occur simply because they are unaware of the existence of such a case.' These organizations expressed their strong support for the Senate version of this provision, only to be ignored by the conference committee. 
On a positive note, I am pleased that the Statement of the Conference Committee makes clear that neither this bill nor the Litigation Reform Act of 1995 alter the scienter standard applied by the courts under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Courts in every Federal circuit in the country hold that reckless conduct constitutes scienter sufficient to establish a violation of section 10(b) and rule 10b-5, the principal antifraud provision of the 1934 act. Chairman Levitt of the SEC has described the recklessness standard as `critically important' to `the integrity of the securities markets.' 
For the reasons I have described, a broad coalition of State and local officials, senior citizen groups, labor unions, academics, and consumer groups oppose this bill. They oppose it because it may deprive defrauded investors of remedies. The headline of a column by Ben Stein in the USA Today newspaper of April 28, 1998, summarizes this opposition: `Investors, beware: Last door to fight fraud could close.' He wrote of this bill, `state remedies . . . would simply vanish, and anyone who wanted to sue would have to go into federal court, where . . . impossible standards exist.' He warned, `this is serious business for the whole investing public.' the associations of public officials I have cited are concerned about this bill because they invest taxpayers' funds and public employees' pension funds in securities, and fear they will be left without remedies if they are defrauded. Over two dozen law professors, including such nationally recognized securities law experts as John Coffee, Joel Seligman, and Marc Steinberg, expressed their opposition in a letter earlier this year. They oppose any legislation `that would deny investors their right to sue for securities fraud under state law.' Similarly, the New York State Bar Association opposes this bill. A report prepared by the bar association's section on commercial and Federal litigation concluded, `the existing data does not establish a need for the legislation' and `the proposed solution far exceeds any appropriate level of remedy for the perceived problem.' I would also like to point out the opposition of the American Association of Retired Persons, the Consumer Federation of America, the AFL-CIO, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and the United Mine Workers. 
I urge Senators, out of caution, to vote against this conference report. The recent bull market was the longest in history, and bull markets tend to conceal investment frauds. Should the decline in stock market values continue, it is likely that frauds will be uncovered. The level of participation in the stock market by America's families is at a record level, both directly through ownership 
 of stocks and indirectly through pension funds and mutual funds. Should this bill be enacted, investors will find their State court remedies eliminated. In too many cases, investors will be left without any effective remedies at all. Such a result can only harm innocent investors, undermine public confidence in the securities markets, and ultimately raise the cost of capital for deserving American businesses.

Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator for his intervention. That is a very important point. Because the critics stand up and say it is all going to administration. Now we learn 2.5 percent of it, Federal and State, as I understand it from the Senator, is going to administration. I think we need to underscore that. 
I want to come back to this notion that we are trying to direct where the money should go and somehow that is a departure from past practice or hasn't in the past, at least, had strong bipartisan support. 
It is clear that math and science is one of the critical areas. I earlier asked the Senator, wasn't this whole education emphasis important to the U.S. competitive role in the world economy. We can look at what other countries are doing, and we know the kind of investments they are making in math and science. We started with the Eisenhower administration, and that, I think, was at the time of Sputnik that that program was energized to try to improve the quality of math and science. We had some successes, but there has been a relapse, there has been a lapse back, and one of the programs that was cut, as I understand it from the Senator from Massachusetts, and which he is emphasizing we need to restore, is this program to improve the quality of the math and science teachers in the schools all across our country. Is that correct?

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it seems to me--and the other program, I take it, is we have a deterioration in the physical quality of many of our public schools in the Nation. 
Young children are going to school in circumstances that no one would tolerate. In fact, I understand some of these schools do not meet ordinary building standards. And there are serious problems in that regard. 
Once again, we are trying to emphasize a program. Of course, another aspect of what the President is pushing for is more teachers in the classrooms so we can have smaller class sizes, which most people agree is extremely important in the lower grades where we are trying to teach reading and we first introduce young people into their education. 
In fact, I ask the Senator, what is the situation with respect to overcrowded classrooms across the country?

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to acknowledge the unique and extraordinary contributions made to Baltimore and the State of Maryland by Judge Robert I.H. Hammerman who, this past summer, retired after thirty-seven years of distinguished service to our citizens and legal system. During his career on the bench, Judge Hammerman was a leader in court reform and the efforts to establish an effective yet caring system of juvenile criminal justice. These efforts were directed not only at changing the system, but also at exerting every effort possible to give young men in need the opportunity for academic and athletic development.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week the nation joins in marking National Fire Prevention Week, a time set aside not only to remember those who were injured and those who tragically lost their lives due to fire, but also to acknowledge the heroic efforts of those men and women who work so hard to prevent and protect us against such tragedies. 
Every year, more than 5,000 Americans die in fires and another 25,000 sustain fire-related injuries. The majority of these fires, around 80%, occur in the home. Fortunately, many of these deaths and injuries can be prevented by simply planning ahead. 
The most important function of National Fire Prevention Week is that of raising awareness about the dangers of fire and the relatively simple steps we can take to prevent fire-related tragedies. 
The theme of this year's National Fire Prevention Week, `Fire Drills: The Great Escape,' serves to encourage the public to practice and plan a home escape plan. This involves a number of steps and I want to touch on them briefly. According to officials at the United States Fire Administration (USFA), the first step in developing a home escape plan is the installation of smoke alarms on every floor. It is estimated that working smoke alarms can actually double your chances of survival in the event of fire. 
Smoke alarms, though, are not the only element of a home escape plan. It is vital that every individual in a household knows and practices at least two escape routes from every room in that home. If confronted by a fire, one should first escape the burning house and then meet at a previously designated family meeting place outside of the home. Then, the fire department should be notified. Finally, by no means should anyone attempt to re-enter a burning home. 
Mr. President, I rise today in support of the theme of this year's National Fire Protection Week and to encourage the development of as many home escape plans as possible. The fact is that no one is immune to the dangers of fire, but if they develop a plan similar to the USFA's their chances of survival are significantly increased. 
Today, on the anniversary of one of our nation's worst fires, the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, I want to commend the National Fire Protection Association for sponsoring National Fire Protection Week and to urge my colleagues and all citizens to pay careful attention to the theme and message of this year's National Fire Protection Week, so that we may continue to reduce such preventable losses.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it is a singular privilege for me to rise and acknowledge that this past summer Sam Lacy, one of the giants of American sports journalism, was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York on July 26. Sam Lacy, like Baltimore's great civil rights leaders Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Mitchell, Jr., was a pioneer in the great struggle to expand the participation of all Americans in our national life. The path he chose, however, was not the corridors of legal or political power, nor the streets and sidewalks of protest, but rather the silent and eloquent power of his pen. 
His career in journalism, which spanned over 50 years, began in the throes of a segregated society which deprived talented athletes of color the right to give their best in the field of competition. Sam Lacy, using his gift of writing combined with a pleasant but persistent demeanor, helped to break down these barriers thereby enriching immeasurably the quality and equality of our revered `National Pastime.' 
It is a tribute to the talent and determination of Sam Lacy and that of baseball pioneers Jackie Robinson and Larry Doby, and the essential fairness of our American spirit, that at age 94, Sam Lacy was recognized for his unique contribution to journalism and baseball. Mr. President, I am most pleased to take this opportunity to congratulate Sam Lacy personally for his induction into the Hall of Fame and for his distinguished and exceptional contribution to sports journalism. In honoring him, we also pay tribute to those great players of the past and present who have given so much to the sport of baseball.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this past July Walter Sondheim, Jr., one of Maryland's most distinguished citizens, celebrated his 90th birthday with family and friends in Baltimore. It is an accomplishment for anyone to reach this chronological milestone, but in this instance, Walter's nine decades have marked an extraordinary record of unparalleled public service to Baltimore and the State of Maryland. 
As a successful business executive, Walter Sondheim has served in `volunteer' public service positions on important state and local boards and commissions and as an advisor to Mayors and Governors for the last half century. His grace, good humor, extraordinary intelligence, and dedication have been powerful and good influences for progress and unity in Maryland. 
Achieving 90 years of age for most `normal' individuals, with rare exception, implies retirement or reduced activity. But among the several articles I am inserting in today's Congressional Record is an announcement in the July 30 edition of the Washington Post that Walter was unanimously elected to become the new President of the Maryland Board of Education. This public demonstration of confidence is a continuing vindication of his effectiveness in undertaking difficult tasks. 
I am also including an article from the July 25 Baltimore Sun which describes Walter's exceptional and inspiring life of service. I know I express the deep appreciation of his fellow Marylanders for his many decades of commitment and their best wishes in his latest and most significant assignment. I ask that these articles be inserted at this point in the record, and I yield the floor.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this legislation authorizes the Secretary of Interior to provide assistance to the State of Maryland in controlling a non-native rodent--nutria--which is destroying wetlands and valuable habitat at and around Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Sponsored by my colleague Representative Gilchrest, the legislation establishes a three year demonstration program of methods of manage nutria populations and to restore marshlands damaged by the destructive creature. 
Mr. President, Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge is one of the real treasures and showplaces of our National Wildlife Refuge system. Established in the early 1930s to help preserve migratory waterfowl, the 20,000 acre refuge has become one of the chief wintering areas for Canada geese along the Atlantic Flyway. It is also home for the endangered Delmarva Fox Squirrel and more than 200 species of birds. As all who visit the refuge quickly discover, Blackwater is a very special place: a haven for fish and wildlife , a land of exceptional beauty, and a vital part of the natural heritage and quality of life that we enjoy in Maryland. 
Unfortunately the Refuge and surrounding wetlands are being threatened by the prolific and highly invasive nonindigenous species nutria which are destroying the tidal marshes and even displacing other native species. Over the past three decades, the population of nutria in Maryland has grow exponentially from about 150 to as many as 150,000--a thousand fold increase. During that same period, Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge has lost more than 40 percent of its marshes--approximately 7,000 of 17,000 acres--due, in large part, to nutria. As nutria population densities continue to increase, so does the range of the creature and its associated ecological damage. 
In order to respond to this threat, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, the University of Maryland and more than a dozen other partners have joined together to develop a plan to address march loss and control of nutria. The goal of this three year pilot program is to develop methods for intensive control of the nutria populations and to restore damaged marsh habitats. This legislation authorizes the Federal funds necessary to carry out the program. I urge adoption of the legislation.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
First, although I am going to speak a little more later about our involvement in this process, I thank Senator Mack for his very generous and gracious comments, and I want to say that this bill would never have happened but for his very fine leadership. I am extremely indebted to him for the very positive and instructive and understanding way he moved this process forward. It has been a long and difficult process, but I am very pleased that we have arrived at this day. 
First, let me express my very strong support for this bill. I want to commend Senator Mikulski and the chairman, Senator Bond, for their very excellent work with respect to the matters before the Appropriations Subcommittee. In particular, I want to applaud them for the excellent bill they have written with regard to the funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
The President submitted a strong budget. And I am happy to see that the bill now before us responds to many of those requests. 
The bill represents a well-rounded approach to housing and economic development. It provides for 50,000 new vouchers targeted to helping people move from welfare to work by eliminating the current 90-day wait on reissuing vouchers upon turnover. The bill effectively adds another 40,000 vouchers. 
It provides $500 million in additional capital funds for public housing modernization to help maintain this important affordable housing resource. And the bill includes a total of $625 million for HOPE VI, the very innovative program that was created by my very able colleague, Senator Mikulski, which is focused on tearing down the worst, most isolated public housing projects and replacing them with mixed-income housing. Senator Mikulski has been an absolute champion of trying to rescue this situation which plagues many of our very large housing projects. I want to acknowledge the tremendous leadership that she has provided in this area. Working together with Senator Bond, they have fashioned I think a first-rate piece of legislation. I am very pleased to support it. 
Let me say, since she is my very able colleague, what a pleasure it has been working with her. I sit on the authorizing committee. Of course, she is on the appropriating committee. Over the years we have been able to work together I think in a partnership not only for our State but for the country. 
Mr. President, the primary reason I come to the floor today is to call the Senate's attention to the fact that an important piece of legislation reforming the Nation's Public Housing Program is attached to this appropriations conference report. This is a tremendous step forward. This public housing legislation I think represents a fine piece of legislative craftsmanship. It reflects a bipartisan approach to reform of our public and assisted housing. 
We have been working at this problem, Senator Mack has been working at this problem for 4 years, at least. The success of this effort reflecting what is before us, is, to a very significant extent, the result of the fine leadership provided by Senator Mack as Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee of the authorizing committee; the work of Senator Kerry, the ranking member of that subcommittee, interacting with our House colleagues, and with Secretary Cuomo, who has been a tireless advocate for housing and economic development programs. 
Senator Mack has taken a keen interest in the area of public housing since he took over the housing subcommittee in 1995. He has personally visited public housing projects and has spoken to administrators and residents. The commitment of his own time and concern I think is a model of how people responsible for certain programs need to understand the program, oversee the program, and then formulate the changes which will make the program work better. 
Senator Mack has been a strongly positive and constructive force throughout the long and often difficult process we have followed to get this positive resolution. I am pleased to express publicly my very deep respect and appreciation for his efforts. 
Mr. President, this public housing bill embodies an important bargain. We provide public housing authorities with increased flexibility to develop local situations to address housing needs in their communities but, in turn, they are required to use that flexibility to better serve their residents by creating healthier, more economically integrated communities. 
The PHAs will get more flexibility in how to use operating and capital funds. It encourages them to seek new sources of private capital to both build new housing and to repair existing units. It provides more flexibility in the calculation of public housing development costs and encourages the construction of higher quality housing. 
Finally, the law gives PHAs increased flexibility to admit higher income families while guaranteeing that the poor, including the working poor, continue to have access to 40 percent of the public housing units made available each year. 
This new increased flexibility is not an end in itself. The purpose is to provide higher quality housing in an overall improved living environment to the families who live in public housing. We want the Public Housing Program and the Rental Voucher Program, which the appropriators have generously supported in this legislation, to be stepping stones to better lives, to provide access to better schools and more economic opportunities. 
There is now a growing consensus that we need to have a mix of families with different levels of income in public housing. Such a policy will strengthen public housing projects and make them more livable communities. To ensure this outcome, the legislation requires the public housing authorities to demonstrate how they will attempt to create these more economically integrated communities. The Secretary is required to review these plans and to ensure that housing authorities pursue them. 
The bill also creates new rent rules that encourage existing tenants to go to work. There is a mandatory earned income disregard so that tenants who start working will reap the benefit of that effort at least for a year before additional payments are phased in. As a result of the special efforts of Senator Kerry, the bill deepens the targeting above the levels contained in both House and Senate bills for section 8 vouchers, requiring 75 percent of vouchers to go to lower-income families. 
The bill gives tenants an important role in working with housing authorities to determine housing policies. Residents will sit on boards, and the resident advisory boards I think will be very helpful.

Mr. SARBANES. I thank the chairman. 
Finally, the bill helps encourage home ownership in two ways. First, as a result of an amendment offered by Senator Dodd, our able colleague from Connecticut, public housing authorities will be able to devote part of their public housing capital funds to home ownership activities. In addition, section 8 assistance will be able to be used to support home ownership. 
Mr. President, I close again by thanking Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski for their very effective efforts. We are deeply appreciative of their cooperation. I again voice my respect for the tremendous leadership which Senator Mack provided in enabling us to achieve public housing reform which we have been striving to achieve for a number of years and to do it in a way that commands a consensus. The process we followed in working this out I really commend to all my colleagues. I think it is an example of how really to craft legislation and in the end achieve a very positive and constructive result. 
Finally, I want to recognize and thank the staff for their hard work and dedication. Jonathan Miller and Matt Josephs on the Democratic side, Chris Lord, Kari Davidson, Cheh Kim, David Hardiman, and Melody Fennel from the Majority side, worked extremely well together to help us bring this finished product to the floor today. 
In closing, Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2131, the Water Resources Development Act of 1998, and the Committee amendment, which provide for the development and improvement of our Nation's water resources infrastructure. This legislation authorizes water resource projects of vital importance to our nation's and our states' economy and maritime industry as well as our environment. 
I am particularly pleased that the measure includes a number of provisions for which I have fought to ensure the future health of the Port of Baltimore and of Maryland's environment. 
First the bill authorizes nearly $28 million for needed improvements to Baltimore Harbor Anchorages and Channels. Many of the existing anchorages and branch channels within Baltimore Harbor were built in the first half of this century and are no longer deep enough, wide enough or long enough to accommodate the vessels now calling on the Port of Baltimore. Many of the larger ships must now anchor some 25 miles south of Baltimore in naturally deep water, resulting in delays and increased costs to the shipping industry. Also, the narrow widths of some of the branch channels result in additional time for the pilots to maneuver safely to and from their docking berths. In June 1998 the Chief of Engineers approved a report which recommended a number of improvements including: 1) widening and deepening Federal anchorages 3 and 4; 2) widening and providing flared corners for state-owned East Dundalk, Seagirt, Connecting and West Dundalk branch Channels; 3) dredging a new branch channel at South Locust Point; and 4) dredging a turning basin at the head of the Fort McHenry Channel. The report identified the project as `technically sound, economically justified and environmentally and socially acceptable.' This project has been a top priority of mine, of the Maryland Port Administration and of the shipping community for many years and I am delighted that this legislation will enable us to move forward with this important project. 
Second, the legislation directs the Corps of Engineers to make critically needed safety improvements to the Tolchester Channel in the Chesapeake Bay. The Tolchester Channel is a vital link in the Baltimore Port system. It was authorized in the River and Harbor Act of 1958 and aligned to take advantage of the naturally deep water in the Chesapeake Bay, along Maryland's Eastern Shore. This alignment, which is shaped like an `S,' has posed a serious navigation problem and safety risks for vessels. Ships must change course five times within three miles, often beginning a new turn, sometimes in the opposite direction, before completing a first turn. With vessels nearly 1,000 feet in length, it is difficult to safely navigate the channel, particularly in poor weather conditions. The U.S. Coast Guard and the Maryland Pilots Association have expressed serious concerns over the safety of the area and have long recommended straightening of the channel due to the grounding and `near misses' which have occurred in the area. The cost for straightening the Tolchester `S-turn' is estimated at $12.6 million with $1.3 million coming from non-federal sources. This authorization enables the Corps to proceed expeditiously with these improvements and address the serious concerns of those who must navigate the treacherous channel. 
Mr. President, the Port of Baltimore is one of the great ports of the world and one of Maryland's most important economic assets. The Port generates $2 billion in annual economic activity, provides for an estimated 62,000 jobs, and over $500 million a year in State and local tax revenues and customs receipts. These two projects will help assure the continued vitality of the Port of Baltimore into the 21st Century. 
In addition to port development and improvement projects, the measure contains a provision which will help significantly to enhance Maryland's environment and quality of life and help achieve the goals and vision of the Potomac American Heritage River designation. 
It authorizes $15 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to modify the existing flood protection project at Cumberland, Maryland to restore features of the historic Chesapeake and Ohio Canal adversely affected by construction and operation of the project. Mr. President, the C&O Canal is widely regarded as the Nation's finest relic of America's canal building era. It was begun in 1828 as a transportation route between commercial centers in the East and frontier resources of the West. It reached Cumberland in 1850 and continued operating until 1924 when it succumbed to floods and financial failure. In the early 1950's, a section of the Canal and turning basin at its Cumberland terminus was filled in by the Corps of Engineers during construction of a local flood protection project. Portions of the Canal were proclaimed a national monument in 1961 and it was officially established as a national historical park in 1971. Justice Douglas described the park `. . . not yet marred by the roar of wheels and the sound of horns . . . The stretch of 185 miles of country from Washington to Cumberland, Maryland, is one of the most fascinating and picturesque in the Nation.' 
The National Park Service, as part of its General Management Plan for the Park, has long sought to rebuild and re-water the Canal at its Cumberland terminus. The NPS entered into a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with the Corps to undertake a study of the feasibility of reconstructing the last 2200 feet of the canal to the terminus, through and adjacent to the Corps' flood protection project. The Corps completed this study in July 1995 and determined that `it is feasible to re-water the canal successfully; the canal and flood protection levee can co-exist on the site without compromising the flood protection for the City of Cumberland; re-construction and partial operation of the locks is feasible; and, based on the as-built information available, underground utility impacts can be mitigated at reasonable cost to allow construction of the canal and turning basin in basically the same alignment and configuration as the original canal.' A subsequent Rewatering Design Analysis estimated the total project cost at $15 million. This authorization will enable the Corps to proceed with restoring a 1.1 mile stretch of the C&O Canal and revitalize the area as a major hub for tourism and economic development. 
I want to compliment the distinguished Chairmen of the Committee and the Subcommittee, Senators Chafee and Warner, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus, for their leadership in crafting this legislation and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.

There is extremely strong support for this legislation. It is obviously being frustrated and thwarted by a handful of people. 
It was my concern that the opportunity to file this cloture motion not pass. In view of the statement of the majority leader that he has no intention to do that, to file the cloture motion, I am not going to object to the consent request, and then we move over until tomorrow. I wanted to keep this window of opportunity available, and now that I know that the majority leader has no intention of availing himself of it, I am prepared to agree to this consent request.

We have worked through this issue, and we reached an overwhelming consensus about it. And it seems to me that the effort now to sort of significantly rewrite these provisions is just not going to happen.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of Kimbel E. Oelke, publisher of the Dundalk Eagle--a homespun and pioneering publication committed to covering the local news stories that directly affect the daily lives of the citizens of the greater Dundalk area. Once sold for 10 cents to 500 subscribers and written entirely by Mr. Oelke at its founding in 1969, the Dundalk Eagle is now circulated to 24,000 people by a staff of twenty. 
Oelke's commitment to the community extended beyond his distribution of the newspaper to include his participation in the creation of the Dundalk Library, the Dundalk Chamber of Commerce, the Dundalk Association of Businesses and the Greater Dundalk Sports Hall of Fame. 
From the age of seven when he first moved to Baltimore, Oelke had journalistic ambitions. I think all would agree that the realization of his dream has not only enriched the lives of thousands of his readers, but conveyed a sense of community too often missing in our modern era. Kimbel Oelke's commitment to community journalism will leave a legacy of service for future generations both in and out of Dundalk.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to authorize continued U.S. participation in the International Mobile Satellite Organization, currently known as `Inmarsat', during and after its restructuring, scheduled to take place April 1. The United States is currently a member of this organization, but its structure and functions are slated for significant reform. Rather than actually owning and operating mobile satellite telecommunications facilities, the intergovernmental institution will retain the much more limited role of overseeing the provision of global maritime distress and safety services, ensuring that this important function is carried out properly and effectively under contract. U.S. participation in the organization--which will keep the same name but change its acronym to `IMSO'--will not require a U.S. financial contribution and will not impose any new legal obligations upon the U.S. government. Privatization of Inmarsat's commercial satellite business is an objective broadly shared by the legislative and executive branches, American businesses, COMSAT, which is the U.S. signatory entity, and the international community. 
To give some brief background, Inmarsat was established in 1979 to serve the global maritime industry by developing satellite communications for ship management and distress and safety applications. Over the past 19 years, Inmarsat has expanded both in terms of membership and mission. The intergovernmental organization now counts 84 member countries and has expanded into land-mobile and aeronautical communications. 
Inmarsat's governing bodies, the Inmarsat Council and the Assembly of Parties, recently reached an agreement to restructure the organization, a move that has been strongly supported and encouraged by the United States. This restructuring will shift Inmarsat's commercial activities out of the intergovernmental organization and into a broadly-owned public corporation by next spring. The new corporation will acquire all of Inmarsat's operational assets, including its satellites, and will assume all of Inmarsat's operational functions. All that will remain of the intergovernmental institution is a scaled-down secretariat with a small staff to ensure that the new corporation continues to meet certain public service obligations, such as the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS). It is important to U.S. interests that we participate in the oversight of this function, as well as that we be fully represented in the organization throughout the process of privatization. 
The legislation I am introducing will enable a smooth transition to the new structure. It contains two major provisions. First, it authorizes the President to maintain U.S. membership in IMSO after restructuring to ensure the continued provision of global maritime distress and safety satellite communications services. Second, it repeals those provisions of the International Maritime Satellite Telecommunications Act that will be rendered obsolete by the restructuring of Inmarsat, including all those relating to COMSAT's role as the United States' signatory. The bill's provisions will take effect on the date that Inmarsat transfers its commercial operations to the new corporation.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be brief. I simply want to, first of all, commend the distinguished chairman of the committee for the very effective work I think he has done in bringing this to this point. I think it is important to understand we have not reached the bill yet. We are now actually postcloture on the motion to proceed to the bill. I do not think it is clear at this point yet exactly how many of these procedural hoops we will have to go through in order to finally get to the substance of the bill and in order, in the end, to have a vote up or down on the bill. I hope the leadership could commit to staying with this process as long as is necessary in order to reach that point, because I think there is overwhelming support for this legislation in this body--overwhelming support. 
I think the Financial Services Act of 1998, which has been brought out of the Senate Banking Committee, is a carefully balanced piece of legislation. It would finally respond to an issue we have been wrestling with for years and years. I say to the chairman of the committee, we have been dealing with this issue for a very, very long time, and finally we have brought it to the point where we have an opportunity, I think, to put into law important legislation for the operation of the financial services industry. 
This legislation would permit banks to affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies within a financial holding company structure, regulated by the Federal Reserve. The Banking Committee held four hearings in preparation for marking up this legislation after it passed the House. It passed the House by just one vote. We are informed, and I believe reliably informed, that the vote in the House on this legislation as is now being presented to the Senate would produce a very substantial majority. In other words, well above, clearly well above the vote that it obtained in just managing to get through the House and coming over to the Senate. The changes we have made have generally been met with favor on the other side of the Capitol. 
We heard from the administration, the financial regulators, the various industry groups, public interest and consumer groups, and in the end the bill was brought out of the Banking Committee on the 11th of September by a broad, bipartisan majority of 16 to 2. The legislation, as I indicated, is balanced. It would expand the range of permissible financial activities for commercial banks while preserving the safety and soundness of the financial system, providing adequate consumer protections, and expanding access to the financial system for all Americans. 
This bill has received unprecedented support across the entire range of the financial services industry. Just last Wednesday, the American Bankers Association, the Independent Bankers Association, the American Council of Life Insurance, the Independent Insurance Agents of America, the American Insurance Association, the Securities Industry Association, the Investment Company Institute and the Financial Services Council sent a joint letter to the two leaders--to Senators Lott and Daschle--saying: 
The Senate Banking Committee, through its actions on H.R. 10, the financial modernization bill, in its discussions with a wide variety of parties including both Members of Congress and representatives of the private sector, has now produced a carefully negotiated product. 
They indicated their very strong support for the package which we are bringing to the Senate. Last Friday, the American Community Bankers, who represent the thrift industry, sent a letter to the two leaders expressing support of H.R. 10, and stating: 
ACB supports the bill as a generally constructive measure. 
These letters obviously reflect a very broad consensus that has been put together around this bill. Obviously, it is my hope we will be able to move it through the Senate over the next few days and move it on towards enactment into law. It is interesting to note, since I have colleagues on the other side who are raising the CRA issue, that the industry groups affected by the CRA issue are in favor of this bill. The community groups, I have to tell you because I am very much aware of it, are opposed to this bill, because they think it is inadequate on CRA. You know, they are making that concern very clear. 
So I say to my colleagues on the other side who come along and they say, `We are going to attack CRA,' that the very people affected by it, the industry groups, say, `We can live with this.' The community groups are very unhappy with it. So we have that situation here. 
In addition, and I am going to talk later in more detail about the separation between banking and commerce, which I think is an important aspect of this bill and one that Paul Volcker wrote a very thoughtful op-ed piece about in the Washington Post, on September 10. Let me just quote that and then I will not develop that issue any further tonight: 
A convincing argument can be made for combinations of banking, securities and insurance companies--under appropriate regulatory and supervisory safeguards. What cannot be defended is reshaping the financial services industry by ad hoc regulatory decisions, manipulating or manufacturing loopholes in plain contravention of the intent of the unchanged law. 
The proposed legislation will maintain and strengthen elements of financial regulation and oversight essential to the overall stability of the system. Specifically, H.R. 10 would reinforce the long-standing policy of the United States against the combination of banking and `commerce,' broadly defined. 
As I indicated, I will come back to many other commentators who have stressed the importance of that aspect of this legislation, and I think one of its major accomplishments is to draw that line and draw a clear line and avoid this sort of fudging that has been taking place in this area. 
On the safety and soundness, let me say I think the regulatory structure put in place by this legislation is important and would permit the formation of financial holding companies. These financial holding companies would be able to engage in any activity that is determined to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activities. 
Thus, the holding company could include a commercial bank, securities firm, mutual fund or insurance company. Each entity within the holding company would be regulated by its existing regulator. Thus, a commercial bank would be regulated by its bank regulator, whether that is the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC or the Federal Reserve. The securities firm and the mutual fund would be regulated by the SEC and by the appropriate State securities regulators, and the insurance company would be regulated by State insurance regulators, as is now the case. So you have functional regulation of each entity within the new financial holding company. 
In addition, the Federal Reserve would serve as the so-called umbrella regulator of the financial holding company. The Federal Reserve would have authority to set capital at the holding company level. It would have authority to conduct examinations and request reports from subsidiaries of the financial holding company if it determines they are necessary to assess a material risk to the bank holding company for its subsidiaries. 
I think this balance is an effective approach to protecting the safety and soundness of the financial system and most independent observers, with respect to safety and soundness questions, agree with that evaluation. 
There are also important consumer protections contained in the legislation with respect to the sale of uninsured financial products, and I am sure we will have a chance to develop those in some detail. 
Where we find ourselves procedurally is the next vote, obviously, will be on the actual motion to proceed to the bill. At that point, the bill would then be before us and open to amendment. I subscribe to the position put forward by the chairman of the committee that Members ought to have a chance to offer an amendment; we ought to have reasonable debate on them and then move to vote on them, one way or another, and work through the legislation in that fashion. 
It has been a long road to reach this point. I think it is important to try now to conclude deliberations on this important legislation in an orderly and rational fashion, and I think the approach the chairman has outlined certainly accommodates that. 
We hear stories or rumors that people are out to simply try to delay this as long as they can in order to, in effect, sink the legislation. I very much hope that doesn't happen. An awful lot of work has gone into bringing us to this point, as is reflected by the comments of the various parties who have been deeply interested and affected by this legislation. I, frankly, think the Congress now has an opportunity to finally come to grips with an issue--this issue is being dealt with on an ad hoc basis. No one thinks it should be done that way. No one. At least I don't think anyone. I don't want to speak for all of my colleagues, but that is true of all of the regulators, all of the commentators. They say the way to deal with this is to do it statutorily through enactment by the Congress. So we will just have to see as we move ahead whether we can come to closure on this important issue. I very much hope it will be possible to do so. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am concerned about the provisions in sections 606 and 607 of this legislation which would increase the number of flights and grant exemptions to the 1,250-mile nonstop perimeter rule at Reagan Washington National Airport. These changes would alter longstanding Federal policies and agreements governing the operations of the three Washington area airports--Reagan National, Dulles, and BWI--and could result in unacceptable noise impacts for tens of thousands of citizens living in the flight path of Reagan National along the Potomac. 
I recognize that the chairman and other Members are concerned about potential barriers to entry of new carriers at Reagan Washington National. While recognizing this, I think we must seek a careful balance between the benefits of increased competition and legitimate concerns of our citizens about aircraft noise. Anyone who lives in the flight path of Reagan Washington National Airport knows what a serious problem aircraft noise poses for human health, and even for performing daily activities. 
Despite having restrictive nighttime noise rules, aircraft noise remains a major concern for many of our citizens who live in Reagan Washington National's flight path. 
The Citizens for the Abatement of Aircraft Noise, a coalition of citizens and civic associations which has been working for more than a decade to reduce aircraft noise in the Washington metropolitan area, has analyzed data from a recent Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority report which shows that approximately 1/3 of the 32 noise-monitoring stations in the region have a day-night average sound level which is higher than the 65-decibel level that has been established by the EPA and the American National Standards Institute as a threshold above which residential living is considered compatible. 
Addressing existing noise impacts and the impacts of noise from further flights into Reagan Washington National Airport must, therefore, be a top priority. 
Senators Mikulski, Robb, and Warner have joined with me in framing some amendments to the pending bill to address the potential impact that would arise from increasing the slots and changing the perimeter at National Airport. These amendments seek to provide a noise safety net to mitigate adverse environmental noise consequences of exemptions to the existing operating rules.  
Ms. MIKULSKI, Mr. President, today, I rise to offer three amendments with my colleague, Senator Sarbanes to address the needs of my constituents in regard to this legislation. 
I also note that I am a proud co-sponsor of two amendments offered by Senator Warner of Virginia that further addresses our citizens concerns. 
Mr. President, I want to make it very clear that I am opposed to any changes in the perimeter rule and slot rules at Ronald Reagan National Airport. 
I believe the present balance among the three regional airports serves the public well. The present slot rules governing Reagan National work well and should be maintained. 
However, I recognize that this legislation has overwhelming support in the Senate and will pass with a majority vote. 
As a result, Senator Sarbanes and I have crafted two amendments to minimize any potential impact from changes to the slot and perimeter rules. 
The first amendment creates a mandatory set-aside of federal funds to mitigate any noise impacts that arise from changes to the perimeter and slot rules. 
The amendment requires the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority to set aside no less than ten percent of their federal funds to prevent noise pollution in areas affected by noise from National and Dulles International Airports. 
For my constituents, this means that they will be eligible for financial assistance to soundproof their homes and schools. This amendment will ensure that residents in Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties will finally get some relief from noise that impacts their communities. 
Currently, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority does not utilize federal funds for noise mitigation activities. 
This amendment will ensure that federal funds are used for noise mitigation. For the first time, federal funds will be dedicated to reducing noise in the Washington area. 
The second amendment requires that any new slots be distributed evenly during the day to avoid the possibility of stacking new flights early in the morning or in the evening. 
I want to make sure that my constituents do not suffer additional noise during the time they are at home in the morning or the evening. When families are together, they should not have to endure additional aircraft noise when enjoying their breakfast or dinner. 
The third amendment gives the Washington Airports Authority and the State of Maryland priority consideration for airport improvement grants. 
Because Maryland is affected by changes to the perimeter and slot rules, this area should receive priority consideration. 
In addition, to the amendments sponsored by myself and Senator Sarbanes, we have worked closely with Senator Warner on two other amendments to further address the needs of our constituents. 
One amendment requires a formal environmental review and public hearing before new slot exemptions are granted at Reagan National. 
I believe this is fair and necessary to ensure that our constituents have a role in this process and have their voices heard. 
A second amendment seeks to guarantee that the pending nominations to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Board are confirmed in an expeditious manner. 
A fully functioning board is necessary to proceed with the modernization of Reagan National and Dulles and I support the pending nominations. 
Mr. President, I could not stop this bill, so Senator Sarbanes and I decided to change it. 
For the first time, we succeeded in providing funds for noise mitigation for our constituents. 
While I would have preferred no changes to the slot and perimeter rules, I believe our amendments will go a long way to reducing noise impact for our constituents.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to assure that the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority provide funding for noise abatement activities such as soundproofing of homes and schools, buying homes that are affected by noise, and improving land use planning. It provides that the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority will expend at least 10 percent of its FAA grant money on noise compatibility planning and programming. 
Let me note in submitting this amendment that MWAA is currently spending hundreds of millions of dollars of capital improvement at Reagan National, yet it is not spending a dime on the noise abatement activities. By comparison, Chicago O'Hare is currently spending $205 million of its passenger facility charges on noise abatement and mitigation activities. 
In my own State of Maryland, BWI is spending a substantial portion of its AIP fund for noise mitigation efforts. In fact, since enactment of the AIP program, the Maryland Aviation Administration has received 46 AIP grants for BWI, totaling approximately $119 million. Seventeen of these grants, totaling more than $52 million, were for noise mitigation. In other words, 44 percent of all AIP grants for BWI have been for noise mitigation activities. 
In direct contrast, since 1991, when Reagan Washington National Airport first became eligible for AIP funds, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority has received $106 million in AIP discretionary entitlement funds and none of those funds for financing of the airport's passenger facilities charges has been used for noise abatement activity. 
I understand that the rationale that MWAA has given for not spending any funds for noise abatement was that it cannot have a 150 noise compatibility plan approved by FAA. Now that it has such an approved plan, it is time that AIP funds be spent to provide some relief for noise-impacted communities. 
This amendment seeks to have the Federal Government address the need for greater balance between airport expansion and associated environmental impact. I know this is an issue that the chairman has taken an interest in. I know he raised it in confirmation hearings with respect to members of the MWAA. We very much welcome his interest. We have tried to work with the committee as we deal with these amendments. 
It is my understanding that the amendment is acceptable to the committee. I urge its adoption.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to mitigate the environmental noise consequences of new air carrier slots added to the Ronald Reagan National Airport inventory. By precluding air carrier slot clustering during the operational day, it would prohibit more than two new operations per hour during the period between 7 a.m. and 9:59 p.m. 
It seeks to achieve a more appropriate balance between the commercial interests of air carriers, the demands of the traveling and shipping public, and the concerns of residents living under the flight pattern. We understand the addition of the slots. This is primarily an effort to spread them out over the course of the operational day and to prevent heavy clustering, particularly in the early morning or late evening hours. I understand the committee feels that this is compatible with the objectives we are trying to seek. 
I urge adoption of the amendment.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to mitigate adverse consequences of the exemptions from the rules governing Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport flight operations by requiring the Secretary of Transportation to make both the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority and the State of Maryland eligible for priority consideration when the FAA distributes noise discretionary funds under the Airport Improvement Program. With increases in the amount of flights at Reagan National--and these other two airports are interrelated, of course, Dulles and BWI--the problem of noise pollution is likely to grow, and it is vital that we make prudent investments in noise abatement activities. 
Therefore, we seek this priority status in order to be able to ensure that we are doing everything we can to soundproof homes and schools and take other steps to address the noise pollution problem for those living in the flight paths. 
I understand, Mr. President, that the committee has, as it were, a refinement of this amendment, and this is certainly acceptable to us. 
I, again, express my appreciation to the chairman and the ranking member for working with us in such a positive and constructive way on this issue.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Senator Durbin, the Ranking Member of the Courts Subcommittee, on passage of S.1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Bill of 1998. 
I especially want to thank him for insisting that S.1301 address not only the need for greater responsibility on the part of debtors, but also the need for greater responsibility on the part of creditors. In particular, this bill takes notice of the fact that credit card companies often act as enablers to individuals who end up in bankruptcy after falling prey to one too many promises of easy credit from these companies. S.1301 requires that credit card companies provide consumers with the information they need to behave in a responsible manner, rather than luring them into tighter financial straits with false promises of easy credit. 
The bill that passed out of the Judiciary Committee did not take such an evenhanded approach, and I, among others both on and off the Judiciary Committee, noted the need to bring greater balance to this issue on the floor. Thanks to Senator Durbin's leadership, the efforts of several other Democratic Senators, and the cooperation of Senator Grassley and other Republicans, the bill we will soon pass is a product that, as amended, acknowledges the shared responsibility for the rise in bankruptcies between creditors and debtors, and strives to discourage reckless behavior on both sides of credit transactions.

Mr. SARBANES. I thank Senator Durbin for his kind words. I also note, however, that we still have much work to do in this area. None of the consumer-oriented provisions that we have succeeded in adding to S.1301 are in the House-passed bankruptcy bill, and I daresay that the credit card companies are less than thrilled with even the modest steps we have taken on behalf of consumers here in the Senate. I ask my colleague from Illinois, is it not safe to expect that there will be efforts during the bankruptcy conference to strip out some of these provisions from the conference report, and to bring to the Senate a bankruptcy bill that is, once again, merely a wish list of the credit card companies? 
I further ask my colleague, will we not need to be vigilant in our efforts to preserve these consumer-oriented provisions during the conference?

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator Kennedy's amendment to raise the Federal minimum wage. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the legislation--upon which this amendment is based--to raise the minimum wage 50 cents a year over the next two years bringing it to $6.15 per hour by the year 2000. 
For more than half a century, Congress has acted to guarantee minimum standards of decency for working Americans. The object of a Federal minimum wage is to make work pay well enough to keep families out of poverty and off Government assistance. Any individual who works hard and plays by the rules should be assured a living standard for his or her family that can keep them out of poverty. 
If nothing is done before the year 2000, the real value of the minimum wage will be just $4.82 in 1997 dollars--about what it was before Congress last acted to increase the minimum wage in 1996. The increase being proposed today would bring the purchasing power of the minimum wage to $5.76. Now, no one asserts that raising the minimum wage will correct every economic injustice, but it will certainly make a significant difference to those on the low end of the economic scale. We have the opportunity to enact what is in my view a modest increase to help curb the erosion of the value of the minimum wage in terms of real dollars, and it is an opportunity which we should not let pass us by. 
Currently, full-time minimum wage worker earns just $10,712 --$2,600 below the poverty level for a family of three. A dollar increase in the minimum wage would provide a minimum wage worker with an additional $2,080 in income per year, helping to bring that family of three closer to the most basic standard of living. This extra income will help a family pay their bills and quite possibly even allow them to afford something above and beyond the bare essentials. 
According to the Department of Labor, 74 percent of workers who will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage are adults, 50 percent work full time, 60 percent are women and 40 percent are the sole breadwinners in their families. Mr. President, these are not the part-time workers and suburban teenagers many opponents of the minimum wage increase would have you believe. 
After 30 years of spiralling deficits we are on the verge of balancing the budget for the first time in 30 years - 4 years ahead of schedule. Today, the budget is virtually balanced, unemployment is at a 25-year low, and inflation is at a 30-year low. However, despite this period of economic prosperity, the disparity between the very rich in this country and the very poor continues to grow. According to the Economic Policy Institute, projections for 1997 indicate that the share of the wealth held by the top 1 percent of households grew by almost 2 percent since 1989. Over that same period, the share of the wealth held by families in the middle fifth of the population fell by half a percent. In light of these estimates, consider that the Department of Labor predicts that 57 percent of the gains from an increase in the minimum wage will go to families in the bottom 40 percent of the income scale. 
It is both reasonable and responsible for Congress to enact measures which provide a standard that allows decent, hard-working Americans a floor upon which they can stand. We did it back in 1996 when we approved, by a bipartisan vote of 74-24, a 90 cent increase in the minimum wage bringing it to its current level of $5.15 per hour, and it is appropriate to do it here again. With the economy strong, we have a responsibility to reinforce this basic economic floor for millions of American workers to prevent them from sliding further into the basement. 
This is, and always has been, an issue of equity and fairness for working men and women in this country and I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this amendment and vote against the motion to table.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am submitting a concurrent resolution to redesignate the United States Capitol Police Headquarters as the `Eney, Chestnut, Gibson Memorial Building' in honor of the three brave United States Capitol Police Officers who have been killed in the line of duty since the inception of the Capitol Police. 
The United States Capitol Police are a very special breed. They have a very special duty and a special trust. They guard our nation's Capitol and keep it safe and secure for the citizens of the world. When Officers Gibson and Chestnut were killed on July 24, 1998, I joined my colleagues on the floor to express my profound shock, and to express my very heartfelt sympathies to their families. I quoted an editorial in Roll Call then and I want to read from it again because I think it sums up the nature of our Capitol Police Force: 
Sometimes, given the comparative low level of violence around the Capitol complex and given that Capitol Police Officers are usually seen cheerfully directing traffic or gently herding tourists, it's forgotten that ours--meaning the Capitol Hill Police Force--is a real police force. We who live and work around the Capitol know--but others don't--that our police also fight crime in the neighborhood as well as watch the Capitol. But now all America understands that the Capitol Police do not just stand guard, but also stand ready to be heroes. That knowledge was derived last week at a heartrending cost. 
So Mr. President, the purpose of this concurrent resolution is not just to memorialize these three officers, but to honor in perpetuity the bravery, and acknowledge the sacrifice of the men and women who put their lives on the line daily to protect this symbol of democracy. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this measure.

Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I am pleased to join with my colleague Senator Mikulski in sponsoring this amendment to require the Secretary of the Interior to prepare an environmental impact statement and comply with all other applicable laws, rules and regulations related to property transfers before engaging in a land exchange near Oxon Creek in Prince Georges County and the District of Columbia. 
Section 135 of the Interior Appropriations Act of 1998 directs the Secretary of the Interior, to `accept full title to approximately 84 acres of land located in Prince Georges County, Maryland, adjacent to Oxon Cove Park, and * * * in exchange * * * convey to the Corrections Corporation of America all of the interest of the United States in approximately 42 acres of land located in Oxon Cove Park in the District of Columbia,' `notwithstanding any other provision of law.' The language directing this exchange was inserted at the eleventh hour in the Conference Report on the Interior Appropriations bill with no prior hearings or consideration, no opportunity for debate, no input from the National Park Service or the area Congressional Delegation and no consultation with the affected communities. It circumvented every procedure and process by which land exchanges normally take place. The only conditions placed on the transaction were that the property would not have environment contamination and that it be a fair market value exchange or equalized in value by a cash payment from CCA. 
Since the enactment of the Interior Appropriations bill, the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) has filed an application with the District of Columbia Zoning Commission to build a 2,200 bed prison on the 42 acre National Park site to house portions of the District of Columbia's inmate population. This facility is strongly opposed by local residents who have raised serious concerns about both the planned location of the prison and the propriety of bypassing National Park Service land exchange and environmental compliance guidelines which allow for public input. Department of the Interior officials have stated that `absent public review, which NPS has been precluded to conduct by statute, it is not clear that the location of a prison on the current parcel of park land would be in the best interest of the public. Further, the legislated land exchange with CCA does not afford equal opportunity to all potential bidders to provide a nearby inmate facility for felons of the District of Columbia.' 
It is important to point out that the National Park Service's Oxon Cove property has been planned as the site of a public golf course and a hiker-biker trail--recreational facilities urgently needed in great demand by the local community. They are a key component of an overall effort to revitalize the area and enhance the quality of life for local residents. These public facilities would largely be displaced by the CCA prison. Moreover, development of a correctional facility on this site would likely have adverse environmental impacts on Oxon Cove and on the Potomac River which was recently designated as an American Heritage River. In addition, it is my understanding that the CCA owned property in Prince Georges County is mostly wetlands and has no access and consequently the land swap is hardly a `fair market value' exchange. 
The amendment which Senator Mikulski and I are offering will ensure that no legislated land exchange can be consummated unless and until the exchange has been reviewed in accordance with the procedures customary for such land exchange proposals including: an Environmental Impact Statement in accord with the National Environmental Policy Act; a determination by the Secretary of the Interior that the land is suitable for exchange under the criteria normally used for such exchanges; an evaluation of whether the land exchange is in the best interests of the public and the National Park Service; an opportunity for public hearings and input; a review of the NPS General Management Plan for the property and scrutiny by the National Capital Planning Commission. It is my firm conviction that this legislated land exchange should never have been enacted. We hold this property and all of our Nation's lands in public trust and it my hope that the amendment we are offering will help preserve that trust as well as citizens' rights to due process and having their concerns heard. I urge adoption of this amendment.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to help commemorate and preserve significant sites associated with America's Second War of Independence, the War of 1812. My legislation, entitled `The Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail Study Act of 1998,' directs the Secretary of the Interior to initiate a study to assess the feasibility and desirability of designating the route of the British invasion of Washington, D.C. and their subsequent defeat at Baltimore, Maryland, as a National Historic Trail. 
Since the passage of the National Trail Systems Act of 1968, the National Park Service has recognized historically significant routes of exploration, migration and military action through its National Historic Trails Program. Routes such as the Juan Bautista de Anza, Lewis and Clark, Pony Express and Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trails cross our country and represent important episodes of our nation's history, episodes which were influential in shaping the very future of this country. It is my view that the inclusion of the Star-Spangled Banner Trail will give long overdue recognition to another of these important events. 
The War of 1812, and the Chesapeake Campaign in particular, mark a turning point in the development of the United States. Faced with the possibility of losing the independence for which they struggled so valiantly, the citizens of this country were forced to assert themselves on an international level. 
From the period of the arrival of the British forces at Bendedict, in Charles County, Maryland, on August 18, 1814, to the American victory at Fort McHenry in Baltimore, on September 14, 1814, the war took a dramatic turn. The American forces, largely comprised of Maryland's citizens, were able to slow the British advance through the state and successfully defended Baltimore, leading to the retreat of the British. 
The sites along this trail mark some of the most historically important events of the War of 1812. It begins with the only combined naval and land attack on the United States, originating at Benedict, Maryland and continuing on to the nation's capital, Washington, D.C. It follows the defeat of the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, the evacuation of the United States Government, the burning of the nation's capital, including the White House and the Capitol Building, the battle at North Point and the bombardment of Fort McHenry, site of the composition of our National Anthem, the Star-Spangled Banner, and the ultimate defeat of the British. 
The route will also serve to bring awareness to several lesser known, but equally important sites of the war, including St. Leonard's Creek in Calvert County, where two American vessels scuttled by the British have recently been found, Brookeville, Maryland, which served as the nation's capital for one day, and Todd's Inheritance, the signal station for the American defenders at Fort McHenry. These sites, and many like them, will only enrich the story told along the trail. Additionally, the attention given to these sites should prove beneficial in terms of efforts to preserve and restore them. 
Mr. President, the designation of the route of the British invasion of Washington and American defense of Baltimore as a National Historic Trail will serve as a reminder of the importance of the concept of liberty to all who experience the Star-Spangled Banner Trail. It will also give long overdue recognition to those patriots whose determination to stand firm against enemy invasion and bombardment preserved this liberty for future generations of Americans.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, last fall, the Majority Leader and the other Republican opponents of campaign finance reform denied the will of a majority of the Senate--and a majority of the American people--by denying an up or down vote on the McCain-Feingold bill. This past February, we witnessed again successful efforts to block consideration of this proposal. At that point, I stated that such maneuvers violate the Senate's well-earned reputation for thoughtfulness and deliberation, in which it rightly takes such pride, and I noted that full consideration of the campaign finance issue by the Senate is crucial to maintaining the public's confidence in its government. 
Mr. President, the McCain-Feingold bill is before us again, but under changed circumstances which make the need for Senate consideration of campaign finance reform all the more vital. We must now consider this most important issue in the context of House passage of its own campaign finance legislation--passage which occurred only after determined members of both parties successfully navigated a minefield of amendments erected by the House Republican leadership with the goal of killing campaign finance reform there. Despite these efforts, a majority of the House held together and enacted legislation that gives voice to the belief of the American public that our system of campaign financing needs fixing. 
I hope that this time the Senate leadership will give us the same opportunity to express our support for campaign finance legislation that the members of the House earned this summer. I am a cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold bill, and will therefore vote in its favor when--if--the issue comes before the Senate. Others oppose this legislation. What the American public deserves at least, however, is an up or down Senate vote that gives effect to the will of the majority and that makes the American public confident that the issue has received thorough review by its elected representatives. Based on prior votes, I suspect that such review will in fact yield a decision by a majority of the Senate that campaign finance reform is appropriate and necessary. But even if I am mistaken and a majority of Senators now oppose such legislation, a fair Senate process demands that an up or down vote take place as soon as possible and that the will of the majority be allowed to carry the day. 
In February I noted that the Senate's failure to consider the McCain-Feingold bill on an up or down vote merely increases the public cynicism that makes campaign finance reform necessary. Now that the House has acted, my prior statements are even more true. I therefore once again urge the Majority Leader to observe a process consistent with the Nation's desires and needs.

Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, I just want to follow along with what the able Senator from Kansas has said. Adoption of this amendment would prevent the United States from consenting to a quota increase until all of these conditions had been met. These conditions cannot be met immediately. That is a guaranteed thing. It means that the United States would, in effect, not be carrying through a quota increase. 
We are facing a very serious financial crisis worldwide. One of the instruments we have to deal with that is the IMF. We need to pass this quota increase, and we need to do it immediately, and we need to address this situation. If the IMF is perceived, as it now is, not to have the resources with which to deal with the international crisis, it will only worsen and intensify the crisis. If anyone wants to ask what is the one thing we can do to try to address this crisis, it is to pass this legislation without this amendment. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering would fix and restore one of our most important monuments, the Korean War Veterans Memorial. It authorizes the Secretary of the Army to provide, within existing funds, up to $2 million to complete essential repairs to the Memorial. Joining me as a cosponsor of this amendment is my distinguished colleague from Colorado--a Korean War veteran himself--Senator Campbell. 
The Korean War Memorial is the newest war monument in Washington, DC. It was authorized in 1986 by Public Law 99-752 which established a Presidential Advisory Board to raise funds and oversee the design of the project, and charged the American Battle Monuments Commission with the management of this project. The authorization provided $1 million in federal funds for the design and initial construction of the memorial and Korean War Veterans' organizations and the Advisory Board raised over $13 million in private donations to complete the facility. Construction on the memorial began in 1992 and it was dedicated on July 27, 1995. 
For those who haven't visited, the Memorial is located south of the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial on the Mall, to the east of the Lincoln Memorial. Designed by world class Cooper Lecky Architects, the monument contains a triangular `field of service,' with 19 stainless steel, larger than life statues, depicting a squad of soldiers on patrol. A curb of granite north of the statues lists the 22 countries of the United Nations that sent troops in defense of South Korea. To the south of the patrol stands a wall of black granite, with engraved images of more than 2,400 unnamed service men and women detailing the countless ways in which Americans answered the call to service. Adjacent to the wall is a fountain which is supposed to be encircled by a Memorial Grove of linden trees, creating a peaceful setting for quiet reflection. When this memorial was originally created, it was intended to be a lasting and fitting tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of our troops who fought in the `Forgotten War.' Unfortunately, just three years after its dedication, the monument is not lasting and is no longer fitting. 
The Memorial has not functioned as it was originally conceived and designed and has instead been plagued by a series of problems in its construction. The grove of 40 linden trees have all died and been removed from the ground, leaving forty gaping holes. The pipes feeding the Pool of Remembrance' return system have cracked and the pool has been cordoned off. The monument's lighting system has been deemed inadequate and has caused safety problems for those who wish to visit the site at night. As a result, most of the 1.3 million who visit the monument each year--many of whom are veterans--must cope with construction gates or areas which have been cordoned off instead of experiencing the full effect of the Memorial 
Let me read a quote from the Washington Post--from a Korean War Veteran, John LeGault who visited the site--that I think captures the frustration associated with not having a fitting and complete tribute for the Korean War. He says, `Who cares?' `That was the forgotten war and this is the forgotten memorial.' Mr. President, we ought not to be sunshine patriots when it comes to making decisions which affect our veterans. Too often, we are very high on the contributions that our military makes in times of crisis, but when a crisis fades from the scene, we seem to forget about this sacrifice. Our veterans deserve better. 
To resolve these problems and restore this monument to something that our Korean War Veterans can be proud of, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted an extensive study of the site in an effort to identify, comprehensively, what corrective actions would be required. The Corps has determined that an additional $2 million would be required to complete the restoration of the grove work and replace the statuary lighting. My amendment would provide the authority for the funds to make these repairs swiftly and once and for all. 
With the 50th anniversary of the Korean War conflict fast approaching, we must ensure that these repairs are made as soon as possible. This additional funding would ensure that we have a fitting, proper, and lasting tribute to those who served in Korea and that we will never forget those who served in the `Forgotten War.' I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Frederick County, Maryland. Throughout Maryland's glorious history, Frederick County and her sons and daughters have played a critical role in our State's quest for freedom and progress. From the very founding of our nation, Frederick Countians have proudly and resolutely upheld the principles and beliefs which are the basis of our democratic system of self government. 
This strong commitment to freedom was evident among the English and German immigrants who first settled in Frederick County. They were extremely appreciative of the freedoms they found in this `New World' and zealous in their dedication to protecting them. One such individual was Francis Scott Key, the lawyer and poet who, watching the bombardment of Ft. McHenry from a British cartel ship off Sparrow's Point in Baltimore's harbor, penned the words that subsequently became memorialized as our National Anthem. 
What many may not know is that the eloquent author of the Star Spangled Banner was born in Frederick City, which celebrated its own 250th birthday in 1995. Francis Scott Key was detained on the British ship in 1814 while attempting to secure the release of Dr. William Beanes of Upper Marlboro who had been arrested. In the early morning of September 14, 1814, during the Battle of Baltimore, Key, overcome with pride from his unique vantage point, wrote the words that captured the essence of our national struggle for independence. 
Frederick County is also the seat of some of our State's most tumultuous historic incidents. When the British passed the Stamp Act in 1785 requiring colonists to purchase stamps for all legal and commercial documents, twelve Frederick County judges resolved to reject the Stamp Act, and approved the use of unstamped documents. This bold maneuver is believed to be the first recorded act of rebellion in the colonies. 
It was in Frederick County that the Maryland legislature held the momentous vote on secession. The vote was held in this venue in response to a personal request from President Lincoln in the hope that Marylanders from the southern part of the State would not be able to attend, therefore guaranteeing that Maryland remain in the Union. Although the strategy was successful, the narrow vote sent reverberations throughout the State and there were skirmishes at towns along the Potomac. While the resulting Confederate occupation of parts of Frederick County was relatively peaceful, this event was the immediate precursor to the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day of fighting in any American war. 
A local anecdote, which serves as a testament to the tremendous dedication of these citizens, claims that on the day that General Jackson's troops were marching out of Frederick to Antietam, a Union flag was seen hanging from the home of Barbara Fritchie, a 95 year old widow known for her spirited nature, who risked injury and death by hanging from her window after shots were fired, flag in hand, shouting, `Shoot, if you must, this old gray head, but spare your country's flag.' 
Another significant event has its beginnings here, as it was from the City of Frederick that Lewis and Clark launched their exploration of the American West. In July, 1803, these two explorers set out from the Hessian Barracks in Frederick Town into uncharted territories. These events further illustrate Frederick County's position at the symbolic crossroads of history, and it is here that we find Maryland's true roots firmly in place. Frederick County is at a literal crossroads as well due to the construction of the B&O Railroad in the early 1800's and the location of the C&O canal. These two modes of transportation opened up major corridors from and to the east, laying the groundwork for a tradition of jobs, industry and trade. 
From this lasting spirit of community interdependence and unity comes many of Frederick's modern landmarks. Frederick County is home to Ft. Detrick, crucial to the creation of new jobs and economic development in the region, and to the National Fallen Firefighters memorial in Emmitsburg. In recent years, Frederick County has been a leader in developing new economic growth and opportunities for our State and has attracted innovative technology companies to its pleasant surroundings. 
The City of Frederick, the County Seat, is the second largest city in Maryland, yet it maintains its small town charm and sense of community that reflects the civil congeniality that has always defined Frederick, both in its rich history and its contemporary success. The contribution of Francis Scott Key to our nation has been complemented over the decades by other distinguished citizens of this county. Most recently, many of us in the Senate were privileged to count as a colleague the extremely distinguished Senator from Maryland and native son of Frederick, Charles Mac Mathias. The intellectual and personal integrity which Senator Mathias brought to this body in service to the nation is exemplary of the spirit of his fellow Frederick Countians. 
The activities that have been planned in celebration of this auspicious anniversary exemplify the deep devotion of Frederick residents to their county. I join these citizens in sharing their pride in Frederick's past and their optimism for continued achievement. I urge my colleagues to visit this lovely location in the heart of Maryland and explore this renowned resource.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, when this debate on the Shelby amendment first began, my colleague from Alabama quoted the introductory statement made by former chairman William Proxmire when he introduced the CRA legislation. We pointed out at the time that we thought the Proxmire rationale still supported his original position. 
I have received a letter from Senator Proxmire and he has asked me to read it into the Record. I will do that now. 
Dear Paul: I would appreciate your reading this letter into the Congressional Record at the appropriate time during the debate on the Credit Union bill. 
I am totally opposed to the Shelby amendment which would exempt small banks from the Community Reinvestment Act and take strong exception to the thrust of his `Dear Colleague' letter which quotes my remarks as the author of CRA and the Chairman of the Banking Committee at some length. 
Throughout my 32 year career in the Senate I championed the cause of the independent small banks of America. In my home state of Wisconsin they represented an important constituency. As Chairman of the Banking Committee from 1975-1980 and 1987-1989 and a member of the Committee from 1957-1989 no one fought harder to protect their interests. 
I count the enactment of CRA as one of the achievements of which I am most proud. I introduced CRA in 1977 because banks receive significant public benefits, such as federal deposit insurance and access to the Federal Reserve Board's discount window. In turn, banks have an obligation to help meet the credit needs of the localities they are chartered to serve. This obligation should apply to all banks, large and small alike, all of whom receive significant public benefits. 
I regret that the statement I made on the Senate floor in 1977 introducing the Community Reinvestment Act is being used to undermine the purpose for which I introduced the legislation. 
Sincerely, 
William Proxmire, U.S.S. (Retired--D-Wis.)  
That is Senator Proxmire's direct response to the effort to use his statement to, in effect, undermine support for the CRA. 
Mr. President, what is the time situation?

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, very quickly, let me just say to my colleagues that this legislation is not an allocation of credit. Larry Lindsey has said, and I quote him, former member of the Federal Reserve: 
Many [institutions] now recognize in an era of growing competition, CRA performance may be critical to an institution's ability to adjust to the new banking environment. CRA-related activities can help to develop new markets, potentially profitable business and improve a bank's public image. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated: 
The essential purpose of the CRA is to try to encourage institutions who are not involved in areas where their own self-interest is involved in doing so. If you are indicating to an institution that there is a foregone business opportunity in an area X or loan product Y, that is not credit allocation. That, indeed, is enhancing the market. 
Let's continue to enhance the market by supporting CRA and rejecting this amendment.

Mr. SARBANES. There is a special class of credit unions--known as community development credit unions--that bear special mention. Community development credit unions serve consumers, neighborhoods, and rural areas that are predominantly low-income. Because of their special mission and circumstances, some community development credit unions may have difficulty in generating capital. 
On the deposit side, community development credit unions have high operating costs because they serve an extremely labor-intensive market of very low-balance depositors. The average depositor in a community development credit union has $1,462, which is one-third the $4,300 of the average depositor in non-low-income credit unions. Typically, as much as 40 percent to 60 percent of the community development credit unions' membership base consists of persons with less than $200 on deposit. Moreover, many of community development credit unions' very-low-balance depositors use the credit union solely for transactions--that is, they deposit checks and immediately withdraw virtually the entire balance. 
On the lending side, community development credit union's business consists primarily of making small loans to borrowers with imperfect credit. The average loan balance per member at a community development credit union is $1,190 compared to $3,200 at all credit unions. Thus, community development credit union loans tend to have more credit risk and higher transaction costs (i.e., noninterest costs per dollar loaned) than loans made by other credit unions, thereby resulting in lower net returns. These lower net returns mean relatively lower income for the community development credit union, which makes capital accumulation more difficult. 
The challenges community development credit unions face from credit risk and low returns are exacerbated because communities served by community development credit unions are especially vulnerable to economic downturns. Unemployment rates in such communities are typically two or three times the national average. Unemployment in low-income communities is slow to decline as the economy improves, and quick to worsen when the economy deteriorates. 
Despite these challenges, most community development credit unions today are quite strong and have capital ratios similar to those of other credit unions. And the changes brought about by new capital requirements and prompt corrective action will ultimately strengthen all community development credit unions. 
Does the Senator agree that this is a fair description of the challenges facing community development credit unions?

Mr. SARBANES. The bill gives all credit unions two years before these provisions become effective. Because of their mission and the special characteristics that arise from that mission, some community development credit unions may have unique difficulties in becoming and remaining adequately capitalized. Accordingly, some community development credit unions may need more time than most other credit unions to build capital in order to comply with the legislation's new capital standards and prompt corrective action provisions. Does the Senator agree?

Mr. SARBANES. So, the question arises: How may the NCUA deal with this issue while implementing the bill's safety and soundness provisions? 
In my view, the NCUA should be mindful of community development credit unions' unique circumstances in applying the bill's prompt corrective action provisions. In addition, community development credit unions that demonstrate that they can build their capital over time to the required levels--as evidenced by an acceptable net worth restoration plan--should be given the full opportunity to do so.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first of all, I express my appreciation to the distinguished chairman for his very kind remarks about my efforts with respect to this legislation. But I really want to underscore the very skillful leadership which Chairman D'Amato provided in helping to move the bill through the committee and then through the Senate on the Senate floor. 
This was not a bill without significant controversy in it. I think the committee worked out a balanced package and preserved most of it on the Senate floor--I regret not all of it. But in any event, I think the legislation we now have passed is a reaffirmation for the credit union movement of their important role in serving consumers. 
When the cooperative movement was established in the early part of the century, it was premised on the proposition that individuals coming together, `small people,' would gain access to credit; that the credit union movement would remain concerned and dedicated to their needs and would provide them an opportunity to share in the American economy. 
Credit unions, by and large, have done a good job of that over the years. And this legislation, I think, will enable them to continue to do a good job. It has important safety and soundness provisions in it, the consequence of a very comprehensive and thorough Treasury study on the basis of which the committee was able to incorporate into the legislation some very important safeguards. 
But I say to the credit union movement: We worked very hard in the aftermath of the Supreme Court decision which, of course, cast a pall over the credit union movement. It really raised very severe questions as to what the future of the credit union movement would be. This legislation has answered that question. 
But I think implicit on the part of the Congress, in answering that question, is that credit unions will redouble their efforts in terms of serving the purposes for which they were established. 
Some have criticized the credit union movement. They say they are getting away from those purposes. I am frank to say I do not think that is generally true of the credit union movement. I think you can point to isolated exceptions. And I only raise the warning flag that to the extent those exist, they tarnish the image of the credit union movement in the eyes of many. 
So with this legislation, which has given them a path to move forward, a firm and secure path to move forward, I look forward to the credit union movement reaffirming its basic and original purposes and look forward to continuing to try to work closely with them in achieving those objectives. 
I, too, like the chairman, express my very deep appreciation to the staff on both sides, to Howard Menell and Phil Bechtel and Rachel Forward and Madelyn Simmons on the Republican side--we depend very heavily on our staff; they are extremely competent and dedicated; they were in here many nights, late into morning hours in order to help put this legislation together--and Steve Harris and Marty Gruenberg and Dean Shahinian and Mike Beresik on our side of the aisle. 
We were able to work together in a cooperative and positive and constructive manner on this legislation. I always look forward to those opportunities with the chairman. It is not always possible. Usually when it is not possible, we set up a separate committee to deal with the issues and work within our own committee. 
I close, again, by commending the chairman for a very skillful job in helping to move this legislation through the Senate. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to take just a moment to join those of my colleagues who have already spoken with respect to our profound shock at the death of Jacob `J.J.' Chestnut and John Gibson, two Capitol Police officers who lost their lives in the line of duty on this past Friday, and to express my very heartfelt sympathies to their families. 
J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson have been engaged over their working careers in the dedicated mission of protecting the lives of their fellow citizens, literally thousands of people who move in and out of the Capitol Building each day, those who work here, those who visit here, both our own citizens and from abroad. 
As we all know, on Friday, the people's house, the U.S. Capitol, was violated by a gunman. Officer Chestnut and Special Agent Gibson put themselves on the line, as do all law enforcement officials, each and every day, both at work and, since they are committed to law enforcement, even when they are off work, literally all the time, in order to protect the physical well-being--indeed, to protect the freedoms that so many of us have taken for granted. 
In its editorial today, Roll Call, which, of course, as we all know, is the newspaper devoted to reporting the activities on Capitol Hill, said this: 
Sometimes, given the comparative low level of violence around the Capitol complex and given that Capitol Police officers are usually seen cheerfully directing traffic and gently herding tourists, it's forgotten that ours-- 
Meaning the Capitol Police Force-- is a real police force. We who live and work around the Capitol know--but others don't--that our police also fight crime in the neighborhood as well as watch the Capitol. But now all of America understands that the Capitol Police do not just stand guard, but also stand ready to be heroes. That knowledge was derived last week at heartrending cost. 
We call them heroes today, and they truly are, but Officer Chestnut and Special Agent Gibson were also husbands, fathers, grandfathers--already heroes to their wives, to their children and grandchildren, to their other family members, and to their neighbors who respected them not only for their uniforms but for the laws they vowed to uphold and the lives they protected on a daily basis. It is these loving people they leave behind, having given of themselves to protect the lives of others and in defending one of the great symbols of this democratic Nation, perhaps the preeminent symbol of our democratic Nation--the United States Capitol. 
Mr. President, may God bless J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson. They are true heroes, and I join with my colleagues in expressing my condolences to their family members.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be very brief, but I want to follow on the chairman in expressing my opposition to this amendment. The chairman just quoted from a letter from Secretary Rubin, but I would like to expand that quotation a bit. In his last paragraph, Secretary Rubin said:  
Finally, I would like to comment on the safety and soundness of credit unions' business lending. 
So he addressed this very issue. 
Credit unions may make business loans only to their members, and cannot make loans to business corporations. Under the National Credit Union Administration's regulations, each business loan must be fully secured with good-quality collateral, the borrower must be personally liable on the loan, and business loans to any one borrower generally cannot exceed 15 percent of the credit union's reserves. Credit unions' business loans have delinquency rates that are comparable to those on commercial loans made by community banks and thrifts, and charge-off (i.e., loss) rates that compare favorably with those of banks and thrifts. We believe that existing safeguards--together with such new statutory protections as the 6 percent capital requirement, the risk-based capital requirement for complex credit unions, and the system of prompt corrective action--represent an adequate response to safety and soundness concerns about credit unions' business lending. 
It is important to note, of course, that the Secretary is speaking with the benefit of an 18-month--actually, the distinguished Senator from Utah was the one who put the requirement in in the previous piece of legislation for the Treasury to undertake such a study. That study came in a few months ago and then was available to the Treasury, in terms of making recommendations as we address this legislation, and available, of course, to the Members of the Congress. 
The Secretary pointed out in his letter: 
The bill's safety and soundness provisions would represent the most significant legislative reform of credit union safety and soundness safeguards since the creation of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in 1970. The bill would institute capital standards for all federally insured credit unions, including a risk-based capital requirement for complex credit unions. It would create a system of prompt corrective action--specifically tailored to credit unions as not-for-profit, member-owned cooperatives. It would also take a series of steps to make the Share Insurance Fund even stronger and more resilient. 
These reforms involve little cost or burden to credit unions today, yet they could pay enormous dividends in more difficult times. 
Mr. President, I think it is important to note that this legislation, as it came to us in the committee, had no limitations. And under the current law and regulations, there are no limitations. So what the committee is doing here is putting in a limitation where none had heretofore existed. So it is not as though the committee simply ignored the assertions that are now being made. The committee reached a decision and struck a balancing point. And that is what is reflected in the legislation. 
But as I said, this does place statutory restrictions on member business loans for the first time. In fact, undercapitalized credit unions would not be permitted to increase their net commercial lending. In fact, the restrictions that are in this legislation are tighter than what now applies under the regulations of the National Credit Union Administration. 
These loans can only be made to members, not to an outside business corporation. This is consistent with the credit union's mandate to provide services to members, not a broad array of customers, and in and of itself places a significant constraint on credit union commercial lending overall. 
I understand the arguments that are being made. I think the committee reached a reasonable process. The $50,000-loan issue, I think, is an important one in terms of the requirements placed upon credit unions. In fact, it is the NCUA, under its regulations, that determines that the dollar amount of risk is very small, small enough that they have regulations that excluded loans less than $50,000 from being counted as a member business loan. 
This is the current state of affairs. There are not all that many such loans. But for some credit unions, it is quite important in terms of their member activities. It also avoids the necessity of trying to separate out what is a commercial loan and what is a business loan. 
If you buy a pickup truck and use it for business activities, does that then become a commercial loan? And how would the credit unions have to address those kinds of questions? 
I say to my colleagues, recognizing the issue that is being raised by the amendment, I simply say that the committee was not oblivious to this issue. We tried to address it, I think, in a sensible and balanced and forthright way. That is why we have the limitations that are contained in the legislation that is before us. 
I urge my colleagues not to alter those limitations and, therefore, to reject this amendment. 
Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I don't think it is altogether accurate to say that the current bill seeks only to keep in place the exact current situation. As the Treasury pointed out in a letter from Secretary Rubin to the leadership, `The bill's safety and soundness provisions would represent the most significant legislative reform of credit union safety and soundness safeguards since the creation of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in 1970.' So that, in effect, we made very substantial changes on the safety and soundness issue, and the Treasury Secretary later in his letter, when he was discussing the very issue of the safety and soundness of credit unions business lending, came back and made reference to these changes: `. . . the risk-based capital requirement for complex credit unions, and the system of prompt corrective action--represent an adequate response to safety and soundness concerns about credit unions' business lending.' 
So we did, in effect, make some significant changes on the safety and soundness issue. The Treasury has referenced those changes in analyzing the question of credit unions' business lending and thereby reached its conclusion that that did not pose a safety and soundness issue.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, very briefly, if we were seeking to leave the consumer or the user of the credit union exactly in the posture in which they now find themselves prior to the Supreme Court decision, we would have no limitation on credit union business lending, because that was the existing state of affairs. 
So in that sense, the problem of an issue was raised. There was an effort to respond to that problem. But if one is to use the argument that all we should do in this legislation is to return to the status quo--that that is the whole purpose of the legislation--then we have no limitation, because the status quo was without limitation.

Mr. SARBANES. I just want to again reiterate on the safety and soundness issue that the Department of the Treasury was charged by the Congress in the Economic Growth and Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 to undertake a major study of credit unions, and the Department did that. This is the report from the Treasury Department which was submitted to us on December 11 of 1997. So they took some 15 months to do it. 
In his letter to the leadership, Secretary Rubin underscored that the safety and soundness provisions in this bill, which in effect largely track what the Secretary recommended, were the most significant legislative reform of credit union safety and soundness safeguards since the creation of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in 1970 and went on then to find that the business lending provisions posed no difficulty, that they represented an adequate response to safety and soundness concerns about credit unions' business lending. 
I won't take a back seat to anyone in my concern about safety and soundness, but I think that has been addressed in this legislation. The Treasury, which did this extensive study and made these quite broad recommendations, took a look at the bill and has concluded that the bill represents a very major and significant legislative reform of credit union safety and soundness safeguards, and in light of those provisions that are in the bill thought that they were adequate to any concerns with respect to safety and soundness about credit unions' business lending. 
We have the people who did this comprehensive study--they took 15 months--make their recommendations, some of which were quite significant. The committee responded to that, and in the light of what the committee has done, the Treasury has taken the official position that concerns about credit union business lending have been addressed adequately in this legislation.

Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, a lot has been said here this afternoon. I regret some of the rhetoric. I don't think it advances a rational discussion of the issue, to talk about extortion and piracy, I must say, because I think there are very important issues here with respect to CRA, and I want to cover both of them since a lot of the arguments that are used on the amendment pending before us which would remove from the bill a sort of modified version of CRA which would be placed on credit unions, which was in the bill as it came over to us from the House of Representatives--a lot of those arguments really relate to CRA as it applies to banks, and that application is being used to make an argument with respect to credit unions. 
First of all, it had been asserted earlier that the rationale for CRA which Senator Proxmire advanced back at the time of its passage in 1977 has all eroded, but the fact of the matter is, when that argument was made, one of the major points that Senator Proxmire advanced for the application of CRA was omitted from the list of considerations; namely, that deposit insurance is available to these institutions and the importance of deposit insurance. 
This was underscored, of course, because in the 1980s Federal insurance for the savings and loans cost us $132 billion, without counting the indirect costs that were incurred in interest payments in order to finance the direct payments which were necessary. 
Many of those who are arguing against are against any CRA requirement for any federally insured financial institutions, and I think it is important to understand that. Of course, I come from a very different point of view. 
The fact of the matter is that CRA does not require a bank to make subsidized loans. It doesn't require it to make uncreditworthy loans. It doesn't require it to lend to a particular individual. It is not an allocation of credit. 
What it requires it to do is pay attention to its community so it can't simply take money out of the community and, in effect, not be in the posture of putting money back into the community, which is, of course, what the act says community reinvestment is. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has pointed out: 
The essential purpose of the CRA is to try to encourage institutions who are not involved in areas where their own self-interest is involved in doing so. If you are indicating to an institution that there is a forgone business opportunity in area X or loan product Y, that is not credit allocation. That, indeed, is enhancing the market. 
What this has enabled us to do is to draw into the mainstream of economic life communities that had previously been neglected. It has worked well, and there is every reason that it also should apply to the credit unions who, of course, also get the benefit of a Federal guarantee standing behind their insurance fund. 
With respect to these sharp statements about how CRA has been used by community groups, let me quote on the record some of the statements that banks and bankers have said about it. 
The Bank of America says: 
Over the past several years, Bank of America, in partnership with community organizations, has developed CRA lending into a profitable mainstream business * * *. We have taken what began as a compliance function and turned it into a business line that makes economic as well as social sense. 
We believe we have demonstrated over the past several years that when institutions develop CRA programs as a business tool, and provide lending products with flexible but prudent underwriting criteria, low-income lending can be safe, sound and profitable. 
`* * * low-income lending can be safe, sound and profitable.'

Through our subsidiary, LaSalle Talman Home Mortgage Corporation, we are the largest residential mortgage lender in both the Chicago metropolitan area and the state of Illinois. 
. . . CRA has proved to be a positive force here in Chicago. It has been the instrument that has provided millions of dollars in investment that has financed home purchase, rehabilitation and home improvement, and new construction in once underserved communities. 
CRA is not bad business or `have to' business. CRA allows discretion and choice to the lender. It allows for reasoned negotiation and workable solutions. It has provided a forum where financial institutions, corporations, and community organizations can work in a spirit of cooperation to meet community credit needs. 
The objective is to meet these community credit needs. We have discovered now a path down which we can go and which, in the course of meeting the community needs, the financial institutions benefit and profit from it.

Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, in this statement they reaffirm their CRA commitment and announce an expansion of their CRA goals. Sumitomo itself came in and said they were proud to announce that, just 4 years into the plan, the bank had made great progress. They then quote some figures of how they come close to meeting their various goals: 
Encouraged by our success to date, we have decided to reaffirm our commitment by expanding our original Goals. Based on our progress, we will strive to achieve our original . . . goal within six years, four years earlier than originally targeted. . . . 
They doubled their goal. So they recognize that it was working, that it was mutually beneficial. They closed by saying this `will greatly assist all the communities we serve, while helping our Bank achieve our own business goals.' 
Recently The Enterprise Foundation, which of course was founded by Jim Rouse, one of the great visionaries, in my judgment, in our Nation with respect to community development, urban planning, affordable housing, they described in a publication `Community Reinvestment, Good Works, Good Business'--`Good Works, Good Business'--they cited programs in Florida, Missouri, Iowa, California, Nebraska, New York, Minnesota, and New Jersey as examples, cited the banks, the programs they were carrying out under CRA. And they went on to say: 
Many banks have discovered that community lending is good business. These banks would continue to meet their obligations regardless of federal requirements. But others need encouragement, and CRA has proven effective at providing this. CRA has helped banks discover new markets and profit opportunities that they otherwise might have overlooked. 
We had all these complaints about paperwork, overregulation. The regulators undertook a major effort to slim that down, with great success. The various banking associations, after that was completed, appraised the process through which we had gone in order to simplify and streamline this process. So it is working. It is bringing in these communities. It is drawing people into the financial mainstream. And it seems to me a reasonable requirement. 
Let me make just one final point, because the point is being asserted that, well, these banks that would be exempted under the amendment offered by Senator Shelby hold a small portion of the assets of all banks nationally. But what you have to understand is that 85 percent of all banks in the country would be eliminated from the CRA by the Shelby amendment. In six States, over 95 percent of the banks fall into this category. In nine other States, over 90 percent of the banks fall into this category. There are 30 States in which 80 percent of the banks fall into this category. 
Many are rural States. CRA is often perceived as benefiting the urban areas of our country. However, rural areas, no less than urban areas, benefit from CRA.

Rural Americans need tools of the Community Reinvestment Act to ensure accountability of their local lending institutions. It is needed to prevent rural banks from abandoning their commitment to serve the millions of Americans living in smaller low and moderate-income communities. Unfortunately, small commercial banks do not automatically reinvest in their local communities.

Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, let me just very quickly focus on the credit unions only. This debate has tended to overlap both areas. It is done by the proponents of the amendment and, of course, we have responded too, because, in part, your attitude is going to be affected by how you see CRA functioning and whether you perceive it as bringing beneficial impacts or whether you perceive it as being harmful or not. I submit there is strong evidence that it has brought significant beneficial impacts, and many of the studies have supported that. 
What is being applied to the credit unions in this legislation is not the full CRA provision. But this does require the credit union regulator, the National Credit Union Administration, to review the record of each insured credit union in providing credit union services to all individuals of modest means within the field of membership of the credit union. 
It would not require them to go outside of the field of membership. They could not be required to give a loan to someone who was not a member of the credit union because that is a requirement of credit unions in terms of their loan policy. But they would have to try to draw in, make an effort to draw in people who were within the field of membership. They would have to concern themselves with trying to bring both low- and moderate-income as well as the sort of very top of the line within their field of membership. 
The NCUA has directed a focus on the actual performance of the credit union not to impose burdensome paperwork or record-keeping requirements. This provision included in the House bill that was sent to us has been crafted to respond to the situation of credit unions. It is an effort to encourage them to meet the financial service needs of all their members and to reach out to those in the field of membership who have not yet joined and gotten the benefit of the credit union's services. 
It is really a modest proposal. It has been suggested that the credit unions are not fiercely opposing it because they have somehow or other been coerced into that position--that is certainly not my understanding--just as it has been suggested that we need to get people to talk to some of these bankers who favor the CRA. 
We are told, `Well, now we have these people who are against it. We cannot identify them because if we identify them then they are going to get into a lot of trouble.' Well, I have people I can identify who would tell you that CRA has worked, that it has made an important impact, that the financial institution has found it not to be a burden but has found it actually to be profitable, that it has developed a better relationship in terms of their service area in terms of providing needed financial services. In effect, we are gaining public benefits from it, from an industry which received very significant public benefits in the sense of the insurance, the backup to the insurance, the Federal Government guarantee, access to low-cost credit through the Federal Reserve window and the Federal Reserve payment system. 
This is enabling us to make very significant progress. The estimates in terms of the money that has gone into previously neglected communities is in the hundreds of billions of dollars. This is an effort to make capitalism work in a broader expanse, both geographically and in terms of the individuals who then are drawn in to play a part in the system. 
I know some harsh language has been quoted earlier by community groups. I do not begin to try to justify or excuse that harsh language, although I must say some pretty harsh language has been used here on the floor of the Senate which I also regret. But we ought to look at this as an opportunity. This is turning into a win-win situation. It enables us then to sort of say, look, this economic system can work for everybody. 
Those of you who are sort of complaining that you are shut out of this economic system, we have found ways to make this system--to open it up so it works for everybody. The institutions make a profit. They do good. They do well by doing good. People who otherwise would be fighting the system are drawn into the system. They become a part of the workings of this, of our financial structure and, therefore, become able to make a contribution to our society. 
It has brought enormous benefits in so many areas of the country. As I said, the Chicago Bank says, `It's a positive force here in Chicago. It has been the instrument that has provided millions of dollars in investment that has financed home purchases, rehabilitation, and home improvement and new construction in once underserved communities.' 
That is what we are trying to accomplish. 
The Shelby amendment, of course, would eliminate all of that, take us back a significant step. The Gramm amendment would prevent the extension of this concept of serving the community to the credit unions. I oppose it and I very much hope my colleagues would oppose it as well.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, first I want to thank my colleague, Chairman D'Amato, for his kind words and to underscore the very effective leadership which the chairman has exercised in bringing this legislation to this point. This bill came out of the committee on a vote of 16 to 2. We had very strong support within the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, and I have been pleased to be able to work closely with the chairman in trying to craft this legislation. 
We had, as usual, outstanding contributions by members of the staff on both the Republican and the Democratic sides, and we are most appreciative to them for the many long hours they have put in on this legislation. 
The time is now to straighten out the credit union challenge which was posed by the Supreme Court decision. This legislation passed the House of Representatives in the beginning of April by a vote of 411 to 8. The Senate Banking Committee, after holding two hearings on the issue, marked up the legislation on April 30 and reported it with amendments to the full Senate by a vote of 16 to 2. Since April 30, we have been looking for an opening on the Legislative Calendar in order to take the matter up in the Chamber, and the majority leader has provided this opening. 
If I could have the attention of the majority leader, I would like to ask, it is my understanding the intention now is to do the opening statements--I know that Senator Shelby and others have amendments--and begin debate on the amendments, continue that on Monday afternoon beginning at about 1 o'clock, and any votes that would transpire in relationship to the amendments which have been offered would occur beginning about 6 o'clock Monday evening?

Mr. SARBANES. I just want to underscore the intention is, and we have every reasonable expectation that, we are going to be able to complete this bill finally by Tuesday morning and do a good deal of it by Monday evening. 
In addition to the broad bipartisan support for this legislation in the Congress, it is strongly supported by the administration. Senator D'Amato has already placed in the Record a letter that Secretary Rubin, our very able Secretary of the Treasury, sent to the majority leader and to the minority leader urging expeditious Senate passage of the bill without any extraneous amendments. Of course, the amendments are the important issue that we will be considering over the next few days. 
President Clinton has personally indicated his support for this legislation, urging the Senate to pass the bill without weighing it down with extraneous and controversial amendments that would seriously jeopardize the legislation. H.R. 1151 is also supported by a very diverse range of groups in the community including the Consumer Federation of America, the Seniors Coalition, the National Farmers Union, National Educational Association, Americans for Tax Reform, the American Small Business Association, AFL-CIO, and the National Urban Coalition. 
The broad support for this legislation suggests the important role credit unions play in our economy. Since the founding of the first credit union in the United States in 1909, almost a century ago, credit unions have served as a way for people of average means, without easy access to credit, to pool their savings in order to make loans to fellow credit union members at competitive interest rates. 
Mr. President, the impetus for H.R. 1151 came from a Supreme Court decision earlier this year. In a 5 to 4 decision, the Court held that under the Federal Credit Union Act a federally chartered credit union may only have a single common bond of occupation. This overturned a policy of the National Credit Union Administration, the regulators of the credit unions, first adopted in 1982, which permitted multiple groups each having a separate common bond to be part of a single Federal credit union. 
The consequence of that Supreme Court decision is to prohibit the formation of multiple group credit unions. Even if the lower courts, in implementing the Supreme Court decision, permit existing multiple group credit unions to stay in business and to accept members from their current groups, employees from the large majority of companies in the United States will find their future opportunities to become a member of a Federal credit union seriously constrained by the Supreme Court's decision. 
The National Credit Union Administration generally does not permit groups with less than 500 employees to start a credit union because it is judged the group is not broad enough or numerous enough to support a credit union in a safe and sound manner. The only way for employees of these companies to join a credit union is if the companies affiliate with existing credit unions. So, if new multiple bond credit unions are prohibited, this will no longer be possible and millions of Americans may be denied the opportunity to join a credit union. This outcome is clearly undesirable, in my view, and is, of course, the basis for the broad bipartisan support for enacting this legislation. 
This legislation would first grandfather existing multiple group credit unions and allow them to add members from their current groups. In addition, it would permit Federal credit unions to have multiple groups, each of which, after the first group, has a common bond of occupation or association and has less than 3,000 members. The bill would also give the National Credit Union Administration the power to authorize credit unions to add additional groups if it finds the groups cannot safely establish and operate a credit union on their own. The Credit Union Administration could also permit a Federal credit union to add a person or organization located in a local community, neighborhood, or rural district that it has determined is underserved by other depository institutions. 
But, in order for a Federal credit union to accept additional membership groups, the NCUA would have to find that the credit union is adequately capitalized, has adequate managerial or financial resources, and has a satisfactory examination record. The legislation directs the Credit Union Administration to encourage the formation of separately chartered credit unions whenever practicable and consistent with safety and soundness. 
In addition to addressing the membership issue, this legislation requires significant new safety and soundness standards for Federal credit unions. These new requirements are based on recommendations contained in a carefully prepared study of credit unions by the Treasury Department conducted at the direction of the Congress and submitted last year. 
Earlier, in legislation, the Congress directed the Treasury Department to study credit unions and to submit a report to the Congress. A good deal of what is contained in this legislation reflects the outcome of that study. 
The bill imposes, for the first time, statutory capital standards on Federal credit unions. The bill requires an insured credit union to have a net worth ratio of 7 percent to be `well capitalized' and 6 percent to be `adequately capitalized.' A credit union with a net worth ratio of less than 6 percent would be `undercapitalized,' at 4 percent it would be `significantly undercapitalized,' and at 2 percent `critically undercapitalized.' The legislation provides a system of prompt corrective action which requires the National Credit Union Administration to take a series of progressively more stringent measures if the credit union falls below the `adequately capitalized' level. Each insured credit union that is undercapitalized would be required to submit an acceptable net worth restoration plan to the NCUA. Until that plan is approved, the credit union generally would not be permitted to increase its average total assets. If an insured credit union becomes critically undercapitalized according to the standards I mentioned earlier, the NCUA would be required to liquidate the credit union, appoint a conservator, or take such other action as it determines could better achieve the purpose of protecting the credit union insurance fund. 
I have taken a few moments to dwell on these provisions because I think they are quite important. They have generally not been involved in the debate that has led up to considering the measure on the floor, but I think Members need to appreciate the very important safety and soundness provisions contained in this legislation. This is a major step in ensuring financial stability in the credit union industry. It has led the Secretary of the Treasury, in the letter which he sent to the leadership, to make this statement. I just want to quote this paragraph from Secretary Rubin's letter:  
The bill's safety and soundness provisions would represent the most significant legislative reform of credit union safety and soundness safeguards since the creation of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund in 1970. The bill would institute capital standards for all federally insured credit unions, including a risk-based capital requirement for complex credit unions. It would create a system of prompt corrective action--specifically tailored to credit unions as not-for-profit, member-owned cooperative. It would also take a series of steps to make the Share Insurance Fund even stronger and more resilient. 
These reforms involve little cost or burden to credit unions today, yet they could pay enormous dividends in more difficult times. 
We worked closely with the Treasury in considering the provisions that were in the legislation. I think this is a major step forward. I really commend this aspect of the legislation to my colleagues as they consider the overall bill. 
Furthermore, this bill imposes, for the first time, a limit on commercial lending by credit unions. No such limit currently exists. The bill provides that a credit union would be generally limited in its member business loans to no more than the lesser of 1.75 times the minimum net worth required for well-capitalized credit unions--namely 7 percent--or 1.7 times its actual net worth. This would put a limit on member business loans for a well-capitalized credit union at approximately 12.25 percent of its total loans. Loans of less than $50,000 would be excluded--that is an operating practice currently--and we would continue to adhere to that. 
Many credit unions are chartered for or have a history of making business loans to their members. Members of a specialized vocation--farmers, fishermen, taxi drivers and so forth--would not be subject to this limit. 
Furthermore, this legislation imposes, for the first time, a modest but meaningful community obligation with respect to reinvestment in insured credit unions, which has been carefully tailored to the membership-based nature of credit unions. It would require the National Credit Union Administration to prescribe criteria for periodically reviewing the record of each insured credit union in providing affordable credit union services to all individuals of modest means, including low- and moderate-income individuals, within the field of membership of the credit union, and provide for making such results publicly available. 
The bill also directs the National Credit Union Administration, in evaluating any insured credit union under this requirement, to focus on the actual performance of the credit union and not to impose burdensome paperwork or recordkeeping requirements. We think this is a modest but important step in paying attention to the needs of low- and moderate-income individuals, and thereby making access to credit more broadly available. 
In conclusion, let me just say this is a very carefully developed and balanced piece of legislation. As I said, the committee held two extensive hearings on the matter. It worked very carefully over the provisions that have been included in the legislation and brought here before the Senate. This legislation seeks to make credit union membership accessible while strengthening the safety and soundness of federally insured credit unions and encourages them to meet the financial service needs of all of their members. 
I strongly urge the support of this legislation by my colleagues. I strongly urge my colleagues to reject extraneous amendments that may be offered to the legislation that may complicate or jeopardize its enactment. We now need to move this legislation forward. 
I think a very careful package has been put together here. The credit union movement supports the legislation as reported by the committee. The administration supports the legislation as reported by the committee. I respect, obviously, the motivation of my colleagues who intend to offer amendments, but I can only point out that those amendments would greatly complicate our efforts to move this legislation to final passage and signature into law by the President. I very much hope my colleagues can back the work that was done by the committee in bringing this matter to the Senate floor. 
I, again, thank Chairman D'Amato for his skillful work in developing the legislation to this point and bringing it to the floor of the Senate. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, before the Senator from Alabama leaves the floor--because this is going to turn into a very interesting debate, and I want to make clear the parameters of it, obviously--he sent out a letter quoting Senator Proxmire. I am sure he is a good former trial lawyer, and he would anticipate that we would go and read all of the Proxmire statement from which he was making selections which were reflected on the chart that he just showed us. 
Now, from that Proxmire statement, the very one containing these selections which the Senator says is his rationale for supporting the Community Reinvestment Act, and from which the Senator allegedly shows that the rationale no longer applies--although I disagree with even that assertion--let me read to you. I will read the next sentence, which didn't appear on the Senator's chart, I regret to say.

Mr. SARBANES. Let me make the point, and then I would be happy to yield. 
The next sentence said: 
The Government provides deposit insurance through the FDIC and the FSLIC with a financial backup from the U.S. Treasury. 
`The Government provides deposit insurance through the FDIC and the FSLIC with a financial backup from the U.S. Treasury.' 
That wasn't quoted as a rationale why it is reasonable to expect financial institutions to look after the needs of their community--because they are getting a very important Government support in the deposit insurance. 
Now, Senator Proxmire made the statement in 1977. To prove his statement, in the 1980s, and to underscore the meaningfulness of the public benefits provided to federally insured financial institutions during the S&L crisis, the GAO report says that `the direct and indirect cost to the United States taxpayers of resolving the savings and loan crisis, namely delivering on this insurance which is provided to them, was $132 billion--$132 billion--`and that does not include the interest expenses associated with financing the direct costs of the crisis which would drive the figure even higher.' 
So, please, with all respect to the former chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, if we are going to start doing selections out of his statements, certainly we should include what I regard as the most important single rationale that he put there: 
The Government provides deposit insurance through the FDIC and the FSLIC with a financial backup from the U.S. Treasury. 
Now, that comes right out of the Congressional Record of January 24, 1977, which is what the Senator said in the letter he sent to Members he was quoting from. But, unfortunately, for the purposes of clarity in debate, that provision was not cited. Of course, that is the very provision that became applicable in the 1980s when we had the S&L crisis, and we delivered to the tune of $132 billion in order to honor the deposit insurance requirements. 
Obviously, without the deposit insurance requirements, you wouldn't have these industries. They are absolutely dependent on them to provide a basic level of financial stability and consumer confidence. 
So I appreciate the Senator yielding, but I thought it was important to get that on the Record at this point, although we will bring it up again in the debate later on.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I know we, in effect, have concluded the debate today with respect to the credit union bill, but there were some comments made earlier about the CRA aspects of this legislation, and I want to put this in the Record. 
First of all, let me make it very clear, the CRA that is being applied to the credit unions is not the Community Reinvestment Act. It is a provision drafted especially for the credit unions, and it is designed to ensure that they pay full attention to the field of membership. I think it is a reasonable provision. I hope it will stay in the bill. 
I know that the Senator from Texas is trying to strike it, but, of course, he is against any CRA, any version of CRA anywhere and at any time. I disagree very strongly with that. We will have an extended debate on the effort to exclude some banks from CRA. 
There is really a basic philosophical difference. We see the CRA as bringing people into the mainstream of economic life and involving them in our economic process. I have spoken to many bankers who support CRA. They think it has produced good results. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has said:  
The essential purpose of the CRA is to try to encourage institutions who are not involved in areas where their own self-interest is involved, in doing so. If you are indicating to an institution that there is a forgone business opportunity in an area X or loan product Y, that is not credit allocation. That, indeed, is enhancing the market. 
That is Chairman Greenspan. 
It is being portrayed by its opponents as sort of a mandatory credit allocation. It certainly is not that. It is an effort to ensure a reasonable amount of money goes back into the community. 
A number of banks have issued statements in support of CRA. They say it has increased their focus on their lending performance. In fact, the Bank of America said: 
Over the past several years, Bank of America, in partnership with community organizations, has developed CRA lending into a profitable mainstream business. 
And that is really what we are trying to achieve--a profitable mainstream business.' These institutions receive deposit insurance, and I earlier indicated the importance of that to the workings of the industry and the fact we had to produce hundreds of billions of dollars in the S&L crisis in order to deliver on that promise. 
There was a problem with CRA over bookkeeping, recordkeeping, and so forth. Secretary Rubin led a major effort to revise the Federal regulations. This extended over a 12- to 18-month period. All groups were involved--the bankers, the community groups, academics, the administration. In effect, Members of the Congress were drawn into the process, and, in the end, very, very significant changes were made. As a consequence, I think many of the defects that earlier were argued against CRA were taken care of. Much of the regulatory overburden I think was removed. 
The argument was made that these small banks hold only a fraction of the assets. The fact is that in 30 States, over 80 percent of the banks would be affected by the Shelby amendment. In other words, it would exclude 80 percent of the banks; in 6 States, over 95 percent; in 9 other States, over 90 percent; and the remainder, the other 15 States, over 80 percent. 
Most of these are rural States, and there seems to be a perception that CRA benefits only the urban areas of our country. However, rural areas, no less than urban areas, are affected by it. We received a letter from a coalition of rural and farm groups, including the National Farmers Union, the National Family Farm Coalition, the National Rural Housing Coalition, and the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, in opposition to the small bank exemption for CRA.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I will quote a portion of this letter: 
Rural Americans need the tools of the Community Reinvestment Act to ensure accountability of their local lending institutions. It is needed to prevent rural banks from abandoning their commitment to serve the millions of Americans living in smaller low- or moderate-income communities. Unfortunately, small commercial banks do not automatically reinvest in their local communities. 
It is a strong view that CRA has really brought investment back into the communities and that this has redounded to everyone's advantage, including--including--the advantage of the banks. 
We think that CRA has been remarkably effective in encouraging both large and small banks to look closely at market opportunities in all of the areas which they serve and in building a better relationship between the banks and the community. The result has been billions of dollars in market-rate profitable loans in urban and rural communities that historically have had difficulty in gaining access to credit. 
That is the basic, bottom-line message, and it is a very good message. It is a very good message for the country. 
I very much hope that as my colleagues think through this issue, they will appreciate the benefits that flow from CRA and reject the Shelby amendment, which would exclude banks under $250 million in assets--which, as I indicated, are the overwhelming number of banks in the country--and reject the Gramm amendment which seeks to eliminate a modest provision in the credit union bill that would require the credit unions to take a look at how they are serving their field of membership in their community, a provision which, I might note, the credit unions have indicated they accept. In fact, their stated position to us is that they support this bill as reported from the committee. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the VA-HUD Appropriations bill. I thank Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski, my good friend from Maryland, for their efforts in bringing this bill to the floor so quickly. I know how difficult it is to balance the many competing needs contained in this appropriations bill. Senators Bond and Mikulski are to be commended for the good bill that they have produced. 
As Ranking Member of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, I am particularly pleased with the appropriations for HUD. S. 2168 provides an increase in appropriations to HUD over what was enacted in FY 1998. I applaud these funding increases and I believe they will go a long way towards helping our neediest citizens. However, I am concerned that they fall somewhat short of the Administration's request--and considerably short of what is needed to address the severe housing and community development needs in this country. 
Today, only about one out of every 4 households in need of housing assistance receives it. This includes households living in public housing, assisted housing, and housing built with the tax credit and HOME funds. Of the roughly 12 million unassisted families, approximately five and a half million have worst-case housing needs. These families are paying more than half of their incomes every month in rent, or live in physically substandard housing, or both. 
My colleagues on the Appropriations Committee recognize this need. For the first time since 1995, they have provided for additional incremental vouchers; $40 million has been appropriated to support roughly 7,000 to 8,000 welfare-to-work vouchers--vouchers that will play a crucial role in helping smooth the transition from welfare to work. Furthermore, the appropriators have deleted a provision in current law which requires housing authorities to retain vouchers and certificates for a period of three months upon their turnover. This simple change means that as many as 40,000 additional low-income families will be served by the Section 8 program each year. I commend the appropriators for implementing this change. 
While I applaud the direction S. 2168 moves us, I am discouraged by the pace. I fully understand the constraints in which the Committee has to work, but these constraints are artificial. CBO tells us to expect up to $63 billion in budget surpluses for FY '98, and hundreds of billions of dollars in surpluses over the next ten years. At least some portion of these funds should be returned to the HUD budget, which has been sacrificed over the years in the name of deficit reduction. 
An appropriate start would be to fully fund the Administration's request of 50,000 welfare-to-work vouchers. A recent HUD study found that the fastest growth in worst case housing needs during the 1990s has been among working families. These findings indicate that wages earned by lower income working families simply have not kept pace with the escalating cost of housing. Welfare-to-work vouchers help fill the gap between real wages and housing costs. Additionally, they help unemployed and underemployed individuals move to where jobs are available. Finally, welfare-to-work vouchers build new partnerships between housing agencies and other local agencies which promote and implement welfare reform. For all of these reasons, it is important that more welfare-to-work vouchers are available in future years. 
We should also be providing funding to fulfill the President's request of 34,000 vouchers for homeless persons. Homelessness continues to be a significant problem in this country. It is estimated that as many as 2 million people will experience homelessness at some point in the next year. Some of these people have chronic disabilities that lead to chronic homelessness; others experience unanticipated problems such as job loss or a sudden illness which results in displacement from their housing. 
That is why I strongly support the appropriators' decision to substantially increase funding for homeless programs, and their decision to include a recommendation that 30% of all funding be allocated to permanent housing. These gestures indicate a real commitment to attaching permanent solutions to the problem of homelessness. But make no mistake. Vouchers are an essential tool for addressing the needs of the homeless. A tenant-based voucher provides immediate assistance to families in need, and is a much better and cheaper housing alternative than a shelter. Project-based vouchers can leverage funding for supportive housing developments, which provide essential services for chronically disabled and chronically homeless individuals. 
I am also pleased to see a renewed commitment to the HOPE VI program. S. 2168 would increase funding for the HOPE VI program by $50 million. This program has provided a crucial source of funding for redeveloping obsolete public housing developments and transforming entire neighborhoods. HOPE VI funds are used to leverage other public and private funds which can be used to promote resident self-sufficiency and economic independence. I have witnessed first-hand the impact that this program has had on communities in Baltimore, and I commend the appropriators for pledging more funds in support of these vital initiatives. 
In order to succeed, however, public housing needs more funding. Without adequate operating subsidies, public housing authorities cannot pay for the day to day operations of their housing developments. PHAs are forced to put off routine maintenance and small capital projects. Over time, this leads to a greater demand for large scale capital improvements. It is currently estimated that PHAs would need roughly $4.5 billion of capital funds per year for 10 years just to address their backlogged capital needs. The Senate appropriation of $2.55 billion in capital funding for FY 1999 represents a $50 million increase over the level enacted in 1998, but does not come close to addressing the severe need for public housing capital improvements. 
It is regrettable that S. 2168, while providing a much needed $75 million increase for Community Development Block Grants, does not adequately fund the Administration's Economic Development Initiative. The EDI supports grants and Federal loan guarantees which municipalities can use to leverage private capital for business loans, community development banks, revolving loan funds, large scale retail developments, and welfare-to-work projects. HUD requested $400 million to fund EDI in FY '99, anticipating that this would leverage $2 billion in private sector loans and create roughly 280,000 jobs in needy communities. Economic growth and jobs are the key to revitalizing urban areas, and the EDI fosters these opportunities. It is unfortunate that the EDI could only be funded at $85 million. 
I am pleased that the appropriators showed a commitment to homeownership by expanding the FHA single family mortgage insurance program. This program is the best tool that the Federal government has for helping low- to moderate-income families become homeowners, and it doesn't cost the taxpayer a single dime. It is well documented that the FHA program serves a higher proportion of low-income, minority and first-time homebuyers than any of the conventional home loan products. By increasing the loan limits for this program, we should see a further expansion in homeownership throughout the country--both in high cost urban areas and lower cost rural regions.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee for his support for this amendment. 
The National Fallen Firefighters Foundation has done an absolutely outstanding job. I think it bears out the wisdom of the Congress in establishing it. The services they are now providing to the families of deceased firefighters are really exemplary. We have had many communications from spouses, from children, from parents, of how much the activities of the Fallen Firefighters Foundation mean to them. 
They have enlisted very significant support from the private sector for their activities. These changes are technical in nature in order to enable the foundation to carry out its responsibilities with greater efficacy and greater efficiency. 
I didn't want to let this opportunity pass without underscoring the tremendously fine work that is being done by the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Nickles amendment. The simple fact is that the Nickles amendment would greatly reduce the availability of FHA loans, which have helped millions of first-time, low-income and minority home buyers share in the American dream of home ownership. S. 2168, before us, currently includes a provision that would expand the FHA loan limits in high-cost markets only--in high-cost markets only--from a current cap of $170,000 to a new cap of $197,000 in such high-cost markets. My able colleague from Missouri earlier indicated on a map where those markets would be located. 
Now, the committee's proposal represents, I think, a very significant and appropriate compromise to the administration's request. The administration's request was to institute a single, nationwide loan limit of $227,000. The committee did not go down that path. The committee, instead, went down the path of raising the lower limit which, interestingly enough, this amendment does not try to strike, apparently, according to my colleague from Oklahoma, because of just political realities of the matter, and also raise the high-cost limit, maintaining that distinction. I think it represents a very significant compromise. I urge my colleagues to support the committee and to reject the amendment. 
Now, we are experiencing a time when almost two-thirds of American families own their own homes today. This would not have been possible without the FHA Single Family Mortgage Insurance Program. Each year, about 700,000 Americans purchase homes using FHA insurance. The vast majority of these home buyers could not qualify for a conventional home loan. If the FHA weren't available, they would not have been able to break into the ranks of homeowners. 
The point is made that the default rate within the FHA is somewhat greater, at 8 percent, than it is in the private insurance market. But that is because, of course, the FHA is making this opportunity available to people who would otherwise be closed out of the market altogether. Of course, the reverse side of the 8 percent is the 92 percent who were able to break into the home ownership market. 
It is estimated that 77 percent of first-time home buyers and 85 percent of minority home buyers who use FHA would not have qualified for private mortgage insurance. And since the FHA insurance premium is financed through borrower premiums, it does not end up costing the taxpayer. 
One of the difficulties is that FHA insurance, at a set figure, cannot be utilized effectively in all parts of the country. Nationwide, there are 43 metropolitan areas, representing 25 percent of the population, which are capped at the current ceiling of $170,000. In 32 out of the 43 metropolitan areas, the median home price exceeds the $170,000 figure. So at the $170,000 figure, in 32 of the 43 metropolitan areas, the median home price exceeds that figure. In Maryland, half of our counties--12 of our 24 countries--are now capped at $170,000. Now, by striking the provision in S. 2168 which raises the loan limits in high-cost areas to $197,000, the result of the Nickles amendment would be that hundreds of thousands of Americans would be denied the opportunity to purchase modestly priced homes simply because they live and work in high-cost parts of the country. 
These are not wealthy Americans. These are teachers, policemen, and firemen who serve in communities where they often cannot afford to live. Now, this isn't just unfortunate, this is also unfair. What has to be understood is that a limit that will work in one part of the country will not work in another part of the country. In other words, if you say, well, we ought to give moderate-income people an opportunity to have home ownership, you have some parts of the country where the cost of housing is low, incomes are lower, costs are lower, a whole different dynamic works, and other parts of the country where costs are much higher and housing costs in particular are much higher. 
I can take you on a very short ride from here to jurisdictions where ordinary working people would not have a chance at home ownership, except through the FHA program. We need to raise those limits in those areas because the median housing cost is now well above the existing cap. 
Furthermore, I want to know--because of the split which the Senator from Oklahoma has made where he said he doesn't go after the lower limits, which, of course, have a much broader application throughout the country--the Nickles amendment imposes substantial increases in Ginnie Mae user fees. This imposes a double hit on consumers. First, the increased cost to lenders will be passed along to FHA consumers in the form of higher interest rates and/or larger downpayments. Second, FHA lenders may opt out of the program if the cost of participation becomes too high. 
The net result of these changes, the increase in the Ginnie Mae user fees, would be a substantial reduction in FHA use and availability even within the current loan limits. And to those of my colleagues who do not have high-cost areas in their State, I point out that the Nickles amendment provision to increase the Ginnie Mae user fees would hurt all FHA users regardless of the size of their loans. By contrast, S. 2168 would increase FHA participation without placing a cost on the taxpayers or any additional financial burdens upon FHA consumers. 
Mr. President, the FHA program has helped millions of Americans purchase homes who would not otherwise qualify. The FHA program serves a much higher percentage of first-time, low- and moderate-income and minority home buyers than any conventional loan product. 
If we as a Nation are committed to supporting home ownership for all Americans, we should reaffirm our commitment to the FHA program. 
I really want to commend the committee, I think, for the very careful balance which they developed. This is a far departure from what the administration's request was. In fact, I think the committee obviously took into account the number of points that had been raised by proponents of the Nickles amendment in making their calculations and reaching their judgments in terms of what to do. But unless we raise the cap in the high-cost markets, they are really going to get excluded from the possibility of home ownership. People really qualify as low- and moderate-income people in those high-cost areas. The Nickles amendment allows the floor figure to come up, which in those areas of the country means that the very sort of people that I am concerned about in the high-cost areas would, in fact, not be able to obtain home ownership. I don't think the people in the high-cost areas who confront a whole different economic circumstance ought to be denied that opportunity. 
This program has been enormously important and successful in moving Americans into home ownership who would not otherwise have had that opportunity. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against the Nickles amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment, along with the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, to extend rural housing programs for the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture. I would like to commend the leadership of Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Bumpers for their continued commitment to ensuring that rural housing programs serve rural Americans with affordable, decent housing choices. 
This amendment would extend for one year several rural rental housing programs. This includes the Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Program, the Section 538 Rural Rental Housing Loan Guarantee Program, and the Underserved Areas Program. Because many families in rural America do not have incomes high enough to make homeownership possible, it is imperative that Rural Housing Service be able to provide decent, affordable rental units. These programs are among the few resources that help alleviate the shortage of affordable rental housing and enable very low and low income renters in rural America to access affordable rental housing. 
The Section 515 Program has provided over 450,000 units of affordable rural housing since 1962; there is no other federal program that provides this assistance to very low income renters in rural areas. The Section 538 Loan Guarantee Program is designed to meet the needs of low and moderate income rural Americans not being served by the Section 515 Program. This program enables the federal government to partner with developers and funders to generate needed rental housing in rural areas. 
Both the Section 515 and 538 Programs offer direct benefits for communities, including creating jobs and increasing local taxes, in addition to attracting and maintaining businesses. Stable rental housing has been proven to be a vital link to the overall health and viability of rural communities. While the Rural Housing Service has done much to bring affordable housing to rural America, many rural families still experience housing overcrowding, substandard facilities, cost overburdens, and remain in desperate need of housing assistance. As we encourage families to move from welfare to work, it is even more essential that we build on this vital housing program that provides the safety net which will give the working poor an opportunity to live in affordable, safe and decent housing. 
Again, I would like to commend Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Bumpers for their action to ensure that essential rural rental housing programs receive authorization to continue serving low income families for another year. I urge the swift adoption of this amendment.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today in introducing the `Africa: Seeds of Hope Act of 1998.' This legislation will support sustainable and broad-based economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa by directing bilateral aid and investment programs toward small-scale farming and rural development. At the same time, by fostering research and extension activities and helping to build local markets, this initiative will provide important opportunities for mutual cooperation between U.S. and African farmers, educators, scientists and entrepreneurs. 
Recognizing the high rates of malnutrition, poverty and hunger in many African countries, this bill is designed to promote food security and agricultural productivity by expanding access to credit and technology, improving information and farming techniques, and creating more efficient market mechanisms. The legislation would accomplish this in several ways. First, it ensures that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) will devote adequate funding to programs and projects that improve food security and meet the needs of the rural poor. It requires the participation of affected communities in all phases of project planning and development, and strengthens coordination with non-governmental organizations, cooperatives, land-grant and other appropriate universities, and local marketing associations that have relevant expertise. 
Second, the bill highlights the role of microcredit assistance in the overall strategy against rural poverty. Lack of access to credit, particularly among women, has restricted the growth of small-scale agriculture, the availability and use of appropriate technology, and the establishment of an adequate and reliable food supply. 
Third, this legislation mobilizes new resources for investment in African agriculture and rural development through the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), working with small businesses and other U.S. entities to develop the capacities of small-scale farmers and rural entrepreneurs. 
A fourth way in which the bill promotes food security and agricultural productivity is by directing USAID and the Department of Agriculture to develop a comprehensive plan to coordinate and build on the research and extension activities of U.S. land-grant universities, international agricultural research centers, and national agricultural research and extension centers. In this way, the initiative encourages the latest agricultural methods and most successful business practices, while ensuring they are appropriate to local conditions and adapted to specific climates. 
Finally, this legislation establishes the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust, which is intended to serve as a reliable mechanism for providing emergency food aid overseas. Using unexpended balances in existing accounts, this bill converts the Food Security Commodity Reserve into a trust account that will allow for more timely and cost-effective responses to humanitarian crises. 
Mr. President, as funding for international affairs has been reduced, it is programs like these, which address the needs of the world's poorest, that have been hit hardest. This bill draws attention to the importance of sustainable agriculture and targets U.S. assistance programs in Africa toward building food security and self-sufficiency. I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleague from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, in introducing this legislation, and I look forward to working with him, the other cosponsors, and the Administration in moving it toward enactment.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 1882, the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998, reauthorizing the Higher Education Act for 5 years. The Higher Education Act, enacted in 1965 to provide disadvantaged students with greater educational opportunities, recognized the shared benefit of providing every American a chance to maximize his or her potential. As a result of the passage of this legislation, doors have been opened to millions of citizens who otherwise would not have had the access or the resources to obtain a higher education. Although the act has been amended over the years through the reauthorization process, the central purpose of the legislation has remained the same--to ensure access, choice and opportunity in higher education. 
First, and foremost, this measure reauthorizes all postsecondary grant and loan programs which have allowed so many of our citizens to obtain additional education and training. It lowers the in-school interest rate on student loans from the current 7.6% to 6.8% and for the years after school from the current 8.2% to 7.4% to make higher education more affordable for more students. Most notably, the bill includes an increase in the maximum Pell Grant from $3,000 for the 1998-1999 academic year to $4,500 for 1999-2000, and increases that award by $200 a year for the following four years and further expands eligibility to include more students who are financially independent of their parents. 
I am pleased that the bill also reinforces our continued support of the TRIO programs which have been so successful in serving disadvantaged and first-generation college students. I have been a longstanding supporter of TRIO which has served more than 700,000 through 1,900 programs nationwide. The impact of the outreach and early intervention services provided by TRIO become even more profound considering that more than two-thirds of the students benefitting from the program come from families with incomes under $24,000. No one set of Federal programs captures more completely the American ideal that fostering educational opportunity for all citizens benefits both the individual and the society as well. 
Title II of the bill consolidates teacher training programs and refocuses Federal efforts to more efficiently and effectively train and recruit new teachers for our Nation's schools. It also provides for greater loan forgiveness for those who choose to dedicate their lives to the teaching profession. Now those who agree to teach for at least three years in high-need areas can see up to $8,000 in their student loans forgiven. In my view, this is an important step in relieving the heavy loan debt many graduates find themselves burdened with upon graduation to allow some of our best and brightest to enter the teaching profession independent of this financial pressure. 
I am also pleased that legislation I introduced to establish the Thurgood Marshall Legal Opportunity Program has been incorporated into the bill before us. This program would identify socially and economically disadvantaged law school students and provide them with the opportunity to hone their skills through summer institutes, mid-year seminars and support services. Working within the framework of the highly successful Council on Legal Education Opportunity (CLEO), this program will provide the necessary resources to ensure that those who have proven themselves at the undergraduate level of study are able to maximize their potential as they move on to law school. Investing in the promise of these talented individuals is a worthwhile endeavor and I am pleased that this legislation has been included in this reauthorization. 
Mr. President, passage of this legislation sustains our Nation's longstanding commitment to access, choice and opportunity in higher education. Every society places a premium on education in terms of fostering a skilled and trained work force in the next generation, and the more complex economically the world becomes, the more critical it is to address this aspect of developing our human resources. In our society, however, education carries two other very important responsibilities which make the legislation we are talking about today essential to the health and vitality of our society. 
The first is that we are one of a handful of countries that has maintained a democracy over a sustained period of time. Obviously, education is essential to a literate citizenry capable of making a democracy work. The other dimension is that education in America represents a ladder of opportunity. We take great pride in being an open society in which people can move up and forward, and the way they do that is essentially through the educational ladders provided in the programs we are reauthorizing today. In a Nation which believes that a person's merit and talent should take them as far as they can go, we must continue to foster a path which allows them to maximize this potential. Many of us here today have benefitted from this philosophy and have achieved certain levels of success as a direct result of the opportunities afforded by such principles. However, all of the programs we address in this bill are not solely for the benefit of the individual, as important as that aspect is. These programs are part of our national effort to include people in our society rather than exclude them, an essential concept in my view to the harmonious working of American society. 
In passing this legislation, it is important to understand that the value of programs authorized by this bill cannot be measured simply in terms of dollars spent. Without Federal support, millions of Americans would not have been able to attend college or receive the advanced training required to make them contributing, productive members of society. If this Nation is to continue to thrive in an ever-evolving global economy, we must not underestimate the value of the Federal government's commitment to higher education. 
The Senate's approval of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act is a critical step in our on-going efforts to maintain access and choice in higher education. We must continue to acknowledge the vital importance of education in this country, to sustain the educated base we have created, and to commit ourselves to a quality education for all our Nation's citizens.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to amend one thing that the distinguished Senator from Virginia said. I think he referred to his role here as a `modest role.' But he really was very pivotal in helping us to get this legislation enacted last night. 
The Secretary of the Interior determined that the Martin Luther King statue, which is going to be placed in the District of Columbia in memory of Martin Luther King, would be put in the prime area, which is the Mall and the surrounding areas. That determination needed the approval of the Congress. Senator Warner and I joined together in the Senate, along with Congresswoman Morella, who led the effort in the House, in order to bring this about. 
We will now have a statue in the District in a fairly short time. The money will be raised privately by the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity. But it will stand as a tribute to what Martin Luther King, Jr. represented, which, in my judgment, was a commitment to achieving change through nonviolence--a very important lesson. Martin Luther King, Jr. clearly worked within the framework of a democratic society. He sought very significant and substantial change. He sought to make the Nation live up to its ideals. But he was committed in doing it in a nonviolent way. 
I think that is a very important lesson for all Americans. 
I, like the Senator from Virginia, have personal memories. I was at the Reflecting Pool the day he gave the `I Have a Dream' speech, when he stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and, of course, that speech had a tremendous impact on American society then and continues to have a tremendous impact. 
So I am very glad that this matter has been moved forward now. All of the legislation that is now necessary is in place, and now we look forward to going ahead and we look forward to, at sometime in the not too distant future, a ground breaking and, sometime thereafter, a dedication. 
I express again my deep appreciation to the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia for his efforts in this regard. 
Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I offer my very strong support to my colleague from the State of Washington and commend her for her efforts on behalf of our Nation's veterans. What we are dealing with is really an unacceptable situation. Families across the nation have come to expect and depend on having a proper military burial for their loved ones who have served in our Armed Forces. This is simply not happening. I joined earlier with the Senator from Washington and the Senator from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, in introducing legislation to in effect mandate a solution to this problem. 
This amendment--and I think this is a commendable effort on the part of my distinguished colleague from Washington--will direct the Department of Defense, working with the Department of Veterans Affairs, to convene a summit and identify the means and manpower to meet this need. Senator Murray has put this process on a very tight timeframe. The Department has a 6-month period in which to come up with a plan to take care of this problem. 
I have received letters that would move you to tears in terms of the importance that families place on providing a proper burial for their loved ones who have served in our armed services. Not every family requests these honors. But for those families who seek a military burial and have it incorporated into their burial plans, this is an extremely important matter. 
These military honors, honoring the sacrifice that members of armed services have made for this country during their lifetimes, should always be a high priority, I think, on behalf of the Congress and on behalf of the Department. Unfortunately, this problem has not been recognized as such until now--due to the tremendous outcry that this situation be addressed. 
And Senator Murray has undertaken to make these burial rites a priority in a very positive and constructive and forthright way. 
I am very pleased that the managers of the bill have agreed to accept this amendment. I think that through the process it establishes we will be able to work to a solution. That is my expectation and hope, that we will now, in effect, by requiring the executive branch to focus on this problem, come together to give it the kind of high priority study which we think it requires and that they will come up with a solution. 
We are constantly told the Department is in favor of our goals and objectives in this regard, so we want it now to work out the means to achieve these goals and objectives. I think the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Washington will move us very much down that path and help to accomplish that purpose. I very strongly support her efforts. 
I thank the chairman and the ranking member for yielding time. 
Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this year marks the 81st anniversary of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps, one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The officers of the NOAA corps play an integral role in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and serve this multi-disciplinary scientific organization and our nation with distinction. 
The roots of the NOAA Corps can be found in 1807, when our third President, Thomas Jefferson, created the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. Directed by Congress, the Department of War and the Department of the Navy provided the Survey with commissioned officers to chart the coastlines and map the shores of our nation, allowing for the expansion of maritime commerce. On May 22, 1917, an Act of Congress formally established a uniformed service, patterned after the military, to meet the growing responsibilities and unique needs of the Survey. This commissioned service of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (C&GS) served with distinction in both world wars. 
Since its inception, the NOAA Corps has enabled its members to perform remote, sometimes hazardous and otherwise arduous duties in a wide range of environmental measurement and stewardship responsibilities. Indeed, the NOAA Corps is truly on the front line of NOAA's operations. Today's corp officers combine unique qualifications as research ship and aircraft operators; as technical experts with advanced academic backgrounds in hydrography, geodesy, fisheries sciences, meteorology, and oceanography; and as leaders in technical program and data management contributing to the coherence, integrity, and effectiveness of the administrative structure of NOAA. 
In order to discharge the responsibilities of NOAA, the NOAA Corps continues to provide a highly effective interface with other branches of the armed forces, most notably the Coast Guard, Navy, Air Force, and Army Corps of Engineers. Additionally, the Corps, our nation's experts in nautical charting, ensure the safe navigation of foreign trade, 98% of which travels in U.S. coastal waters. 
In recent years, the NOAA Corps has contributed its valuable scientific and engineering skills to the Armed Services and to the Nation, particularly during times of national emergency. Mr. President, you may recall that it was the crew from the NOAA Ship Rude that so swiftly located the wreckage of TWA Flight 800. The Rude and a shore component of NOAA officers were also responsible for creating a highly detailed map which greatly aided Navy divers in their retrieval of the wreckage. For their efforts, they were recognized by then Secretary of Transportation Pena and by NOAA's parent bureau, the Department of Commerce, with the Department's highest award, the Commerce Gold Medal. 
Additionally, it was the NOAA Corps who provided ship, aircraft and technical expertise for an environmental appraisal and the first comprehensive study of the Persian Gulf following the Gulf War. While shore personnel provided expertise in the management of hazardous materials, scientists above the NOAA Ship Mt. Mitchell evaluated and determined the extent of environmental damage to the Gulf. Not only did the work of the NOAA Corps grant instant credibility to both the United States and the other nations involved in the Gulf conflict, it also provided a safe, effective research platform. Once again, the Captain and crew were lauded for their service, receiving a Commerce Gold and Silver Medal, respectively. 
Whether charting our nation's coastline, assessing its fisheries stock, or flying into hurricanes for the benefit of science and mankind, today's NOAA Corp maintains a standard of excellence in steadfastly following its mission, always ready to apply their scientific and service skills to the management of the United States' oceanic and atmospheric resources. 
On this, the 81st anniversary of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Commissioned Corps, I urge all Americans to join with me in taking a moment to honor these men and women for their distinguished service in their efforts to explore, chart, and protect the oceans and atmosphere not only of the United States, but of the entire world.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, together with my colleagues Senators Faircloth, Warner, Mikulski and Robb, to help address the serious problems posed by toxic microorganisms that are affecting the tidal and non-tidal wetlands and waters of the States along the eastern seaboard. The `Atlantic Coast Toxic Microorganism Environmental Remediation Act' authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to develop and implement a strategy to mitigate current and potential problems posed by these aquatic microorganisms. 
Serious outbreaks of toxic microorganisms, such as Pfiesteria and Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates, have recently struck inland waters and estuaries in Maryland, North Carolina, Delaware, Florida, and Virginia. Linked to the flow of excess nutrients and loss of habitat, these toxic microorganisms are seriously impacting regional economies and threatening finfish resources and economic and recreational sectors along the Atlantic Coast. 
Between 1972 and 1995, the number of coastal and estuarine waters that host major, recurring attacks by harmful microbes has doubled. Last year alone, approximately 450,000 fish were killed in North Carolina by Pfiesteria, while tens of thousands of valuable fish met the same fate in tidal rivers in the eastern shore of my own State of Maryland last year. There are other harmful microbes, as well, that are similar to Pfiesteria in their effects and that may be poised in a moments notice to wreck havoc on our aquatic ecosystems and communities and which may pose serious threats to human health and safety. 
In 1982, scientists were aware of 22 species of harmful water-borne dinoflagellates; now they are aware of over 60! So, we now face a situation where more than five dozen different harmful microbes can potentially produce catastrophic economic and environmental effects in waters extending along the eastern seaboard. 
Experts note that such harmful attacks are increasing in frequency or severity in aquatic environments both in the United States and worldwide. Toxic dinoflagellates and harmful algae are microscopic, single-celled organisms that live in the sea, estuaries and near-shore inland waters along our coasts. Most species are not harmful, and are a key element in the aquatic food web. Unfortunately, a small number of these species also produce potent neurotoxins than can affect and even kill higher forms of life, such as shellfish, finfish, birds, marine mammals, as well as impact human health. 
Last year, the Administration directed that an interagency research and monitoring strategy be developed in response to the outbreaks of Pfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay. Seven federal agencies participated in developing this strategy including NOAA, EPA, the Departments of Interior and Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control. Funding to implement actions called for under the plan and the Administration's Clean Water Initiative was included in the fiscal 1999 budget request. Unfortunately, the key Federal agency with expertise in water resources and aquatic habitat restoration--the Army Corps of Engineers--was not included in the interagency task force and habitat and related considerations were not integrated into the response plans. 
The bill I am introducing seeks to address this shortcoming and to ensure that all the available expertise of the Federal government is brought to bear in combating these biotoxins. The legislation authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers, in partnership with State and local governments as well as other Federal agencies, to conduct an evaluation, develop a strategic master plan, and implement recommended actions to address problems in the degradation of aquatic habitat related to the presence of toxic microbes, including Pfiesteria, in wetlands and waters along the Atlantic coast. With its expertise in watershed management and restoration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a vital role to play in responding to the threats posed by toxic microorganisms and this legislation provides the funding and authority for this agency to do so.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee in a colloquy concerning funding for the restoration of Assateague Island National Seashore. 
I am deeply concerned that the Committee was not able to provide funding for so-called `new start' construction projects of the Army Corps of Engineers. I understand that the House Committee has also adopted a no new starts policy. The Corps of Engineers was scheduled to initiate an authorized and approved mitigation project for the North End of Assateague Island National Seashore in Fiscal 1999 and without funding, it appears that this project will have to be postponsed. This is a particular problem because the northern end of Assateague was hit very hard by two northeastern storms which slammed the mid-Atlantic coast this past February causing severe erosion and overwash conditions. In its current condition, the seashore is extremely vulnerable to breaching should another storm hit the coast. The integrity of the National Seashore and the area's coastal bays are at risk. 
Fortunately, the Corps will be able to make emergency repairs to the storm-damaged section under the authority of Public Law 84-99, providing some additional protection to the island over its current condition. But it would be far better if the approved restoration project could be initiated and completed as soon as possible. 
I recognize the difficult constraints that the Committee faced in crafting this bill but, given the critical nature of this project, I ask if the Chairman would be willing to work with me and Senator Mikulski in the Conference Committee to address Assateague's needs should additional funding become available.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to voice my hopes that the Senate will this week have the opportunity, after several weeks of debate, to vote on the pending tobacco bill. 
The course that this bill has taken is in marked contrast to the course taken by many other important bills that we have considered in the 105th Congress. Whereas the Republican leadership has severely truncated debate on such important matters as campaign finance reform and education policy, we have been on the tobacco bill for several weeks, have engaged in hours of debate, and have considered a wide range of amendments. I have no doubt that when the Republican leadership has wanted quick resolution of an issue during the 105th Congress, it has understood how to accomplish that goal, and worked toward it. A similar commitment has not been apparent in the area of tobacco legislation. 
Let me be clear, Mr. President. I support the idea of full and considered debate on an issue as important as this one. I also believe, however, that once an issue has been fully vetted, once Senators have had a chance to listen to the debate and vote on amendments, it becomes time for the Senate to step up to the plate and vote on the legislation before us. That is what we are paid to do, and it is what the American people expect us to do. 
This is the fourth week of the tobacco debate. We have debated and voted on germane amendments and non-germane amendments; we have consumed dozens of hours of floor time and hundreds of pages in the Congressional Record. I worry, Mr. President, that the delays we are now facing on this bill are not designed to allow further thoughtful consideration of tobacco legislation, but rather to delay and obfuscate that legislation, to add to tobacco legislation layer upon layer of unrelated measures, to divide supporters of action in this area, and to run the clock in a legislative session that is evaporating before our eyes. The American people deserve better than that. 
Now I do not support everything in this bill. I have voted for some of the amendments the Senate has considered and against others. I have found the wide-ranging discussion on the Senate floor to be valuable and enlightening in some instances and irrelevant and repetitive in others. I do believe, however, that by the end of this week, after the Senate has had the chance to consider the handful of remaining outstanding issues, we will be ready to take a stand on how to deal with the problems of smoking--especially the problem of teen smoking--in our nation.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation together with my colleagues Senators Byrd, Rockefeller, and Mikulski to grant Congressional consent to a Compact entered into between the States of West Virginia and Maryland that established the Potomac Highlands Airport Authority. The purpose of this legislation is to help facilitate a regional approach to the operations, use, management and future development of the Greater Cumberland Regional Airport. 
Greater Cumberland Regional Airport is an important transportation hub serving the commercial, general aviation and corporate communities in the tri-state area of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. It is not only an essential link in the region's transportation network, but a critical part of the strategy to attract new business and tourism to the area. 
The airport was established in 1944, when the City of Cumberland, Maryland purchased property in Wiley Ford, WV--three miles south of Cumberland--and began construction of airport facilities. Unfortunately, this unusual situation--a commercial service airport located in one state while owned by a local unit of government in a contiguous state--has greatly complicated the operation, financing and development of the airport over the years. With two states, two counties and two municipalities having jurisdiction over different aspects of the airport and enforcing different laws, taxing authorities and regulations, it was difficult, at best, to transcend the political and boundary lines and achieve a consensus on the future of the airport. 
In order to address this situation, in 1976, the General Assemblies of the State of Maryland and the State of West Virginia enacted a bi-state compact authorizing creation of a public agency known as the Potomac Highlands Airport Authority (PHAA) to govern and operate the airport. However, no action was taken to implement that Compact until 1990, when the two states, the Board of County Commissioners of Allegany County, Maryland and Mineral County, West Virginia and the Mayor and City Council of Cumberland, Maryland signed an intergovernmental agreement to transfer airport management and control to the Authority and changed the name to the Greater Cumberland Regional Airport. 
Since that time, the Potomac Highlands Airport Authority has actively maintained and operated the airport, and has been working to develop and implement a 20-year, $10 million airport modernization and expansion program designed to facilitate current operations and anticipated growth in utilization of the facility. In the process of seeking investment capital, loans and airport development grants, questions have been raised by the Federal Aviation Administration, USDA Rural Development, and others about the Authority's eligibility to function as legal sponsor for the airport and borrow money and give security, absent Congressional Consent to the Interstate Compact which established the Authority. 
Article I, Section 10 of the Constitution requires Congressional approval of compacts between States and Bond Counsel for the airport has recommended that the Compact creating the Airport Authority receive the consent of Congress in order to provide some certainty as to the legal status of the airport and to permit the Authority to borrow funds. 
The legislation I am introducing today would ratify the Interstate Compact enacted by Maryland and West Virginia in 1976 and reaffirmed in the 1990 Intergovernmental Agreement. It will allow the Potomac Highlands Airport Authority to fully exercise the powers and authority set forth by the Compact and to provide a truly regional approach to the operation, use and future development of the airport. It will help advance the public interest by ensuring the future viability of Greater Cumberland Regional Airport to serve the transportation needs of the tri-state area.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the nomination of Patrick Mulloy to be Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Market Access and Compliance. 
I have known Pat since he came to work for the Senate Banking Committee in 1983 as a Congressional Fellow from the Justice Department. Pat made such a strong impression during his fellowship that the then ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee, Senator Proxmire, hired him to be Minority General Counsel, a position which he held from 1984 to 1986. After the Senate changed hands in 1987, Pat became General Counsel for the majority and served in that capacity until 1989. When Senator Proxmire retired in 1989, Pat became Senior Counsel and International Affairs Advisor to the new chairman, Senator Riegle. Since 1992 he has served as Chief International Counsel for the Democratic members of the Committee. Since 1995, when I became ranking Democrat on the Banking Committee, Pat has worked directly for me. 
The first point I want to make about Pat is that he is a career public servant. He holds a B.A., Magna Cum Laude, from Kings College Pennsylvania, an M.A. in International Politics from Notre Dame where he was a University Fellow, a J.D. degree with Honors from George Washington Law School, and an LL.M. from Harvard Law School. He began his professional career as a Foreign Service Officer in the State Department, where he served from 1965 to 1973. From 1973 to 1977 he served as a Trial Attorney in the Land and Resources Division of the Justice Department, and from 1979 to 1982 he served as Senior Attorney in the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. It was from that position that Pat came to work for the Senate Banking Committee. 
During his tenure on the Banking Committee, Pat has played a lead role in every major international finance and trade issue the Committee has dealt with. These include enactment of the International Lending Supervision Act; amendments to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, the Export Administration Act, and the trade promotion programs of the Commerce Department; and the exchange rate, third world debt, and foreign investment provisions of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. He helped draft the Export Enhancement Act of 1992 which established the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee. He was intimately involved as a Congressional Advisor in the negotiation of the recently concluded agreement on trade in financial services in the World Trade Organization. 
I can think of no one better prepared or suited to serve in the position of Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Market Access and Compliance. Pat brings a deep background and expertise in international trade and finance. He has served in the executive branch and the Congress, and in both capacities has worked closely with private sector business and labor groups affected by trade policies. He also brings a passionate personal commitment to opening foreign markets to U.S. exports and expanding job opportunities for American workers. 
Pat is a person of the highest intelligence, integrity, and commitment to public service. He has been an enormously effective member of the staff of the Senate Banking Committee, and I have come to rely with great confidence on his judgment and expertise. The fact that Senator D'Amato, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, as well as myself introduced Pat at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee suggests the deep professional and personal regard in which he is held by members of the Senate Banking Committee on both sides of the aisle. Pat has my unreserved support for confirmation to this important position.

Mr. SARBANES. I am prompted by something the ranking member of the subcommittee said which leads me to put an inquiry to him and to Senator Grassley. 
There are a number of bankruptcy districts in the country that are facing very serious problems in handling their caseload. I have been in frequent communication with the subcommittee about this, and obviously my district is one of them. It has consistently now, for 4 or 5 years, ranked at the very top of case overload of all bankruptcy districts in the United States. Every study that has been made has recommended additional bankruptcy judges, and I note for a fact that the existing bankruptcy judges in my district are severely overworked. This is denying economic justice to both creditors and debtors. It is a matter which needs to be addressed. It is a pressing crisis. 
Now, the House sent over to us some time ago legislation providing for some additional judges based on comprehensive studies undertaken by the Administrative Office of the Courts and by others. This session is moving along. If we don't get some relief, we are going to continue to have this extraordinary situation which exists in quite a number of districts across the country in terms of reducing their backlog. It is a very severe problem in a number of districts. 
I am prompted by Senator Durbin's reference, and Senator Grassley's assent to it, as I understood it, there is more to follow. So I just put the inquiry whether this is one of the matters to follow. I would certainly hope so.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I think it is important at the outset of this debate to try to dispel three misconceptions that surround S. 1260. The first is that class-action lawsuits alleging securities fraud have migrated from Federal court to State court since 1995 and the enactment of the earlier legislation. 
In fact, as I will describe in some detail shortly, every study indicates that the number of securities fraud class actions brought in State courts, while it increased in 1996, then declined in 1997. So the numbers do not support that assertion. 
The next misconception is that this bill would preempt only class-action lawsuits from being brought in State court. In fact, this bill likely will deprive individual investors of their own opportunities to bring their actions in State courts separate and apart from class actions. 
The final misperception about this bill, which is suggested, is that it enjoys widespread support. In reality, a broad coalition of State and local officials, senior citizen groups, labor unions, academics, and consumer groups oppose this bill. They oppose it because it goes too far. It will deprive defrauded investors of remedies. 
Once again, we have this classic example of being able to sort of try to address a problem and, instead of narrowly dealing with the problem, swinging the pendulum well beyond the problem and taking the so-called corrective legislation so far out that in and of itself it creates additional problems. 
Let me turn to the first misperception, the notion that securities fraud class actions are being brought in State court in order to avoid the provisions of the Litigation Act of 1995. 
It is correct that the number of such cases went up in 1996, the first year the Litigation Act was effective, but every available study shows that the number declined in 1997. For example, a study done by the National Economic Research Associates, a consulting firm, found that the number of securities class-action suits filed in State courts during the first 10 months of 1996 increased to 79 from 48 filed during the same period in 1995. 
In an update released in the summer of 1997, however, NERA found that the number of securities class actions filed in State courts during the first 4 months of 1997 declined to 19, down from 40 in the same period in 1996. So the number actually declined very significantly by more than half the first 4 months of 1997. 
These numbers are cited in a report that was prepared by the Congressional Research Service. In July 1997, Professors Joseph Grundfest and Michael Perino of Stanford University Law School testified before the Securities Subcommittee, and in their testimony they show that the number of issuers sued only in State class actions declined from 33 in 1996 to an annualized rate of 18 in 1997. A Price Waterhouse securities litigation study posted by that accounting firm on its Internet site corroborated NERA's findings. Using data compiled by Securities Class Action Alert, based on the number of defendants sued, Price Waterhouse reported that the number of State court actions increased from 52 in 1995 to 66 in 1996 but then declined to 44 in 1997. That was lower than the number of such actions in 1991 or 1993. 
The study went on to find that the total number of cases filed in 1997 showed little or no change--little or no change--from the average number of lawsuits filed in the period 1991 through 1995. 
Data provided to the committee by Price Waterhouse on February 20, 1998, also demonstrated that State court filings declined in 1997. Measured by the number of cases filed, the number of State securities class actions declined from 71 in 1996 to 39 in 1997. So much for this assertion of a rising number of suits being brought in the State courts. This really is a piece of legislation in search of a problem. And when you look at the facts, when you look at the numbers, the problem is not there. 
Now let me turn to the notion that this bill addresses only class-action lawsuits. I think most people understand a class-action lawsuit to refer to lawsuits brought by one person on behalf of himself and all other people similarly situated, an anonymous and potentially large group of people. For class actions to be certified in Federal court, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that the class be so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. In Federal court, a judge normally must find that common questions of law and fact predominate over questions only affecting individual members. 
Class actions are a tool that allow plaintiffs to share the cost of a lawsuit when it might not be economical for any one of them to bring an action. But, because they can be brought on behalf of potentially an enormous class, they also carry with them the possibility of being misused to coerce defendants into settlement. 
This is the sort of situation that is ordinarily described by the proponents of such legislation as requiring a legislative enactment. But when you examine the legislation that comes in behind that assertion, you invariably find that the breadth of the legislation far exceeds this problem which they have identified, and which they constantly use in the discussion and the debate as the example of what they are trying to deal with. If we could limit the legislation to the examples that are cited, we might really come close to obtaining a consensus in this body about corrective measures. But the legislation goes far beyond the examples that are ordinarily used as constituting the basis for legislative enactment, and it is that expanded application of the legislative language, not the specific examples that are generally used, which creates the problem. 
This bill is another example of that. It addresses more than the type of class-action case which is ordinarily cited as constituting a potential abuse of the legal process. This bill contains a definition of class action broad enough to pick up individual investors against their will. The bill would amend the Federal Securities laws to include a new definition of class action. It would include as class action any group of lawsuits in which damages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons if those lawsuits are pending in the same court, involve common questions of law or fact, and have been consolidated as a single action for any purpose. 
Even if the lawsuits are brought by separate lawyers without coordination--in other words, you have 50 different investors who feel they have been cheated and want to bring a lawsuit--there is no interplay or interaction amongst them, even if the common questions do not predominate--which is a requirement in class-action suits, but weakened in this legislation--those lawsuits, under this legislation, may qualify as a class action and thus be preempted. 
So if an individual investor chooses to bring his own lawsuit in State court, to bear the expenses of litigation himself, he can be forced into Federal court. He can be made to abide by the Federal Rules if 50 other investors make the same decision about bringing a lawsuit, 50 other separate investors. Indeed, the bill provides an incentive for defendants to collude with parties to ensure that the preemption threshold is reached. Such a result goes well beyond ending abuses associated with class-action lawsuits. It deprives individual investors of their remedies. 
The definition of class action in the bill would preempt other types of lawsuits as well. It includes as a class action any lawsuit in which damages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons and common questions of law or fact predominate. The bill specifies that the predomination inquiry be made without reference to issues of individualized reliance on an alleged misstatement or omission. This would ensure that the investor receives the worst of both worlds. While the investor could not bring a class action under State law, because each investor must prove his or her reliance, they nonetheless constitute a class action under the bill and their suit is preempted. 
Finally, let me turn to the assertion that there is little or no opposition to this bill. In fact, the bill is opposed by State and local officials very vigorously, as a matter of fact. I note there that Orange County has just begun the first of its recoveries, in terms of being defrauded. Senior citizens groups, labor unions, consumer groups, columnists and editors, legal practitioners and academics have all weighed in on this debate. The headline of a column by Ben Stein in USA Today on April 28, summarizes this opposition: `Investors, beware: Last door to fight fraud could close.' 
`Investors, beware: Last door to fight fraud could close.' He wrote of this bill, the legislation before us:  
State remedies would simply vanish, and anyone who wanted to sue would have to go into Federal court where impossible standards exist. 
He warns: 
This is serious business for the whole investing public.

Mr. SARBANES. Why are these public officials concerned about this bill? Why are these associations that represent public officials all across our Nation concerned about this bill? Because these public officials invest taxpayers' funds and public employees' pension funds in securities. And they fear they will be left without remedies if they are defrauded. 
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Mayor Harry Smith of Greenwood, MS, warned: 
The most potent protection investors have is the private right of action. To remove that protection could have grave consequences. We oppose taking such a risk. We oppose preemption of traditional State and local rights created to protect our citizens and taxpayers. This bill is inconsistent with Congress' renewed commitment to the preservation of federalism, and reduces protections for our retirees, employees, and taxpayers.

Mr. SARBANES. These distinguished law professors stated: 
We . . . believe that Congress should wait to ascertain the effects of the 1995 Act, as well as the direction of state law, before enacting any legislation that would undercut the longstanding role that state law has had in protecting investors from securities fraud. 
These distinguished academics oppose any legislation that would deny investors their right to sue for securities fraud under State law. 
Similarly, the New York State Bar Association opposes this bill. A report prepared by the Bar Association Section on Commercial and Federal Litigation concluded: `The existing data does not establish a need for the legislation,' and, `the proposed solution far exceeds any appropriate level of remedy for the perceived problem.' 
Let me repeat that quote from the report prepared by the New York State Bar Association Section on Commercial and Federal Litigation:  
The proposed solution far exceeds any appropriate level of remedy for the perceived problem. 
The opposition goes on. As additional examples, I cite a March 30, 1998, editorial from the National Law Journal entitled `What's the Rush?' This editorial concludes: 
The Senate should pause before it neutralizes State laws that still stand as a bulwark protecting investors against flimflam artists.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, much will be made during the debate on this bill of the support it is asserted it enjoys from the Securities and Exchange Commission. But it seems to me that citing the support of the SEC tells only part of the story--only part of the story. 
First, SEC Commissioner Norman Johnson has written to express his opposition to the bill. His March 24, 1998, letter concludes: 
I believe that much more conclusive evidence than currently exists should be required before state courthouse doors are closed to small investors through the preclusion of state class actions for securities fraud.

Mr. SARBANES. Secondly, the SEC supports changes to the Federal antifraud standard to make it more protective of investors. In other words, if the SEC is going to be cited, as the proponents of this legislation have done, in support of their position, surely then they ought to pay attention to the SEC position which has been asserted seeking changes in the Federal antifraud standard to make it more protective. Let me give you a few examples. 
The SEC supports a longer statute of limitations so that fraud artists do not escape liability by successfully concealing their frauds. The SEC supports the restoration of liability for aiders and abetters of securities fraud so that those who give substantial assistance to fraud artists do not escape liability. 
The SEC supports codification of liability--codification of liability--for reckless conduct to ensure that professionals, such as accountants and underwriters, carry out their responsibilities under the Federal securities laws. In fact, Chairman Levitt reiterated his support for these provisions as recently as 6 weeks ago when he appeared before the Banking Committee for his renomination hearing. Nonetheless, these provisions are nowhere to be found in this bill. 
The supporters of this legislation argue the desirability of a uniform antifraud standard for securities traded on national securities exchanges, but they fail to address directly the question which we need to ask, whether the current Federal antifraud standard, as reflected by the 1995 act, deserves to be the uniform standard. Is the current antifraud standard, which they are now going to use to bring cases up from the State courts and deny investors the remedies under the State systems, is that standard adequate to protect investors? 
I voted against the 1995 act because I was concerned that it did not establish an appropriate standard. I was worried that it did not strike the proper balance between deterring frivolous securities suits and protecting investors who are victimized by securities fraud. None of us is in favor of frivolous securities suits, these so-called strike suits. But at the same time, I, for one, at least, do not want to go so far in trying to deal with that problem that I cease to protect investors who are victimized by securities fraud. There is a line in between, actually, I have asserted many times, I think, on which a consensus can be reached, but the legislation that keeps coming forward always overreaches--it overreaches--and therefore, I think, jeopardizes the protections that are available to investors who are innocent victims of securities frauds. 
A number of securities law experts warn that the safe harbor for forward-looking statements enacted by that act could protect fraud. In addition, the proportionate liability provisions leave innocent victims suffering a loss while shielding those who participate in securities fraud. Of course, the 1995 act omitted the statute of limitations in aiding and abetting provisions recommended by the SEC, still recommended by the SEC, and, of course, not included in this legislation. 
Since the reform act was enacted, another concern has developed. Some district courts have relied on the legislative history of that act in concluding that the act's pleading standards eliminated liability for reckless conduct. Imagine, eliminating liability for reckless conduct. 
If that view prevails in the circuit courts, and if the Congress preempts, as this legislation proposes to do, causes of action under State laws, investors will be left with no remedies--I underscore that, with no remedies--against those whose reckless conduct makes a securities fraud possible. 
It is for these reasons that the associations and various commentators I have cited are opposing this bill. They oppose this bill both because of its overly broad reach--clearly because of its overly broad reach--and because its sponsors fail to take this opportunity to correct the flaws of the earlier legislation. If the sponsors are going to eliminate recourse in the State courts, it becomes even more incumbent upon them to correct the Federal standard with respect to the shortcomings which have been identified in it and continue to be identified by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Mr. SARBANES. I say to my colleague, as I understand it, this is what transpired. The 1995 act was being interpreted at the district court level, the Federal district court level--the legislative history of it--that the act's pleading standards eliminated liability for reckless conduct. 
Now, the SEC has come to us and said we should codify a reckless conduct right of action into the Federal standard. The legislation before us does not have such a codification. 
Now, there is language in the report, but we do not have a codification. So you have the problem about the legislative history for the 1998 act. And it is not quite clear to me how it will supplant the legislative history for the 1995 act. A codification would do that but that is not in this bill.

Mr. SARBANES. That is right. If you want to talk about where you put the balance, how in the world would you drive the balance so far over that an investor who was the victim of reckless conduct would not have a remedy? It just defies any equitable striking of the balances with respect to, quote, `frivolous' lawsuits on the one hand, and investor protection on the other.

Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is correct. Currently, what happened is we set a Federal standard in the 1995 act in the Federal courts. That still left to an investor the option of going into a State court to seek remedy. 
Now the proponents of this bill said, `Well, everyone who is going into Federal court bringing the so-called frivolous suits are now going to migrate into the State courts.' The numbers show that has not happened. You have a little increase in 1996. The numbers came back down in 1997. The projected numbers are down. So you do not have that flood of litigation into the State courts, and yet investors had available to them State court remedies. 
Well, now what they are going to do is they are going to preempt the ability to bring the action in the State courts. Well, then, the proponents will say, `Well, we are just preempting it for these class actions. If you are an individual investor and you want to hire your lawyer, you will still be able to go into State court.' But they define a class action in this bill in such a way, so broadly that it will sweep up individual investors who are really not part of a class-action suit. 
Those individual investors will then discover--I mean, what is going to happen here, my prediction on this is that what is going to come before the Congress down the road, if this legislation passes, is small investors showing up in the Congress and saying, `This happened to me. And now I discover, because of the legislation which you all enacted, I can't get any remedy. And this isn't right.' And Members are going to be looking at that, and they are going to say it is not right. 
That is why we are urging Members to pause and take a careful look at this before they put it into law. You can have a situation in which an individual investor goes in under State law within the statute of limitations. Often you do not discover these things. They are concealed. That is what fraud is all about. So he is within the statute of limitations. Other investors do the same thing. 
So let us say it is New York or California or Illinois, and a whole wide group of people have been defrauded by some fraud artist. Well, if 50 of them come in and bring some kind of suit against this artist, they can be swept up into a class action, removed into the Federal court. They will go over to the Federal court, and then they say to them, `Well, our statute of limitations is shorter than your State statute of limitations under which you filed this action,' which was timely filed in the State court. 
They acted on their rights within the time limitation of the State court. They had no idea they were going to get swept up the way this bill permits. And so all of a sudden they are over in Federal court, and they say to them `It's too bad. The statute of limitations has run. And you don't have an action. You don't have a cause of action.' You are shut out of the courthouse. 
Now, where is the fairness in that? I defy anyone to show me the fairness in that process.

Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is exactly on point. That is exactly what would happen, which would be exactly what would be permitted to take place under this legislation. 
When the 1995 bill was passed, people said, `Well, we are defining this Federal standard. People can still go into the State court, the individual investor, and get a remedy.' 
Now they come along and they say, `Well, we're going to preempt the State courts in quote, `class actions,' but then they define class actions so broadly that it will sweep up individual investors. It can sweep up people who are not bringing what we traditionally recognize and know as a class action. 
So it is once again an example of overreaching, as this mayor indicated from Greenwood, MS, that removing these protections would have grave consequences. This thing goes beyond anything that is required to deal with--the New York State Bar Association quote, I think, is the best on this very point when they said, `The proposed solution far exceeds any appropriate level of remedy for the perceived problem.' 
I am saying to the opponents, look, let us examine what you assert as the problem. And we will hear examples of a problem that will be cited. Most of those examples, I am sure I would think something needs to be done about them. But the solution, the proposed solution here will far exceed the examples. What is going to happen is eventually--and that is why I think these people are opposing this legislation I have cited. 
I think Senators need to be cautious. This, in effect, is an investor's beware legislation--investors beware. I think in the future we are going to be petitioned or importuned in the Congress to correct this overreaching because innocent people will have been denied their remedy against fraud artists who have cheated them out of their life savings. 
Let me just note that we are at a time of record high in our Nation's stock market. The current bull market is the longest in history. Stocks are trading at a price-earnings ratio that exceed even those reported in the 1920s. The level of participation in the stock market by America's families is also at a record level, both directly through ownership of stocks and indirectly through pension funds and mutual funds. 
History suggests that at some point the bull market will end, and history also suggests that when that occurs is when securities fraud will be exposed. You don't get that much exposure in a rising market. 
Should this bill be enacted, at that time many investors will find their State court remedies eliminated. In too many cases investors will be left without any effective remedies at all. Such a result can only harm innocent investors, undermine public confidence in the securities market, and ultimately raise the cost of capital for deserving American businesses. 
I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about this legislation, to be very careful about it. It far exceeds what needs to be done in terms of addressing any perceived problem. I think we need to be extremely sensitive to it. 
I expect a number of amendments to be offered to this bill as we proceed with its consideration. I look forward to discussing those at the appropriate time as we seek to correct what I think are some of the more obvious and egregious flaws in this legislation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment, as the Senator from New York has indicated, goes to the question of the statute of limitations, and it seeks to preserve the State statutes of limitations. 
Let me quickly review the history. In the Lampf case, which my colleague referred to, the Supreme Court significantly shortened the period of time in which investors may bring securities fraud actions. On a 5 to 4 vote--in other words, in a very closely divided Court--the Supreme Court held that the applicable statute of limitations is 1 year after the plaintiff knew of a violation, and in no event more than 3 years after the violation occurred. In other words, once the violation occurs, if the plaintiff never finds out about it and 3 years pass, you can't do anything about it, even though, of course, one of the hallmarks of securities fraud is concealment and deception specifically designed to keep them from finding it out. 
The other aspect was 1 year after the plaintiff knew of the violation. Now, this is shorter--this statute of limitations --than those that exist in private securities actions in the law in 33 of the 50 States, as my distinguished colleague illustrated earlier with his map. 
Testifying before the Banking Committee in 1991, SEC Chairman Richard Breeden stated: 
The timeframe set forth in the Court's decision is unrealistically short and will do undue damage to the ability of private litigants to sue. 
Chairman Breeden went on to point out that many cases come to light only after the original distribution of securities. The Lampf cases could well mean that, by the time investors discover they have a case, they are already barred from the courthouse. The FDIC and the State securities regulators joined the SEC in 1991 in favor of overturning the Lampf decision. In fact, Chairman Levitt testified before the Securities Subcommittee of our committee in April of 1995: 
Extending the statute of limitations is warranted because many securities frauds are inherently complex and the law should not reward the perpetrator of a fraud who successfully conceals its existence for more than 3 years. 
Chairman Levitt reaffirmed his support for a longer statute of limitations before the committee as recently as March 25, 1998. I continue to believe that this time period in the Federal legislation does not allow individual investors adequate time to discover and pursue violations of securities law, but we raised that issue before and that issue was decided. 
So this amendment isn't trying to change the time period for securities fraud actions brought in Federal court. This amendment seeks to fix a related problem that will be created by this bill. Because of the overly broad definition of a class action, this bill creates a flaw; namely, that the Federal statute of limitations will now apply in an unfair manner to State cases. Cases that were timely filed under State statute of limitations may now be removed to Federal court and then dismissed under the shorter Federal statute of limitations.

Mr. SARBANES. Investors who file in a timely fashion under State law may find their lawsuits dismissed because, contrary to their intention, and in many instances unbeknownst to them that this would happen, they find themselves lifted out of a State court, put into the Federal court, and at that point the shorter statutes of limitations apply. So their suit is dismissed for failure to meet a shorter time requirement that they couldn't have known was going to be applied to them. 
This problem is created in part because of the broad definition of what is a class action that is in this legislation. So you could have an individual investor who finds himself classified as part of a group, although he was not part a group. He filed it on his own. He had his own lawyer, and he wasn't in collusion with anybody else in doing this. Or you could have 50 identified investors--say, school districts, or water and sewer districts--that get defrauded. If there are more than 50, they can be lifted out of the State court and put into the Federal court. When they went into the State court, they met the statute of limitations. But when they get lifted out of the State court and put in the Federal court, they then have to comply with this shorter statute of limitations, and they find themselves dismissed for failure to meet the shorter time requirement.

Mr. SARBANES. That is right. What this amendment does, very 
simply, is it provides that when the investors are removed from the State court to the Federal court, they can bring their State statute of limitations with them. If they filed in the State court, and they complied with the statute of limitations, they ought not to find themselves taken into Federal court and then being told they do not comply with the shorter statute of limitations and they are out of the courthouse when they, in fact, complied at the State level with the State statute of limitations. 
This is to deal with this unfairness whereby an investor can file a timely suit under State rules and without advance warning later be dismissed under a different set of rules. Anyone who wished to bring the suit in the Federal court would have to abide by the 1- and 3-year limitation of Lampf. But this is clearly unfair to an investor who is acting in a reasonable manner. 
This amendment is supported by a broad coalition of government officials and consumer groups. The National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and others have written to express their support for an amendment to allow plaintiffs to carry State statute of limitations with them in cases filed in State court which are removed to Federal court. The Consumer Federation of America has joined as well. 
I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It is an effort to deal with what, I think, is a very specific and definable flaw in this legislation. I don't think investors going into a State court, timely under State law--and I refer back to the comments of Chairman Breeden and others about the complexities of these cases, the difficulty of discovering the fraud, the difficulty of bringing the suit once the fraud is discovered--that they then ought to find themselves foreclosed altogether from any equitable relief simply by removal to the Federal court and the application of the shorter statute of limitations.

Mr. President, I understand that the leadership doesn't intend to have votes much beyond 6 o'clock or thereabouts, and I suggest to my colleague that we set aside this amendment and do the next amendment, which I will send to the desk, which actually is interrelated in concept with this amendment, and that we have a vote on the two amendments beginning about 5:40.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment interrelates with the other amendment that has been set aside on which a vote will occur later. 
The sponsors of this bill say their goal is to wipe out frivolous class-action lawsuits alleging securities fraud. What are class-action lawsuits? They are lawsuits brought by a single person, not just on his own behalf, but on behalf of other persons similarly situated. In other words, one person can bring a lawsuit on behalf of an anonymous and potentially enormous group of people. 
Why do we allow someone to bring such a lawsuit? Because in many situations, it is the only economical way people can pursue remedies. If a large number of people have each suffered a relatively small loss, it may not be economical for any one of them to pay the costs of a lawsuit. There are many examples of class-action suits by investors who have been defrauded. It is a tool that allows individuals to share the cost of a lawsuit when they are injured. 
Because they can be brought on behalf of a potentially enormous class, on occasion they can be misused to coerce defendants into settlement. This is the abuse about which the sponsors of the legislation complain. They argue that companies are coerced by flimsy securities fraud class-action suits, that it is cheaper for the company to settle rather than to fight them, and that these class actions are being misused. 
I share the view that frivolous securities fraud class-action suits should not be tolerated, either in Federal court or in State court, and lawyers who file worthless suits hoping to extort a settlement should not be able to pursue that practice. But this bill reaches beyond the frivolous class action. 
Here is the problem. The definition of class action in this bill is too broad. 
It will prevent investors from bringing individual actions solely on their own behalf in State court. Since they were enacted over 60 years ago, the Federal securities laws have preserved the right of individual investors to bring securities fraud suits under State law. This system has worked well. State remedies offer important protections to investors where Federal remedies fall short. 
But the definition that is contained in this bill for `class action' is too broad. The bill has a three-pronged definition of `class action.' And these prongs permit individual investors to be brought into Federal court against their will. The bill includes, as a class action, any group of lawsuits in which damages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons, even if the suits are brought by separate lawyers without coordination. 
So to tie it into the previous amendment, what happens is an investor goes into State court, in a timely fashion, he files an individual suit, and if 50 others do the same thing, they can be removed to Federal court as, quote, a `class action,' although it is not a class action as a class action is ordinarily considered or ordinarily defined. They lift them out of the State court and put them into the Federal court, and they are shut out because of the statute of limitations. 
Individual investors ought not to have to lose their remedies under State law in order to deal with the problem of frivolous class actions. And so the amendment that is offered narrows the bill's definition of `class action' to a suit brought on behalf of unnamed parties similarly situated. We do not use this `50 investor' definition which means unwary people are going to be trapped and lose their remedy. 
Now a broad coalition of State and local government associations have written to us supporting this amendment--the National Association of State Retirement Administrators as well. Here is what they have to say about the definition of `class action' in the bill. 
The definition of `class action' contained in S. 1260 is overly broad. The definition of `class action' in S. 1260 would allow single suits filed in the same or different courts to be rolled into a larger class action that was never contemplated or desired by individual plaintiffs and have it removed to Federal court. Claims by the bill's proponents that individual plaintiffs would still be able to bring suit in Federal court are belied by this provision. 
If we can narrow the definition of `class action' to a proper class action, and then that is taken into Federal court, then the statute of limitations will apply, if that prevails. 
On the other hand, if you are going to have a definition of `class action' that is so broad that individual investors can be covered, they ought not be subjected to the risk of losing their suit altogether because it is removed in a Federal court and they are bound by a statute of limitations that they had no idea was going to come into play in their instance. 
So, Mr. President, I very strongly urge this amendment. I think it corrects a very important weakness in this legislation. We can narrow the definition of who is covered by the class action so we no longer have to worry about the individual investor being shut out unfairly. I think we ought to significantly improve this legislation and narrow it so it applies to what it is asserted it is meant to apply to, and does not apply to individual investors who I think need to have their remedies preserved in the State courts.

This amendment preserves the right of State and local governments and their pension plans to bring securities fraud suits under State law. They have never been professional plaintiffs. They have never abused the system. They have to go through an elaborate process to even bring suit. They obviously are concerned with protecting the public and the taxpayers, and it seems to me a reasonable exemption from the provisions of this bill as it applies to these governmental units.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the President, Vice President, and my colleagues in Congress in recognizing the significant contribution of all public employees to our Nation's well-being. This week, from May 4 through May 10, is Public Service Recognition Week and today begins a three-day celebration of events on the Mall designed to highlight the creative, innovative and effective government programs serving Americans across the country. 
I am indeed proud to bring special attention to the dedicated individuals who have chosen public service as a career and who, through years of hard work, have helped to contribute to our Nation's growth and prosperity. Their important work includes protecting our Nation, keeping our food supply safe, participating in medical and scientific research, and maintaining highway and air safety. 
The excellent service provided by Federal employees often goes unrecognized and it is only when these services become necessary for an individual or when the services are unavailable--as we experienced just two years ago during the shutdown of the Federal government--that people truly appreciate the importance of Federal employees. It is with this in mind that I want to again thank and praise the millions of men and women in the Federal workforce who perform these important jobs every day. 
I view public service as an honorable career and a high calling, and I am proud that our Government has such a conscientious and highly qualified workforce. Despite previous attempts to undervalue the ideals which make public service rewarding and attractive to many, Federal employees continue to work positively and responsibly, while accomplishing many vital tasks. President Kennedy once stated:  
Let the public service be a proud and lively career. And let every man and woman who works in any area of our nation government, in any branch, at any level, be able to say with pride and honor in future years: 'I served the United States Government in that hour of our Nation's need. 
The Nation has unquestionably benefitted from the many wonderful achievements of Federal employees. In setting aside this week to acknowledge our Nation's public servants, we all have an opportunity to give these employees the thanks and recognition they so greatly deserve. I am very pleased to extend my appreciation to such a worthy an committed group of men and women and encourage them to continue in their efforts on behalf of all Americans.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, while I support H.R. 2676, the Internal Revenue Service restructuring bill that is now before the Senate, I would like to express my opposition to any amendment that would seek to remove an IRS employee representative from the citizens oversight board established in that legislation. 
Mr. President, the idea of having an employee representative on the oversight board is hardly a novel one. In fact, that idea has been incorporated into virtually every IRS reform proposal that has been made in the last couple of years, including: 
The recommendation of the bipartisan Commission to Restructure the Internal Revenue Service; 
H.R. 2676, the House IRS reform bill that passed that body by a vote of 426-4. 
The Senate Finance Committee's version of the IRS bill, which we are now considering; and 
The recommendation of the Administration. 
That an employee representative has been deemed an essential part of the proposed oversight board in particular--and IRS reform in general--should not be surprising. 
The IRS is an enormous agency of over 100,000 employees. The IRS reform bill we are now considering gives the proposed oversight board significant authority to review and approve plans for this agency's operation--its strategic plans, its reorganization plans, its budget requests, and other fundamental operational matters. 
Without the cooperation and input of the IRS' employees in this process, how can we possibly expect the Board's responsibilities to be discharged in a manner that will make the oversight board an effective instrument of reform? 
Let us not forget that IRS employees have been instrumental in bringing to light much of the information that has caused Congress to undertake the reform efforts before us now. 
Let us also recall that IRS employees have expertise in the operation of the agency that is unique and irreplaceable. This expertise is absolutely integral to effecting the kinds of changes that we in Congress--and more important, the American people--want and expect. 
Mr. President, the idea of having employee input in the basic management decisions of major enterprises is not a novel one. In fact, the placement of an employee representative on the IRS oversight board mirrors similar steps taken in several private sector businesses. For example: 
Northwest Airlines has a union representative on its Board of Directors; 
Similarly, the steelworkers union holds a position on the Boards of Directors of several of our nation's biggest steel companies. 
Thus, both the private sector and--in this legislation--the public sector have recognized the value of having employee input and participation in the management of major enterprises. 
Those who seek to eliminate employee participation on the oversight board charge that a union representative on the board will have conflicting interests that will hinder the board's effectiveness. Mr. President, My colleagues should note that this union representative: 
Is subject to nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate; 
Must make full financial disclosure in accordance with current laws, like all other Board members; 
Is, unlike other Board members, subject to additional disclosure requirements, including requirements to file financial disclosure information with the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees. 
Will receive a waiver of conflict of interest laws along the lines of those granted in over 1000 cases a year, where the public benefit of the individual's participation in government decisionmaking outweighs the potential benefit arising out of that participation. 
In short, Mr. President, the union representative will face greater scrutiny than any other member of the Board; such scrutiny will ensure that this representative will discharge his or her duties diligently and responsibly. Moreover, the House and the Senate Finance Committee have determined that the public benefit of having an employee representative on the Board outweighs the potential conflict by having him or her on the Board. I think this determination is indisputably correct, and should not be disturbed by the full Senate. 
In closing, let me make a few remarks about federal employees in general. 
It has become all to fashionable in recent years for Congress to berate federal employees and to denigrate the many contributions they make to our nation. 
Federal employees render invaluable service to this nation. They work hard and are proud of that work. Many of them are highly educated and skilled. In short, they bring a great deal of expertise and dedication to their roles as civil servants. 
Such dedication ought to be recognized, applauded, and, most important in this context, utilized to help the government's efforts become more responsive to our constituents. We are now engaged in such an effort. To remove federal employees from the oversight board would be shortsighted and a disservice to the nation. I therefore urge my colleagues to preserve the current composition of the oversight board and to defeat any amendment that would change that composition by removing the employee representative. 
Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, 50 years ago the State of Israel proclaimed its independence as a homeland and beacon of hope to Jews around the world. At 4:06 p.m. on April 30, 1948, David Ben-Gurion declared that the establishment of Israel would be effective at midnight the same day. Eleven minutes into the next day, the United States became the first country to extend recognition to the State of Israel when President Truman declared to the American people: 
This government has been informed that a Jewish State has been proclaimed in Palestine and recognition has been requested by the provisional government thereof. The United States recognizes the provisional government as the de facto authority of the new State of Israel. 
The ensuing rejection of Israel's appeal for peace expressed in its 1948 Declaration of Independence represented a missed opportunity of historic proportions. The Declaration stated: `We extend our hand to all neighboring states and their people in an offer of peace and unity and appeal to them to cooperate with the independent Jewish nation for the good of all.' Yet for 50 years, the people of Israel have endured war and violent conflict, including a war of independence, the Six Day War, and the Yom Kippur War, weathered constant challenges to their survival, faced isolation, an economic boycott, and struggled against terrorism. 
To build an independent Jewish nation on a small piece of land would have been difficult even under the most ideal conditions. For Israel to have done so while the country's very existence was constantly being threatened is truly a tremendous accomplishment. In the face of hostility and adversity, Israel has persevered and developed into a thriving and diverse nation. 
The special relationship between the United States and Israel is fundamentally based on shared values and experiences. As a vibrant democracy like our own, and despite the heavy burdens imposed on the country by war, Israel is a land of immigrants and pioneers whose democratic achievements reflect the hard work, sacrifice, courage, devotion, and self-discipline of its people. Few societies have sustained such pressure and kept their commitment to a strong democracy as Israel has done. In just 50 years the Israeli people have built modern cities and prosperous farms, and established high quality educational and medical institutions. Israel has accomplished this while remaining a refuge for Jews fleeing oppression and persecution around the world, as earlier Israel offered a new life to the survivors of the Holocaust. 
In keeping with its earliest hopes, Israel has been successful in forging ties with some of its neighbors and former adversaries, and sought to strengthen its security by ending the cycle of conflict and violence marking its first 50 years. Israel's willingness to take risks for peace has been borne out in the Camp David Peace Accord which settled the state of war with Egypt, in Israel's recognition of a Palestinian Authority, and in the 1994 agreement ending war between Israel and Jordan. 
Throughout these years, through good and difficult times, the United States and Israel have maintained an enduring strategic partnership which has served us well. The United States commitment to Irsael's strength and security remains firm. As President Clinton declared before the Knesset in 1994, `The survival of Israel is important not only to our interests, but to every value we hold dear as a people. Our role in war has been to help you defend yourself by yourself. That is what you have asked. Now that you are taking risks for peace, our role is to help you to minimize the risks of peace.' 
Today, on the fiftieth anniversary of the Jewish state, we recognize the tremendous achievements of the Israeli people and commemorate the fruitful and enduring partnership between our two nations. We wish for Israel the lasting peace and stability its people have long sought and offer our congratulations on the inspiring example they have set.

Mr. SARBANES. 
Mr. President, today, joined with Senator Lieberman, I am introducing legislation to provide our nation's workforce with the information technology and computer skills it needs to meet the emerging and rapidly changing requirements in our various technology sectors. I am delighted to have my distinguished colleague from Connecticut--whose efforts on behalf of the high technology sector and its workforce have been second to none--join as an original co-sponsor of the Technology Skills Partnership Act of 1998. The purpose of the Technology Skills Partnership Act is to establish regional initiatives to provide the skills that industry and workers require to remain competitive in the global, high technology marketplace. 
The United States is currently the world's science and technology leader. Technical innovation, which according to a 1995 report by the President's Council of Economic Advisors has been responsible for more than half of America's productivity growth over the past fifty years, has positioned us at the forefront of the global economy. In my view, we could not have achieved this status without the most skilled, innovative, and competitive workforce in the world. The high tech global economy is evolving at such a rapid pace however, that if we fail to keep our workforce honed and highly skilled --whether in advanced computer programming or computer based manufacturing technology --we risk losing this edge. 
A growing number of industries throughout the country are reporting serious difficulties in hiring workers with appropriate computer and information technology skills. Recent reports have estimated up to 190,000 unfilled information technology jobs in the United States due to a shortage of qualified workers. Many businesses point to the lack of skilled workers as a primary reason for their limited competitiveness and growth. 
In my own State of Maryland, the high technology sector currently faces an estimated lack of 10-12,000 workers with appropriate technology skills. A recent Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development survey indicates that 80% of firms which hire manufacturing or skilled trades workers, reported significant difficulty in finding applicants with the required skills for technology intensive jobs. The same survey indicates that more than two thirds of businesses hiring computer technicians, engineers, analysts, or other technical or laboratory personnel experienced difficulty finding qualified workers. It also mentions that fifty-five percent of firms that hire college-level scientist or technical program graduates reported the same difficulty and that 62% of these firms reported that their need for hiring these types of graduates is expected to increase over the next five years. 
Without the appropriate skills for the new economy, hundreds of thousands of American workers face stagnation in their jobs or worse. While well intentioned, most existing training programs are not structured in a way which addresses this problem from the perspective of industry and directly prepares our workers for these types of positions. To help meet the demand in this regard, a unique approach which is flexible enough to address the fluctuations and transitions of our high technology economy is required. In order to train and educate new entrants to the workforce, workers dislocated by economic change, and workers already in the 
workplace facing increased demands for higher levels of technology related skills, we must establish an industry driven framework which recognizes and addresses this need on a continuum. Without such a framework, this country and its workers stand to lose significant ground in the global economy. 
While some post-secondary training institutions have reached out to industry and become more customer-focused, more still must identify ways to respond directly to the changing skills and needs of employers. Many community colleges, and even four-year colleges and universities, lack the resources to purchase up-to-date equipment on which to train workers in relevant knowledge and skills. In addition, while some colleges and universities have been able to establish partnerships with some larger firms that have human resource departments, building partnerships and a two-way dialogue with small and medium-sized firms has proven more difficult. 
Relevant, focused and systematic training and upgrading of infotech skills is essential to linking and transitioning our supply of skilled American workers to the powerful and emerging demand of today's high tech economy. Without direct participation by industry, however, and an understanding of regional dynamics which help us identify specific solutions to address specific industry and regional needs, a significant portion of the U.S. workforce will be left behind. 
Mr. President, having the appropriate information technology skills is becoming more and more important in all sectors of our economy, not only in high and biotech industries and the manufacturing sector, but also in the so-called low-tech industries. More than half of the new jobs created between 1984 and 2005 require or will require some education beyond high school. The percentage of workers who use computers at work has risen from 25% to 46% between 1984 and 1993. Moreover, firms today are not only using more technology, but are also reorganizing production processes in new ways, such as cellular production, use of teams, and other high performance structures and methods requiring higher levels and new kinds of skills. 
According to the American Society for Training and Development, company spending on training has not kept up with today's evolving needs. In 1995, American businesses spent $55 billion a year upgrading the skills of their employees, 20 percent more than a dozen years ago. However, the number of employees has increased by 24 percent, meaning that private-sector spending hasn't kept pace. In order to bridge this gap, we need to pool our resources and coordinate our perspectives on this matter. 
Most firms, but particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, have limited capacity to engage in significant and sustained workforce development efforts. Managers and owners of most firms are simply too busy running their business to develop training systems, especially for new or dislocated workers. Firms also often lack information on what kind of training their firms need and where to get it. As a result, most firms forego training initiatives and instead try to hire workers away from other companies in related fields. 
Moreover, because workers are so transient, individual employers are reluctant to bear the 
burden of training employees, be they new or incumbent workers, simply due to the likelihood is that the employee will leave and go to work for a competitor. In light of this possibility, many firms simply cannot envision an adequate return on the investment for paying to train their employees. This, coupled with an increasingly competitive global marketplace, is one reason why many larger companies that once supported in-house training programs have since eliminated these efforts. 
The legislation I am introducing would establish regional working groups across the country in which employers, public agencies, schools, and labor unions can pool resources and expertise to train workers for emerging job opportunities and jobs threatened by economic and technological transition. It will help develop targeted consortia of industry, workers and training entities across the country to assess where and what gaps in this regard exist and provide the skills that industry and workers require to remain competitive and get ahead. 
Specifically, it would authorize a grants program--to be overseen by the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology--and provide up to a $1 million federal match, for every dollar invested by state and local governments and the private sector for these working groups. The Department would budget $50 million annually for this purpose and funds would be allocated through a competitive grants process, with each consortia of firms as applicants. 
Through a sector based approach, this legislation would direct meaningful participation in building an alliance by ensuring that each consists of at least 10 firms. These alliances would allow for participation from state and local officials, educational leaders, regional chapters of trade associations and union officials. However, each would be predominantly made up of industry, and as I have mentioned, would be industry driven. Indeed, if we are going to address the skills crisis in this country, industry must have a leadership role in establishing the means by which we continue to build and upgrade the skills of workers in technology related fields. 
Smaller scale versions of the types of skills alliances which my legislation proposes to develop have already shown promise. In Wisconsin, metal-working firms got together with the AFL-CIO in a publicly sponsored effort that used an abandoned mill building as a teaching facility, teaching workers essential skills on state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment. Rhode Island helped develop a skills alliance among plastics firms, who then worked with a local community college to create a polymer training laboratory linked to an apprenticeship program that guarantees jobs for graduates. In Washington, DC telecommunications firms donated computers, and helped to set up a program to train public high school students to be computer network administrators and are now hiring graduates of the program at an entry-level salary of $25,000-30,000.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in commemorating the 83rd anniversary of the Armenian genocide, which consumed the lives of one and a half million men, women and children. Today, as we remember the sacrifice of the Armenian people, we honor them by renewing our commitment to protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of all humanity. 
It is imperative, Mr. President, that no nation or individual ever forget the injustices suffered by the Armenians in 1915. Perhaps the most prominent witness to the Armenian genocide was Henry Morgenthau, the U.S. Ambassador to Turkey at the time, who described the wide-scale and deliberate orchestration of atrocities against the Armenian people as `the Greatest Horror in History.' He later wrote, 
`Whatever crimes the most perverted instincts of the human mind can devise, and whatever refinements of persecutions and injustice the most debased imagination can conceive, became the daily misfortunes of this devoted people. I am confident that the whole history of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this. The great massacres and persecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when compared to the sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915. The killing of the Armenian people was accompanied by the systematic destruction of churches, schools, libraries, treasures of art and of history in an attempt to eliminate all traces of a noble civilization some three thousand years old.' 
Ambassador Morgenthau's assessment of the great tragedy was consonant with public reporting at the time the events took place. Newspaper headlines in mid-1915 heralded, `More Armenian Massacres,' `Armenian Horrors Grow,' `Tales of Armenian Horrors Confirmed,' `800,000 Armenians Counted Destroyed,' `Spare Armenians, Pope Asks Sultan.' On July 16, 1915, Morgenthau sent the following message by telegraph to the Secretary of State: 
`Deportation of and excesses against peaceful Armenians is increasing and from harrowing reports of eyewitnesses it appears that a campaign of race extermination is in progress under pretext of reprisal against rebellion.' 
Other diplomats and consular officers substantiated the Ambassador's report of what was taking place. Abram Elkus, Morgenthau's successor, through his cables to the State Department confirmed his predecessor's assessment. 
We must not allow a handful of revisionists to shake our resolve to prompt recognition and acceptance of responsibility for this well-documented historical event. Indeed, Morgenthau and other diplomats who witnessed and reported in great detail the enormous devastation of the Armenian community would be astonished to learn today that the abundant evidence they collected, much of which is held in our own National Archives, and the testimony of survivors who are still with us, have come under challenge. Despite the irrefutability of the documentation and testimony, including extensive accounts from survivors, witnesses, and historians, there are those who deny the past, blame the victims, and oppose reconciliation. 
It is a tribute to the indomitable spirit of the Armenian people that, after enduring centuries of oppression, they have reestablished a free and independent state that is making new strides toward democracy and economic revitalization. In its short existence, the Republic of Armenia has survived the earthquake of 1988, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and a blockade by its neighbors. The spirit of the Armenian people is reflected not only in their dedication to rebuilding a nation from the ashes of totalitarianism, but also in the strength and vibrancy of the Armenian-American community. Americans of Armenian origin have successfully contributed to the cultural, social, economic, and political life of this country while preserving the rich faith and cultural traditions of their forebears. Clearly, the spirit of the Armenian people continues to thrive. 
Mr. President, to ensure that such a tragedy never be repeated it is incumbent upon us to remember the victims of the Armenian genocide and pay tribute to the survivors. Just as we have vowed never to forget the Nazi Holocaust, we must continually remind ourselves of the events of 1915. They became, after all, a precedent for Hitler, who rationalized his barbarism by asking, `Who remembers the Armenians?' 
As citizens of a nation founded on the ideals of freedom and human dignity, we must educate ourselves about the events that constituted the Armenian genocide and renew our commitment never to remain indifferent in the face of such assaults on humanity. In the words of the great philosopher, George Santayana, `those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.'

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing new legislation to help ease congestion, protect our nation's natural resources, and improve mobility and accessibility in our national parks and wildlife refuges. The `Transit In Parks Act' or TRIP bill is a new federal transit grant initiative that is designed to provide mass transit and alternative transportation services for our national parks, our wildlife refuges, federal recreational areas, and other public lands managed by three agencies of the Department of the Interior. 
When the parks first opened in the second half of the nineteenth century, visitors arrived by stagecoach along dirt roads. Travel through parklands, such as Yosemite or Yellowstone, was difficult and long and costly. Not many people could afford or endure such a trip. 
The introduction of the automobile gave every American greater mobility and freedom, which included the freedom to travel and see some of our nation's great natural wonders. Early in this century landscape architects from the National Park Service and highway engineers from the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads collaborated to produce many feats of road engineering that opened the national park lands to millions of Americans. 
Yet greater mobility and easier access now threaten the very environments that the National Park Service is mandated to protect. The on-going tension between preservation and access has always been a challenge for our national park system. Today, record numbers of visitors and cars has resulted in increasing damage to our parks. The Grand Canyon alone has five million visitors a year. It may surprise you to know that the average visitor stay is only three hours. As many as 6,000 vehicles arrive in a single summer day. They compete for 2,000 parking spaces. Between 32,000 and 35,000 tour buses go to the park each year. During the peak summer season, the entrance route becomes a giant parking lot. 
In the decade from 1984 to 1994, the number of visits to America's national parks increased 25 percent, rising from 208 million to 269 million a year. This is equal to more than one visit by every man, woman, and child in this country. This has created an overwhelming demand on these areas, resulting in severe traffic congestion, visitor restrictions, and in some instances vacationers being shut-out of the parks altogether. The environmental damage at the Grand Canyon is visible at many other parks: Yosemite, which has more than 4 million visitors a year; Yellowstone, which has more than 3 million visitors a year and experiences such severe traffic congestion that access has to be restricted; Zion; Acadia; Bryce; and many others. We need to solve these problems now or risk permanent damage to our nation's natural, cultural, and historical heritage. 
The legislation I am introducing builds upon two previous initiatives to address these problems. First is the study of alternative transportation strategies in our national parks that was mandated by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, ISTEA. This study, completed by the National Park Service in May 1994, found that many of our most heavily visited national parks are experiencing the same problems of congestion and pollution that afflict our cities and metropolitan areas. Yet, overwhelmingly, the principal transportation systems that the Federal Government has developed to provide access into our national parks are roads primarily for private automobile access. 
Second, last November, Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater and Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt signed an agreement to work together to address transportation and resource management needs in and around national parks. The findings in the Memorandum Of Understanding entered into by the two departments are especially revealing:  
Congestion in and approaching many National Parks is causing lengthy traffic delays and backups that substantially detract from the visitor experience. Visitors find that many of the National Parks contain significant noise and air pollution, and traffic congestion similar to that found on the city streets they left behind. 
In many National Park units, the capacity of parking facilities at interpretive or science areas is well below demand. As a result, visitors park along roadsides, damaging park resources and subjecting people to hazardous safety conditions as they walk near busy roads to access visitor use areas. 
On occasion, National Park units must close their gates during high visitation periods and turn away the public because the existing infrastructure and transportation systems are at, or beyond, the capacity for which they were designed. 
The challenge for park management is two-fold: to conserve and protect the nation's natural, historical, and cultural resources, while at the same time ensuring visitor access and enjoyment of these sensitive environments. 
The Transit in Parks Act will go far to meeting this challenge. The bill's objectives are to develop new and expanded mass transit services throughout the national parks and other public lands to conserve and protect fragile natural, cultural, and historical 
resources, to prevent adverse impact on those resources, and to reduce pollution and congestion, while at the same time facilitating appropriate visitor access and improving the visitor experience. 
This new federal transit grant program will provide funding to three Federal land management agencies in the Department of the Interior--the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management--that manage the 375 various parks within the National Park System, including national battlefields, monuments and national seashores, as well as the national wildlife refuges and federal recreational areas. The program will allocate capital funds for transit projects, including rail or clean fuel bus projects, joint development activities, pedestrian and bike paths, or park waterway access, within or adjacent to national park lands. The bill authorizes $50 million for this new program for each of the fiscal years 1999 through 2003. It is anticipated that other resources--both public and private--will be available to augment these amounts in the initial phase. 
The bill formalizes the cooperative arrangement entered into last November between the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the Interior to exchange technical assistance and to develop procedures relating to the planning, selection and funding of transit projects in national park lands. 
The projects eligible for funding shall be developed through the ISTEA planning process and selected in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior. The bill provides funds for planning, research, and technical assistance that can supplement other financial resources available to the Federal land management agencies. 
It is anticipated that the Secretary of Transportation shall select projects that are diverse in location and size. While major national parks such as the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone are clearly appropriate candidates for significant transit projects under this section, there are numerous small urban and rural Federal park lands that can benefit enormously from small projects, such as bike paths or improved connections with an urban public transit system. Project selection should include the following criteria: the historical and cultural significance of a project; safety; and the extent to which the project would conserve resources, prevent adverse impact, enhance the environment, improve mobility, and contribute to livable communities. 
The bill also identifies projects of regional or national significance that more closely resemble the Federal transit program's New Starts projects. Where the project costs are $25 million or greater, the projects shall comply with the transit New Starts requirements. No single project shall receive more than 12 percent of the total amount available in any given year. This ensures a diversity of projects selected for assistance. 
Finally, the bill directs the Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with the Secretary of the Interior, to undertake a comprehensive study of alternative transportation needs in the national parks and other public lands eligible for assistance under this program. The objective of this study is to better identify those areas with existing and potential problems of congestion and pollution, or which can benefit from mass transportation services, and to identify and estimate the project costs for these sites. 
This program can create new opportunities for the Federal land management agency to partner with local transit agencies in gateway communities adjacent to the parks, both through the ISTEA planning process and in developing integrated transportation systems. This will spur new economic development within these communities, as they develop transportation centers for park visitors to connect to transit links into the national parks and other public lands. 
The on-going tension between preservation and access has always been a challenge for the National Park Service. Today, that challenge has new dimensions, with overcrowding, pollution, congestion, and resource degradation increasing at many of our national parks. This legislation--the Transit in Parks Act--will give our Federal land management agencies important new tools to improve both preservation and access. 
Just as we have found in metropolitan areas, transit is essential to moving large numbers of people in our national parks--quickly, efficiently, at low cost, and without adverse impact. At the same time, transit can enhance the economic development potential of our gateway communities.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate one of Maryland's finest state institutions, Frostburg State University, on the occasion of its Centennial Anniversary. 
Since its founding in 1898, Frostburg State University has been a primary component of the greater Frostburg community. Although small towns are often identified merely as extensions of the school in their midst, it is more the case that Frostburg State is a true extension of the town of Frostburg. In fact, the people of Frostburg themselves raised the funds that were used to buy the land on which the institution is located. This symbiotic relationship is one in which the Frostburg community provides the support system for the school and in turn, is enriched by the school and its students. 
This unique relationship dates back to when the University was a small local teacher training institution named the State Normal School at Frostburg. Upon completing their training, students often stayed in the area and taught at regional elementary schools. This tradition of community participation continued as the school evolved into a State Teachers College in 1935 and finally, a multipurpose institution, Frostburg State University, in July of 1987, becoming a member of the University of Maryland System the following year. 
While the commitment to teacher training remains at the core of Frostburg State's mission, the University has expanded its curriculum significantly to include the arts and sciences, professional and pre-professional programs, and graduate programs including business, psychology and biology training. Enrollment has grown from an initial class of 57 to over 5,200, and the University's degree program now requires four years of study. 
It is important to note, however, that Frostburg State University occupies a unique educational niche as the only four-year institution west of the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Therefore, it serves as the intellectual and cultural center for this westernmost region of my State, and for nearby communities in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Although the student body includes students from various states and foreign countries, it continues to draw primarily from the immediate area, and provides important employment opportunities for the residents of the region. Furthermore, Frostburg State enjoys a partnership with the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) from whom they receive federal funds for various projects that enrich the school's resources and provide further economic development to the area. 
It has always been my firm belief that a democracy cannot prosper and grow without an educated populace. As the world becomes increasingly complex and technically challenging, the quality education of the individual is one of the most important tasks in our society. From its inception, Frostburg State University has prioritized education; maintaining a commitment to providing community and educational services to the entire region while, at the same time, succeeding in providing a nationally acclaimed education to its own university community. 
As we celebrate this important milestone, I would like to commend the greater Frostburg State University family for upholding the traditions of community cooperation and commitment to excellence that serve to exemplify the very best that Maryland has to offer.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as some of my colleagues may know, each year tuberculosis claims nearly 3 million lives--more than all other infectious diseases combined--making it the number one infectious cause of death worldwide. Unlike many other infectious diseases, tuberculosis is an airborne disease transmitted like the common cold. Nearly one-third of the world's population is already infected, and cases of multi-drug resistant strains, which are far more difficult and expensive to treat, are on the rise. Overall, tuberculosis is responsible for 25% of all preventable deaths.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a native son of Southern Maryland, Tubby Smith, who, as a first year head coach, led the Kentucky Wildcats to victory in this year's NCAA Basketball Tournament. This event is a historic one as Tubby Smith becomes only the third African-American to coach an NCAA men's championship basketball team at an institution that, at one time, did not allow African-Americans students to participate in basketball. It is for these reasons that I am particularly proud to congratulate Tubby Smith, a fellow small-town Marylander, on behalf of athletes and citizens nationwide who appreciate the value of opportunity and victory. Mr. President, I ask that an article on Tubby Smith, his family and life in Scotland, St. Mary's County, Maryland from the April 1, 1998 edition of the Washington Post be printed in the Record.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senators Murray and Murkowski, as an original co-sponsor of S.1825, The Veterans' Burial Rites Act of 1998. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure the continued availability of military burial honors to our veterans. 
More and more families across the country are discovering that, due to budgetary cutbacks, full military burial honors are not available for their relatives who have served in the armed forces. In many cases that have been brought to my attention, families are now being told that the best they can expect for these loved ones--who clearly deserve a funeral with full military honors--is a taped rendition of `taps' and a lone representative from the armed services. 
In my view, a society is not only judged by the way it treats its aging, its children and its least fortunate, but also by how it dignifies and honors its deceased. Knowing of the commitment and sacrifice of the armed forces and how important military honors are to those who serve and to their families, it would seem that maintaining these rites would be a high priority for the Department of Defense. It is very difficult for me to understand any degradation or lapse in this regard. 
When I first learned of this growing problem, in late 1997, I wrote to the Secretary of Defense, urging him to personally review this matter and identify the means to reinstate traditional military honors for those who have served. I have now joined forces with Senators Murray and Murkowski in introducing this legislation in an effort to ensure that full burial honors will always be available to our nation's veterans when requested. Simply, this legislation would ensure that the sufficient manpower and funding is available for requested burial details to consist of at least five members of the armed services, National Guardsmen, or Reservists--including a bugler, a firing party, and a flag bearer. 
In my view, the issue is clear and our commitment should be unwavering. Our veterans are always there when this country is in need. Rightfully, they have come to expect certain commitments in return which ensure them the dignity they deserve --in life and in death. In my view, it is our obligation to continue to provide these honors without hesitation and without degradation. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I just want to say, I don't really have a basic quarrel with my good friend from Minnesota. I want to be on the side of environmental protection and on the side of workers' rights and on the side of human rights. The Secretary of the Treasury has committed himself to undertake a serious review of the international financial architecture. I have a lot of confidence in the Secretary of the Treasury. In fact, I think we have the best finance minister in the world in Secretary Rubin. I place great credibility in his proposals. 
But you cannot remodel the emergency room at the very time the patients are being brought in to be dealt with. That is the issue that is involved in this IMF replenishment. The distinguished chairman of the committee said on yesterday that the Asian flu is the El Nino of economics, and he warned that unless we understand that, we are liable to make a big mistake. I think the distinguished Senator from Alaska was absolutely right on that point. 
These countries got into trouble because of, in many respects, mismanagement of their economy. The IMF wasn't there to begin with. The IMF came in in order to try to help them out. 
Now, we can argue about its programs, and I have been critical of them in the past and, indeed, even critical of them in the current context. But nevertheless, we have to do this replenishment because, if the IMF is perceived as having inadequate resources to deal with any crisis that might now emerge, it makes it more likely that the crisis will happen. If the IMF is perceived as having adequate resources, it makes it less likely that a crisis will happen because there will be an increase in confidence. 
So I urge my colleagues to support the McConnell amendment; otherwise, we may be headed for very big trouble, as the distinguished chairman of the committee said on yesterday.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Chairman D'Amato in introducing the Federal Transit Act of 1997 and the Transportation Equity Act as part of reauthorizing the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, what is characterized as ISTEA II. I want to commend Senator D'Amato for his leadership on this bill and urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
The Federal Transit Act of 1997 continues for another 6 years the program structure established in ISTEA in 1991. It takes the total funding for Federal transit programs, all Federal transit programs, up from $31.5 billion for the 6 years under ISTEA I to $41.3 billion over the next 6 years. 
Adoption of the budget agreement for transit continues the important 4-to-1 funding relationship between highways and transit that was incorporated in ISTEA. Actually, that ratio has existed now since the early 1980s, during the administration of President Ronald Reagan, when we raised the gas tax 5 cents. Four cents went to highways and 1 cent went to mass transit. We have managed, 
subsequently, to maintain that 80/20 ratio with respect to the allocation of the gasoline tax. 
The additional funding provided for in this legislation is critical to address the demand for transit in all regions of the country. The Department of Transportation reports in the newly released 1997 Conditions and Performance Status Report on the Nation's surface transportation system that we need to spend almost $10 billion every year just to maintain existing transit conditions. 
Enactment of this bill will at least take us a good part of the way toward meeting the goal of maintaining current conditions on transit systems nationwide. It doesn't really take us far enough out to address the question of improving the conditions and performance of the transit systems. 
The bill and the budget agreement increase the authorization levels for discretionary capital grants of formula programs to new levels. Funding for urbanized areas, for rural areas, for the elderly and persons with disabilities, the bus capital program, the fixed guideway program, and new starts are all covered under this legislation. 
The new levels should, hopefully, provide an important boost to much-needed transportation services in all parts of our country. Transit investment is critical to achieving the full implementation of the Americans With Disabilities Act. Enactment of this legislation strengthens the important Federal commitment to a national transit program. 
Building on the flexibility in ISTEA, the bill ensures that local decisionmakers continue to have the necessary tools to make balanced transportation decisions based on local needs. There is a new emphasis in this bill on giving transit operators greater flexibility to use transit formula funds. 
The definition of capital is expanded to include preventive maintenance activities. These changes help ensure that the Federal investment is properly maintained and encourages the development and deployment of new transit technologies. In this legislation, small urbanized areas, those between 50,000 and 200,000 population, will gain the flexibility that rural areas already have. This is a flexibility that is already provided to rural areas of the country; namely, to use their formula funds flexibly for either capital or operating assistance. In other words, they won't be divided into categories in this respect. This change should help to offset the reductions in the operating assistance that various areas of the country have faced over the past 3 years. 
In combination with the expanded definition of capital, which I referred to above--expansion includes preventive maintenance activities--this new flexibility will benefit all transit operators in those communities. 
The transit bill also includes an additional $600 million over 6 years for a new access-to-jobs program that is designed to improve transit services for welfare and low-income individuals to get to and from jobs. Actually, one of the greatest obstacles welfare recipients face in getting jobs is getting to the job. Making public transportation more accessible ensures that people can move from welfare to work. 
This legislation follows the path broken by ISTEA in placing emphasis on regional planning and flexibility to allow each area of the country, whether rural or urban, east or west, north or south, to use Federal transportation dollars, along with matching State and local resources, to develop the best mix of highway and transit systems to meet local infrastructure needs. It seeks to level the playing field so that local decisionmakers can make those choices, in effect, on an equal basis. 
ISTEA gave us a balanced, multimodal approach to designing and constructing transportation systems, quality systems that reduce congestion, reduce air pollution, conserve fuel, improve efficiency in the movement of people and goods, contribute to the economic well-being of our country nationally, and help us compete more effectively in the global economy. 
The legislation that is now before us continues that balanced approach to the development of an integrated and intermodal transportation system. Now, I don't think there is much argument that transit is critical to our overall economy. It's especially essential to our ability to sustain and revitalize the great metropolitan areas of the country. 
In many areas, transit systems provide basic mobility for people of all ages and abilities. As an increasingly larger proportion of our population ages, we need to ensure mobility for active seniors who can no longer drive. I really want to stress that point. This is a very important matter. Various senior groups have actually been to us underscoring how essential transit is in terms of meeting the needs of our senior citizens. 
Clearly, transit systems link people to jobs, to medical care, to shopping and other essential services. They are particularly crucial to lower income Americans who have no other alternative to reach their jobs. Making public transportation more accessible ensures that people can move from welfare to work. 
Now, let me turn for a moment to the interrelationship between effective transit systems and the environment and dealing with the challenges we confront with respect to our environment. Congestion and air pollution are two major headaches that we confront every single day, whether or not we drive. Increased use of public transit is critical if we are to reach Clean Air Act goals in areas with significant noncompliance. In fact, many of the gains that have been already achieved under the Clean Air Act are now in jeopardy unless there are viable transportation alternatives. Air pollution constitutes a major public health threat, and careful scientific study has shown that the danger posed by air pollution to health is more pervasive than scientists previously thought. In fact, the American Lung Association estimates that the national health care bill for air-pollution-related illness is $40 billion a year. 
In many areas of the country, transportation actually is a major creator of air pollution for both ozone smog and particulate matter pollutions. Whether it be diesel trucks or gasoline-powered vehicles, they contribute to that problem. One way, of course, of reducing this problem is for people to make greater use of our mass transit systems. 
Secondly, congestion is imposing significant costs to the economy and wasted time and fuel as drivers are simply stuck in traffic. If we did not have public transit, there would be a minimum estimate of 5 million more cars on the Nation's roads, requiring 27,000 more land miles of roads. Last year, the Texas Transportation Institute released its 10th annual report on congestion in 50 urban areas. Research showed that commuters in one-third of the Nation's largest cities spend more than 40 hours a year in traffic jams, and they estimate that the gridlock costs the Nation over $50 billion a year. 
Use of mass transit systems is on the increase. In the third quarter of 1997, transit ridership increased by 2.6 percent over the same period in 1996. Actually, the total number of trips taken on all modes of public transportation from July through September of 1997 exceeded 2 billion. More than 50 million more trips were taken on transit during this period than during the same time the previous year. 
Third, transit means mobility. According to the Federal Transit Administration, over 10 million Americans use transit each working day, and another 25 million use it less frequently but on a regular basis. Public transit provides these commuters with an affordable and convenient transportation option. Mobility is important in all parts of the country in urban, rural and small town America. This legislation seeks to contribute to an improvement in transit in all parts of the country. 
Finally, transit is an important contributor to economic development and job creation. Observers from across the political spectrum recognize that quality transit investment, whether bus or rail, makes good economic sense. 
In `Conservatives and Mass Transit: Is It Time For A New Look?' Paul Weyrich and William Lind state that transit serves important conservative goals, `including economic development, moving people off welfare and into productive employment, and strengthening feelings of community.' 
Public transit is also about jobs--creating jobs and connecting people with jobs. Increasingly, employers see the benefits of locating their businesses near a transit line for employee access to work, for reduced need for parking facilities, and for the economic benefit from commercial development around transit stations. 
Mr. President, a balanced, integrated national transportation network is essential to improve the economic productivity and quality of life of all Americans. Public transit is a vital part of our intermodal transportation system. We must continue to invest to both maintain existing transit and to build the necessary infrastructure to meet growing, unmet demands for quality transit systems. 
ISTEA has worked well for transit, and that has brought many benefits to our States and to the country. Passage of the Federal Transit Act of 1997 will keep America moving forward well into the 21st century. 
Therefore, I am very pleased to join with Chairman D'Amato to continue a strong Federal transit program as we reauthorize ISTEA. 
I urge my colleagues to support this very important legislation.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to address very briefly the matter which my distinguished colleague from New York was addressing just before I took the floor, because apparently it now appears, unfortunately, that we are going to have a squabble over regional allocations of transit money. The transit program has always been based on need. We have tried to structure the program in such a way that it responds to need, whether it is in the urban areas, the small metropolitan areas, or in the rural areas of the country. If we get into a sort of, `well, I need to get back what I put in' mentality, this can be carried to an extreme. 
My State, for example, is a high taxpayer to the Federal Government with a high per capita income. On any chart we put in, we are right up in the top handful in terms of what we put into the Federal Treasury. We don't get, to use an example, much from the agricultural subsidy program--from the various stabilization 
programs for agriculture. I, in fact, have supported those programs in this body, responding to the appeal of my colleagues from the farm States that it is essential to the economies of their States and, indeed, essential to the economy of the Nation. 
I think a strong agricultural program is essential for America's strength, just as I think a strong transit system program is essential to America's strength. But I have not approached that issue on the basis that I should get out of the agriculture subsidy program a relationship to the money we are putting into the Federal Treasury. I am willing to take that issue on its own in terms of the need to have the program. I think if you are going to have a united nation, you have to have a certain amount of that attitude. 
We have already been through a revision of the highway formula that has markedly shifted the percentage shares distributed under that formula to the Western and Southern States, and we recognize the arguments that are made for that. That change is taking place in other sections of this legislation. 
I, for one, would be very much opposed to departing from the needs criteria in addressing the transit systems. We are trying to meet, in effect, national transportation needs. The extent of that, of course, varies in different parts of the country. We structured legislation to try to ensure that a reasonable amount of resources go into each part of the country. But we have not structured it on the basis of, in effect, you get back something that is related to what you put in. As I said, if we go down that path, there are any number of programs that we are supportive of that are not done on that basis. And I think Members, if they stopped and thought about it for a bit, would reach the conclusion that it would not be advisable to have that approach. 
So I hope these matters can be dealt with in a spirit that recognizes the national interest that is involved in these transit system programs and that maintains some sense of equity as between highway and transit moneys, which I think is essential--that sense of equity is essential--if we are going to develop a balanced and integrated national transportation network. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I agree with the distinguished Senator from New York, the chairman of the committee. 
There are just a few basic points I want to make. First of all, I think all of us owe a significant measure of appreciation to the chairman of the committee for his efforts interacting with the chairman of the Budget Committee to find additional money for 
transit programs. 
In other words, a real effort was made here to get more money into the transit programs to help address the various needs of people. 
Secondly, on the fixed guideways, the committee itself, in consultation with the public transit groups across the country, made an adjustment in the workings of that formula so it is not as though we are oblivious to some of the problems that have been raised here on the floor. We try to make adjustments to take care of them. 
Thirdly, it is very important to understand that about three-quarters of the riders are in those cities. So there is a relationship between where you are putting the money and where the ridership is. This gets complicated because more and more cities now want to come on line with transit systems. The additional money that the chairman and those of us working with him have been able to gain for the transit programs will help to make that possible. 
Now, the distinguished Senator from Colorado said that this last year, he thought his return had jumped significantly. As I understand it, there is a full-funding agreement for the transit system in the Denver area so that the payout is beginning on that system. One of the problems you have here--and people have to understand this--the transit systems have to be funded in discreet jumps. You can't do it just a little bit everywhere each year because that doesn't give you enough money to build your transit system. In order to build a transit system, the transit systems have to work with the Department of Transportation to get a full-funding agreement, and then there is a commitment. So you get a jump, a discreet jump, in the amount of money coming in to build your system. You have to do that with each system that is coming along. If you just give a few extra dollars in each place, you can't build a transit system with that little money. 
Now, one of the problems, obviously, we will confront as we move along is more and more areas and regions recognize the desirability of a transit system, so they want to be part of the process. I am in favor of their being part of the process. 
I fought very hard with the chairman to maintain the 80/20 allocation. If we had lost that allocation, I think our ability to have additional money for transit would have been very quickly on the downslide. 
We know there are lots of needs. Members come to us. We understand that. We are trying to work with Members in order to achieve that. You can't look at one segment of the transportation funding without relating it to the other segments, not just within mass transit, but highways as well. 
Now, the chairman's State and my State take a sharp hit on our percentage share of the highway money in this bill. We take a sharp hit on the percentage share of the highway money. Many of those who are now coming to us who were seeking to rework the transit formulas, in fact, were among the States that benefit very significantly by the reworking of the highway formula. 
I am trying to look at it with a broad point of view. I recognize some of the arguments that have been made about the highway formula, although I had counterarguments I could make if you want to talk about miles traveled, congestion and all the rest of it. I can bring up a list of figures. The second most congested area in the country on highway traffic is right here in Washington, DC, 
as most of my colleagues probably realize as they seek to move around the area. But in any event, those adjustments are getting made, and we are recognizing that those adjustments are getting made. Now, even within the transit scene, it's clear that the new-start money is moving to new areas. Now, that simply is happening. I don't think the old areas ought to be `frozen out' of new starts because often they have to, as it were, extend their systems to accommodate the movement of populations further out into suburban areas. 
We are trying to build systems here that work, and we recognize the needs of new areas. I think we have tried to be very responsive, as a matter of fact, in the committee to try to address the needs of new areas. 
So I say to my colleagues that I think it's very important to try to take a balanced view. I think it's important for the Senate to try to come out with a balanced bill that represents a reasonable accommodation amongst all the interests that are reflected in the Senate, because the nature of the political dynamic is quite different in the House, if one stops and thinks about it for a moment. I think that if we have a balanced bill, it can become a kind of magnet point in dealing with the House. If our bill is seen as unbalanced, it won't be that magnet point, and the House people, I think, will obviously be seeking to move it to a new balance. So I think it is very important for us here to try to come with a new balance, and we are working hard to try to get that. 
I made my point on the highway formula, and I don't intend to press it any further. But in terms of taking a broader view, I hope we can get a comparable response on the transit measures. But you have these older transit systems--actually, a system that is more than 15 years old may need modernization worse than any system in the country. You have to upgrade these systems. New York has upgraded its system, and it made an enormous difference in ridership and in the general acceptability of the transit system. So we understand the problem, and we are trying to work with our colleagues. We are trying to keep moving this process along. We really have worked overtime to try to get the additional resources to help ease the situation. And I think, having done that, although we have to carry it all the way through the appropriations process now, I think we are in a better position to respond to needs that Members have. 
If we get into undoing all of these arrangements--it is a never-ending process--then I think we are going to confront a lot of difficulty. I appeal to all of my colleagues to recognize the complexity of it and recognize that the committee has been trying to deal with it. I think the chairman has bent over backwards to try to find ways to accommodate Members. But I certainly hope we don't make any sort of major, sweeping changes in the allocation because it's going to throw the balance completely off. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I just want to make a few points about the importance of transit as we are considering this amendment. 
First of all, when we had the energy crisis, there was a tremendous focus at the time on transit, which in a sense faded from the scene because we no longer confront an energy crisis. But it is very important to underscore how energy efficient mass transit is in terms of moving people and goods. We have developed and, of course, even improved technology with respect to low emissions on clean-fuel buses, clean technology for light rail systems and for heavy rail systems. 
People have to understand that means it is just that much less oil we have to import. So we are able to decrease our dependence on foreign oil by developing transit systems. And, of course, we are able to, as a consequence, improve our balance of payments situation. We often lose sight of that. We do not talk about that very much nowadays because energy isn't seen as a critical issue. But I simply want to remind people that at the time when we had the oil embargoes and everything, there was a tremendous emphasis on transit and its importance. 
Secondly, the importance of transit for improving the environment I think is indisputable. It is estimated that over 40 percent, between 40 and 50 percent, of all Americans live in areas with unhealthy air, according to the EPA. In many communities, transit investments are a cornerstone of the strategies to achieve air quality standards. A failure to develop transit capacity will undermine our efforts to give millions of Americans cleaner air to breathe. So we have to recognize that transit is important for environmental purposes as well. 
Thirdly, traffic congestion in our Nation's largest 50 cities is estimated to cost travelers over $50 billion annually, just from the bottlenecks and the gridlocks. These delays translate directly into added cost to businesses and to individuals. Transit carries the equivalent of 5 million additional automobiles per year. People need to sort of envision what would happen if we did not have these transit systems. You would have utter chaos. 
So we have to address this congestion and delay cost for millions of American motorists. And it is interesting to note, transit is used disproportionately during peak periods, peak-period commuting, which is exactly the same time when the roads are at their most congested. So, obviously, it serves a very important purpose in limiting or diminishing the amount of congestion that would otherwise occur on the highways. 
Now, not only does it eliminate or decrease the amount of congestion, transit also provides essential access for people to jobs and shopping and medical services. It is estimated there are about 80 million or above Americans who do not drive, in other words, people who, to get around independently, are totally dependent on transit. 
Transit is also essential now as we focus on moving people from welfare to work, a major national priority, one as a consequence of the legislation passed by the Congress. Now the States are under very tight constraints in terms of addressing that population. It is estimated that only a very small percentage of welfare recipients, 6 percent, own cars. So most people on welfare would be dependent on transit in order to get them to and from their jobs. 
So a strong and vibrant transit system, I think, is critical to the Nation's economy, to the well-being of our communities. I hope we can keep these additional considerations in mind as we address the transit title which is now pending before the Senate. There are these additional benefits that flow from it, and they really flow to the country as a whole. 
If we can reduce our dependence on foreign oil and the import of oil, we become less in the hands, as it were, of others overseas, and we improve our balance of payments position. Transit makes an important contribution in that regard. It clearly makes a very strong contribution in the effort to improve our environment and to achieve clean air quality. It helps to reduce congestion. 
Of course, people look around and say there is a tremendous amount of congestion now. I only say to them, think how much worse it would be if we did not have the transit systems. I mean, for those in the areas that are served by a transit system and are traveling by automobile or truck and encounter a lot of congestion, think what they would encounter if there was not a transit system moving millions and millions of people every day. You would have absolute gridlock in those areas of the country. 
Now, as we deal, of course, with the welfare-to-work challenge, transit is a major component in helping us to succeed in addressing that challenge. It is also clear that transit is an important contributor to economic development and property values. Those areas that have the availability of convenient transit services have discovered that it makes an important contribution in spurring economic development and job creation. So, Mr. President, I hope our colleagues will keep this in mind. 
An argument was strongly made in this body many years ago that we needed farm-to-market roads. We needed roads to make it possible for farmers to move their goods to market. As a nation, we responded to that and sought to support a farm-to-market network of highway transportation. I am supportive of that concept. 
I think if we are going to build the Nation, we have to be sensitive to the needs of all parts of our country. I very much hope my colleagues will be sensitive to the needs of transit. Actually, everywhere in the country, we have provisions in this bill for rural transit, and transit in cities of over 50,000 and up to 200,000, special provisions. But, of course, we have the situation in which we have the greater urban centers where literally millions of people move every day on mass transit. If it were not there, if we did not have a first-rate system, we would have a total, total breakdown in the functioning of the economy. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

So I am prepared to go along and accept the amendment in an effort in part to move this legislation forward and also to indicate that we are trying to be reasonable here. We want to get accomplished a result without departing from the basic structure of ISTEA in some significant way. I think what has been talked about here sort of puts us on that path.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to offer my support for H.R. 3116, a measure that will help our nation's bank regulators address the so-called Year 2000 computer problem, and enhance the safety and soundness of our financial system. 
The Banking Committee has held five important hearings on the Year 2000 problem and its consequences. It became clear during these hearings that the Year 2000 problem, in which computer systems may crash because they fail to process the date change from the 20th to the 21st century, could have a significant impact both on our financial system, and on the U.S. economy as a whole. witnesses testified that the problem is extensive, and will be expensive to solve. Our banking system is heavily dependent on computer technology, and failures at one institution could spread to others through their closely linked networks. Every single financial institution in the U.S. will need to solve this problem, and some individual banks plan to spend $250 million or more on computer replacements and repairs. 
The consequences go far beyond the financial sector, however. Estimates of the worldwide cost of Year 2000 remediation range as high as $600 billion. One Banking Committee witness, economist Edward Yardeni of the investment firm Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said that there is a 40% or greater risk that business dislocations caused by the Year 2000 problem could bring about a global recession as severe as the one that followed the OPEC oil embargo in 1973. The stakes involved clearly are high. 
I want to commend Senators Bennett, Boxer, and Dodd, along with Chairman D'Amato, for their leadership on this issue through their efforts in the Banking Committee. The committee has been working hard to make sure that our financial industry regulators solve their internal Year 2000 difficulties, and that our banks, thrifts, brokers, and credit unions are ready to enter the new century as well. Thanks to these efforts, our financial institutions are generally acknowledged as leaders in solving the problem, although much work remains to be done. 
This bill is a first legislative step toward helping our financial regulators meet the Year 2000 challenge. It directs each federal banking agency--the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, along with the National Credit Union Administration--to provide financial institutions with informational seminars on, and model approaches to, the problem. It also gives our thrift and credit union regulators the authority they need to examine an institution's vendors, particularly computer services vendors, for Year 2000 compliance. This will put all of our financial regulators on an equal footing with respect to these crucial examinations. 
Mr. President, the Year 2000 will not wait: there is no extending the deadline, and our financial institutions must be ready. To help our regulators meet that goal, I urge speedy adoption of this legislation.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the achievement and service of the American Red Cross. March has been declared `Red Cross Month' by Presidential Proclamation, and I can think of no more appropriate a season to recognize an organization whose mission centers on renewing hope for the citizens of our Nation. 
Founded in May, 1881 by Clara Barton, the American Red Cross was charged with providing emergency relief in times of war and natural disaster. Today, the American Red Cross is the largest grass-roots volunteer organization in the United States with 2658 chapters and over a million volunteers. I am pleased that the United States Congress had the foresight in 1905 to designate the American Red Cross as the lead voluntary agency responsible for national and international relief in times of peace. In over a century of service, this organization has grown from an idea borne from war to a national network on which people depend in times of crisis and calm alike. 
My own State of Maryland recently suffered severe damage from two consecutive Nor'Easters which battered the coastline. Ocean City, a center of Maryland's summer tourism, and Assateague Island, one of the State's most critical natural resources, sustained high winds, wave action and tidal surges which leveled protective dunes, destroyed recreational beaches and caused severe damage to roads, parking lots, and bike trails. American Red Cross volunteers responded quickly to the needs of these communities by preparing shelters for evacuees, providing replacement food, clothing and basic furnishing to those in need, and helped to evaluate damage to homes of year round residents. I am personally very grateful for all that was done for these people in a time of unexpected loss and would like to thank the many volunteers who pitch in when `Help Can't Wait.' 
Although disaster relief is one of the most important and renowned roles of the American Red Cross, the local chapters offer many other critical services that serve to prevent emergencies and provide training. The Red Cross is perhaps best known for its work to ensure a safe blood supply and blood products for cancer patients, accident victims and others in need. Other important services include courses in CPR, First Aid, HIV/AIDS education, swimming lessons, life guarding, and disaster relief and preparedness training. 
The American Red Cross also works closely with civic and educational entities to further their message and facilitate training. In Maryland, a newly formulated `Safe Families--Safe Kids' Campaign will be presented to schoolchildren from kindergarten to third grade in Baltimore City and counties throughout the State. This program will address safety concerns for children and families, including fire and injury prevention and interaction with strangers. 
The activities of the American Red Cross are innumerable and their contributions to the health and wellbeing of our society are invaluable. What is clear, this month and throughout the entire year, is that the tradition of service and the value of community responsibility thrives in the actions of this historic organization. I urge my colleagues to join me in applauding those who are taking part in the oldest and best of America's traditions--the spirit of service.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I had the honor of joining with Mrs. Mary Anne Gibbons, a number of firefighters from the State of Maryland, the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation, the United States Fire Administration, and others in dedicating the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Chapel in commemoration of Chief A. Marvin Gibbons. 
As I mentioned in Emmitsburg, Mrs. Gibbons is doing a terrific job in her position as a member of the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation board--carrying on the good work for which we honored her husband--and we are extremely grateful for her continued contributions in this area. 
I also made mention during the ceremony of the many accomplishments of the `Big Chief,' as Chief Gibbons was affectionately known by his many friends and associates. I wanted to make his legacy a part of the Congressional Record because throughout his life, I think he embodied the qualities which make our firefighters heroes, leaders, and role models. 
Ever since I grew up, two blocks from the fire house in Salisbury, I have always held a deep and abiding respect for the men and women of the fire service. This is not simply because of the willingness of fire fighters to put their lives on the line every day, but also because they tend to do their jobs with kindness and an infallible commitment to serving the citizens of their communities. Indeed, there are few persons more deserving of our respect and admiration than those who serve as fire fighters and first responders. 
I have long felt that Americans do not pause often enough to consider the critical importance of the work that firefighters do--to appreciate their sacrifice and the contribution which they make to our nation. Throughout his life, Chief Gibbons not only personified the best of what it means to be a firefighter and a public servant, but he also showed a strong commitment to ensuring that firefighters receive the recognition they richly deserve. 
This past weekend's dedication ceremony was indeed a fitting tribute to Chief Gibbons' 42 years of lasting contributions to the fire service. I want to again touch on one of the contributions he made on a national level which is of particular interest to me. As most who are involved in the fire service know, it was Marvin Gibbons who helped ensure that the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial was located in Emmitsburg, Maryland on the beautiful campus of the National Fire Academy. And it was his vision which led to the unveiling of this monument and the first annual National Memorial Service held at Emmitsburg in 1982. 
I was proud to introduce and push to enact the legislation that made the Emmitsburg site the official National Memorial to all firefighters. And in 1990, I spoke at the dedication marking the official recognition of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial where I recall quoting an editorial from the Carroll County Times entitled `Firefighters Memorial: An Important Reminder.' I want to again just quote briefly from it, because I think this editorial reflects what Chief Gibbons was striving to accomplish in establishing the memorial and an annual ceremony in honor of our nation's fallen firefighters:  
We take many aspects of life for granted. Not thinking about a service until we need it is an easy way to think . . . But how often do we consider that at a moment's notice, our fire fighters will risk their lives for us? Until the tragedy of fire or some other emergency strikes, we hardly consider it at all. 
Mr. President, behind each name engraved in Emmitsburg is a story--a story of courage, dedication and service to others--and I should mention that we are working to expand the National Memorial site there to ensure that it continues to serve as a lasting tribute to our firefighters. 
The National Fallen Firefighters Foundation is responsible for the National Memorial Service each year so that as a nation we will never forget the sacrifice that these brave men and women make in protecting us every day. With the dedication of the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial Chapel in his memory, we hope to ensure that the legacy of A. Marvin Gibbons and his commitment to the fire service will also never be forgotten.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to express my dismay that, just like last fall, the Republican leadership is preventing the Senate from conducting a broad, thoughtful debate on the issue of campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, the controversy surrounding our system of elections is not a new phenomenon. I can recall the 100th Congress, during which then-Majority Leader Byrd held a total of seven cloture votes in order to effect reform in this critical area. Sadly, we were not able to command a filibuster-proof majority then and this situation has not improved under the current leadership. 
It is my view that in order for our nation as a whole to be strong, our public and private institutions must be strong--our schools, our churches, and our governmental institutions must be vital instruments of democratic participation, and must instill in the people a confidence in and enthusiasm for our way of life. I am very concerned that, to the contrary, the people are growing increasingly cynical about public life. They are staying away from the polling place in increasingly large numbers, diminishing the level of political debate and the health of our public institutions. This is in large part due to their perception that money, rather than the popular will, drives electoral outcomes. Under these circumstances, meaningful campaign finance reform becomes vital to the health of our system of government and our way of life. 
Mr. President, a majority in the Senate--all Democrats, including myself, and a few courageous Republicans--agree with the American public that our system of campaign financing needs repair. Regrettably, however, an effective debate in the Senate on what should be done is impossible, so long as the Republican leadership insist on using parliamentary tactics to prevent Senators from offering and debating amendments that will help us clarify the nature and gravity of the campaign finance problem. These technical ploys are not simply designed to determine the outcome of the campaign finance debate--they are designed to preclude debate altogether, and to deny those advocates of campaign finance reform even the opportunity to garner a filibuster-proof majority in favor of reform. 
Mr. President, these kinds of maneuvers formed the Republican strategy last fall, when campaign finance reform legislation was successfully blocked, and here they are again. Such measures violate the Senate's reputation for thoughtfulness and deliberation, in which it rightly takes such pride. If the Republican leadership has the votes to defeat important and necessary campaign finance reform, so be it--I would not agree with this outcome, but it would at least comport with the way the Senate should conduct its business. To preclude altogether the consideration of amendments and a full and fair debate on the issue is something altogether different, and is inconsistent with the Nation's needs and desires. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I urge the majority leader and his allies to recognize that a system of elections that commands the trust of the American people is essential to the proper functioning of our democratic system, and, at the very least, to allow the Senate to conduct a full, fair debate on whether our current system needs reform. No one can guarantee that the Senate will reach a result of which it can be proud, but let us at least observe a process that will make the American people confident that this issue has received thorough review by their representatives in government. Anything less would simply add to the public cynicism that already exists toward government, and that brings us to this point today.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, yesterday, I joined with my colleagues, Senators Mikulski, Warner, and Robb in introducing S. 1679, the Federal Employee Pay Fairness Act of 1998, legislation that will seek to ensure pay equity for our Nation's civil servants. 
In 1990, Congress and then-President Bush approved the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 (FEPCA), legislation which governs the pay system for all general schedule Federal employees--nearly 76% of the workforce in the Executive Branch. Recognizing that Federal employees' salaries have trailed those of their private sector counterparts by an much as 30%, this law was enacted in order to bring Federal employees toward comparability with the non-federal rates that prevail in different localities across the country. 
The law set in motion a schedule to close 20% of the pay gap in 1994 and an additional 10% each year thereafter through 2002 to bring Federal salaries within 5% of their private sector counterparts. Each year, the President's Pay Agent makes a recommendation to the President as to what the rates should be in order to comply with FEPCA and remain on schedule to reach comparability by 2002. However, the law also grants the President the authority to override this schedule and set the pay adjustments annually. Since 1994, FEPCA has never been fully implemented. In fact, in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1998, Federal workers received a reduced annual adjustment, and fully locality payments have never been provided. Thus, instead of facing a 30% pay gap in 1999 as FEPCA would have allowed, we actually face a 69.3% gap today. 
The President has the authority under FEPCA to deviate from the Pay Agent's recommendation `because of national emergency or serious economic conditions.' Although FEPCA cites consideration of pertinent economic measures such as the GNP, unemployment rate, budget deficit, and CIP, it does not define what constitutes a `serious economic condition.' In fact, despite the record economic growth, low unemployment, and reduced budget deficits of the past five years, the President continues to cite `serious economic conditions' each year when he deviates from the FEPCA-recommended pay levels and proposes a lower pay plan. 
Our bill, a companion to legislation introduced by Congressman Hoyer and others in the House, would change `serious economic conditions' to `severe economic conditions' and define `severe economic conditions' to clearly indicate when the President can exercise his authority over the pay schedule. Simply put, a `severe economic condition' is defined in the bill as `two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the real Gross Domestic Product'; the definition of recession most commonly used by economists. By providing an objective, rather than a subjective standard, this legislation will ensure that our Federal employees receive a fair and adequate pay level, as set out in current law. 
Mr. President, over the years, Federal employees have made significant sacrifices in the name of deficit reduction. The Federal government is currently on target to downsize by more than 272,000 employees by 1999, and according to the Office of Personnel Management, has already reduced the number of Federal workers by more than 254,000 as of September, 1997. Additionally, these employees have persevered despite numerous attacks on their pay and earned benefits and the denigration by some in this body during the government shutdowns of 1995 and 1996. Through it all, Federal employees have continued to provide the high quality of service the American public has come to know and expect. 
Now, in order to maintain the high quality of service the American people have come to expect, we need to be able to recruit and retain the most qualified and competent employees. Certainly, if we are to expect more from our Federal workforce, if these very dedicated individuals have to do more with less during this time of downsizing, then we should ensure a rate of pay comparable to what they could get in the private sector. Federal employees and the public they serve deserve no less. 
Mr. President, as one who firmly believes in value of a first-rate public service, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important legislation to provide pay equity for America's Federal worker.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, since 1926, we have designated February as the month during which we honor the contributions of African-Americans to our history, our culture, and our future. 
Of course, no month should pass without our giving attention to the historical legacy of America's African-Americans. However, this month is the time when we devote special attention to this legacy, which, in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds, has survived and enriched American life in countless ways. 
As it does each year, the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History (ASALH) has selected a theme for this month's celebration. This year's theme is `African Americans and Business: The Path Toward Empowerment.' 
Mr. President, maybe more than any other theme, the question of African-Americans and business demands our attention and interest. The degree to which African-Americans participate in and benefit from America's commercial and business life may be the single best indicator of whether they have obtained the equality of opportunity and freedom for which they have long strived and to which they are entitled under our Constitution. We move toward full equality when uniquely gifted individuals--athletes, artists, entertainers, etc: capture the public's imagination and because of their unique gifts transcend the limits placed on their race. We move even closer to this goal when each and every African-American has the opportunity to get a loan, lease or purchase property, open a business, develop a product, hire other African-Americans, and contribute to the betterment of his community. The ability of African-Americans to have these most basic avenues of opportunity and advancement open to them may give us the best sense of just how far we have progressed on the road to equality. 
Thus, any study of the history of African-Americans and business should highlight not only the many brilliant inventors and entrepreneurs who have made unique or major contributions to American history. It should also take note of the many average, hard-working people who have fulfilled, against great odds, the American dream of owning and operating their own businesses. Let me devote a few minutes to both these sets of heroes. 
On one hand African-Americans, and Americans in general, can boast of such great minds as Jan Matzeliger (1852-1889), Joseph Lee (1849-1905), Elijah McCoy (1843-1929), and Andrew Beard (1850-1910)--19th century inventors who helped revolutionize American industry at a crucial period in its development. They can boast of groundbreaking success stories such as Madame C.J. Walker (1867-1919), America's first black millionaire businesswoman, whose hair products company employed 3,000 people, and Maggie Lena Walker (1867-1934), America's first female bank president. Mr. President, this list is merely a sample of the many African-Americans who have 
made unique contributions to American commerce, and who have helped lead us to the heights we occupy today as the strongest economic force in the world. 
On the other hand, let us also take note of the more modest success stories of the many African-Americans who at this same time owned and ran businesses, surviving not only economic hardship but a social system that left them short of funding, public support, and legal protection. Here I speak of the members--now long forgotten--of the Colored Merchants Association of New York City, formed during the Great Depression to sustain the city's African-American businesses against the shocks of that economic disaster. I speak here also of the numerous African-American newspapers established in the late 19th century, the first of which, Baltimore's Afro-American, is still published to this day. 
Mr. President, I submit that only when such stories of struggle and achievement are commonplace, and demand no particular attention, can we truly claim credit for eradicating completely the scourge of racial bias from our society. 
I think we are moving in the right direction. Between 1987 and 1992, when the last set of complete figures were available from the Census Bureau, the number of American businesses owned by African-Americans increased by 46%. In my own State of Maryland, the numbers are even more impressive. In Maryland during the 1987-1992 period, the number of African-American businesses grew by 14,080 to 35,578, a 65% increase. These figures, I am proud to say, make Maryland the State with the most African-American-owned businesses in the Nation. Moreover, two of Maryland's counties are among the top ten in the nation in terms of the number of African-American businesses based there. Clearly, more and more African-Americans are taking the path to empowerment that Americans of all colors and creeds should view as their birthright. 
Thus, during Black History Month, let us celebrate not only firms like Prince George's County's Pulsar Data Systems, a computer systems integration company that made $165 million in 1995, and was ranked by Black Enterprise Magazine as the fifth most profitable black-owned company in America that year. Let us also celebrate smaller enterprises like Grassroots II, an African-American bookstore in Salisbury, MD, which specializes in literature celebrating the African-American experience. Both these types of businesses--the smaller no less than the bigger --show us how far we have come as a nation and how far we still need to go.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Naval Surface Warfare Center's Carderock Division in Montgomery County, which will celebrate its Centennial Anniversary on January 30, 1998. 
For 100 years, the NSWC's Carderock Division, widely known as the David Taylor Research Center, has played a pivotal role in the design and construction of Navy ships, submarines and advanced craft. This Center has been described--accurately, in my view--as the `First Stop' for Navy ideas in new ship and submarine concepts. Through the basic and applied research conducted at this center the Navy has been able to develop new, innovative hull designs, ways to significantly lower the costs of submarine and ship construction, and has made significant advances in reducing electromagnetic signatures and underwater accoustics--to name only a few of its accomplishments. Its team of scientists, engineers, technicians and support staff at Carderock and formerly Annapolis, have spearheaded the development of surface ship and submarine system technologies to ensure that the U.S. fleet remains the best in the world. Since its inception, the Carderock Division has been charged with the unique dual mission of supporting not only the Navy, but also our maritime sector as a whole and I think it is important to point out how much the research conducted at David Taylor and the technology it has transferred to the private sector has benefitted the nation's entire maritime industry. From having the largest number of patents issued to employees in the entire division, to being the first DOD/Navy and second government organization to receive ISO 9001 (International Organization for Standardization) Certification--as well as receiving Vice President Gore's coveted Hammer Award--the David Taylor Center's achievements are truly second to none. 
Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work closely with a number of individuals at the Carderock Division and I can personally attest to the high caliber, quality and commitment of its workforce. Indeed, the many accomplishments of the David Taylor Research Center have only been possible through the professionalism, dedication, imagination and energy of its employees. 
One of the projects on which I worked very closely with the Navy was Carderock's new, state of the art Ship Materials Technology Center which we dedicated last year. With this new center and other developments which are underway, Carderock not only has best personnel, but also some of the finest, most-advanced facilities and resources to ensure that the Navy's Research and Development Program stays on the cutting edge of technology into the 21st Century. 
We take great pride in the accomplishments of the Carderock division, in the people who work there and in having this outstanding facility located in Maryland. I commend the David Taylor Center for its 100 years of success and remarkable achievements and am confident that, with its new lab facility, the Carderock division and our nation will continue to be on the frontier of Naval research and development for hundreds of years to come.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, now that we have concluded the 1st session of the 105th Congress, I want to again focus the attention of the Senate and the American people on the glacial pace of Federal judicial confirmations during this session. 
Mr. President, the reluctance of the Senate to confirm the President's nominees to the Federal bench is a carryover from the 2d session of the 104th Congress, during which the Republican-controlled Senate, in an unprecedented display of election-year inaction, confirmed only 17 district court nominees and no circuit court nominees. 
This pattern of inaction has continued into the 105th Congress, during which the Senate has confirmed only 36 of the President's judicial nominees--7 circuit judges and 29 district court judges. Admittedly, there was some effort made in the waning days of the session to confirm judges, but the overall numbers remain highly disturbing and worthy of attention. 
In the last 2 years, the Senate has confirmed 53 judicial nominees, while a total of 81 seats on the bench continue to lie vacant, and 41 nominees await committee or floor consideration. 
In other words, there are still more nominees pending in the Senate than were confirmed this year, and more than twice the number of nominees confirmed last year. 
Compare the number of nominees confirmed thus far this year and in the 104th Congress to the number confirmed in the last two Democratically controlled Congresses, one of which featured a Republican President. In the 102d Congress, the Senate confirmed 124 Federal judges, while in the 103d Congress it confirmed 129 Federal judges. In the 104th Congress, the Republicans confirmed but 75 judges, while this year it confirmed 36. In other words, in the last 3 years, the Republican majority in the Senate has confirmed fewer Federal judges than the Democratically controlled Senate did in either the 102d or the 103d Congress. 
I ask my colleagues to further compare the figures of the last 2 years with the number of judicial nominees confirmed by Democratically controlled Senates during years when a Republican White House faced a Democratic challenge--when, as in 1996, the party in control of the Senate had an incentive to delay confirmations, in the hopes that the Presidential election would effect a transfer of the White House to its party. S12720 
In 1992, when President Bush stood for reelection and the Democrats controlled the Senate, the Senate confirmed 11 circuit court judges and 55 district court judges. In other words, the Democratically controlled Senate in 1992 confirmed almost four times the number of Republican nominees confirmed by the Republican controlled Senate in 1996, and almost 25 percent more judges than the Republican Senate has confirmed in the last 2 years combined. 
Similarly, in 1988, when Vice President Bush stood for election, the Democratically controlled Senate confirmed 7 circuit court judges and 33 district court judges--over twice the number of judges confirmed last year, and more judges than were confirmed in this past nonelection year. 
Clearly, in the last couple of years, the politicization of the confirmation process has increased. Today, the Republican majority in the Senate is effectively bottling up nominees in committee and on the floor, in stark contrast to the behavior of Democratically controlled Senates over the last decade. 
This politicization, Mr. President, has been extended to include the practice of denying nominees an up or down vote on the Senate floor, or even in the Judiciary Committee. If the majority of the Senate opposes a judicial nominee enough to derail a nomination by an up or down vote, then at least the process has been served. Instead, however, the President's nominees are not even receiving that courtesy from this Senate: Some of the individuals whose nominations are pending before the Judiciary Committee or the full Senate have not been allowed a vote on the floor, much less in committee, for close to 2 years. It is especially troubling that of the 14 nominees who have been held up the longest by the Republican majority in the Senate, 12 are women or minorities. 
Let me give one example of this phenomenon--that of James Beaty, the President's nominee to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes my State of Maryland. 
Judge Beaty, currently a district court judge in North Carolina, was nominated by the President to the court of appeals in the 104th Congress, during which he did not even receive a vote in committee. He was renominated on January 7 of this year, and has yet to receive even a hearing in the committee, much less an up-or-down vote there, or on the floor. 
Some have argued against Judge Beaty's nomination that, in their view, the fourth circuit does not need an additional judge, and that failure to confirm him would amount to a conservation of taxpayer resources. Assuming for the sake of argument that that is the case--and I would disagree that it is the case--Congress should act affirmatively to eliminate the vacant seat on that court before a nominee comes before it, not stall an individual's nomination into oblivion with arguments created after the fact. When you have a nominee sent to the Senate and then claims are made that the seat is unnecessary, it is simply impossible to divorce the claim that the seat is unnecessary from an ad hominem attack on the candidate himself. 
Judge Beaty, if confirmed to the fourth circuit, would be the first African-American to sit on that court. Prior to becoming a district court judge, Judge Beaty maintained a general civil and criminal litigation practice in Winston-Salem, NC, and then served as a State court judge for 13 years. These accomplishments entitle him, at the very least, to an up-or-down vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Instead, he has not even received a committee hearing--much less a committee vote, at the hands of the majority. 
By any measure, Mr. President, the Congress has become increasingly politicized in the last few years. I submit to my colleagues, however, that if there is one subject that should remain immune from political games and pressure it is our Federal judicial system, which is the envy of the world for its independence and integrity, and which is absolutely fundamental to our system of government. 
It is essential for the maintenance of public confidence in this system that the confirmation process be as far removed from politics as possible. Yet we seem to be moving in the exact opposite direction, as we hear Members of the other party calling for impeachment of judges on the basis of decisions with which the Members disagree, and for defeat of judicial nominees deemed to possess liberal or activist tendencies. 
This behavior--while perhaps politically advantageous in the short run--betrays a basic and dangerous misunderstanding of the role of the courts in our system of government. 
Moreover, on a purely practical level, the Senate's failure to confirm the 42 nominees before it adjourns hamstrings the courts' ability to deal with its ever-increasing caseload--an increase that, I might add, Mr. President, is in large part due to the majority's proclivity for federalizing areas of law that have been historically left to the States. 
So we have district judges throughout the country putting aside all civil cases in order to deal with their criminal dockets, because their courts have been left shorthanded by the Senate's inaction. We have courts of appeals canceling oral arguments because of shortages on their courts. We have Chief Justice Rehnquist--hardly the kind of liberal judicial activist that so concerns the majority--calling the problem of judicial vacancies the most pressing problem facing the Federal courts today. And yet we see little in the way of movement by the Senate to alleviate these burdens. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues--especially my Republican colleagues--will give serious attention to the problems, both practical and philosophical, that will result if the Senate does not revisit its approach to the judicial confirmation process, and that in this area, the second session of the 105th Congress will proceed in a markedly different manner than the last 2 years. 
In closing, I would like to commend the efforts of my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, in this area. He has tried to jog the Senate into acting to resolve this problem: I regret that his calls for action have not been heeded thus far, though I hold out hope that common sense and respect for our constitutional system will prevail in the long run.

Mr. SARBANES. I ask the Senator from North Dakota, in fact, what has happened to the U.S. trade balance is a marked deterioration in our position in the post-World War II period. In other words, beginning after World War II, we ran a modest trade surplus year in and year out, and beginning in the mid-1970s and continuing thereafter, as the Senator indicates on his chart and indicated on this chart, we have been running these very large negative trade balances, sometimes as much as $150 billion, $180 billion in a single year. The consequence of running these trade balances year in and year out cumulatively is about $1.5 trillion. 
The result of that is a deterioration in the U.S. position from being a creditor nation to now we are a debtor nation.

Mr. SARBANES. The United States is the largest debtor nation in the world. People say, look, if we were a developing country just setting out on the process of development, there is an argument that can be made that you run a trade imbalance. And if you are smart in your trade imbalance, you bring in investment to develop your economy for the future. That is what the United States did in the 19th century. 
But the United States now is supposedly the most developed country in the world. The most developed country in the world, supposedly the world's leader, ought not to be a debtor nation and ought not to be running these large trade imbalances. 
I say to the Senator from North Dakota, here is what happens. You know, people say, `Well, people are losing jobs.' And they say, `Well, they're losing jobs, but other people are gaining jobs from the exports, and, as a consequence, we're strengthening ourselves as a nation.' We are not strengthening ourselves as a nation. We are running these very large trade deficits year in and year out. 
This represents a marked deterioration in the American position. We did not do this between the end of World War II and into the 1970's. It is only over the last 20 years that we started running, year in and year out, these very large trade deficits. 
As the Senator from North Dakota points out, the reason for them, I think, is fairly simple. Our market is very open for other countries to send goods into the United States. And many of those markets are relatively closed to us. We export $12 billion a year to China, to the PRC, and take from the PRC $52 billion a year; $12 billion goes that way and $52 billion comes this way, for a net imbalance of $40 billion. And it is growing year to year to year. Every year it keeps going up.

Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. The question is not whether you are going to trade; it is the terms on which you 
will trade. What are the rules going to be? Of course, China's trade surplus with the United States finances China's trade imbalance with the rest of the world. So, in effect, we make it possible for China to purchase from other developed countries, the European countries, for example, who are very careful to keep their trade relationship with China in much more of an even balance. 
So, year after year, we run these large trade deficits, and everyone says, `Well, it doesn't matter.' It does matter. It does matter. It affects the standing of the United States as a world power. You cannot long be a world power if you are the world's largest debtor country. 
This chart makes a difference. The United States for decades was a creditor nation--others owed us. Now we have deteriorated to where we are now the largest debtor nation in the world to the tune of $1 trillion--a $1 trillion debtor nation. 
People get up on the floor of the Senate, and they make these expansive speeches about what a great power we are, and so forth and so on, and yet our economic status continues to deteriorate year after year. 
This is the issue that needs to be addressed. This is exactly what this commission would try to do. The fact of the matter is that in this trade debate there is an effort to frame it as though the people that are losing their jobs are screaming, which they well should be, but then it is argued, well, this has to happen when you have trade development and, you know, there are people who get jobs in the export industry. 
The fact of the matter is, we are losing far more jobs on the import side than we are gaining on the export side. I mean, if the trade was roughly in balance, then you'd have a different set of circumstances. But we have been running, as the Senator has pointed out, these very large trade deficits, year after year after year. 
That is a deterioration in the American position. I defy anyone to try to make the case that it is a good thing for the United States in present circumstances to be running these large trade deficits, that it is a good thing for the United States, supposedly the world's most highly developed economy, to go from being a creditor nation to being a debtor nation. It is obviously not a good thing. We need to address this issue. This commission would be one way of trying to do that.

Mr. SARBANES. Isn't it a fact that if you can't bring in the environmental standards and the working conditions, you are not going to be able to compete on a level field? Either one of two things will happen. You will remain at a competitive disadvantage, as the Senator has noted, I think, very perceptively; or there is going to be a tremendous downward pressure to lower environmental standards because people will say, well, we are at a competitive disadvantage, we can't have these environmental standards. 
Now, we have been through the whole debate about the environmental standards, and they are clearly necessary if we are not going to befoul the very world in which we live. 
This legislation doesn't make the environmental concerns a legitimate objective. The Senator made a very thoughtful speech the other evening about the difficulty with this legislation, about, as I recall, setting out what our negotiating goals ought to be. It seems to me that this is a clear example of such failure, because the legislation does not permit environmental considerations to be a central negotiating goal, as I understand it; is that correct?

Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. Of course, the reason we put in the environmental standards is we went through a long debate that indicated we were paying a very heavy health cost because we didn't have clean air and clean water. So we made the effort to get clean air and clean water, which I very strongly support. But now if you are going to go into international trade and your competitors are free of having to meet any of those standards, then they are, as you say, at a competitive advantage in dealing with you. That is one of the things we are facing. I can't, for the life of me, understand why it is unreasonable or impermissible to bring the environmental concerns into the middle of the trade negotiations as well.

Actually, at the very point when we have something we can use as leverage to get the higher standard, which is access into the American market, we are refusing to do it in order to achieve greater equalization of these environmental standards. I can't, for the life of me, understand why we are leaving the environmental matters out of the trade negotiations. I understand that it will not be the only thing in the trade negotiation; there will be other considerations as well. But why it should be, as it were, excluded outside of that parameter, I can't, for the life of me, understand.

Mr. SARBANES. That leads to this: Many people have said these are not really trade agreements that are being negotiated, or the impetus for them is not trade; it is investment. These are investment agreements. Among other things, a result of these agreements is extended protection for American investment in other countries; in other words, as the Senator said, for the multinationals to be able to establish their production abroad rather than in this country. Well, of course, if they are going to do that, then they don't want the higher environmental or working-condition standards.

Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, I agree with the Senator completely. I think all of the items that he mentioned in terms of resolving commercial disputes, repatriation of earnings, and so forth obviously have to be part of a negotiating effort. But the environmental considerations should also be a part of the negotiating effort. 
I think that is all the Senator's amendment seeks to do. It doesn't seek to displace those other goals or objectives. It simply seeks to add to them so that it becomes a part of the negotiating focus and so that environmental concerns will also be on the agenda instead of left off the agenda and not have so-called side agreements. We have been through those side agreements. We know full well--we did the same thing on environment and on worker conditions--we know full well that in both instances the side agreements don't amount to anything. Other things which are put right into the trade agreement become enforceable and have to be adhered to. If they are not adhered to, they are contrary to the trade agreement; the remedies that are provided for in the trade agreement go into effect. But they are not putting the environment and the working conditions on the same status, the same level.

Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further, I think the Senator made a very important point when he spoke about the contradiction in our approach. On the one hand, as he pointed out on the global warming issue and on the other environmental matters that he talked about, we are often engaged in negotiating with other countries to try to arrive at international environmental standards. Everyone says, `Well, we have to do that.' On the other hand, when we come to trade agreements where we have an enhanced ability, since the entry into the American market is a very important objective that is sought abroad, we take the environmental matters out of that context altogether. 
So the very place where we are most likely to be able to gain advances on environmental standards and at the same time, as the Senator points out, avoid placing our own producers in a disadvantageous position, we forswear dealing with those environmental questions. 
It just boggles the mind that this approach is being taken in this legislation.

Mr. SARBANES. Of course, when we go into the international environmental conferences, they say, `You are the biggest offender,' because we are the most highly developed country and, therefore, we are put on the defensive in trying to get an agreement on the environmental standards. We are the most highly developed country, which is why in the trade negotiations they are so anxious to come into the American market, but we leave out of the trade negotiations the environmental issues. It just doesn't make sense. It is diminishing our ability, it seems to me, to negotiate comprehensive, fair trading arrangements that do not place our own producers at a significant disadvantage and do not create a downward pressure and downward movement with respect to protecting and enhancing the environment.

What are your objectives that are going to be focused upon in the trade negotiations? We all want to arrive at these trade agreements if we can do so. The question then becomes, What are the goals? What are the objectives? The Senator pointed out that the goals were too narrowly focused. This is a dramatic example of that narrow focus.

Mr. SARBANES. Of course, the assertion used to be made, well, if we lost jobs in certain industries because our technology was always advancing, we would be out doing the more complex, complicated production techniques and therefore we would gain jobs in those industries. And if you think about it, there is something to that theory. 
But what has happened, in my perception, that undercuts that theory and why we are running these large trade deficits as a consequence is, first of all, as capital moves freely, capital moves into these undeveloped countries where there are no environmental standards and there are no real working conditions. So then you have people who are working 11, 12 hours a day for 15 cents an hour but the machines they are working on, because the capital has come in, are the same machines that people would be working on in this country. 
And so the ability of capital to move that way makes it even more imperative that these environmental and working condition issues be included within the trade negotiations. 
Furthermore, even if the capital does not move, as it were, voluntarily, some of these countries are demanding that it move as a condition for having any trade. China has made it very clear that companies have to bring in their top-line technology and investment so that they will then be the producers at the next economic turn. 
So in order to get a contract, our people get a short-term contract, they agree as part of selling the goods that they are also going to move in the technology and the investment which then makes it possible for them to produce the goods the next economic go-round. So no longer will we not be able to sell to them, but it is my prediction they will then become our competitors in other markets as well. So we are being, as it were, coerced into, in effect, providing technology, and yet we are told, well, we can't have as part of the trade negotiation evening up the environmental and the worker landscape, economic landscape.

Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield just further for 1 minute, it is since 1975 that our trade balance has deteriorated in this extraordinary fashion. I understand the point. Everyone says we have been doing this. The consequence of doing this is--contrary to the whole period prior to then, when we ran modest surpluses--we have now been running these very deep deficits. And the consequence of doing that is that we are now a debtor nation. I defy anyone to say that this is a welcome trend, in terms of the U.S. economic position worldwide. We have gone from being the largest creditor nation in the world to now we are the largest debtor nation, and at the end of this year we will be a debtor nation to the tune of $1 trillion.

This important summit examined one of the most critical issues facing American families today, the need for safe, affordable, quality child care. I rise today to commend the President for working to focus public attention on this very important matter, and to urge the Senate to move quickly to address the critical issues facing us with regard to our children's future. 
Mr. President, it has long been my view that our children are our greatest national resource and must number among our country's highest priorities. Nationwide, nearly 10 million preschool children spend a part of their day in child care, and there are many more school-age children who spend portions of their afternoons under the supervision of someone other than a parent when the school day ends. These children need care that will enable them to learn and grow, while keeping them safe, healthy, and happy. 
There can be no disagreement that high quality child care and early childhood development services are absolutely essential to the well-being of our children and our families. In fact, recent research findings in early brain development indicate that much of children's growth and future emotional health is determined by early learning and care. This research emphasizes the urgent need for well-trained reliable child care-givers for even the youngest of children, and underscores the importance of continued Federal support for child care programs. Whether these programs are called child care, early childhood development, or early childhood education they all must provide the nurturing and stimulation children need to develop fully, to enter school ready to learn, and to grow into capable and responsible adults. 
While quality of care is the most important consideration for parents choosing a child care provider for their families, many parents must take into consideration the high cost of child care in this country. According to the 1995 Census, middle class families earning approximately $36,000 a year spend 12 percent of their annual income in child care expenses, and families earning $15,000 or less a year pay approximately 25 percent of their household income on care for their children. For these parents child care is an enormous financial burden. 
In my own State of Maryland, many parents are struggling to hold jobs and at the same time provide quality care for their children. While the State of Maryland is a leader in day care financing, in 1994, there were approximately 4,000 children on the waiting list for child care assistance. Many of these children's parents must daily live with the fear that their child care situation is inadequate or that their carefully patched together child care arrangements will fall apart. We can--and we must--do better. 
The Federal Government has a crucial responsibility to support and protect society's youngest members. As a nation we must work to empower low-income parents so that they may meet their children's needs by providing access to affordable, quality child care. As a member of the Senate, I have co-sponsored previous legislation to address these pressing issues including the Act for Better Child Care Services which led to the authorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant, and I have continued to work with my colleagues to ensure that Federal investments in the care and development of young children yield concrete results. 
The White House Child Care Conference has provided us with a strong foundation on which to build and expand our Nation's child care programs, and has already begun to yield tangible results. Proposals resulting from the White House conference include the creation of a national child care provider scholarship fund to improve training, education, and compensation for child care providers, and a National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of background checks on child care providers. These proposals are useful first steps to bolster Federal child care programs, and to address issues of quality, accessibility, and affordability of reliable child care. 
Mr. President, it is imperative to remember that children represent the future of this Nation. Unless we provide those generations to come with the knowledge and skills needed to function successfully in an increasingly complex world, we not only imperil the futures of our children--we imperil the future of our Nation. We must continue to invest in the future of our children by renewing our commitment to quality child care, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort.

Mr. SARBANES. I rise today to offer legislation which would establish the Thurgood Marshall Legal Educational Opportunity Program. This program would allow the Department of Education to award grants to universities to provide assistance to low-income, minority or economically disadvantaged students who are seeking a legal education. 
For more than 28 years, such assistance was provided through appropriations authorized by the Higher Education Act [HEA] of 1965. These critical funds were channeled through the Council on Legal Education Opportunity [CLEO] and were used to help qualified disadvantaged students gain admission to law school and prepare themselves for their legal education. 
Since 1968, the heart of the CLEO program has been the 6-week pre-law summer institute. These institutes, held on law school campuses across the country, simulate the classroom setting of first year law school, exposing students to the rigors of legal study. Utilizing full-time law school professors and a proven curriculum that emphasizes critical thinking, legal analysis and writing skills, CLEO has built a reputation of credibility and has produced more than 6,000 successful alumni from more than 170 law schools. 
Unfortunately, Federal funding for CLEO was eliminated during the fiscal year 1996 appropriations process. This highly beneficial and cost-effective program has persevered primarily through the assistance of private donations and the sponsorship of the American Bar Association [ABA]. 
The bill I am introducing today, a companion to Congressman Cummings' legislation in the House, would restore much of the CLEO framework. The Thurgood Marshall Legal Opportunity Program would identify socially and economically disadvantaged law school students and provide them with the opportunity to hone their skills through summer institutes, midyear seminars and support services. 
Mr. President, every society places a premium on education in terms of developing a skilled and trained work force in the next generation, and the more economically complex the world becomes, the more urgent it is to develop these human resources. This program will provide the necessary resources to ensure that those who have proven themselves at the undergraduate level of study are able to maximize their potential as they move on to law school.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the men and women who have served our Nation's Armed Forces and the tremendous sacrifices they have made for this country. It has always been my view that these citizens who are called upon to defend our Nation, to risk and in many cases sacrifice their lives, deserve our upmost respect and gratitude, not only on Veterans Day, but for the peace and freedom we enjoy every day. 
This day allows us all to contemplate the bravery and absolute importance of the men and women who have served and are currently serving in our Armed Forces. It is in large part because of their efforts and sacrifices that we are ensured the domestic tranquility with which to progress and become an even greater Nation. Moreover, their service has helped to ensure peace throughout the world and for generations of Americans to come. Whether directly involved in conflict or not, it is this mission the dedicated men and women in the Armed Forces are sworn to uphold and we all value and recognize their hard work and tremendous contributions. 
The First World War ended on the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of the 11th month, in 1918 on the day we now call Veterans Day. By the end of the first world conflict there had been more than 37 million military casualties, in addition to 10 million deaths among the civilian population. The effects of this war were felt around the world, but the sacrifice and tragedy associated with it were destined to be repeated with more bloodshed and even deadlier consequences. 
Mr. President, it is my view that the purpose of Veterans Day is not only to understand and honor the depth of the sacrifice that has already been made by our Nation's veterans, but to help strengthen our vows for peace in the future. It is the hope of many, indeed, all of us who celebrate Veterans Day, that this day, through reflection, will strengthen and foster peace worldwide. We should use this day as a link to our past in a way that helps us understand the depth of the tragedy and loss incurred in previous wars and thereby help us keep the peace and our democratic way of life. To ignore this link would deplete the purpose and meaning of this important day. 
So, I rise today to pay the upmost tribute to our veterans, past and present. As we celebrate Veterans Day, I want to extend my sincere gratitude to those who have sacrificed and died, those who have served, and those who are serving now. We will never forget your service and your sacrifice.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this past August, I was privileged to address the Order of AHEPA during the celebration of its 75th anniversary in Atlanta, GA, the city of its founding. AHEPA, American Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, the largest Greek-American fraternal organization, has played a pivotal role in bringing Greek-Americans into the mainstream of American life, and promoting the ideals of Hellenic culture. It has also launched significant philanthropic and educational initiatives which have benefited both the Greek-American community and American society at large. 
As part of this 75th anniversary commemoration, James Scofield, a past supreme president of AHEPA, prepared for article on the early origins of AHEPA entitled, `Forgotten History: The Klan vs. Americans of Hellenic Heritage in an Era of hate.' This piece, written by Mr. Scofield, recently retired after 30 years as a senior executive at the St. Petersburg, FL, Times, has appeared in the AHEPA magazine and many Greek-American publications. 
It records the struggle which Greek-Americans encountered in their effort to participate fully in American society. AHEPA's history, as presented by Mr. Scofield, also reminds us of the extraordinary progress which our country has achieved in providing opportunity for people of all races, religions, and backgrounds.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it was my singular honor this past September to attend the annual dinner of the Center for National Policy where Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana received the Edmund S. Muskie Distinguished Public Service Award. Representative Hamilton's distinguished record of public service exemplifies, both in spirit and deed, the principles which the late Senator Muskie brought to public service. 
The Congress and the American people will deeply miss Lee Hamilton's wisdom, sound judgment, and the 30 years of dedicated and independent representation he gave to his fellow Hoosiers. These values were tangibly evidenced in Lee Hamilton's acceptance speech which demonstrated why he is one of the most respected and listened to Members of Congress. His plain Hoosier common sense and high standards of public service have well served the Nation.

Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from North Dakota is making an extremely important point. The assumption is trade, by definition, is good; but the focus is all on exports and not on the balance of trade. 
This is what has happened to our trade balance since 1975. You can see this incredible deterioration that has taken place. We are running negative trade deficits year in and year out. And the consequence of doing this, I say to my distinguished colleague, is this is what has happened to the American net foreign investment position. 
The United States, in 1980, was a creditor nation to the tune of about $400 billion. In other words, we had claims on others. We were a creditor nation. And now that has deteriorated so that the United States now, when we add in what the trade imbalance will be this year, will be about a $1 trillion debtor nation. We have 
gone from being the world's largest creditor nation to being the world's largest debtor nation. And then everyone comes along and says, `Well, no one wants to focus on this issue. No one wants to pay any attention to it.' 
I mean, the Senator from North Dakota has been absolutely right. He said, `Look, there are two sides to this thing. There are your exports and there are your imports.' Yes, we are getting additional exports, but we are getting far more imports. 
As we get these imports, and we get this deterioration in our trade balance--look at that. Since World War II, we have been running a positive trade balance, modest but positive, year in and year out. And this is the deterioration that has taken place in it over the last 20 years. 
And, of course, each year we run these large trade deficits --$100 billion, $150 billion, $120 billion trade deficits year after year after year. It is offset somewhat by the service, but not enough. I mean, the net is reflected in this chart, which is not quite as bad as the previous level but still shows us year after year showing these deficits. 
The consequence of that--these amount to about $1.5 trillion over that period of time. We have been running a trade balance deficit since 1975 of $1.5 trillion. And the consequence of doing that is that our net asset position is absolutely deteriorating. 
Look at this chart. This is what has happened. This is the U.S. net foreign investment position. In 1980, before we got this tremendous decline, we were a creditor nation, the world's largest creditor nation; in other words, others owed us. And now we are the world's largest debtor nation. And by the end of this year, it will be to the tune of $1 trillion--$1 trillion. 
Now, you cannot go on doing this indefinitely. You can do it for a period of time, but you cannot do it indefinitely. In any event, the whole time you are doing it, we are taking on an increase in volume of foreign indebtedness through these large and persistent trade deficits--the losses sustained every year by buying more goods from others than they are buying from us. 
And we are undercutting the Nation's capacity for mass consumption by declining wages and loss of high-income employment. As the Senator from North Dakota said, they said, `Well, your consumers can buy cheaper products.' But then the question is, `Well, suppose they're not working? Suppose they've been thrown out of a job by these importations?' They can't buy anything. They can't buy anything.

Mr. SARBANES. That is right. We are not driving the right trade bargains. Something is wrong with a trade policy that gives you this deterioration in your net foreign investment position. Something is wrong with a trade policy that takes the United States, in less than 20 years, from being the largest creditor nation in the world, in other words, people owe us, and in 20 years makes the United States the largest debtor nation in the world. Something is wrong. 
The Senator is absolutely right to focus on it. Everyone says, `Well, we succeeded in selling $3 billion worth of airplanes to China on this visit that they had.' Our trade imbalance with China is over $40 billion and increasing all the time. It is increasing all the time. It may soon surpass the trade deficit 
with Japan. The consequence is that we are selling to them far less--far, far, far less--than they are selling to us.

Mr. SARBANES. `Consider' is not the right word. They do not say, `We would like you to consider.' The Washington Post ran an article just the other week, and here is the heading of the article: `China Plays Rough. Invest and Transfer Technology or No Market Access.' And that article then described how China forces U.S. companies to transfer jobs and technology as a price for getting export sales. So, in effect, what they say is, `We won't take any of your exports if you don't give us the investment and the technology so we can then produce them ourselves.' 
So what are our people doing? In order to get these short-run exports, they give away the capacity to maintain a long-run position. And the Chinese, in effect, extract that capacity out of them. So, yes, they make a short-run purchase, but at the same time they are getting the investment and technology so they do not have to make long-run--not only will they not make long-run purchases, but, mark my word, they will be exporting these products themselves elsewhere in the world. 
Not only will they, in effect, close our people out from getting into the Chinese market; they will become their competitors in other markets on the basis of the investment and the technology that our people transferred to China in order to get these short-term sales. 
That is exactly what is going to happen. And the consequence of that is our trade position will continue to deteriorate, and we will go on to become an even bigger debtor nation.

Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely on point. 
Just let me read you two quotes from two very able authors. One is Benjamin Friedman, who is a professor of economics at Harvard, and his book called `Day of Reckoning.' 
I again want to go back and emphasize the fact that we have gone from being the world's largest creditor nation to now being the world's largest debtor nation. This is the deterioration that has taken place in the U.S. net foreign investment position. 
This is what Professor Friedman says about that: 
World power and influence have historically accrued to creditor countries. It is not coincidental that America emerged as a world power simultaneously with our transition from a debtor nation, dependent on foreign capital for our initial industrialization, to a creditor nation supplying investment capital to the rest of the world. But we are now a debtor again, and our future role in world affairs is in question. People simply do not regard their workers, their tenants and their debtors in the same light as their employers, their landlords and their creditors. Over time, the respect and even deference that America has earned as world banker will gradually shift to the new creditor countries that are able to supply resources where we cannot, and America's influence over nations and events will ebb. 
That is the big issue that is behind all of this. That is the issue we really ought to be debating. The whole direction in which--everyone comes out here and says--you know, I listened to the President yesterday. He said, `We've got trade.' I will not quarrel with that. `I'm trying to negotiate good trade agreements with other countries.' 
But look what is happening to us. We have had this incredible deterioration in our trade balance and this represents $1.5 trillion dollars of deficits over the last 20 years. This is what has happened to our net foreign investment position. 
This is a devastating chart when you think about what it has done to the United States. William Wolman, chief economist at Business Week, had this to say, and it ties right in with the Senator's comments about economic growth, `The Implication of Debtor State for U.S. Economic Growth.' 
The transformation of the United States from a major international creditor to an international debtor has major implications for future United States economic growth. It is no accident that back in the 1950's and 1960s when the United States was a creditor nation interest rates were lower here than they were abroad and the dollar was a strong currency. But since the United States has become a debtor nation U.S. interest rates are higher than those in the other industrial countries, and the dollar, despite its revival in 1996, has become a weak currency. The effect is, of course, to squeeze the average American standard of living both because Americans are forced to pay high real interest rates for what they borrow and because a weak dollar means that America must produce and export more goods to earn foreign currencies than it had to when the dollar was a stronger currency. Debtor status has the same effect on a country as on citizens of that country. What is in effect the disposable income of the United States is under downward pressure, just as surely as the disposable income of its highly indebted citizens. 
You can't get people to focus on this. Trade has two sides to it: What you export and what you import. If you import more than you export, you will be running trade deficits. If you are running trade deficits, that means people abroad are accumulating claims against us that we have to pay off over time. So we have now gone from being a creditor country to being the world's largest debtor country. We continue to be a world power but how long can you sustain that position? It is not as though we have stopped the hemorrhaging. 
If we run a $125 billion trade deficit, our net position will deteriorate another $125 billion. This line will continue to go down as long as we are running a negative trade debt. Suppose we cut it in half, suppose we reduce it from $120 billion to $60 billion, which would be a terrific accomplishment. Say you do that in a year's time, you reduce it from $120 billion to $60 billion, the net position deteriorates another $60 billion, another $60 billion. The next year you cut it to $30 billion, it deteriorates another $30 billion. We are getting ourselves deeper and deeper into the hole. We can't get anyone to focus on this. 
The distinguished Senator from North Dakota I think has brought our attention back to an exceedingly important point, and I thank him very much for yielding to me to make these points.

Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. When you talk about trade you have to talk about trade balance. Now, we ran a trade balance from the end of World War II until 1975. We were exporting a little more than we were importing. The imports that were coming in were causing dislocation in our economy, no question about it. But at the same time we were gaining a plus from the exports. In fact, there were a little more exports than there were imports. 
What has happened, as the Senator from South Carolina points out, we are now importing far, far, far more than we are exporting. In fact, as he points out with respect to trade goods it has been an almost $2 trillion deficit since 1975. Everyone comes along and says, `Look, we have a little more exports.' Look at how many more imports we have. All of those imports are costing people jobs. So the displacement of jobs taking place by the increase in imports far, far, far exceeds the additional jobs gained from the expansion of exports. 
That is what people have to understand and they are not understanding it. To the extent we run these trade deficits then we end up losing our position as a creditor nation. 
This is a devastating chart, showing the United States in a creditor position in 1980, and look what has happened to us. We have come down just like this, and by the end of the year we will be at $1 
trillion deficit debtor status. Debtor status, $1 trillion, the United States. In 1980, less than 20 years ago, we were in a creditor status to the tune of $400 billion. So there has been an almost $1.5 trillion deterioration in our international position in less than 20 years. It is the very thing the Senator from South Carolina is talking about.

Mr. SARBANES. The American market is still the most lucrative market in the world. They want access into the American market. 
I cannot accept for a moment in these bilateral dealings, countries won't negotiate a trade agreement with the President which could then be submitted to the Congress for the Congress to consider, to amend if it deemed it advisable, and to vote on. We have done that consistently, as the Senator pointed out, including the telecommunications agreement, a very complicated measure. We do it in arms control agreements. They are open to amendment and are a far more serious matter than a trade agreement. 
I want to say one other thing to the Senator because he talked about the Chinese getting the investment and the plants in their own country, and he uses the example that occurred in Brazil. The Chinese don't make any bones about it. They don't like to conceal it. The Washington Post had an article last week, and here is the heading to the article, `China Plays Rough: Invest and Transfer Technology or No Market Access.' Invest and transfer technology or no market access. 
The article went on to describe how China forces United States companies to transfer jobs and technology as a price for getting exports sales. They say, `We will take the exports but you have to give us the investment and the technology,' and that means in the future they won't take other exports because they won't need them. They will have the investment and the technology to produce the goods themselves, and I predict not only will they do it for themselves they will then be producing and selling them internationally, and they will go from being an importer of American high-technology products to being an exporter themselves of high-technology products from the investment technology that we are compelled to give to them.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to get into the Record the figures that underlie this chart on the deterioration in the U.S. net foreign investment position. 
In 1976, the United States had a $180 billion positive net position. We were a creditor nation, to the extent of $180 billion. That rose until, in 1980, it hit its peak at just under $400 billion. That is net. That is in our favor, $400 billion. Since 1980, that has begun to deteriorate, as we can see. It crossed into the minus figures in 1986, at minus $13 billion. In 1986, 11 years ago, we were at $13 billion minus. Since then, it has come down and we were at $870 billion in 1996, and it is estimated that the 1997 figures will go to $1 trillion in debt, in a debtor position. 
This is incredible that, in just over 10 years, we have gone from balance in our net foreign investment position to a $1 trillion debtor position. I mean, we have been adding it at the rate of $100 billion, $120 billion, and $150 billion a year because of what happened to our trade balance, which the able Senator from South Carolina pointed out. So we have now come down to the point where we are $1 trillion in a debtor position--the world's largest debtor country. 
Now, these are the issues we ought to be addressing. Fast track doesn't begin to address that issue. All fast track is trying to do is get the Congress to give up its right to review these agreements. Everyone says, well, we ought to do that. Look at how we have been doing on the trade front. Well, how have we been doing on the trade front? Look at this deterioration over the last 20 years. By coincidence--perhaps not so much by coincidence--ever since we started doing fast track, we started getting deterioration in the trade balance, year after year. I think these trade agreements need to be brought back to the Senate to give us a chance to review them. If they had to come back here and be reviewed, not on a `take all or nothing' basis, which, of course, is a loaded deck because as soon as that happens, then the argument they make to you is not economic; it is political. 
If the President negotiates a trade agreement, let's say, with Chile, and then he brings it to the Congress on fast track, all or nothing, then we start asking economic questions about the trade agreement. We say, well, you know, this balance here doesn't seem to work. You don't open up their market the way you should and so forth. The next thing they say to you is, oh, well, we have to approve it; otherwise, the political relationship will go to pieces. That is what we were told on the Mexico agreement. We had debate on the floor of the Senate, and piercing remarks were made about the economics of that Mexican agreement and how it would not work and how disadvantageous it was. Well, then the argument shifted in order to try to push it through. The administration didn't talk anymore about the economics of it; they started talking about the politics of it. They said: Well, Mexico is our next-door neighbor. If we don't approve this trade agreement, we will have a crisis in our relationship. 
In effect, that was probably true. But that's the argument that then is used, not the economic argument. So I think these agreements ought to be brought to the Senate. We ought to have a chance to amend them, if we choose to do so, not give away or derogate our authority in that important regard. Frankly, I think if the agreements have to come to the Senate in that form, they are going to negotiate tougher agreements. 
If the administration knows that those agreements are going to be submitted to the Congress and subject not only to the up-or-down vote of the Congress, but also subject to amendment, they are going to have to negotiate a much tighter agreement that will withstand scrutiny. And I think it will achieve a better balance, a better 
balance between our opportunity to go into the other countries' markets and their opportunity to come into our market because, clearly, what has been happening for the last 20 years is that our market has been opened up far more than other nations have reciprocated.

Mr. SARBANES. It says: 
For years mainstream economists and economic journalists explained away public concern over the U.S. trade deficit by arguing the true cause of the deficit was the huge U.S. Federal budget deficit and, more recently, low U.S. savings. 
Exactly the argument the Senator from New York has just made. 
However, a new study released today by the Economic Strategy Institute refutes these traditional explanations and argues they are no longer adequate to explain what is, in reality, a significantly more complex problem negatively affecting a wide variety of economic statistics, including aggregate demand, gross domestic product, the budget deficit, business-financed research and development, wage rates, and exchange rates. 
And then it goes on in effect to say that this traditional analysis is really simplistic; it doesn't really answer the situation. It is almost dismissive of any trade deficit problem. In fact, if you look at the movements here, there is not a direct correlation between the various factors the Senator talked about. I mean you have a decline in the goods trade balance here at the time the trade deficit is still going up.

Mr. SARBANES. Since 1974, our trade deficit on merchandise goods is $1.8 trillion. In just over 20 years, $1.8 trillion. Up until 1975 we had been running modest surpluses every year in our merchandise trade deficit. So there has been a dramatic deterioration.

Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further? To the extent there are such investments, those then become claims which foreigners hold against us. So what has happened is we have gone from being a creditor nation in 1980, where we were a creditor nation to the tune of $400 billion, to today where we are a debtor nation to the tune of $1 trillion. So, because they sell more to us than we sell to them, they build up claims against us and we become a debtor. Now we are the biggest debtor nation in the world.

Mr. SARBANES. First, I want to commend the very able Senator from Rhode Island for a very thorough and thoughtful analysis of the issues surrounding this legislation. Obviously, a great deal of work went into that statement, and I think the distinguished Senator touched on a number of very important and critical issues. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the motion to proceed to S. 1269. This legislation would provide trade agreement approval procedures, so-called fast-track procedures, for implementing the results of trade agreements that require changes in U.S. law. 
In my view, this is a poorly conceived piece of legislation that does not serve the interests of the American people. 
First, let me observe the fast-track procedures are relevant only to a narrow range of trade agreements, specifically, those agreements which require Congress to make changes in existing U.S. law in order for the agreements to be implemented. 
Most trade agreements do not require legislative changes and, therefore, fast track consideration would in effect be inapplicable to them. 
It is my understanding, for example, that the Clinton administration has negotiated over 220 trade agreements. Only two required fast-track authority--NAFTA and the GATT Uruguay round agreement. 
So let me just observe at the outset that there is a great deal of overstatement going on as to the importance of fast-track authority to the administration's ability to negotiate trade agreements and open foreign markets to U.S. exporters. 
The fact is that for the overwhelming majority of trade agreements, fast-track authority is not needed. And based on its own record, the administration has concluded a large number of such trade agreements without fast-track authority--not under fast-track authority. 
The question then becomes, for the narrow range of trade agreements that will require legislative action by the Congress, because the trade agreement reached requires a change in U.S. law, what is the appropriate role for the Congress in approving those agreements? 
Now, article II, section 8 of the Constitution explicitly grants Congress the authority `To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations . . .' 
The authority of Congress to approve trade agreements is unquestioned. And it is very clearly spelled out in the Constitution. So the issue is simply, how should the Congress best exercise this authority? 
I want to go back just a little bit historically and trace some of the evolution of trade negotiating authority in order to bring us to set the current situation in context. 
As many have observed, up until a couple of decades ago, most trade agreements dealt with setting tariffs on traded goods. 
Up until 1930, Congress passed occasional tariff acts that actually set tariff terms. However, Congress became increasingly reluctant to set tariff schedules in legislation. And in 1934, in the Reciprocal Trade Act--I emphasize the word `reciprocal' --the Reciprocal Trade Act, Congress granted to the President for the first time so-called proclamation authority, the power to set tariffs by executive agreement with U.S. trading partners. 
But that was a power with respect to the setting of tariffs that was limited, specifically limited within certain limits and for fixed periods of time. 
From the 1930's through the 1960's, Congress extended the 1934 act authorizing the President to negotiate reductions in U.S. tariffs in exchange for comparable reductions by U.S. trading partners. 
Congress would typically limit how much tariffs could be reduced. In other words, we would set the range below which the administration could not go. We would give a range how long negotiations could go on, and the Congress even exempted specific products from the negotiations. But once the reductions were negotiated within the range that the Congress had established, the President then issued an order proclaiming the new tariffs and trade agreements between 1934 and 1974 were negotiated pursuant to this authority. 
Now, during the 1960's, trade talks began to expand into nontariff trade areas that were governed by existing U.S. law; in other words, the trade talks began to involve matters that were not tariff matters but matters that were covered by our law. The Kennedy round GATT negotiations, for example, required for the first time changes to U.S. antidumping laws. We had antidumping laws on the books. The negotiated agreement required changes in those antidumping laws. The Congress made clear at that time that the executive branch had to obtain authority from the Congress to change a U.S. law in a trade agreement. The executive branch can't go and negotiate a trade agreement and simply by signing off on the trade agreement change an existing law without the approval of the Congress. 
Now, proclamation authority for the President, which had been used in the reciprocal trade agreements for tariffs, did not extend to authority to proclaim all changes to U.S. law called for in a trade agreement. 
Fast track was a procedure first enacted by Congress in the Trade Act of 1974 to deal with trade agreements that called for changes in U.S. law. What fast track provided for was a commitment by the Congress before the negotiations started that whenever an agreement came back from the trade negotiations, the executive branch could write legislation implementing the trade agreement and have that legislation voted on by the Congress without any opportunity to change or amend it. In other words, it had to be voted as presented by the administration. Only 20 hours of debate are allowed and a floor vote must take place within 60 days after the legislation is submitted. 
Now, since its initial enactment, fast-track authority has been utilized for five trade agreements: The GATT Tokyo round agreement of 1979; the United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement of 1985; the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement of 1988; the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, 1993; and the GATT Uruguay round of 1994. Fast-track authority expired in December 1994 at the conclusion of the Uruguay round and has not been extended since, and the Congress is now confronting that question. 
Now, over that same period of time, hundreds of trade agreements were reached by U.S. administrations. Hundreds of agreements were reached. Other countries were prepared to enter into them, and they did not require fast track and were not submitted under fast-track authority to the Congress. 
Now, in examining this grant of authority, I first want to differ with one of the assertions that is made by its supporters that the executive branch would not be able to negotiate trade agreements if those agreements were subject to amendment by the Congress. That is the argument that is made. Unless we have this authority, we won't be able to negotiate agreements. As I have already indicated, the vast majority of trade agreements do not require changes to U.S. law and do not utilize fast-track procedures, and the successive administrations have been able to negotiate such agreements without any apparent significant difficulty. 
Now, the very idea that the Congress should, in effect, delegate to the executive branch the authority to write changes in U.S. law and not have those changes subject to modification or amendment by the Congress represents an extraordinary grant of 
authority by the Congress to the Executive. My very distinguished colleague, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, spoke to this issue eloquently earlier in this debate, pointing out what a derogation of authority this represents from the legislative to the executive branch. 
It is my own view that if changes are going to be made in U.S. statutes, those changes ought to be subject to the scrutiny of the Congress and amendment by the Congress. That is the role the Congress is given under the Constitution. Failure to provide for that congressional role, for that discipline, may leave the American people without any recourse to change unwise agreements entered into by the Executive. 
Who is to say that all of the particular decisions made by the Executive in reaching an agreement are the right ones, or that the balance struck by the Executive is the right one? Is the Congress, then, simply to have to take this package and consider it as an all-or-nothing proposition? That is not what the Constitution calls for, and I don't think Congress ought to be delegating this authority. 
I recognize that a stronger case can be made for the availability of fast-track authority to approve large multilateral trade agreements involving well over 100 countries, like the Uruguay round of the GATT and bilateral trade agreements like NAFTA. There is a plausible argument that concluding such multilateral agreements might be complicated by the ability of individual countries, then, to make legislative changes in the agreement. That argument has been asserted and, on occasion, recognized by Members of the Congress. However, I point out that argument loses any persuasive weight when only two or a few countries are involved in the trade agreement. This legislation makes no such distinction between multilateral and bilateral trade agreements and would provide fast track for both. 
It is worth noting that all major U.S. tax, arms control, territorial, defense, and other treaties are done through normal constitutional congressional procedures. We negotiated an arms control agreement with the Soviet Union. What can be more important? It is submitted to the Senate for approval. The Senate has the authority, if it chooses to do so, to amend that agreement. There is no fast track on an agreement far more important than trade agreements, involving the national security of our country, where they say to the Senate, `You must approve this arms control agreement exactly as it was negotiated by the administration, and you can only vote for it or against it.' We have never accepted that. 
The argument will be made at the time, `Don't amend it because we don't want to have to go back and have to renegotiate,' but clearly our power to amend it is recognized and it is submitted to us under those terms. 
Now, if the agreement can withstand the scrutiny as to why it ought not to be amended, then it should not be amended. But to bind ourselves in advance that we will only vote it up or down, without the opportunity to amend it, is to give away a tremendous grant of legislative authority. 
Among the nontrade treaties done under regular procedures during the 1970's, 1980's and 1990's are the Nuclear Weapons Reduction Treaty, SALT I, SALT II, START, Atmospheric Test Ban Treaty, Biological Weapons Convention, the Customs Harmonization Convention, dozens of international tax treaties, Airline Landings Rights Treaty, Convention on International Trade and Endangered Species, Montreal protocol, Ozone Treaty, and on and on and on and on. 
No one said at the time that the Congress can only consider these to vote yes or no, without the power and authority to amend them; and no one said that unless you give us such a grant of authority, we won't be able to negotiate these treaties. 
Now let's turn for a moment and examine the question of what benefits have we received from this extraordinary grant of authority to the executive embodied in the fast-track procedures. The fact of the matter is--and I am not necessarily asserting that, because the time period corresponds, the whole cause was fast-track authority--but since fast-track authority was first granted by the Trade Act of 1974, there has been a sharp deterioration in the U.S. balance of trade with the rest of the world. During the period 1945 to 1975, the United States generally enjoyed a positive balance of trade with the rest of the world, running for most of the time a modest surplus. Since then, the U.S. balance of trade has sharply declined. 
Now, I first want to show a chart that shows the merchandise trade, goods traded. 
What this chart shows, Mr. President, is this. It begins back in the late 1940's and it comes through to the present day. This is our merchandise trade deficit. We ran a modest but positive balance throughout the 1940's, 1950's, 1960's, and into the 1970's. Here about 1975, this trade balance begins to deteriorate, and it's now down here at $200 billion a year. In fact, from 1948 until 1970, we had a positive merchandise trade balance in each and every year. In 1971 and 1972, we had a slight minus, but it was back positive in 1973, minus in 1974, positive in 1975; and since 1975, every year we have had a negative merchandise trade balance. We have been in deficit on our merchandise trade balance. 
Listen to the numbers. I will just take a few of them. It was $28 billion in 1977. In 1984, it jumped to $106 billion. It was $152 billion in 1987. It dropped back down; it was down to $84 billion in 1992. It went back up. In the last 4 years, it was $115 billion, $150 billion, $158 billion, and $168 billion--negative trade deficits. 
Now, this incredible deterioration in the merchandise trade balance was offset somewhat--by no means anywhere near entirely, but it was offset somewhat, to give a full picture--by an improvement in our services trade balance. Again, that had run in balance more or less all the way, and we have had an improvement here, as you can see, over the last few years. 
The total trade deficits--in other words, adding the two together--however, continues to show a deterioration in the U.S. economic position. This is what has happened to the total trade balance. We are running along here more or less with a positive balance, and then we have had this deterioration in the trade balance. During the first 9 months of 1997, the United States has been running a trade deficit that is outpacing the 1996 rate. The cumulative U.S. trade deficit from 1974 to 1996, according to the Congressional Research Service, is $1.8 trillion. Let me repeat that. The cumulative U.S. trade deficit from 1974 to 1996 is $1.8 trillion. The cumulative current account deficits, when you offset the surface improvement during that period, is $1.5 trillion. 
We are running these enormous deficits. This is what we ought 
to be debating. One argument to turn down this fast-track authority is in order to precipitate a national debate on what our trade policy ought to be and what our trade position is. We have been running these huge trade deficits year in and year out. I defy anyone to assert that that is a desirable thing to do--to run trade deficits of the kind and magnitude that we are talking about here--$1.5 trillion over the last 22 years. 
What these mounting trade deficits have done, which have persisted over this 20-year period, is they have resulted in the accumulation of U.S. foreign debt obligations that will approach $1 trillion by the end of this year--$1 trillion in foreign debt obligations. The fact of the matter is that our trade deficits over the last 15 years have moved the United States from being the largest creditor nation in the world in 1981 to being the largest debtor nation in the world in 1996. And this debtor status is continuing to deepen. Let me repeat that. These large trade deficits that we have run successively over the last 20 years have moved the United States from being the largest creditor nation in the world in 1981 to being the largest debtor nation in the world in 1996. Just think of that. We have gone from being the largest creditor nation to being the largest debtor nation. And then everyone is saying that the trade policy is a source of great strength. How can it be a source of great strength when we are getting deeper and deeper into the hole as a debtor? 
This development has raised concerns about the ability of the United States to finance the debt. These are claims that foreigners hold on us. For example, Lester Thurow, in his recent book `The Future of Capitalism' wrote:  
No country, not even one as big as the United States, can run a trade deficit forever. 
Money must be borrowed to pay for the deficit, and money must be borrowed to pay interest on the borrowings. Even if the annual deficit does not grow, interest payments will grow until they are so large that they cannot be financed. At some point world capital markets will quit lending to Americans and Americans will run out of assets foreigners want to buy. 
Now, I am not suggesting that all of the blame for this ought to be laid on fast-track authority. There is a complex factor. But what I am suggesting is that contrary to the constant assertions, it cannot be shown by the statistics that fast-track authority has had a positive impact on the U.S. balance of trade. That is what we should be debating. We ought to be debating why is this happening? What can be done about it? What does it do to the United States to become the world's largest debtor country? 
Now, in many respects the assertion that fast track is needed in order to resolve some of our trade problems, I think, misses the mark. Let me give you a very clear example. The United States bilateral trade deficit with China in 1996 was $40 billion, second only to our trade deficit with Japan, and that trade deficit is continuing to deteriorate in 1997. In other words, the figures for 1997 will be more than the $40 billion figure for the 1996 trade deficit with China. Resolving our trade deficit with China does not require fast-track procedures. It requires a determined effort by our Government to address the type of problem described in a recent Washington Post article entitled, `China Plays Rough: Invest and Transfer Technology or No Market Access.' 
`China Plays Rough: Invest and Transfer Technology or No Market Access.' 
That article describes how China forces United States companies to transfer jobs and technology as a price for getting export sales. That is the so-called offsets issue. Of course, what we are doing is to gain a temporary, momentary advantage we are giving away the long run. In other words, because of this requirement, companies come in. In order to get some exports now, they transfer the technology and make the investments in China which will guarantee that they will get no exports in the future. And the Chinese are requiring that as part of the trade negotiation. 
Those are the kinds of issues we ought to be addressing here. That is a serious issue. And that has very severe and consequential long-term implications. 
The ongoing deterioration in the international position of the United States should raise fundamental questions about our trade posture. I defy anyone to look at these charts and this movement in terms of our trade balance and not conclude that we are facing a serious problem here. 
I am frank to tell you, I think those agreements ought to come to the Congress and let the Congress scrutinize them. The Executive makes these agreements. They develop the package. They do all the tradeoffs. They say, if it goes to the Congress, there will be all kinds of tradeoffs, as if there are no tradeoffs downtown, as if the Executive is not engaged in all sorts of tradeoffs. Who is to say that their tradeoffs better serve the public national interests of the country than the judgments or decisions that Congress would make? 
Recently, Kenneth Lewis, the retired chief executive of a shipping company in Portland, OR, and a member of the Presidential Commission on United States Pacific Trade and Investment Policy, wrote an article in the New York Times. In that article, he called for a significant dialog on U.S. trade policy and the establishment of a permanent commission charged with developing plans to end in the next 10 years our huge and continuing trade deficits. In fact, Senators Byrd and Dorgan and I have sponsored legislation to establish such a commission. In his article Mr. Lewis wrote:  
Full discussion is needed on questions like: What is the purpose of our trade policy and what do we want our domestic economy to look like? Who gains and who loses, and to what extent, from the increases in exports and the greater increases in imports? 
The greater increases in imports, what this chart says. See, everyone comes in, and they say, well, we are going to be able to increase our exports. Everyone says, well, that's a wonderful thing. No one looks at the other side of the ledger, which is this incredible increase which has taken place in imports and, therefore, the deteriorating economic position of the United States as we run these very large trade deficits--$1.5 trillion deficits since 1974, and because of that the United States, which has been the world's largest creditor nation into the 1970's--and we even survived up to 1980 because we had a creditor position before it was worked down. Eventually it was worked down. At the end of this year we will be a $1 trillion debtor, with every indication that it will continue on out into the future--continue on out into the future. 
Let me go back to this quote from Mr. Lewis: 
Full discussion is needed on questions like: What is the purpose of our trade policy and what do we want our domestic economy to look like? Who gains and who loses, and to what extent, from the increases in exports and the greater increases in imports? Do American workers benefit, or only consumers and investors? What conditions must exist--concerning human rights, workers rights, or environmental protections--for us to allow other nations' goods to enter our country? 
These strike me as the fundamental questions that we are failing to ask about our trade policy, and fast track is not an answer to any of those questions. What we really should do here is not do the fast track. Launch a major debate on our trade policy, a major examination of the trade figures and a major consideration of why the United States is running these large trade deficits. I defy anyone to come to the floor and suggest that running these large trade deficits is to our national interest, that that is a positive situation. It is clearly not a positive situation. 
Throughout this whole period we ran modest but positive trade balances. In fact, many have said that the United States purposely tried to hold down its positive trade balances in order to help the rest of the world develop subsequent to World War II. So we ran these modest but positive trade balances, and beginning in the mid-1970's--coincidentally, as I said, about the time we started doing fast-track authority--we began to get this deterioration. That's in the overall trade balance. 
In the merchandise trade balance, the deterioration was absolutely dramatic, as I have indicated earlier. We just had an incredible deterioration in the goods balance, as we can see by this chart here. This is about a $1.8 trillion deterioration in the trade. Now, it is somewhat offset a bit by the improvement in the service balance. But the net figure comes out to show this figure on total trade balance.

Mr. SARBANES. Now we are at a trillion. Each year, if you add $100 billion, $125 billion, $150 billion, if you run a deficit that year at $100 billion to $150 billion, that is another $100 billion or $150 billion you add to your debtor status. So, unless you get out of this status, you are continuing to worsen your position and get deeper and deeper into the hole. What it means to be in a debtor status is that others abroad have claims on us. When we were a creditor Nation we had claims on them. Now they have claims on us. I submit that is a weakening, that is a deterioration of the U.S. economic position. 
Then they will come along and say, `Well, the economy is working well.' The economy is working well now. There is no question about it. But the one thing we have not straightened out or addressed are these constant trade deficits which get us deeper and deeper into the hole. Others continue to finance us. But you wonder how long they are going to go on doing it. And even if they continue to do it, we nevertheless are more and more at their mercy. 
I mean we are depending on the good will of strangers, is what it amounts to, on the economic front. And I am just saying --now, if you didn't have fast track, would you correct it? Well, I don't know. At least the agreements would be subjected to a much closer scrutiny. In any event, we could turn our attention to finding out what the factors are that cause this.

Mr. SARBANES. I appreciate the comments of my distinguished colleague. 
Mr. President, I have one final point I want to make and that is on this matter of protection for workers' rights, health and safety standards, and environmental standards. 
Actually, in many respects, this legislation is weaker than the legislation which last reauthorized fast track in 1988 in these areas. The administration has come in today with a number of so-called initiatives and I am sure we will see more tomorrow, more the next day, and so forth. But, as I read them, none of those initiatives go right to the heart of the fast-track negotiating process in terms of what the negotiating goals should be. Let me just point out that under this legislation, we drastically limit the extent to which workers' rights, health and safety standards, and environmental protection are addressed in the principal negotiating objectives of the fast-track authority. The fast-track authority sets out principal negotiating objectives. And it is those objectives that describe the subject matter of trade agreements which are covered by fast-track procedure. 
My very able colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, made this point in a very careful and thoughtful way. The bill states that the principal negotiating objectives with respect to labor, health and safety, or environmental standards only include foreign government regulations and other government practices, `including the lowering of or derogation from existing labor, health and safety or environmental standards for the purpose of attracting investment or inhibiting U.S. exports.' 
`The lowering of or derogation from existing * * * standards. * * *' Thus the bill would not allow for fast track-consideration of provisions to improve labor, environmental and health and safety standards in other countries. It, in effect, says they can't lower it. But it says nothing about improving it. And one of the problems, of course, that we face is that environmental standards, workers' standards, health and safety standards in other countries are completely inadequate and we are in that competitive environment. 
The principal negotiating objectives, which are what the implementing legislation has to be limited to, leave no room for provisions that are outside a very narrow range, strictly needed to implement the trade agreement. So this provision, despite these assurances now which are coming in, all of which are unilateral assurances by the executive branch and not included in the negotiating objectives, would be included within the fast-track authority. So we are not even going to be able to start addressing this very serious and severe question about the discrepancy between workers' standards, environmental standards, and health and safety standards--between what exists in this country and what exists with a number of our competitors. 
What is the answer to that? Are we simply going to accept these lower standards, many of which result in lower costs, and then continue to experience these growing trade deficits? Are we going to lower our own standards, when clearly we put them into place because we perceive that they are necessary in order to deal with the sort of problems at which they are directed, when we are trying to get the rest of the world to come up not to go down? These are many of the questions that I think need to be addressed on the trade issue. 
Very quickly in summary, the fast-track authority represents a tremendous derogation of the power of the Congress. The Constitution gives us the power to regulate foreign commerce and we ought to exercise that power. We do very serious consequential arms control agreements that are open to amendment when they come to the floor of the Senate. We may not amend them. We may decide not to amend them. But we don't give away or forswear the power to do so. I don't see why we should give away or forswear that power when it comes to trade agreements. 
Of course we have had this incredible deterioration in our trade situation. That is the issue that ought to be addressed. It would serve everyone's purpose if we rejected the fast-track authority and then provoked or precipitated, as a consequence, a major national debate with respect to trade policy. It is constantly asserted--I understand the economic theory for free trade and I don't really differ with it, although I do submit to you that many of the countries with which we are engaged in trade are not practicing free trade. They are not playing according to the rules. They are manipulating the rules to their own advantage and to our disadvantage--witness these. In many instances the consequence of that is to contribute to these very large trade deficits. But those are the matters that we ought to be debating. We ought to have a full-scale examination of that and the Congress ought not to give away its ability to be a full partner in developing and formulating trade policy. This proposal that is before us, in effect, requires the Congress to give up a significant amount of its authority in reviewing trade agreements. I think, therefore, they don't get the kind of scrutiny which they deserve. 
The examination is always on one side. It says, we will get these additional exports. No one looks at what is going to happen on the import side and what the balance will be between the two. 
As a consequence of not examining the balance, we have had this incredible deterioration. We used to not do that. We used to have in mind the fact there was a balance and that it was important to us. We sought to sustain that balance, as this line indicates. We held that line for 25 years after World War II. Since then, we have gone into this kind of decline, and I, for one, think it is time to address that problem. I think the way to begin is not to grant this fast-track authority. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the pending measure overriding the line-item vetoes of the military construction appropriations bill. 
During last year's debate on the line-item veto legislation, I spoke at length--and I do not intend to do that again today--on how giving that authority to the President would strike a major blow against the intricate, carefully conceived system of checks and balances that the Framers of the Constitution crafted over 200 years ago and that has stood the Nation in such good stead ever since. 
With the line-item veto authority, the President needs only one-third plus one of either House of Congress, not even both Houses of Congress but either House, to negate legislation that the Congress has passed and the President has signed--I repeat, legislation that the Congress has passed and the President has signed. Then, after that process, the President can go back in and pull out those items he wants to cancel. 
In my view, giving such authority to the President cannot be done by statute, and I believe that the measure we passed last year is constitutionally deficient. I trust when it is finally determined by the courts they will agree. In the meantime, of course, we have to deal with the legislation. 
Furthermore, I simply want to point out that as a matter of policy, the line-item veto gives the Executive extraordinary power to determine the priorities of the Nation and to use that power, if he chooses to do so, to pressure Members of Congress on a whole range of other legislative issues. In other words, the Member is told, well, here is this item in this bill that is very important to your State, but on other matters on which I need your support--nominations, treaties, you name it.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, October has been designated National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, and I rise today to speak briefly about our need to continue our struggle against this national problem. 
Mr. President, over the past several years, the Congress, the Clinton administration, our State and local governments, and our community-based organizations have taken enormous steps toward eradicating the scourge of domestic violence--a scourge that for too long had been ignored as a family problem outside the scope of government responsbility. Congress' passage of the Violence Against Women Act [VAWA] as part of the 1994 crime bill, and the wide variety of enforcement and prevention grants available under that legislation, has ensured that our Federal, State, and local authorities have at their disposal the resources and legal authority needed to educate our citizens about domestic violence, and to prosecute those who have chosen to engage in such reprehensible conduct. The administration's development of informational initiatives, such as a toll-free nationwide domestic violence hotline and a Violence Against Women information homepage, have buttressed Congress' efforts, and provided law enforcement officials with a direct link to those who need assistance. 
My State of Maryland has been at the forefront of these national efforts to combat domestic violence. With the assistance of over $400,000 in grant funds made available under the 1994 crime bill, Maryland has formulated its Stop Violence Against Women plan, under which the State identifies cases of domestic abuse, safeguards victims, and coordinates and funds local community responses to incidents of domestic violence. To implement this plan, the Governor's office has established a statewide Family Violence Council, headed by Maryland's attorney general and Lieutenant Governor, which will continue to keep this issue in the public eye and to formulate additional initiatives in this area. 
The Federal authorities in Maryland have been no less vigilant in their efforts to combat domestic violence. Maryland's U.S. attorney's office has developed a specific training program for prosecutors on VAWA, has drafted a VAWA manual now available to local law enforcement and community groups, and is in the process of prosecuting only the second interstate stalking case brought under that law. 
In short, Federal, State, and local authorities in Maryland, as elsewhere, have embarked on a cooperative effort designed to educate our citizens about the plague of domestic violence, and to bring to justice those who violate our increasingly strict laws in this area. 
At the same time, Mr. President, we still have a long way to go before domestic violence is evicted from our homes and communities. Last year alone, almost 4 million women were physically abused by their husbands or boyfriends. Women continue to be the victims of domestic abuse more frequently than they are victims of burglary, muggings, and all other physical crimes combined. The damage done by such abuse extends directly to the most vulnerable in our society--our children, who are subject to abuse in 75 percent of the cases in which their mothers are subject to abuse. 
Mr. President, I have long supported efforts to stamp out domestic violence in our communities. I once again urge my colleagues to continue on the path on which we embarked in 1994, and to ensure continued full funding for VAWA in future years. I also urge my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to preserve the $10 million provided for community police to combat domestic violence in this year's Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations bill. This money, expressly authorized under the 1994 crime law, is essential if we are to address the domestic violence problem at its local, root level. 
While October is National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, no month should go by without our attention to this issue. Domestic violence is directly contrary to the community and family values we hold most dear, and its eradication should continue to be one of our most pressing national priorities.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased that the mark-to-market legislation that is incorporated in the VA-HUD conference report contains some measures that deal with properties that are disqualified from the restructuring program. I believe that it is critical that flexibility is provided to the participating administrative entity [PAE] and HUD in dealing with disqualified properties. I am, however, concerned about those properties that are not part of the mark-to-market program but are disqualified from the renewal process.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the VA-HUD conference report. This bill funds many important programs, programs that are crucial to America's veterans and to poor and working families struggling to attain the dream of home ownership or simply to find affordable rental housing. It will help ensure our Nation's environmental vitality, our Nation's health and scientific progress. The bill will maintain our commitment to the exploration of space. I commend the chairman, Senator Bond, and my good friend and colleague from Maryland, the ranking member, Senator Mikulski for their hard work to serve so many important needs with an ever-shrinking pot of money. 
I also appreciate their willingness to work with me, Senator D'Amato, Senator Mack, and Senator Kerry to include in this report important legislation designed to restructure HUD's portfolio of FHA-insured, assisted housing. This legislation is commonly known as the mark-to-market (MTM) legislation. Senator Mack, in particular, deserves credit for his tireless efforts to have this legislation included in the VA-HUD appropriations bill and for his willingness to work with the administration and the House authorizers to craft this final consensus. Again, I thank Senators Bond and Mikulski for their partnership in this important achievement. 
Mr. President, the mark-to-market legislation--title V of the appropriations bill--will save the American taxpayers billions of dollars. It will allow HUD, primarily through State and local partners, to squeeze excess rents down to supportable market levels. It will provide for funds to rehabilitate those properties that need capital investments. It will eliminate bad owners from the program. Most importantly, Mr. President, this legislation will help preserve hundreds of thousands of units of affordable housing for the foreseeable future. At a time when we are cutting back on the Federal commitment to build new affordable housing while simultaneously facing growing needs for such housing, the long-term commitment established by this legislation is truly a landmark achievement. 
In implementing this legislation, HUD will most often do the restructuring through a participating administrative entity, or PAE. The legislation clearly indicates that we expect that, with some exceptions, State or local housing finance agencies will act as the PAE. In fact, HUD has signed 14 management contracts with State housing finance agencies [HFA's] to implement the fiscal year 1997 MTM demonstration, which was based on the legislation in the current appropriations bill. The experience HFA's have in restructuring section 8 as a result of their participation in the demonstration, or in restructuring equivalent properties, along with their experience in FHA risk sharing, overseeing low-income housing tax credit deals, mortgage revenue bond deals, and in underwriting and managing market rate and assisted low-income multifamily housing, clearly makes the HFA's the most qualified candidates to be chosen as the PAE in most cases. In addition to all these financial engineering and management qualifications, the legislation requires the use of highly qualified HFA's because these public agencies have a public purpose and share with the Congress the commitment to preserve these projects as low-income housing far into the future. This factor was paramount in the decision to give the HFA's such a prominent role in the MTM process. 
At the same time, we gave the Secretary the discretion to make the final choice of PAE because we did not want the Secretary to be required to choose an unqualified housing finance agency to be a PAE. There will be thousands of projects and hundreds of thousands of units that will have to go through the restructuring process. In order to get this done in a timely and cost-effective way, the Secretary may have to reach out to more than one entity in a given area, or HUD may decide to do the restructurings itself. In all cases, however, the crucial decisions that have major impacts on the residents, the projects, or their surrounding communities, such as, for example, whether the assistance is to remain project-based or, in a few cases, may be turned into tenant-based, shall be made by a public agency with a public mission whose interest is to preserve affordable housing. 
In addition, the ongoing oversight of the projects, after restructuring is completed, will have to be in the hands of the public. This requirement can be satisfied by HUD doing the contract monitoring and oversight, or by contracting this function out to a State or local HFA. Again, this is a public trust, and the legislation requires that a public agency carry it out. 
The Congress clearly expects HFA's who seek the role of PAE to strengthen their applications by reaching out to other experienced parties, particularly non-profits with experience in real estate development and/or management and with deep roots in their communities, to develop partnerships. In addition, PAE's may want to find financial and other relevant experts to ensure that they present the best possible application to the Secretary. 
Mr. President, tenants, owners, HFA's, HUD, and the Congress all agree that the majority of the portfolio of affordable housing that will go through the MTM process should continue to have project-based section 8 assistance. For example, the legislation requires that elderly and disabled housing projects and housing in tight rental markets continue to receive project-based section 8 assistance. 
It is the clear intent of the Congress that we preserve the existing section 8 project-based portfolio of affordable housing to the greatest extent possible. To do this effectively, we expect the PAE's to continue to provide project-based assistance except in certain rare circumstances. The bill provides for the final decision to be taken only after consultation with owners, residents of the projects, local government officials, and other affected parties. Moreover, the PAE must take into consideration the availability of other affordable housing in the area, the ability of tenants to use vouchers successfully, the financial stability of the project, and other factors which, when taken as a whole, would lead a PAE to conclude that project-based assistance continues to be the best choice in most cases. 
Mr. President, in the course of the final negotiations to include the MTM legislation in the appropriations conference report, it was agreed to create an office within HUD to oversee the restructuring process. The office, called the Office of Multifamily Housing Assistance and Restructuring [OMHAR] will have a director that is appointed by the President and subject to Senate confirmation. The Congress clearly intends, as the legislation language states, that the Director will work under the Secretary, subject to the Secretary's direction and oversight. Section 573(d)(2) of the bill gives the Director the authority to report directly to the Congress, in certain circumstances, when the Director determines, in his discretion, such a report would be appropriate. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me reiterate a point also made by my colleagues regarding tenant participation in the restructuring process. It is our clear intent that HUD and the PAE's work with tenants in a meaningful and effective way with regard to all aspects of the restructuring process. This means timely access to relevant information, adequate time to analyze such information, the right to meet with the PAE, and the right to be included in physical inspections of the property, capital needs assessments, proposals to transfer the property, and other decisions that have significant impacts on the residents. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I strongly support the MTM provisions in the VA-HUD conference report, thank my colleagues for their hard work, and look forward to seeing this important Federal resource restored to sound financial and physical condition.

Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further for a question, I simply ask the Senator, in fact, my State is the second-highest traffic density on the urban interstates of any State in the Nation. You may be No. 1. Now, that makes a very important point. 
The purpose of the Federal Highway Program is to provide a high-quality road system. I understand the claim of donor States and I am not trying to minimize that. I think attention has to be paid to that. 
On the other hand, I always thought that the system was directed toward the system's needs. The purpose is to construct an interstate highway system that serves the entire country, and I think if you are going to have real equity in the distribution of highway funds you need to look at things like urban areas of highway traffic density, high volume of vehicle miles traveled per lane mile, other systems that indicate how heavily the infrastructure is being used. I understand in rural States they have a different kind of problem and we need to take account of that as well. 
One of my difficulties with this bill, and I ask the Senator whether it is the same, if he has the same perception, is that this aspect of developing an interstate highway system--of course, we built the system. Much of it now needs repair and rehabilitation

Mr. SARBANES. In my State, we have not yet finished the interstate system. We have some very pressing problems in the Western part of my State with respect to certain interchanges. It was not done the way it should have been done to begin with, and we now have to address that problem. 
I say to the Senator from New Jersey, I take it it is your perception, as well, that these considerations of system need and the needs of the heavily urban areas in which there is this very heavy, heavy traffic, have not been adequately addressed in this legislation.

Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further, I think he is addressing a very important point. 
Let me give an example from my State. Maryland has one of the highest density levels on urban interstate in the country, as I said before, second. Apparently, New Jersey is first. The Baltimore-Washington region interstates are the second most congested in the Nation. Now, my colleagues can appreciate this because they are here in Washington and they have some experience with this highway network I am talking about. 
We are in the center of the I-95 corridor, the north to south corridor. This corridor generates a huge amount of commercial and passenger traffic. It is adjacent to the Nation's Capital which generates additional commercial and personal through traffic. We are serving not just our own needs but national needs by having a first-rate interstate system here. In fact, we have a disproportionately large responsibility for complex infrastructure projects that need maintenance and rehabilitation. These projects--I-95, the Capitol beltway, the Baltimore beltway, I-70--all carry through traffic generated outside the State of Maryland. Now, there are other States along the eastern corridor--New Jersey is an obvious example--that are sort of through States. In other words, a lot of highway traffic is moving through those States, going from one point to another point, and neither point related to the State through which they are passing. 
Yes, we have to invest significant amounts of money, not only the Federal share that we receive, but State and local share as well, in order to maintain this highway network if we are going to maintain the existing infrastructure and have the efficient movement of freight and passenger traffic. 
Now, my perception of this bill is it does not adequately address that consideration, that that is one of the things that has not been focused on. 
The formula allocation represents a very significant drop for my State from 1.72 to 1.51. The amount of money now that is provided for the interstate discretionary program, as I understand it in this legislation, is severely limited. As I understand it, and I ask the Senator from New Jersey, there is only $140 million a year nationwide for both interstate highways and bridges, is that correct?

Mr. SARBANES. The amount that is divided among the States, as I understand it, is a formula allocation. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-sarbanes-md-7-19971008</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. SARBANES. I recognize there is a formula allocation. Here is the problem, and I am glad the Senator interjected because I think it is very important to focus on this problem. I understand the committee's problem. The committee had to do a formula allocation, Members are at them from all over the place, about the formula allocation. 
Now, I concur with the Senator from New Jersey, and I appreciate his continuing to yield to me for a question. We didn't know what the formula figure was going to be until the committee came out with the formula figure, and then we were presented with this formula figure. So we take a strong hit on the formula which I think does not adequately recognize the kind of transportation challenges with which we are confronted which have a national import. 
Now, in addition to the formula allocation, there are also other moneys that are available in the legislation--various discretionary programs. The interstate discretionary program is one, the public land highways is another, the Appalachian regional highway program is yet another, and there are others, as well, which can be used if the committee is saying to us we can't do the formula allocation in a way that takes into account all of these considerations. Then the least the committee should do is have these other programs which can then be used to offset the unfavorable impact of the formula allocations. It is my perception that that hasn't been done, as well. 
Now, we have one unique problem in my State that I want to bring to people's attention, and that is, the Federal Government owns the Woodrow Wilson Bridge; it is federally owned. It is the only facility on the interstate system in which that is the case. Now, the committee has provided $900 million, and that is certainly an important step forward, but it is barely over half of what would be required to get a new Woodrow Wilson Bridge, which every expert agrees is necessary. 
Now, the States have indicated that once a new bridge is done, they are willing to take over the responsibility of maintaining it from then on out. But it is clearly unfair to dump the responsibility upon them that was not met by the Federal Government. There is no way the States can pay for this thing. Maryland receives, under the formula allocation, a little over $300 million a year in Federal highway money. We are going to need, for one bridge, $1.6 to $1.8 billion, and this legislation provides $900 million. I think it is the Federal Government's responsibility, frankly, to deal with the problem of this bridge. They need to face up and deal with that problem. Once they have dealt with it, then it can be shifted over to State responsibility. But you ought not to dump this responsibility, which the Federal Government failed to meet, upon the State. So this is a whole list of the kind of problems we are talking about, which this legislation fails to come to grips with.

Mr. SARBANES. Well, I think we indicated that we understood the committee has done something. I am pointing out that it is not adequate to meet the problem. This is a pressing problem in the interstate system. The House approach would actually create a gaping hole in the interstate system. I think the committee recognized that problem at least. But, again, I am talking about this in the context of the other things that are happening in this legislation. If the committee came to me and said, look, we have to redo a formula allocation, we understand the problems it creates for you, we understand you have some other pressing highway needs, and we are trying to help you address those, but that hasn't happened. Any effort to try to get at that hasn't met with any success. 
I understand the committee has a difficult job and I, frankly, have been supportive of the effort to try to find more money with which the committee can work. I say to my friend from New Jersey, isn't it a fact that if more money were available, it would be easier to work out these problems?

Mr. SARBANES. My State has one of the Nation's great ports, the Port of Baltimore. 
Mr. President, the road network from that port to the West is critical for the commerce of the Nation--not just for the commerce of Maryland, but for the commerce of the Nation. A proper system of access for the movement of goods is extremely important to the economic health of the country. So all of this needs to be taken into account. We are on a major corridor for the movement of passengers and traffic north and south, and because of the port, we have a major corridor that goes to the Midwest that is critical for the economic activity in the Midwest. In many respects it is more critical for the economic activity in the Midwest than in my own State. Those things need to be considered in this legislation. 
The Woodrow Wilson Bridge that we talked about--and I think the chairman is right, they have certainly done a better job than they have done in the House. But we still have to get up to a point where we can do this bridge, and this level will not allow that to happen. That is a major link on the entire interstate highway system. Every expert who has examined it says the bridge needs to be replaced within the next 5 to 6 years. We have to move on that project. 
Those are items that could be addressed I think in this legislation. 
I also agree with the Senator from New Jersey. If you are going to start adjusting the formula in recognition of, let's say, population shifts, which is what the argument is that is being made, at the least--of course, I argue that you have to look at system needs in a much more significant way than I think has been done in this legislation. But leaving that to one side, at the very least, the transition period has to, in effect, cushion the impact of it so that States don't all of a sudden find themselves unable to carry through on committed transportation projects which are essential for the vitality of their economy. That is what the whole issue is that we are discussing here.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues' attention to a crime-fighting initiative implemented by the Baltimore City Police Department, in conjunction with the Federal Community Oriented Policing Services [COPS] Program created by the 1994 Crime Bill, and with American Telephone and Telegraph. This initiative--the 1-year anniversary of which was the first of this month--has contributed greatly to community policing efforts in Baltimore, and I believe holds great promise for the Nation at large. 
Like other major cities in America, Baltimore--our 12th largest city--has experienced over the past several decades a rapid rise in crime. One of the effects of this rise has been the increasing burden placed on the 911 emergency telephone system--a system which citizens regularly used to phone in not only emergency calls, but also criminal complaints of a nonemergency nature. In 1995 alone, the Baltimore Police Department fielded 1.7 million 911 calls. Such a volume made it increasingly difficult for the city's police to address in an expeditious manner those complaints that were truly of an emergency nature, and required the redeployment to the phone banks of officers who should have been on the city streets. 
In October 1996, the Baltimore City Police Department, aided by a $350,000 award from the COPS office, established a new telephone line for nonemergency calls. This 311 line is staffed by limited duty officers specifically trained to handle both emergency and nonemergency calls, and citizen understanding of the differences between the 311 and 911 lines has been heightened by an intensive public awareness campaign. 
Mr. President, this experiment has proven to be an unmitigated success. As a result of the implementation of the new 311 number, emergency calls to 911 have decreased by 25 percent, leaving Baltimore's police with more time to address in an expeditious manner true emergencies. In fact, statistics show that 911 operators now answer the phone on an average of 2 seconds, as compared to 6.5 seconds before the 311 line was set up, and that 80 percent fewer callers to 911 receive a message asking them not to hang up. In short, because of the 311 number, Baltimore's police can now respond immediately to situations that demand prompt action. 
Moreover, the reduction in 911 calls has allowed Baltimore's police to spend more time patrolling their beats, a consequence of which has been a declining crime rate in the city of 15 percent in fiscal year 1997, as opposed to an 11 percent decline in fiscal year 1996.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences [USUHS] as it celebrates 25 years of service to our country. It was on September 21, 1972 that Public Law 92-426 established USUHS to provide a corps of uniformed medical officers who would provide continuity and leadership for uniformed medicine in the United States. For 25 years, USUHS had remained our Nation's only military medical school, ensuring top-quality medical care to the men and women of our armed services. This institution has consistently produced first-rate career medical officers who excel in meeting the needs of military medicine and military readiness. 
USUHS provides a unique curriculum that contributes greatly to our military preparedness by providing knowledge that is vastly different from that taught in civilian medical schools. In fact, the American Medical Association [AMA] has recognized that training in military medicine mandates special course work and instruction not necessary in the civilian sector, and calls the existence of USUHS vital to the continued strength, morale and operational readiness of the military services. This specialized training includes trauma, mass casualties, combat surgery, medical logistics, nuclear medicine, tropical infectious diseases, and medical responses to terrorism. 
Following 18 graduations at the University, the total of USUHS School of Medicine [SOM] graduates is 2,470; the 2,276 active duty USUHS physicians represent 17 percent of the current physician force in the military medical system. Over the years, the university's graduates have consistently demonstrated a high level of performance during their various deployments in combat areas and in support missions, including Desert Storm and Somalia. This performance based upon their extensive military training has been validated by three Surgeons General, the American Medical Association and the Military Coalition, the Retired Officers Association, the National Association for Uniformed Services, and the American Legion, among others. 
It is also important to underscore the long-term commitment made by USUHS graduates to our armed services. Although USUHS graduates are required to serve 7 years of active duty beyond the time they devote to internships and residencies, the average time served is actually 18.5 years. Indeed, 85 percent of those graduates who have completed their initial service obligations and could leave active duty for the private sector remain on active duty in the Armed Forces where they often hold significant leadership and operational positions. For example, four USUHS-SOM graduates currently work directly for the President of the United States in medical support positions. That so many USUHS graduates have made a career of military medicine provides the continuity that is so critical to our military medical services. 
In addition to its original mandate, USUHS has further expanded its mission to meet the changing needs of the armed services. Additional programs provided by USUHS include the Graduate School of Nursing, recently granted full accreditation by the National League for Nursing, which prepares advanced practice nurses to deliver primary care and services to all eligible beneficiaries; the Graduate Medical Education Programs, established in 1986 to provide DOD-wide consultation on internships, residency, and fellowship training for physicians; the Graduate Education Program which has provided 444 students with graduate degrees in the basic medical sciences; and the Continuing Education for Health Professionals Program which facilitates the continued professional growth of health care professionals in the uniformed services and reduces DOD travel and other expenses by bringing medical training directly to the health care professional. 
For 25 years, this institution has consistently produced first-rate career medical officers who excel in meeting the needs of military medicine and military readiness. USUHS is a cost effective means of providing these uniquely trained physicians and deserves significant recognition of its accomplishments over its 25-year history in providing top-quality medical care.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 462, the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act of 1997. 
This bill is the culmination of months of hard work and careful consideration. It represents the collective wisdom of housing authority directors, public housing residents and resident organizations, local elected officials, and experts at HUD. As a result of this open, inclusive, and bipartisan process, this bill represents widespread agreement among stakeholders. 
I want to take a moment to extend my special thanks to Senator Mack for his hard work over the past 3 years to get us to this point. Senator Mack has worked tirelessly to listen to every argument, to entertain every question, and to consider every opinion as we moved this bill from introduction through the committee and now to the floor. He has proven to be responsive to serious concerns and has shown the willingness and ability to build coalitions in the interest of getting legislation passed. I greatly appreciate his willingness to work with me and my colleagues to produce this important piece of legislation. 
Likewise, I want to thank Senator Kerry, the ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee. Senator Kerry has long been one of the chief advocates for public and assisted housing in the Congress of the United States. This public housing bill, particularly in it efforts to target assistance to those most in need, reflects Senator Kerry's indelible stamp. 
Finally, I greatly appreciate the skill with which Senator D'Amato has managed this bill and other important legislation, such as the mark-to-market proposal. He has been an important partner in the success we are achieving here tonight. 
Mr. President, public housing is the program everyone loves to hate. It is easy to understand why; bad high-rise public housing projects are easy targets for the press. These projects are magnets for crime and drugs. They stick out like sore thumbs and ruin whole neighborhoods. 
But the fact is that most public housing is good housing. In fact, in most communities around the country, public housing cannot be distinguished from the private housing stock that surrounds it. Most people don't even know when public housing is in their neighborhoods. 
Many of the provisions of S. 462 will help make the public housing program a more effective program. It will give local housing authorities greater autonomy, and greater responsibility, to meet the housing needs in their communities. It will provide for a broader, more economically diverse mix in public housing, which experts universally agree is necessary to create healthier communities. The bill includes important provisions to encourage public housing residents to go to work by delaying any rent increases that would otherwise accompany income gains. 
The bill will expedite the demolition of bad public housing, which has been a point of emphasis for both Secretary Cuomo and former Secretary Cisneros. It will enable HUD to set aside bad public housing management more quickly and replace it with the type of professionals that can turn these agencies around. Many of the reforms in this bill will result in spending taxpayers dollars more efficiently and effectively, and in residents benefiting from imported conditions. 
Again, I want to thank my colleagues for their cooperation, and I look forward to continuing to move forward to conference in a bipartisan spirit. I urge my colleagues to adopt this legislation.

Mr. SARBANES. As you know, one of the most important principles of this public housing bill is resident empowerment. To this end, the legislation mandates that resident advisory boards assist in the development of public housing agency [PHA] plans. It also requires that PHA's: first, conduct public hearings to collect input on their proposed plans; second, make a copy of their proposed plan available for public inspection at least 45 days prior to the public hearing; and third, provide notice of the date of the public hearing at least 45 days in advance of the hearing. 
Given this emphasis on resident participation, I would anticipate that PHA's would make every effort to ensure that each resident is aware of his or her opportunities to provide input. I would expect PHA's to prominently display, at each of their assisted housing developments, information about the hearings, as well as information about where residents can view copies of the proposed agency plans. I would also expect that PHA's, to the maximum extent practicable, will contact resident groups directly to inform them of this information. Is this how you anticipate the process will work?

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator D'Amato, chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, in urging immediate passage of H.R. 2248. 
Patriarch Bartholomew will be visiting the United States from October 19 through November 17, 1997. This bill awards the Congressional Gold Medal to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of approximately 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. The occasion of this legislation is to recognize Patriarch Bartholomew's outstanding contributions to world peace and understanding during his tenure as head of this ancient branch of Christianity and to honor Patriarch Bartholomew's first visit to the United States as Patriarch. As a Greek-Orthodox American and member of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Annunciation in Baltimore, I am particularly gratified to join in this tribute. 
During his American visit Patriarch Bartholomew will meet with thousands of Orthodox faithful and will take the opportunity to convey his message of reconciliation to Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs. His All Holiness has been a leader in ecumenical understanding and has convened important meetings which have brought together participants of all religious backgrounds. In 1994, in cooperation with Rabbi David Schneier and the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, he cosponsored a Peace and Tolerance Conference in Istanbul where Christians, Jews, and Muslims joined together to discuss important and pressing issues. 
As spiritual head of world Orthodoxy, Patriarch Bartholomew has been a leader in the quest for peace throughout the world, particularly in Eastern Europe, the Balkans, and the Middle East. He has vigorously spoken out against extremists and those who would use violence to achieve their ends and has counseled respect for all peoples, irrespective of their nationality and religion; his ministry has been a call to our best virtues. 
From his historical seat in Istanbul, Turkey, Patriarch Bartholomew has served as a mediator between East and West, Christians and Muslims, and as a force for openness and tolerance in the newly emerging independent countries of Eastern Europe. 
As he pursues the goal of peace, Patriarch Bartholomew is equally vigorous in his desire to preserve and promote the Earth's environment as a reflection of God's creation. Working with the European Commission, the Worldwide Fund for Nature, and his Royal Highness Prince Philip, he has cosponsored significant international conferences on the environment, including one scheduled for this month on the future ecological health of the Black Sea. 
I believe it is most fitting that the visit and the accomplishments of Patriarch Bartholomew should be recognized and honored by this Gold Medal as it will reflect the appreciation of the American people for his ministry of peace and reconciliation.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the proposed amendment by my colleague from Arkansas. 
First, I think it is important to point out that the American heritage rivers initiative does not force designation upon any river or river community. It is a voluntary program. 
American heritage rivers enables communities who wish to protect, restore, and revitalize their waterways, who want to protect their vital natural, historical, cultural, and recreational resources, to voluntarily develop and submit a locally driven nomination and to seek designation. 
As proposed by the administration, any nominated river must demonstrate broad community support for the nomination. It must demonstrate that members of the river community have had ample opportunities to comment on the nomination and plan of action. The administration has also made it very clear that if a Member of Congress opposes a river designation in his or her district, the designation will not occur in that district. 
Second, American heritage rivers establishes no new regulations, and was specifically designed to streamline Federal assistance to community-led riparian restoration efforts. By requiring written approval from all property owners along a river, and subjecting designation to a lengthy congressional selection process, this amendment in effect creates crippling delays and places unnecessary regulatory burdens on the nomination preparation and selection processes. 
Third, this amendment unnecessarily restricts the broad objectives of American heritage rivers by focusing only on the water pollution aspects of river revitalization. American heritage rivers is designed to celebrate and address not only natural resource and environmental protection, but to also promote economic development and the protection of our historical, cultural, and recreational resources. 
In my own State of Maryland, and throughout the entire Potomac watershed, a broad coalition of local governments, private citizens, businesses, and others, known as the Friends of the Potomac, has mounted a concerted effort to nominate the Potomac. This coalition is striving to make `Our Nation's River' one of the first 10 designated American heritage rivers, and I fully support and encourage their efforts. 
Mr. President, the American heritage rivers initiative is simply an effort to better coordinate and leverage existing Federal resources. The Council on Environmental Quality, participating agencies and departments already have congressionally provided authority and responsibility to carry out this program. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week, from September 14-20, has been designated National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week, and I am pleased to take this opportunity to recognize the achievements of these fine institutions of higher education. 
For more than 150 years, the 116 historically black colleges and universities [HBCU's] throughout our Nation have played a vital role in providing students with an exceptional education. These institutions have significantly increased educational access for thousands of economically and socially disadvantaged Americans, particularly young African-Americans. In turn, armed with this educational opportunity, these young people have risen to the challenges of our time and have become leaders not only of their own communities, but of our Nation as well. 
While constituting only 3 percent of the Nation's colleges, HBCU's enroll 16 percent of all African-Americans students in higher education. Each year they award approximately 28 percent of all baccalaureate degrees earned by African-Americans nationwide and they continue to graduate the majority of African-Americans who go on to earn advanced degrees, including 75 percent of all African-American PhD's, 50 percent of all African-American attorneys, and 75 percent of all African-American military officers. The success of these institutions in providing educational opportunities for African-Americans in unparalleled. 
My own State of Maryland is privileged to be served by four outstanding historically black colleges and universities: Bowie State University, Coppin State College, Morgan State University, and the University of Maryland Eastern Shore. These four institutions, all of which have undergone dramatic growth in recent years, have contributed significantly to the higher education system in Maryland. 
Bowie State, one of the oldest black universities in the United States, is the Nation's first historically African-American institution to offer graduate programs in Europe. While providing high quality education to thousands of African-Americans, Coppin State has uniquely focused on serving the residents of inner-city Baltimore for almost 100 years. Morgan State annually ranks among the top 10 public campuses nationally in the number of baccalaureate recipients who pursue doctorate degrees. The University of Maryland Eastern Shore, which celebrates its 111th anniversary this week, commits itself to combining an excellent education with an emphasis on meeting the needs of the region by providing a doctorate in marine-estuarine-environmental science and toxicology. These are just a few examples of the strong commitment HBCU's have demonstrated throughout the years in preparing our young people for the increasingly technological and global economy. 
The extraordinary contributions of historically black colleges and universities in educating African-American students cannot be overstated. They are a valuable national resource which are being rightly honored for their exemplary tradition in the area of higher education. I am very pleased to join with them and citizens throughout the Nation in celebrating National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week.

Mr. SARBANES. In FY 97, the committee provided $200,000 from the RTCA account for the National Park Service's Chesapeake Bay Program Office to implement its Chesapeake Bay Action Agenda. The Committee's support enhanced NPS's ability to provide important financial and technical assistance to communities and organizations implementing their watershed protection, heritage area or heritage tourism strategic plans. These projects are terrific examples of community-led conservation, interpretation and preservation efforts that complement other Chesapeake Bay Program activities and illustrate NPS's unique role as a formal participant in the Bay Program. 
I note in the Committee report that a number of worthy projects have been mentioned as deserving of continued funding from this program. I would ask the Senator whether NPS Chesapeake Bay Program Office activities would also qualify as a continuing project to receive funding from RTCA.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Nickles amendment. This represents an unjustified intrusion by the Congress into the decades-long effort by Federal prosecutors to rid the International Brotherhood of Teamsters of corrupt influences. 
That is what is involved here, it is the effort to drive corrupt influences out of the Teamsters Union. Now, that effort has been vigorously pursued by both Republican and Democratic Departments of Justice. It culminated in litigation and ultimately a consent decree between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the United States. This was a consent decree entered into by the Bush administration and Attorney General Thornburgh, who hailed this as a major achievement, which I concede it was. And now Congress, with this amendment, is seeking to interfere in that law enforcement effort at a vital moment. 
In the 1989 consent decree, the Federal Government effectively entered into a contract to pay for the supervision of the 1996 election. In fact, the consent decree is very clear in stating, `The union defendants consent to the election officer at Government expense to supervise the 1996 elections.' And the rerun election we are talking about is the 1996 election, which has not been certified. It is now back before the court. 
Now, this amendment breaches that agreement. It in effect violates the consent decree. 
It is asserted that unions typically pay for their own elections. That is quite true. But in those elections they do not have election officers, and they do not have Federal supervision of the election. What the consent decree said was that the union would pay for the 1991 election and that the 1996 election would be supervised under the consent decree at Government expense. 
Now, the Teamsters already pay $3 to $4 million annually for consent decree activities related to the effort to prevent corruption. Between 1990 and 1995, they incurred costs in excess of $40 million in complying with its obligations and responsibilities under the consent decree. 
The danger with this amendment is that if the Government goes back on its undertaking to pay for the supervisory costs of the 1996 election, you will take the Teamsters out from under the necessity of having an election officer. You do not ordinarily get election officers to supervise union elections. 
My colleagues on the other side will say, well, what did we get out of it? What we got out of it was the continued supervision of the union elections into the 1996 election to help ensure that corrupt influences would not creep back into the union and affect its legitimate operations. The executive branch agreed to this consent decree.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I have been listening very carefully to my colleague from Oklahoma. I am beginning to wonder, what is happening to this tremendous effort to drive corruption out of the Teamsters union? The Senator quoted a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick, which is dated after the 1989 consent degree. I say to my colleague from Oklahoma, you cited this memorandum of Deputy Attorney General Gorelick which comes after the 1989 consent decree. The consent decree was entered into by Attorney General Thornburgh and the Bush Administration. So, now we are told that a later memorandum is going to vitiate the earlier consent decree. How is that for undoing the law? 
The Senator is playing with fire. If this rerun is not the 1996 election, then the results of the 1996 election ought to hold and there should not be a further election. This is not a new election. This is a rerun of the 1996 election. 
The Senator selectively quotes from the consent decree. The consent decree is very clear. It says, `The union defendants consent to the election officer, at Government expense, to supervise the 1996 IBT election.' He omitted that part of the consent decree. My colleague then quotes, `The union defendants further consent to the Department of Labor supervising IBT elections.' That supervision, I say to my colleague, by the Department of Labor, does not encompass an election officer and it does not encompass the severe degree of supervision that comes with an election officer. What is the objective here? Is the objective to get the Teamsters out from under the consent decree so they don't have to use an election officer in doing this rerun of the election? If that is the objective, I strongly disagree with it. Having an election officer serves a public interest. 
Then we are told every other union pays for its own elections. We have heard that time again and again, but they don't have an election officer to supervise their elections.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this is an incredibly mischievous amendment. The Teamsters are operating under a court order. This would violate the consent decree. The reason the Government pays for the election is so they can have an election officer supervise the election in order to ensure that we drive corruption out of the Teamsters Union. 
This consent decree was entered into by Attorney General Thornburgh in the Bush administration and heralded at the time as a great and significant accomplishment. 
The Nickles amendment violates the consent decree and it carries with it the very severe risk of resulting in an unsupervised election. Now, it is asserted that other unions pay for their own elections. That is quite true, but they don't have an election officer to supervise the election. The agreement in the consent decree provided for this payment. 
I urge a vote against the amendment.

Mr. SARBANES. I would like to commend the committee and subcommittee for their hard work on the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill. I am particularly pleased that the committee has seen fit to honor the administration's request for funding of the efforts of the Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS] with respect to its review of the Consumer Price Index. 
However, I am concerned about the level of funding provided in the Labor-HHS bill for the remainder of the BLS budget, which is $6.8 million below the administration's request. 
BLS has suffered substantial funding reductions in past years, and consequently has had to eliminate or reduce the scope of several important programs--programs which produced valuable information on the Nation's labor markets and economy as a whole. It would not serve the national interest for BLS to have to undertake similar reductions as a result of the funding level in this appropriations bill. 
For example, high school guidance counselors around the country who help young graduates find work in growing sectors of the economy rely on Occupational Outlook Handbook, Occupational Outlook Quarterly, and other special reports produced by the BLS Employment Projections Program. The proposed cuts in this bill, however, may make the continued publication of these important materials less likely in the future. 
Similarly, to excel in the increasingly competitive global economy American businesses and trade officials need reliable international comparison statistics on employment, labor costs, and productivity. The proposed level of funding in this legislation jeopardizes our ability to receive such information. 
Finally, another consequence of the committee's proposed BLS funding level could be a delay in the implementation of the new industrial classification system--the so-called NAICS--that BLS has been working on. Updating the current system, which dates back to the 1930's, to reflect an economy approaching the 21st century is critical to the ability of our business leaders and policymakers to understand the challenges our economy will be facing in the upcoming years. 
I understand that the House funds all BLS activities at a level consistent with the administration's request. Would the Senator from Pennsylvania, as ranking member of the Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee, be willing to accept the House funding levels in conference?

If ever there was an instance of trampling in on the part of the Congress and in effect, undoing an arrangement that was very carefully and elaborately worked out and, in fact, done so by now Mayor Giuliani but then U.S. Attorney Giuliani in the Southern District of New York, approved by the Department of Justice, headed by Richard Thornburgh, and held out by President Bush as a major accomplishment. 
I thank the Senator for yielding.

Mr. SARBANES. Well, in fact, what the taxpayers got out of the consent decree was the use of the election officer for the 1996 election. 
The Senator seems to proceed on the premise that having an election officer to supervise the election is the normal course of events. That is not the case. One of the things that was negotiated in the consent decree was getting an election officer for the 1996 election. 
Let me read from the consent decree.

Mr. SARBANES. I will ask a question. 
`The union defendants consent to the election officer at government expense to supervise the 1996 IBT elections.' 
Now, that represented a major concession by the union in the consent decree to place themselves under an election officer. Part of the consent decree was, obviously if they were going to do that, that the costs of the election officer would be paid by the Government and you are undoing that aspect of the consent decree.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to respond to the questions put by the Senator from Arizona. The Senator seems to proceed on the premise that you are entitled to have an election officer to supervise a union election, although he referred to them as `private unions' and said, `Why are we paying for this with public funds?' 
Now, the deal that was made in 1989 by the Bush administration and by Attorney General Thornburgh was that the 1991 election would be held with an election officer, paid for by the union. The Government obviously wanted to have an election officer in the picture in the next election, the 1996 election. But part of the consent decree was, if the election officer was going to be in the picture for the 1996 union election, the cost of that election was going to be paid for by the Government. Now, you all talk about how anxious you are to keep the influence of the mob out of the union. I certainly subscribe to that. But what you are doing by this amendment is you are setting up the possibility that the union can conduct its election without an election officer because it is out from under the consent decree. The consent decree required the 1996 election to be done with an election officer. That election has not been certified. It is that election about which there are questions, which the judge is now going to hear. Now, you are going to come in and, in effect, undo part of the consent decree. I simply point out to you that it carries with it the very high risk that an election officer will no longer be required. That is how the Bush administration got an election officer for the 1996 election, through the consent decree. They got it for 1991, and they got it for 1996. 
The Bush administration obviously wanted an election officer in the 1996 election. They didn't want the Teamsters out from under the consent decree altogether after the 1991 election. Part of the arrangement, in order to get the consent decree, was that the election officer would be, at Government expense, appointed to supervise the 1996 election. Now, that is the election that is in question. That is the election that has not been certified. I mean, you act as though the involvement of public moneys did not achieve a public objective. 
What was the Bush administration thinking about, and what was Attorney General Thornburgh thinking about, to support a consent decree that provided that the Government would pay for the 1996 supervised election? Obviously, what they were thinking about is they would get an election officer to supervise the 1996 election, so they would carry the supervision of the Teamsters beyond the 1991 election. 
Now you are coming in and you want to undo this arrangement. My view is, you are intervening in an established court procedure under the consent decree. Second--and I suggest that people stop and think about this very carefully--you are running the very high risk that you will enable the Teamsters to come out from under the consent decree, as far as having an election officer is concerned. The people on the other side will certainly say that other unions pay for their elections; the Government doesn't pay for their union elections. That is true. But they don't have an election officer to supervise it either. 
In fact, the other side referred to this as private elections on the part of the union. Those private elections on the part of other unions are not supervised by election officers. With respect to the Teamsters elections, given the corruption we were trying to deal with, we thought it imperative to have an election officer. They got an election officer in 1991 for that election. The union paid for that election as part of the consent decree. But the Bush administration obviously wanted to supervise the next election as well, in order to ensure that they didn't revert back to past practices. 
Part of getting an election officer for the 1996 election was that the Government assumed the cost of that supervision. Now, that election has not been certified. It still remains an open question, and that is the very matter on which the judge will be holding these hearings in less than 2 weeks' time. 
Now we come in here and are sort of, in effect, trespassing on this whole arrangement, portraying it as though there was no return to the Government for the arrangement. The Government got the use of election officers in order to supervise these elections. I mean, the Senator ought to want election officers to continue----

Mr. SARBANES. I say to my colleague that that is not the consent decree which the Bush administration approved and which they presented forward as a major accomplishment. That is an interesting argument, but the Senator should have used it in 1989, at the time the Bush administration sanctioned this consent decree. Otherwise, you never would have had an election officer for the 1996 election. It is treated as though that is a normal course of events. That is a major part of the bargain that was reached in the consent decree, keeping an election officer. The other part of the bargain was that the Government would pay the cost for the supervised election.

Mr. SARBANES. I think the Senator makes a very valid point, but I will take it a step further. By meddling into this, we may well make it possible for the Teamsters to come out from under the consent decree with respect to the use of an election officer to conduct the election. 
I ask my colleagues on the other side, is that a result they want? Do they want the Teamsters to be able to conduct an election without the use of an election officer?

<DOCNO>105-sarbanes-md-33-19970904</DOCNO>

Mr. SARBANES. I observe to the Senator that the only reason you got that supervision was because of the consent decree. The reason you had an election officer in 1991, and the reason you had one in 1996 was because of the consent decree. You don't automatically get election officers to supervise union elections. You are absolutely right, ordinarily union elections are paid for by the union. It is a private association. They pay for the elections. There is no election officer to supervise those elections. 
Now, what the consent decree gave you was an election officer because the Government wanted to supervise the election as a way of rooting out corruption and the influence of the mob in the Teamsters Union. They got a consent decree and it gave them an election officer in 1991, and also gave them an election officer in 1996 because, obviously, the Bush administration didn't want to have just one election and then they are off the hook. They wanted to keep the supervision for the 1996 election. But in order to get that agreement and that understanding in the consent decree, they agreed to pay the costs of the supervision for the 1996 election, which is, in a sense, the election that is still before us, since it has never been certified. 
Now you are coming in, and you want to in effect eliminate an option that is available to the judge in terms of carrying out the consent decree. My point is that is carrying with it the very high risk that you eliminate the election officer. Then that raises a question. Why do you want to eliminate the election officer to supervise the teamsters election? That brings us back to why we have the election officers to begin with. So that works the whole thing back full circle. This is a classic example of tramping in without fully thinking through what the consequences of doing so are. 
As the Senator from New Mexico has pointed out, it intrudes into the judicial operation, clearly. But, beyond that, I think it carries with it a very high risk that you are going to be hoisted by your own petard here, and you are going to end up without an election officer, which is an essential part of the consent agreement that was reached which the Bush administration at the time trumpeted as a major accomplishment.

Mr. SARBANES. I think the Senator is on a very important point. As the Senator from New Mexico said, you have the Congress coming in and trying to in effect dictate what the conclusions are going to be in the court proceedings--improper intrusion into the process, and a total lack of respect for the separation of powers. We are talking about a consent decree here. We are not even talking about a matter which is just in the initial stages of litigation in which we have traditionally shied away from intervening in saying it is a matter to be resolved by the courts. We have a matter here that was in extended litigation and which resulted in a consent decree entered into under an order of the court. 
Now we are coming along and we are going to play around with this consent decree, and it is treated as though there is no downside to it. In other words, they say, `Well, we will not honor the consent decree that requires that we pay for the election but we will keep the election officer which was provided in the consent decree.' Which is unprecedented. That is not the normal way you do an election with an election officer. 
So they are going to keep the election officer. But they are going to deny the court the ability to handle the apportioning of the cost of that, which is apparent currently available to the court under the consent decree. You are playing with fire. The end result of this may be that the teamsters get out from under the consent decree, and they don't have to use an election officer in order to conduct their election. 
If that is what you really want to do, I mean I think one ought to be explicit about it. I don't think that is desirable. The questions that have been raised about this election that just happened--and, you know, obviously, you want to be sure you have a fair election given the long history of this issue involving the Teamsters Union.

<DOCNO>105-sarbanes-md-37-19970904</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. SARBANES. No. I think the Senator is absolutely correct. Just as the court is about to pass on this previous election and make some judgment as to what ought to be done with respect maybe to holding another election, we come along with this amendment, and in effect alter the consent decree. 
What the Government got out of the consent decree was continued supervision of the Teamster election by an election officer. In order to get that for the 1996 election in the consent decree, the Government undertook to pay the costs of that election. Now people want to preclude that side of the bargain but they want to keep the election officer. 
I am simply suggesting to them that they may lose the election officer as well and bring the Teamsters out from under the consent decree. I would think upon reflection that that is something they would not want to do. In fact, the consent decree very clearly states that the union defendants consent to the election of officers at Government expense to supervise the 1996 IBT elections. 
This was a litigated matter. It was in the courts. In fact, the mayor of New York, the current mayor of New York, was then the U.S. Attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and this was the agreement they worked out as part of the consent decree, as part of this litigation. Now, it is suggested that, well, we didn't get anything for it. Of course, we got something for it. We got the continued supervision of these elections with an election officer. You don't ordinarily get that with union elections. Ordinarily the unions pay for the election. There is no election officer. The Government wanted an election officer. They wanted to supervise these elections. The union said pay for the '91 election. But they, obviously, want out from under it. In effect, the deal was if you are going to continue to supervise us with an election officer through the 1996 election, you are going to pay the costs of the 1996 election. This election we are talking about here is in effect a continuation of the 1996 election, and that one has not been certified. 
So now we are playing, as it were, fast and loose with this consent decree. The end result of it may be that you will get an unsupervised election throwing the whole thing right back. This thing was negotiated, as I understand it, after a long period of time with very intense and extended negotiations. And it was finally put in a place under the order of a U.S. district judge, and it was consented to by the U.S. Attorney. It was consented to by the U.S. Government, and consented to by the plaintiffs and by the defendant. In fact, there is a long list of signatures consenting to the consent decree. Otherwise, you would have been in litigation. You don't know what the outcome would have been. 
At the time, I can recall President Bush declaring this a great success. I think it was an accomplishment by the Bush administration, by Attorney General Thornburgh. Now we come along, and we are undoing it here on the floor of the U.S. Senate.

<TEXT>
Mr. SARBANES. I say to the Senator, yes. That is correct. What my colleagues on the other side are failing to understand is the history out of which this consent decree arose. In other words, the Federal Government filed suit against the Teamsters alleging mob influence in the Teamsters, and it went through an involved presentation of what the issues were, the campaigns of fear and extortion, and so forth and so on. That suit is pending. The Government then reaches a consent decree with the Teamsters. The matter never went to full-scale litigation. You don't know what the outcome of the litigation would have been. They reached a consent decree, and the Attorney General stated at the time, `This settlement, which union leaders agreed to earlier today, culminates 30 years' of efforts by the Department of Justice to remove the influence of organized crime within the Teamsters Union.' And the observer goes on to note that the Teamsters signed a consent decree with the Federal Government to avoid a trial over a lawsuit. The union agreed to purge its mob connections and hold democratic elections. Then they discussed the supervision that was taking place with respect to the 1991 election. And the grumbling, in fact, on the part of some of the rank and file of the Teamsters is that the union no longer belonged to them, `their second-guessing of internal decisions that we make,' et cetera, et cetera. `They are eliminating democracy to ensure democracy,' one of these dissidents said. 
We got that arrangement in order to supervise this election in order to try to root out this mob influence. Part of the consent decree was not only that you have a supervisor for the 1991 election but you have one for the 1996 election, which was a marked departure from how these things are handled. 
My colleagues on the other side say, well, we don't pay for the elections of any other unions. That is quite true. No. We don't pay for them. We don't have election officers to supervise them either. We don't have them under a consent decree. There is a national purpose or objective to be achieved by rooting out the corruption that existed in the Teamsters Union. This consent decree negotiated by Mr. Giuliani, or by his associates, when he was a U.S. attorney in New York, approved by the Department of Justice, by Richard Thornburgh, the Attorney General, was an effort to accomplish that objective. In order to do that, we were able in effect to impose an election regime upon the Teamsters, not only for the 1991 election, the immediately next forthcoming election, but also for the 1996 election.

Mr. SARBANES. Let me finish my point, and I will yield. Obviously, as part of the effort to extend out supervision beyond another 5 years out into the 1996 election, the Government undertook to pay the costs of the supervision of the 1996 election. But we got an election officer to supervise it. That is the election that is now in question. That is the election that is going to be under the scrutiny of the Federal District judge in New York. Now we are sort of messing with that situation without even beginning to have any full appreciation of what the consequences may be.

Mr. SARBANES. The Department wanted to supervise the 1996 election. They got the consent, they got it as part of the consent decree from the union to do so, but the costs of the election would be borne by the Government. 
We ought to let the court decide what the consent decree means because, if you start playing around with a consent decree with respect to the cost of the election, the next thing you may discover is that you have let the Teamsters out from under the consent decree and you will not have an election officer, which was part and parcel of the arrangement that was made in the consent decree. 
That is the point I am trying to make. You are running a very large risk here that you are going to lose your election officer to moderate and supervise these Teamster elections. And we have a strong public interest in preserving an election officer. Let the court decide what the consent decree means, and the court can then do it in a way that assures you that the Teamsters will not come out from under application of the election officer. That is the point.

I do not see how the Senator can take that position when questions have been raised about the validity of the 1996 election. This is the very thing that the court is going to be deciding up in New York, and we ought to let the court decide what the consent decree means. 
I think this exchange just now is a pretty dramatic illustration of why we ought to let the court decide what it means because otherwise we are running the very high risk of exactly what the Senator said he would countenance happening; namely, an unsupervised election. I am sure there are many Members who do not want an unsupervised election.

Mr. SARBANES. It is not quite the same. I say to the Senator that is not the agreement that is embodied in the consent decree. This consent decree was not done by this administration. This consent decree was done by the Bush administration. Attorney General Thornburgh said about it, `This settlement, which union leaders agreed to earlier today, culminates 30 years of effort by the Department of Justice to remove the influence of organized crime within the Teamsters Union.' 
The Senator had service as a U.S. attorney, and you know when you agree to enter into a consent decree, you know, in effect, there is some give and take on both sides, and this was the arrangement that was made. It was done by Giuliani, approved by Thornburgh, trumpeted by President Bush as a success. I thought it was a success. I continue to think it is a success. And I certainly don't think we should run the risk here of undoing the consent decree by refusing to carry out the Government cost of the elections and lose the election officer as a consequence and allow the Teamsters to have an unsupervised election, and that is the fire you are playing with here. 
What we really should do here is we should back off and let the court handle this matter. The court has a consent decree to administer. It has options. Under that consent decree, the court could, in effect, maintain supervision and not pick up the costs of it. But that is a matter for the court to do as it interprets the consent decree. If we try to do it on the floor as we are trying to do right now, we run the risk of upsetting this whole apple cart and the whole effort to purge the Teamsters and to get an honest union.

<DOCNO>105-sarbanes-md-3-19970731</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, just 4 years ago, in 1993, in order to reduce the deficit, the Congress, by a narrow margin, enacted a budget resolution that curtailed programs and increased taxes--taxes that fell primarily on those at the upper end of the income scale. 
This combination of spending restraint and revenue increases represents a logical way of dealing with the deficit issue. 
This approach has worked in a most impressive way. The flourishing economy has brought unemployment below 5 percent for the first time in a quarter of a century. While unemployment is at a quarter-century low, inflation is at a 31-year low. I don't know what better proof you can offer of a strong economy than the low unemployment rate and low inflation rate we are now experiencing. As a consequence of this flourishing economy, the deficit has declined on a steady basis since fiscal year 1992. It has come straight down in each succeeding fiscal year from $290 billion to $255 billion, to $203 billion, to $164 billion, to $107 billion in the fiscal year that ended last September 30, and it is now expected to be below $50 billion for the current fiscal year come this September 30. 
As a percentage of gross domestic product, the deficit has gone from 4.9 percent--a very worrisome figure--in 1992 to well under 1 percent for the current fiscal year, the best performance since 1974. So you have the best unemployment rate in 25 years, the lowest inflation in 31 years, the lowest deficit as a percent of GDP in 23 years. We are doing far better than any of the other major industrial countries. So it is a very impressive economic and deficit-reduction performance indeed that we are now witnessing. 
Given this performance, one would think that the wise policy would be to stay the course and finish the job, that we would choose to continue following the path on which we find ourselves. Today we have already enacted budget cuts and spending restraints, legislation which obviously works in the direction of deficit reduction. But now we are passing a tax cut when the objective, or so everyone states, is deficit reduction. 
Tax cuts obviously work against deficit reduction. And the tax cuts contained in this legislation are particularly destructive of deficit reduction in that they will grow over time in a way that may well jeopardize the goal of reaching and staying in budget balance altogether. 
The capital gains, inheritance, and IRA tax cuts all carry with them the potential for substantial increases in future years. In fact, the tables put out by the Joint Tax Committee itself with respect to the tax cuts contained in this conference report tell this very tale. For the first 5 years covered by this legislation--1998-2002--estate tax cuts will cost $6 billion in revenues. For the next 5 years, from 2003 to 2007, they will cost $28 billion in revenue. That is the upward trendline from the first 5 years to the second 5 years. We don't have the figures for beyond the initial 10-year period. They have not been provided to us. So we are in a sense being asked to make this decision in the dark. But it is reasonable to assume that these estate tax cuts will continue on that upward trajectory. 
Capital gains cuts in this conference report are listed as producing $123 billion in revenues over the first 5-year period, 1998 to 2002, and then to cost $21 billion from 2003 to 2007 with no projection beyond that point. 
IRA's will cost $1.8 billion in the first 5 years, $18 billion in the next 5 years. And the alternative minimum tax costs $8 billion in the first 5 years and $12 billion in the 5 years thereafter. 
So, as everyone can see, we are on an upward trajectory that makes it reasonable to assume that the loss in revenues over the second 10-year period will be well in excess of $0.5 trillion. 
This rising trend will, in effect, undercut--if not derail--the deficit reduction effort. 
Is it not imprudent--indeed, irresponsible--to commit to such tax cuts before we have actually achieved budget balance and before we have a more accurate and realistic view of whether it can be sustained? 
As the Baltimore Sun said in an editorial only yesterday, and I quote:  
The question remains: Will the generous tax cuts come back to haunt the country in the form of widening deficits as the tax cuts take full effect several years down the road?' The answer, judging from the figures I have just cited, appears to be yes. 
Furthermore, let me note that all of this is premised on the economy continuing to function as strongly as it is functioning right now. In effect, with this tax cut, we are giving away our margin to engage in a countercyclical fiscal policy, if we have an economic downturn. What would we do in a downturn when, in fact, you might want to do a tax cut in order to stimulate the economy to help move us out of the recession when, in fact, you have proceeded to use up the margin for taking such policy action with the legislation that is here before us. 
Second, these tax provisions before us in this conference report are strikingly inequitable, and result in a disproportionate share of the burdens of deficit reduction being placed on lower income individuals and families. The impact of the reduction in programs contained in the spending bill passed earlier today will be felt by ordinary working people, primarily. The tax reductions contained in this legislation, far from burdening upper income individuals, will primarily benefit those at the top end of the income scale. 
In fact, it has been reliably estimated that the top 1 percent of the income scale will receive 30 percent of the tax benefits contained in this conference report. The top 5 percent will receive 44 percent of the benefits. And the top 20 percent, the upper quintile, will receive 77 percent of the tax benefits contained in this conference report. I repeat, the top quintile will receive 77 percent of the benefits. 
By contrast, the bottom 60 percent, the lowest three quintiles, will receive less than 7 percent of the benefits. So the top fifth of the income pyramid is going to get 11 times the benefit that the bottom three-fifths of the income pyramid will receive under this proposal. 
There is no way that can be regarded as an equitable arrangement. And, in fact, what is happening here is, in order to move toward deficit reduction, additional burdens are being put on working people. In fact, under this conference report, the people at the top end of the scale, instead of making a contribution to deficit reduction, are getting out from some of the burden which they now bear, a burden which has helped to bring the deficit down to the point at which we find ourselves today. 
A budget agreement and the tax measure to implement it should undertake equitable deficit reduction apportioning the burdens in a way that it is reasonably spread across the entire society, as was done in 1993 when ordinary working people made their contribution through program reductions, and those at the top end of the income scale made their contribution through tax increases. Here again we have working people bearing their share of the burden of program reduction. But the tax breaks contained in this resolution go very much to those at the upper end of the income scale, leaving working Americans bearing a far larger percentage of the load. 
So one must conclude this budget fails the equity test. A budget agreement and the tax program to implement it should also lead to lasting long-term deficit reduction. I don't think this legislation will do that. In fact, as I have already discussed at length, I have very deep concern that in the long term, as the Sun editorial indicated--in posing the basic question, `Will the generous tax cuts come back to haunt the country in the form of widening deficits as the tax cuts take full effect several years down the road?'--this conference report will do serious damage to our long-term deficit reduction efforts. 
These tax cuts will explode in the outyears. They start exploding even within the 10-year period. Let me repeat the figures: The estate tax cuts go from a loss of revenue of $6 billion in the first 5 years to a loss of $28 billion in the next 5 years, and presumably more in the outyears. Capital gains are scored under this conference report to earn revenues--earn revenues--of $123 billion in the first 5 years, and to cost $21 billion in the next 5 years, and presumably more in the outyears. 
IRA's are scored here to cost $1.8 billion--less than $2 billion--in the first 5 years, $18 billion in the next 5 years, again with no projection beyond that, although everyone assumes it is on an upward trajectory. 
So, Mr. President, this measure before us also fails the long-term deficit reduction test, just as it fails the equity test. In effect, it does not have either of two essential attributes--equitable deficit reduction and lasting long-term deficit reduction--that should inform a tax bill. 
For those reasons, I must oppose the measure before us. 
I thank the Senator for yielding me time.

I just want to say that I was very heartened to hear the majority leader state that it was his intention to address this Executive Calendar before we go out, I gather, with the anticipation of clearing, if not all of it, most of it, as I understand it. 
I want to underscore how important that is. If we do it now, these people can move into their positions and be functioning within the week. If we don't do it now, then it obviously has to carry over into September, and you are talking about losing 5, 6, 7 weeks before we get people on the job.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to join with my colleague, Senator Mikulski, in endorsing the inclusion of I-70/I-270 in Frederick, MD, on the priority list for discretionary highway funding. Anyone who drives on I-70 or I-270 in Frederick knows what a serious traffic and safety problem we have in this area. The highway narrows from 6 lanes to 4 lanes creating a bottleneck. There are missing interchanges with I-270 and U.S. 15, forcing cars and trucks onto city streets and adding to existing congestion; and the substandard condition of the highway and resulting congestion means accidents and delays for commuters, interstate truckers, tourists, businesses, and employers alike. With traffic volumes in the area projected to more than double in the next 20 years, there has been a clear need to address this problem. I want to thank the distinguished managers of the bill for their assurances.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator D'Amato, chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, in introducing legislation awarding the congressional gold medal to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of approximately 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. The occasion of this legislation is to honor Patriarch Bartholomew's first visit to the United States as Patriarch and to recognize his outstanding contributions to world peace and understanding during his tenure as head of this ancient branch of Christianity. As a Greek-Orthodox American and member of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Annunciation in Baltimore, I am particularly gratified to join in this tribute. 
During his American visit, which will take place from October 19 through November 17, 1997, Patriarch Bartholomew will meet with thousands of Orthodox faithful and will take the opportunity to convey his message of reconciliation to Americans of all backgrounds and beliefs. His All Holiness has been a leader in ecumenical understanding and has convened important meetings which have brought together participants of all religious backgrounds. In 1994, in cooperation with Rabbi David Schneier and the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, he cosponsored a peace and tolerance Conference in Istanbul where Christians, Jews, and Muslims joined together to discuss important and pressing issues. 
As spiritual head of world Orthodoxy, Patriarch Bartholomew has been a leader in the quest for peace throughout the world, particularly in Eastern Europe, the Balkans, and the Middle East. He has vigorously spoken out against extremists and those who would use violence to achieve their ends and has counseled respect for all peoples, irrespective of their nationality and religion; his ministry has been a call to our best virtues. 
From his historical seat in Istanbul, Turkey, Patriarch Bartholomew has served as a mediator between East and West, Christians and Muslims, and as a force for openness and tolerance in the newly emerging independent countries of Eastern Europe. 
As he pursues the goal of peace, Patriarch Bartholomew is equally vigorous in his desire to preserve and promote the earth's environment as a reflection of God's creation. Working with the European Commission, the Worldwide Fund for Nature, and his Royal Highness Prince Philip, he has cosponsored significant international conferences on the environment, including one scheduled for this fall on the future ecological health of the Black Sea. 
I believe it is most fitting that the visit and the accomplishments of Patriarch Bartholomew should be recognized and honored by this gold medal as it will reflect the appreciation of the American people for his ministry of peace and reconciliation. 
I am also pleased to join Senator D'Amato in submitting a concurrent resolution providing for the use of the rotunda for a ceremony honoring Patriarch Bartholomew.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the amendment now pending. The National Endowment for Democracy has done some extremely effective work around the world in strengthening and assisting in the development of democratic institutions and protecting individual rights and freedoms. Endowment programs have assisted grassroots organizations and individuals in more than 90 countries across the globe. 
A great number of distinguished individuals have walked through the Halls of the Capitol over the years whom we have recognized as fighters for human rights, freedom, and democracy. They are leaders from abroad who have come to visit the U.S. Congress as a sign of their respect for American democracy. They have led the way toward democracy and human rights, and freedom in their own countries. In expressing their support for the National Endowment for Democracy, they have underscored the critical assistance that they have received from it, which made it possible for them to pursue democratic efforts in their own countries. 
The National Endowment for Democracy has enjoyed broad bipartisan support since it was established in 1983 under the Presidency of Ronald Reagan. Seven former Secretaries of State--James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, Alexander Haig, Henry Kissinger, Edmund Muskie, George Shultz, and Cyrus Vance--wrote to the leadership of the Congress in 1995 to express their support for continuing funding of the National Endowment for Democracy. Their letter and stated, and I quote: 
During this period of international change and uncertainty, the work of the NED continues to be an important bipartisan but nongovernmental contributor to democratic reform and freedom. We consider the nongovernmental character of the NED even more relevant today than it was at NED's founding 12 years ago. 
The NED serves an important role because of the fact that it can operate as a nongovernmental entity. It can support nongovernmental organizations which, in turn, provide opportunities that would not otherwise be available if these activities were undertaken by a government or governmental agency. This is an extremely important dimension to the work of the National Endowment for Democracy. 
Former national security advisers of previous administrations and the President's current Adviser for National Security Affairs, Sandy Berger, have expressed their strong support for the NED. Mr. Berger noted in his letter to Members of Congress this week: 
I welcome the opportunity to reaffirm strong administration support for the NED and our opposition to any effort to reduce or eliminate NED funding . . . The President is a dedicated supporter of the NED, as it has been in the forefront of U.S. efforts to promote democracy, civil society and the rule of law around the world. Moreover, it has done so at very little cost to the American public, leveraging modest resources with great effectiveness. 
The sweeping and profound changes resulting from the end of the cold war provide ample reason for why we continue to need institutions like the NED, which can operate in a cost-effective manner and at the same time promote our interests and values. Many of the new democracies that have emerged from the implosion of the Soviet Union and the collapse of the Iron Curtain have benefited from the assistance NED and its grantees have provided. Those who paved the way for freedom and democracy in their own countries have consistently testified as to the importance of NED support to the success of their efforts. 
In fact, President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic stated that `the National Democratic Institute was one of the first supporting actors in the democratic revolution in our country.' 
And others have made similar statements with respect to the activities of the two party organizations, the business groups, and the labor groups that are the core grantees of NED. 
This is a program that is working. It is producing significant results around the world. 
I strongly support this amendment, and urge my colleagues to adopt it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to direct my colleagues' attention to section 408 of this bill, on pages 124 and 125. I am absolutely stunned to find this language in this legislation, because it provides for our withdrawal from the United Nations. 
What it says, if I understand it correctly, is that if the appropriation does not come up to the level of the U.N. assessment, then the United States shall withdraw from an international organization, but I assume it is primarily directed at the U.N. 
Let me just read a couple of paragraphs to my colleagues. 
The United States shall withdraw from an international organization under this section in accordance with the procedures identified for withdrawal in the treaty, pact, agreement, charter, or other instrument of that organization which establishes such procedures. 
Unless otherwise provided for in the instrument concerned, a withdrawal under this section shall be completed by the end of the fiscal year in which the withdrawal is required. 
This is a small section located in the latter part of this legislation. As you read through this bill, all of a sudden, you come across the provision. If we are going to withdraw from the U.N., we ought to have a full-scale debate. This is not a minor decision. There are some people in the country who would like to do that, but if we are going to undertake to do so we ought to have a full scale debate. 
What this section says as it starts off is: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the United States shall withdraw from an international organization if the President determines that the amount appropriated or otherwise available for a fiscal year . . . is less than the actual amount of such contributions. . . . 
In other words, the assessments. So, if we do not appropriate the full assessment, as I understand this section, the President has to begin withdrawal procedures. 
There are many years when we have not met the assessment. In fact, we continue to run arrearages. We just passed legislation here that had certain conditions for paying our U.N. dues, that withheld certain amounts, required certifications, and so forth and so on. 
I don't know where this provision came from but it is a backdoor way of compelling our withdrawal from the United Nations. 
The amendment that was sent to the desk would strike this section from the bill. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. We should not be talking about withdrawal from international organizations. We are the world's leading power. We essentially use these international organizations to serve our interests. Now we come to this section, which is sort of hidden away. The upshot of it would be to, in effect, lead us to begin withdrawal procedures from the United Nations. 
I don't think we even ought to have any references to withdrawal. Certainly the way this provision is written, the bill is going to force us out of the U.N. 
I hope the committee, upon reflection, would agree to drop the section from the bill.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment concerning rural housing reauthorizations for the Rural Housing Service of the Department of Agriculture. I want to commend Chairman Cochran and Ranking Member Bumpers for their tireless efforts and cooperation in bringing the Agriculture Appropriations Act of 1998 to the floor for Senate consideration. 
Given the uncertainty of housing reauthorization legislation this year, I have joined with Banking Committee Chairman D'Amato to request the inclusion of an amendment that would reauthorize several rural housing programs in the 1998 Agriculture appropriations bill. This amendment will allow the section 515 and section 538 rural rental housing programs to continue providing multifamily housing developers with direct loans and loan guarantees to build or rehabilitate affordable rental housing. 
In addition, this amendment reauthorizes for 1 year the nonprofit set-aside which reserves 10 percent of section 515 funds for nonprofit applicants, as well as the Underserved Areas Program which targets funds to the 100 most underserved rural communities. This amendment also changes the section 515 loan term from 50 to 30 years, while allowing the loan to be amortized over a 50-year period. This change permits the administration's proposed program level in the budget of $150 million to be supported by almost 15 percent less in budget authority. 
Without these housing programs targeted to very-low and low-income rural residents, there exists few resources in rural America to help alleviate the shortage of affordable rental housing. Rural areas still lack adequate access to commercial credit to finance affordable multifamily housing. The direct benefits to rural communities from the section 515 and section 538 programs includes increased jobs and local taxes in addition to attracting and maintaining businesses. This is a direct and vital link to the overall health and stability for rural communities. 
While the Rural Housing Service has done much to bring decent, safe, and affordable housing to rural America, many rural families are still in need of assistance. Rural renters experience housing problems such as overcrowding, cost overburdens, and substandard facilities. There are 1.6 million rural households that live in housing without adequate plumbing, heating, or kitchen facilities. Nearly 2.5 million are paying more than 50 percent of their incomes for housing costs, and another 3 million pay between 30 and 50 percent. As we encourage families to move from welfare to work, it is even more essential that we build on the vital housing programs that provide the safety net which will give the working poor an opportunity to live in affordable, decent housing. 
Again, I would like to thank Chairman Cochran, Ranking Member Bumpers, and the rest of my colleagues for their swift action to ensure that essential rural rental housing programs receive authorization to continue serving low-income families for another year. I urge the adoption of this amendment.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to support the VA-HUD appropriations bill. Chairman Bond, a former colleague of mine on the Banking Committee, and Senator Mikulski, the ranking member and my good friend from Maryland, both have a deep understanding of the importance of housing programs that are so crucial to creating safe, decent, and affordable housing for the American people. I want to thank them for their hard work. 
The committee did a good job of juggling many competing needs and interests that go far beyond housing programs. I want to recognize their good work in both appropriating enough funds to renew expiring section 8 contracts and in adopting the mark-to-market legislation passed as part of the reconciliation bill but unfortunately dropped in conference. This legislation, sponsored by Senators Mack, D'Amato, Bond, and others addresses what Secretary Cuomo calls the biggest crisis facing HUD in a way that saves money and ensures the long-term preservation of the section 8 housing stock. 
We have worked very hard on a bipartisan basis in a short period of time to iron out differences with HUD on the section 8 legislation. It is my hope that, as the appropriations bill moves forward, the committee will adopt the agreements we reached with HUD which will make the program easier to implement and generally more efficient. Solving this problem will rank as one of our best accomplishments for this Congress and I again want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their interest and dedication in putting the section 8 housing program on a sound financial and management footing. 
Unfortunately, while these efforts on the section 8 portfolio should bear real fruit, the committee has been forced to try to squeeze too many high-priority programs into too small a box. There is simply not enough money in this bill to address the overall housing needs we face in this country. 
For example, consider the public housing funding. While public housing has become a much-maligned program, this view is unwarranted. The vast majority of public housing is in good shape. Fewer than 100 of more than 3,300 public housing authorities [PHA's] are troubled. Public housing serves hundreds of thousands of elderly households and nearly 1 1/2 million children. In many neighborhoods, public housing is indistinguishable from the privately owned housing that may be next door. 
As in everything, problems do exist. There are bad housing projects and bad housing authorities. However, the Banking Committee is working on legislation that will require the Secretary to react quickly to put the bad PHA's in receivership and to demolish bad projects. We are also reforming the program to create more mixed-income communities and help make it possible for additional working families to get access to public and assisted housing. In fact, public housing represents about one-third of the housing stock affordable to minimum wage workers in ths country. It is for this reason, among others, that Secretary Cuomo called public housing a precious resource. 
While these reforms will contribute greatly to the overall health of the public housing program, in order to succeed, public housing needs more funding. The bill before us provides $2.9 billion for public housing operating subsidies, the same as this year. Operating subsidies are needed to cover the shortfall between what public housing authorities can collect in rent and what it costs to run the projects. I am pleased that the committee preserved this funding at current levels. 
Even with the committee's best efforts, however, the $2.9 billion covers only about 85 percent of what the PHA's need to pay for their day-to-day operations. We have put public housing authorities in a bind. They are asked to serve the poor, but not given the funding necessary to ensure that they can house the poor adequately. To close the gap, PHAs are forced to put off routine maintenance and small capital projects. In effect, the housing stock faces slow deterioration just so the housing authorities can pay the heating bill. 
The capital account in this bill also stays steady at $2.5 billion. These are much-needed funds, and again, I welcome the committee's effort to protect this crucial spending. But the fact is, the National Commission on Severely Distressed Public Housing said that PHA's need $4.5 billion per year for 10 years to take care of backlogged capital needs, in addition to keeping up with routine maintenance, which, by itself, costs $1.7 billion annually. 
This combination of low operating subsidies and inadequate capital funding means that we are slowly bleeding our public housing stock to death. All the hard work and good intentions of the committee cannot make up for the fact that the chairman and ranking member were simply not given the allocation necessary to fund these crucial housing programs at necessary levels. 
Similarly, homeless funding remains level in this bill, although homelessness, despite good progress, continues to be a serious problem. While economic growth is strong, it has not reached down to the people who live on the bottom rung of society's ladder. In fact, the Conference of Mayors estimates that homelessness increased by 5 percent last year. Moreover, as we try to make public and assisted housing more available to the working poor, a worthy goal that I support, we reduce the number of assisted housing units available to the very worst off in our country. In the end, this will mean more homelessness. In my view, Congress ought to recognize that truth and expand the homeless program. 
One casualty of the fiscal constraints that the committee labored within is the Low Income Housing Preservation and Homeownership Act [LIHPRH], better known as the Preservation Program. This program has preserved over 80,000 units of affordable housing permanently. Another 30,000 units await funding. I urge the committee to work in conference to find some funding for this critical program. I know of the chairman's interest in accomplishing this goal, along with appropriate reforms to the program. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for all their hard work. I support this bill and urge my colleagues to do so, as well. I will continue to work for additional funding for housing programs, and look forward to the day when we are able to adequately address the many existing demands.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished manager of this bill, Senator Stevens, in a colloquy concerning the funding of the operation and maintenance account for the Department of the Army. 
For some time, I have been concerned about the deteriorating conditions of the historic buildings at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center Annex at Forest Glen, MD. In response to my amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act last year, the Department of the Army recently submitted a Comprehensive Plan for the Basic Repair and Stabilization for the Historic District of the Forest Glen Annex. This plan identified the need for $9.8 million in fiscal 1998 to take care of the critical needs for stabilization of the historic buildings at the Forest Glen Annex. 
I want to inquire whether there is sufficient funding within the Army's real property maintenance account to implement this plan.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to support the statement of the majority leader. I don't know what is in these Bosnia amendments, but this is obviously always a difficult and sensitive issue. You know, we are locking in now procedure to try to produce this bill, which I am supportive of. I don't think we ought to put into that mix perhaps acting precipitously on a very complicated issue. I think the majority leader has made a very strong point.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise today to recognize Dr. John Mather, a senior astrophysicist from Hyattsville, MD, who works at the nearby Goddard Space Flight Center [GSFC] in Greenbelt, MD. Dr. Mather has risen to the top of his field and was recently elected to the National Academy of Sciences for his distinguished and continued groundbreaking achievements in the area of original research. 
As a senior Astrophysicist at Goddard, Dr. Mather serves as a Study Scientist for the Next Generation Space Telescope, which will be a successor to the Hubbel Space Telescope. He also serves as chair of the Anomaly Review Board for the HST NICMOS Instrumental as PI for the ARCADE/DIMES mission studies, as PI for a Long Term Astrophysics grant for the study of the anisotropy of the cosmic IR background, as well as other projects that will advance science well into the next century. 
Since joining NASA in 1974, Dr. Mather has received a number of commendations and awards for his cutting edge work in the demanding field of astrophysics. Among his accomplishments are the Group Achievement Award from GSFC, the Exception Achievement Award, the John C. Lindsay Memorial Award, the Group Achievement Award, the Rotary National Space Achievement Award, the National Air and Space Museum Trophy, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Space Science Award, an Honorary Doctor of Science Degree from Swarthmore College, and the Rumford Prize from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
In recent years, Dr. Mather has continued to publish on the topic of the COBE FIRAS Spectrum, the Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer on the Cosmic Background Explorer and other topics, always maintaining his grasp of current scientific discoveries. 
A native of New Jersey, Dr. Mather grew up on the Rutgers University Dairy Research Station where his father worked as a geneticist. He went on to graduate from Swarthmore College with highest honors in Physics. He received his doctorate in Physics in 1974 from the University of California at Berkeley. We in Maryland are certainly delighted that he has since decided to become a member of the Hyattsville community and a prominent member of the NASA presence in the state. 
Mr. President, Dr. Mather's election to the National Academy of Sciences is a tremendous milestone in this public servant's already magnificent career. As Dr. Mather continues to be a rising star in the astrophysics community it is truly an honor to recognize this fine Marylander for his accomplishments and I wish him continued success in future endeavors.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Col. Randall Inouye, Commander of the Baltimore District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Col. Inouye is moving on to a new assignment in the Pentagon and I want to express my appreciation for the fine work that he has done. 
In the 3 short years in which Col. Inouye has commanded the Baltimore District he has proved to be one of the best and most accomplished District Engineers. During his tenure in Baltimore, the colonel helped spearhead Maryland's flood mitigation task force--a Federal, State, and local partnership effort to help communities rebuild after the devastating floods of 1996. This task force is now being used as a model for similar efforts throughout the nation. Under his leadership, the Poplar Island restoration project--the largest habitat restoration project ever undertaken in the United States--was initiated. Poplar Island is the first large-scale project to make beneficial use of dredged material and will help protect and promote the recovery of the Chesapeake Bay while at the same time preserving the vitality of the Port of Baltimore. Similarly, Col. Inouye was responsible for many other important environmental restoration and water resource development activities in the region, including the successful restoration of 32 acres of emergent tidal wetlands at Kenilworth Marsh--the largest and last remaining freshwater tidal wetland on the Anacostia; the Maryland coastal bays initiative; and the Tolchester and Brewerton Channel improvement projects, to name only a few. As District Engineer, Col. Inouye also directed and oversaw the succeessful completion of numerous military construction projects in Maryland from the Army's Research Labs at Aberdeen Proving Ground and Adelphi to the Defense Information School at Fort Meade to the new Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Forest Glen. 
I came to know Col. Inouye shortly after he assumed command of the Baltimore District and have had the privilege of working closely with him over the past three years on many initiatives throughout Maryland, including those mentioned above. In every instance, the Colonel has distinguished himself for his responsiveness and commitment to getting the job done. He has set a new standard of excellence and accomplishment for other District Engineers to emulate. 
In recognition of his outstanding service to the Baltimore District and other commands, Col. Inouye has received numerous awards and commendations including the Legion of Merit, the Meritorious Service Medal and the Army Commendation Medal. But perhaps more importantly, his efforts have earned him the respect and admiration of everyone with whom he has worked. I know that many Marylanders join me in expressing appreciation for his contributions toward improving the quality of life in our State and in wishing him the best in his new endeavors.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts for offering the amendment just voted upon. I think the failure of this amendment dramatically illustrates one of the difficulties plaguing this spending reconciliation bill. This bill, when combined with the tax breaks approved by the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, places a disproportionate share of the burden of deficit reduction on ordinary citizens. You can't consider the spending reconciliation bill separate and apart from the tax bill we will debate later this week; the two are linked in the budget plan. And when considered in connection with the tax cuts we will soon discuss here, the spending cuts in this reconciliation bill reflect a flawed set of priorities for the Nation. 
Now, this spending bill contains program reductions impacting numerous Americans, many of whom face extreme financial difficulty and are at the low end of the income scale. At the same time, the tax bill that is also part of the budget gives benefits to people at the top end of the income and wealth scale. That is the set of priorities that is reflected in this spending bill and in the budget as a whole. 
Take as an example the home health copayment provision just voted upon. As the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out in discussing his amendment, 43 percent of home health users have incomes under $10,000 per year--I repeat, 43 percent have incomes under $10,000 per year. Two-thirds of the people requiring home health visits are women, and one-third of those are women living alone. The Office of Management and Budget has stated: `We are concerned that a copayment could limit beneficiary access to the benefit.' These are the kinds of people affected by the program cuts in this bill such as the one that the Senator from Massachusetts sought to strike--people who lie at the bottom end of the income scale, and who can ill-afford even a $5 copayment requirement. 
At the same time that we require this $5 copayment and other similar cost-cutting provisions, we also include tax cuts in the budget plan. Now, given the objective of a balanced budget, the inclusion of tax cuts in the budget plan necessitates program reductions substantially greater than would be needed to eliminate the deficit if tax breaks were not part of the budget plan. Let me repeat that. Given the objective of a balanced budget, toward which we are all embarked, the inclusion of tax cuts in the budget plan requires program reductions substantially greater than would be needed to eliminate the deficit if tax breaks were not a part of the plan. 
The math is simple. The budget resolution provides for $85 billion in net tax cuts over the next 5 years and $250 billion in net tax cuts over the next 10 years. 
In the framework of a balanced budget, these tax cuts require additional program reductions of $85 billion over the next 5 years and $250 billion over the next 10 years over what would otherwise be required. 
In other words, because you are approving tax cuts, you need to locate program reductions sufficient to offset the tax cuts. Now, the structure of the tax bills reported out by the tax committees makes it clear that those at the very top of the income pyramid will receive very substantial tax breaks--thereby absenting themselves from the deficit reduction effort, indeed shifting the burden to others--while ordinary people will carry a greater burden of program reductions to compensate for the tax breaks. 
Many programs important to ordinary citizens are being reduced to pay for capital gains tax cuts, inheritance tax cuts, and IRA expansion that will benefit the wealthiest people in the Nation. The cuts in Medicare and Medicaid--such as the one the Senate just voted to sustain--are examples of such reductions in vital programs. 
After looking at which Americans are affected by the program reductions in this bill, look at the distributional effects of the tax cuts that are also part of the budget. The tax bills reported from the Finance and Ways and Means Committees give the top 1 percent of the income scale the same percentage of the tax benefits as the bottom 60 percent on the income scale. At the same time, in order to make room for these tax breaks, we are reducing programs such as the one that we just voted on, which impact heavily on people who really cannot afford such reductions.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, Members need to ask themselves whether they support the priorities reflected by these choices. For every dollar lost to the Treasury in tax cuts, a dollar must be added to the Treasury through reductions in programs that are essential to many of our citizens. If there were no tax cuts, or if the tax cuts were less than what is being projected, we wouldn't have to cut the home health program. These two things--tax cuts and program cuts--have to be understood together, even though they have been separated into two bills. The fact of the matter is that the whole budget plan, in order to provide for upper income tax breaks, has to reduce programs to offset the cost of the tax breaks. And the vote we just had is one example of a program that is being reduced. 
So, in assessing this reconciliation bill that is before us, we need to ask ourselves whether providing tax breaks to the very well to do should be a higher priority than adequate funding for programs essential to the well-being of ordinary citizens. On each amendment we have to ask this very question: I repeat, is it more important to give a upper income tax breaks--and, in order to compensate for them, to cut programs such as the very program that we just voted on with respect to home health copayment, a program which clearly helps people at the very lower end of the income scale--or to preserve programs vital to ordinary Americans? 
I think that question needs to be asked again and again as we confront these various proposals to deal with the program reductions that are contained in the reconciliation bill that is before us. 
Mr. President, I would like to address one other item with respect to what we are confronting in this budget debate because it looks to the future. 
Mr. President, the Los Angeles Times just yesterday published an article entitled `Tax-Cut Plans Could Reseed Deficit.' 
I quote: `Analysts liken House and Senate bills as time bombs set to begin detonating shortly after 2002--the target date for balancing the Federal budget.'

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this article points out that under versions of the tax bills approved by the Tax Committees in the two Houses, the revenue loss to the Treasury would take off, starting in the year 2003 and continuing for many years thereafter. What has happened is the tax cuts have been crafted in such a way that they artificially are held down in the early years to stay within the terms of the budget agreement. But because of back loading the principal revenue impact comes in later years. 
Robert Reischauer, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office, said, and I quote him: 
. . . warns that of all the debate surrounding the House and Senate tax bills--whether the reductions are skewed too much toward the wealthy, or whether they would overheat the economy--`this is the critical issue.' 
I again quote him: 
If the tax bill explodes, it will explode just at the time that the baby-boom generation is beginning to retire and when we will need every penny we can get our hands on to pay for Medicaid, housing, transportation, and food stamps. 
Moreover, many of the tax cuts contained in the two bills `would not be easily reversible' if the Government decided that it needed the extra revenue after all to pay for these vital programs. 
The figures are very stark. 
[The figures] . . . compiled by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation show that during the first five years, the tax cuts would result in a net loss to the Treasury of $85 billion--precisely what the budget agreement has allocated . . . 
But the figures also show that the House tax writers have held down the initial costs by phasing in some of the reductions slowly. Once the provisions are fully in effect the cost of the package jumps dramatically. 
As a result, while the House provisions would drain about $18.4 billion from the Treasury in 1999, by 2007, the annual cost would soar to $41.8 billion--more than double the earlier amount. 
So, in other words, you come to the end of the 10-year period upon which limitations have been placed by the budget agreement and you have the revenue loss projected on trend lines that simply take off over the second 10 years. Some estimates have placed this loss at $600 to $700 billion over the next 10 years--2008-17--compared to a $250 billion cost over the first 10 years, 1998-2007. 
The same criticism applies to the Senate Finance Committee version--a little less, but not much. Moreover, as I have noted, both bills threaten the deficit through backloaded, phased-in tax cuts, which principally benefit the wealthy. 
Mr. President, as pointed out in this Los Angeles Times analysis, three of the main provisions in these tax bills--IRA's, capital gains, and inheritance taxes--make heavy use of gimmicks, including delayed effective dates, slow phaseins, and timing shifts in revenue collections to minimize the revenue losses that these tax cuts cause in the early years. But then the costs begin to rise sharply, and they accelerate as you move into the outyears. 
In short, these cuts place the whole deficit reduction effort at risk. 
So we have two things happening here. First of all, the tax cuts are inequitable as we have just seen because you do something like this home health copayment charge at the same time that you give a tax break at the top of the income scale. Forty-three percent of the people who use home health services have incomes of less than $10,000 a year, and now will have to make a payment of up to $760 a year under this bill for home health care before they get some assistance. At the same time you are giving a tax break to people at the top end of the income scale on capital gains, on inheritance tax, and on delayed IRA's. 
Second, the broader question, what Reischauer called the critical issue, is the fact that the tax bill is structured in such a way that the cost of the tax bill will simply take off after the year 2007. It will start moving out after the year 2002, the so-called balance year, and then after the year 2007 it will really take off and we will then be confronted with a major threat to our fiscal stability. As this Los Angeles Times article said, the `Tax-Cut Plans Could Reseed Deficit.' 
The whole purpose of this exercise is to eliminate the deficit, which is not being done. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I sought the 2 minutes because I wanted to respond to the points made by the chairman of the Budget Committee. First of all, he said, if these senior citizens had difficulty with the copayment requirement, they could get Medicaid. That is true if they are at the poverty level or below--approximately $9,000 of income or less. But you have a lot of people that are above the poverty level who cannot afford this, and who, without Federal assistance, will suffer these program reductions at the same time that those at the upper income level receive tax breaks. 
Second, we are told that the distribution tables show that these tax cuts are not going disproportionally to the upper end of the scale. Well, that is because of the backloading gimmicks that are in the tax bill. In fact, the capital gains and IRA proposals on which the distribution tables are based through the year 2002 show no net revenue loss--no net revenue loss--for that 5-year period of time, which is the sole subject of the distribution table. Yet, the combined revenue loss from those provisions for the period 2003 through 2007 is $51 billion. And that is never calculated in the distribution tables, let alone the cost of these tax breaks in the years after 2007, which, as I mentioned before could well be staggering and totally destructive of the deficit reduction effort. 
Moreover, as a consequence of such backloading, the upper income tax provisions account for a growing proportion of the tax package over time. In the year 2003, outside the scope of the distribution tables that the chairman was citing, they will account for 30 percent of the gross cost of the tax cuts. By 2007, the figure is 42 percent. And as you move out into the next decade, they very quickly eat up more than half of the tax breaks. 
Now, the way these cuts are structured makes the Joint Tax Committee analysis an inadequate indicator of the distribution effect of these tax cuts. Because of the way they are structured, with the backloading, a 5-year distribution table shows that they are not costing any revenue. But if you carry the cuts out beyond the 5-year period, they cost very significant revenue. And by the year 2010, it is estimated that a majority of the tax cuts in the package will be directed to the upper income sector of the population. 
Now, as I stated earlier, the fact that you are making those tax cuts requires you, since you are trying to reach a balanced budget, to make program cuts. So you have to look at the tax cuts reported by the committee and weigh them against the program cuts. 
Here you have home health care being cut, with 43 percent of the people who use home health care making under $10,000, and here you also have tax breaks given to people at the very top of the income scale. These are not the right priorities for the Nation.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure today to recognize the Commander of Ft. Ritchie, Lt. Col. James A. LaFleur, who will retire on Tuesday, June 24th, after 20 years of distinguished service for his country. 
A highly decorated soldier and respected leader, Lt. Col. LaFleur also has set standards in an area in which the Army does not give any awards, the Base Realignment and Closure process. With great diplomacy, sensitivity and vision, Lt. Col. LaFleur has presided over this very painful process at Ft. Ritchie, a place rich in history that has proved instrumental in the defense of the United States. Like my colleagues from Maryland and nearby Pennsylvania, I was very surprised and disappointed by the inclusion of Ft. Ritchie in the 1995 round of BRAC closings. The base has provided many good jobs for our constituents and we are all saddened by the Army's departure. 
Under Lt. Col. LaFleur's leadership, however, the BRAC process at Ft. Ritchie has progressed as smoothly as possible. His understanding of the connection between the base and the civilian community led him to work with Washington County, the surrounding areas, and the Local Redevelopment Authority to establish a partnership that has facilitated the transition for Ft. Ritchie's employees. He has reduced the closure time by 50 percent, at the same time that his obvious concern for the base's employees has boosted morale. Lt. Col. LaFleur's efforts in this regard have been recognized by BRAC-affected communities across the nation, as well as by the Army and the Department of Defense. 
The successful redevelopment process has culminated in the decision by the PenMar Development Corporation to turn Ft. Ritchie into a high-tech conference and training facility, where organizations like the International Masonry Institute will use Ft. Ritchie as an international training center, bringing at least 200 good jobs to Washington County. I.M.I. is even considering building a conference center at this bucolic mountain lake park. 
It is quite fitting that the man whose stewardship made much of this possible is the same man who will take the site into the 21st century. I was gratified to learn that, rather than leaving Ft. Ritchie, Lt. Col. LaFleur will dedicate himself to the success of the new PenMar Tech Park, serving as its deputy director. Thus, while the Army is losing an effective administrator and a courageous soldier, Washington County is retaining a respected friend committed to the welfare and economic success of the area. 
Lt. Col. James LaFleur began his military service in 1977 with the 4th Infantry Division at Ft. Carson, Colorado, where he was a platoon leader and battalion officer. Since then, he has served in countries across the globe, including both Iraq and Kuwait, during the Gulf War. For his distinguished service, he earned the Bronze Star Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with second oak leaf cluster, Joint Service Commendation Medal, Army Commendation Medal with fourth oak leaf cluster, Joint Meritorious Unit Award, National Defense Service Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal, and Humanitarian Service Medal. 
Mr. President, Lt. Col. LaFleur's service in the field is matched only by his service to Washington County. His determination and spirit has turned a painful base-closing into an opportunity for economic development, all the while engendering a lasting friendship between Ft. Ritchie and the civilians who live and work in its shadow. `Patriotism,' said Adlai Stevenson, `is not the short and frenzied outburst of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime.' Mr. President, Lt. Col. James A. LaFleur is a true patriot. I congratulate him on his distinguished military career, and look forward to his continued success as a leader in Washington County, Maryland.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment, referring to pages 160 to 162 of the bill, takes out subsection (g), which is a subsection that puts forward the possibility that the United States might withdraw from the United Nations. I am very frank to tell you that I don't think the prospect of that eventuality ought to be raised in this legislation. 
This legislation, in effect, says that if the amount of funds made available for U.S. membership exceed a certain figure, then withdrawal is required. Of course, we determine the amount of funds that are made available. In any event, even if the figure is exceeded, I don't think a withdrawal sanction ought to be incorporated in this legislation. If you stop and think about it, that is quite a sweeping proposition. 
Let me quote from paragraph (2) of that subsection: 
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the United States shall withdraw from an international organization. . . . 
It then goes on to set out the procedures for doing so, and the deadline for doing so. Let me read for a second. 
Unless otherwise provided for in the instrument concerned, a withdrawal under this subsection shall be completed within one year in which the withdrawal is required. 
Then it requires the President to submit a report on the withdrawal. 
I hope that the managers of the bill, upon reflection, will agree with me that we ought not to be including in the legislation any provisions that carry with them the implication of withdrawal from the United Nations. 
The United Nations is too important an organization, and our participation in it is too critical a matter to include in this legislation a provision of this sort. The provision on which I am focusing runs from pages 160 to 162, providing for the withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations. 
My amendment is focused on a limited part of this bill. I have a lot of differences with other parts of this bill, as Members well know. I supported the effort earlier in the day to take out the conditionality of the payment of our arrearages, which did not prove successful. But I am very frank to tell you that I find it a matter of very deep concern--even of dismay--that this legislation should even include within it the possibility for the consideration of the withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations. 
To suggest that we are thinking of withdrawal, or that withdrawal would be required under certain circumstances, in my judgment is very detrimental to our international leadership. It affects our credibility at the United Nations, and around the world. 
What is sought in this bill, to stay within certain funding limitations, is within the control of the Congress in any event. So there would be other ways for the Congress, in making its decision on resources to be provided, to adhere to that standard. But I do not think we should put it in this legislation. 
If we are going to withdraw from the United Nations, we ought to have a full-scale debate about withdrawing from the United Nations. Withdrawal from the United Nations is not some minor course of action to be taken lightly, not some form of discipline to address a problem that can be addressed in other ways. It is a very serious matter. I think even raising the prospect of withdrawal from the United Nations is harmful to American interests. I very much hope the managers of the bill will find it possible to accept this amendment. 
I do not understand why we are, in effect, bringing in the most extreme remedy one could imagine, the one that most sharply affects our international leadership and our position in the United Nations, namely the remedy of withdrawal. I do not think this legislation ought to have any mention of withdrawal from the United Nations and I very much hope we will be able to take this particular section out of this legislation.

Mr. SARBANES. I rise in very strong support of this amendment. The Senator from Indiana stated the arguments in a very cogent and, I think, persuasive fashion. 
Mr. President, we just celebrated 50 years of the Marshall Plan. A couple of years ago we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations. If you read that history, what is clear is the marked contrast between the United States' 
attitude at the end of World War II, at which time we demonstrated strong leadership, and the attitude that is reflected in this legislation. 
This legislation imposes a host of arbitrary and burdensome conditions on the United Nations. If the United Nations fails to achieve them, I am sure the argument will be made, `It's too bad they didn't accede to the conditions we were imposing, and therefore it's their fault that we're not paying these arrears.' Yet, I remind my colleagues, these are arrears which we clearly owe and which we have built up over the years. 
This approach goes directly contrary to the one that was reflected in the exercise of American leadership in both the United Nations and the Marshall plan--an approach which I think ought to characterize our policy toward the United Nations today. 
I think the able Senator from Indiana has rendered a distinct service by focusing the attention of the Senate on this issue. I very much hope my colleagues will support his amendment. It relates solely to payment of arrearages, to dues we already owe. We agreed to pay them under the Charter of the United Nations. Now we are saying, `Well, if you want us to pay our past dues, you've got to agree to reduce our future dues.' 
Now, I support an effort to reduce our future dues, but I do not think it ought to simply be imposed through this unilateral action on the part of the United States. 
The United Nations serves important interests of ours. I think it is critical for the United States to help sustain and preserve a strong United Nations. I very much hope that the amendment of the Senator from Indiana will be adopted. 
Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sadness at learning of the passing of Barry Sklar, a long-time staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who died unexpectedly on Sunday. Barry was well known to a number of Members and staff who had occasion to work with him during the more than a decade he served on the professional staff of the Committee, as an able advisor on Latin American and Caribbean affairs. 
In a recommendation for Barry just a few short months ago, I wrote that he `demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of the issues and great professionalism and integrity in his work.' But that only describes the qualities that led to his intellectual accomplishments and career success. It does not begin to tell why Barry won the personal admiration, friendship and esteem of all who came to know him. 
Barry Sklar was a warm, gentle, kind and unassuming man who was devoted to upholding moral principles in his work and his personal life. Despite his involvement in issues and policies that made frequent headlines, Barry maintained a sense of modesty and great humility. He never forgot that his family came first. 
Throughout the turbulent decade of the 1980's for Latin America, Barry worked for peace and conflict resolution through international cooperation. Due to his work on human rights, as was noted at his funeral, many children today have mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers who might otherwise have been forgotten by the world when they disappeared from their villages. Barry's life reveals his commitment to keeping families safe and together, in his own case and around the world. 
Mr. President, I would like to extend to Barry's wife, Judith, and his sons Joel Mark and Adam Benjamin my deepest condolences. I am sure I speak for my colleagues in expressing these sentiments. He will be greatly missed by all of us. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, this amendment would delete section 1145 in the bill, the section which purports to clarify the remedial authority of the Foreign Service Grievance Board, but which in effect limits the remedial authority of the Foreign Service Grievance Board. I am frank to say I hope we will not do that. 
The section in question would expressly limit the remedial authority of the Foreign Service Grievance Board to those actions specified in section 1107(b) of the Foreign Service Act. 
Now, as I understand the Department's thinking in this matter, they believe it is necessary to prevent the Board from relying on other statutes as authority for directing remedies that are not contained within section 1107(b) of the act. Those would include the award of liquidated damages in cases that fall under the Fair Labor Standards Act, and compensatory damages in discrimination cases. 
Section 1101(a) of the Foreign Service Act provides the Grievance Board with jurisdiction in cases alleging the violation, misinterpretation, or misapplication of applicable law. Thus Congress has given the Foreign Service Grievance Board the authority to decide grievances under other laws, including the Fair Labor Standards Act and the equal employment opportunity laws. 
It would seem to me that if we have given them the authority to decide grievances under these other laws, that it was our intention that the Board would have the authority to provide the remedies available under those laws. And those remedies, in particular, are the liquidated damages available under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the compensatory damages under the EEO laws. 
In other words, the Grievance Board ought to retain the authority to provide remedies under the laws over which it has jurisdiction. 
Of course, first a grievant must be successful in pressing a claim. The question is, having won the grievance, what remedies are available? 
Now, the Foreign Service Grievance Board's own regulations provide broad remedial authority. If the Board finds that a grievance is meritorious, the Board is authorized to `take any corrective action' it deems appropriate that is not contrary to law or the applicable collective bargaining agreement. 
Furthermore, the act requires the Foreign Service Grievance Board to apply the substantive law that would be applied by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for all grievances alleging a violation of the equal employment opportunity laws. 
If the Grievance Board is directed to apply the substantive law that would be applied by the EEOC, I see no reason in the world why it would not be able to apply the remedy that would be available to an EEO action. In other words, I am just trying to ensure that the Grievance Board is able to provide appropriate remedies. 
These remedies, liquidated damages and compensatory damages, are available under the Fair Labor Standards Act and the EEO laws, and those laws have no exemption in them for the Department of State or other foreign affairs agencies. Nor do they provide any rationale for excluding the foreign affairs agencies from laws with which that every other Federal agency must comply. 
I am fearful that by denying or limiting the remedial authority of the Foreign Service Grievance Board, the effect of section 1145 would be to require those with grievances to go into court, or through the EEOC, rather than through the grievance procedure, because the grievance procedure would not be able to provide them full relief. I can't believe that this is the kind of arrangement we want to have. 
It seems to me that it makes eminent good sense that the Grievance Board, which has the authority to apply these other statutes in its substantive determinations, ought to have the authority to provide remedies to correct violations. The limitation that is sought to be placed on the remedial authority of the Board would unfairly disadvantage foreign service officers with grievances, whose cases may be quite legitimate. 
This is an important issue for people with grievances, and I think we must be careful in working out the statutory arrangements by which they have their grievances resolved. For the life of me, I don't understand why we would deny to the Board the remedial authorities that I have outlined here. I hope that the managers of the bill will find this amendment acceptable.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this amendment would add a section to the bill to clarify a previous action taken by the Congress, which, in effect, was too broad, too expansive, and caused unnecessary difficulties. I support the general purpose of the existing law, which was to prevent conflicts of interest in negotiating management-labor disputes. I am in favor of trying to deal with that problem. But it now appears that we went too far in trying to do so. 
The amendment I am now offering would narrow the definition of `management official' to a more appropriate group. A similar provision, I believe, was included in the companion to this bill recently adopted by the House of Representatives. 
Let me briefly try to outline the situation. In the early 1990s, the Congress amended the 1980 Foreign Service Act, placing restrictions on the movement of foreign service personnel between certain positions in the American Foreign Service Association, which is the organization that represents foreign service employees, and management jobs in the foreign affairs agencies. The Act was amended to prohibit any individual who served as an agency management official or confidential employee during the preceding 2 years from participating in the management of the American Foreign Service Association for the purposes of collective bargaining or representing them in such bargaining. And, conversely, any individual who had participated in AFSA management for the purposes of collective bargaining, or who represented AFSA at the bargaining table, is precluded, for 2 years, from serving as a management official or confidential employee. So for 2 years, such officials could not move in either direction. 
I have no quarrel with the purpose of that amendment, which was to prohibit a foreign service employee from moving from one side of the table to the other in labor-management negotiations. However, I think the definition of `management,' as we try to deal with this problem that is currently in the law, is too broad because it can encompass officials who play no role in labor-management relations or the formation of personnel policy. 
This broad definition creates an obvious problem for people who might otherwise want to participate in the American Foreign Service Association and hold responsible positions in that organization. If they become officers in AFSA, and then in that capacity participate in labor-management relations--which in many instances is part of the job--they would be precluded from a whole range of potential posts within the agencies. 
The amendment I am offering would narrow the definition of `management official' by exempting chiefs of mission, principal officers or their deputies, administrative and personnel officers abroad, who are not involved--I emphasize `not involved'--in the formulation of the personnel policies and programs of the Department. 
In other words, we would continue the protection against conflicts of interest by covering only those officials who are involved in labor-management relations or personnel policies and programs. And so a foreign service officer who is in any way involved with those issues on behalf of the Department may not move into an AFSA position involving those issues for 2 years. 
Likewise, someone who has served in an AFSA position that involves labor-management relations may not take a management position in a foreign affairs agency for 2 years that would involve these issues. But this amendment would not prohibit, for instance, someone who was an officer in AFSA from becoming a Deputy Assistant Secretary in a regional bureau that has nothing to do with developing personnel policies or programs. 
At the moment, the broad limitation has a rather chilling effect on people who are willing to assume a responsible role in AFSA. They say to themselves, `If I do that, for 2 years I am blocked out of taking a whole host of positions in the foreign affairs agencies.' Of course, AFSA represents the employees in all of the foreign affairs agencies. Its officers are being prevented from taking a wide range of subsequent assignments. 
I don't think this was the intent of the statute. I agree with the basic effort to preclude any conflict of interest, and this amendment in fact accepts the proposition that you ought not to be able to go from one side of the bargaining table to the other. But my amendment seeks to limit the current provision's coverage so that it does not exclude former AFSA officers from responsible positions in the foreign affairs agencies that really don't involve the bargaining table. That is the amendment.

Mr. SARBANES. Which is, of course, a very important stepping stone on the career of a Foreign Service officer. I take it that currently, the DCM is regarded as a `management official.' Even though the deputy chief of mission is not involved in labor-management negotiations, or in developing department-wide personnel policies, he or she does administer an Embassy. 
So the question then is, should you keep someone who has been an officer in the Foreign Service Association from being able to accept such a position? I don't think we should. I do think they should be prohibited from becoming involved with labor-management negotiations.

<TEXT>
Mr. SARBANES. I commend the very able Senator from Indiana for offering this amendment and for, in effect, crystallizing this issue on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
I share his view that this is an extremely serious matter and that the American commitment to the United Nations, despite various assertions we are hearing to the contrary, in fact may be in the process of being seriously eroded. This is a very important amendment. 
It is my own strongly held view that the interests of the United States have been served by our Nation's active participation in the United Nations and the U.N. system. Over the years, since the end of World War II, the U.N. often has been an effective means of promoting U.S. foreign policy interests. When we work with and through the United Nations, we can leverage our resources and our influence in order to achieve a much greater impact than we could unilaterally. 
Why do we go to the U.N. and seek these resolutions to sanction various actions we take around the world to serve and protect our national security interests? Because it gives us an international mandate to pursue a course of action, and frequently elicits contributions from other countries. Sometimes, in fact, the other countries are the ones who put their troops on the line, not the United States, in order to accomplish objectives that we regard as important. 
Now, in the last decade, our status as the U.N.'s biggest debtor has affected our credibility and undermined our leadership with our allies and within the international community. The United States owes over $1 billion to the U.N. for regular activities and peacekeeping, more by far than any other country. Our arrearages are nearly two-thirds of the total amount owed by all countries to the United Nations. 
There has been a misperception that the U.N. can somehow dictate policies to the United States and force us to undertake actions that do not serve American interests. 
This is simply not the case. Nothing could be further from the truth. U.N. peacekeeping operations cannot be established without the concurrence of the United States. Of all of these various peacekeeping operations, none of them could have happened without American concurrence in their going forward. 
As a key member of the Security Council, we are one of five countries with veto power over all resolutions that are considered by the council. We have a veto power that, in effect, can prevent any action of which we disapprove from taking place. 
As a country, we pride ourselves for following the rule of law and holding our citizens responsible for meeting various legal obligations. In fact, we try to get other countries to follow our example and live up to those standards, both domestically and internationally. It is frequently a tremendous challenge to get countries to respect the basic rights of their citizens and to act in accordance with international law. 
We ourselves are not now meeting those high standards, as they relate to the United Nations. We undertook commitments under the U.N. Charter, and we have a responsibility to make good on them. The starting point here must be a recognition that this is an obligation that we freely undertook, upon which we have defaulted. We have not met our responsibilities. 
Now, this legislation, first of all, does not provide money to meet all of our arrears. There has been a negotiating process between Members of the Congress and the administration. The United Nations says, well, this is what we think the United States owes--$1.3 billion and some. The administration says, no, we think we owe just over $1.0 billion. This legislation has in it just over $800 million. It does not even have the figure which the administration states is what we owe to the United Nations, let alone the figure which the United Nations asserts that we owe. 
The gap between the United Nation's assertion and the administration's position is largely the consequence of a unilateral action by the United States lowering its peacekeeping assessment from 31 percent to 25 percent. We just came along and said to the organization, well, we are going to cut it, just like we are doing here now on regular assessments. This is an organization with clear procedures for working out these responsibilities, and we are simply telling them what the situation is going to be. 
Now, I have no doubt that if some other country, delinquent in meeting its obligations, showed up with the demands that we have put in this legislation, we would be absolutely outraged. We would say, who do they think they are and what do they think they are doing? They had these obligations and now they are coming in and rewriting them unilaterally and imposing these conditions. 
These are conditions on past obligations. This is not looking to the future. This isn't saying, well, we rethought the matter and we don't really want to be part of this organization, unless it does such and such and so and so in the future. 
These are past obligations. These are instances in which many countries have gone out and have put their people at risk, at our encouragement as a matter of fact, and now we come along and we refuse to pay the bill. We are refusing, in effect, to reimburse other countries for sending their troops on peacekeeping missions that we have voted for. Many countries have done that. They have gone and sent their troops, put their troops' lives on the line in order to accomplish these objectives. Our responsibility in most of those instances was to provide the money to cover the activities, activities they were performing for us and for the entire world. Those missions have been accomplished. The bill has not been paid. 
The approach taken by Senator Lugar would seek to address our previous obligations in a very straightforward manner, and he also, as I understand it, has a proposal to fully meet current obligations, thereby enabling us to break out of the cycle of growing debts and waning influence. 
Now, it is asserted here that we are not trying to micromanage 
the United Nations. We just went through this tremendous struggle at the United Nations to get a new Secretary General. The United States was a moving force in that effort and, from all indications, was happy with the change that took place. Now we are throwing a burden on the new Secretary General which I have serious concerns that he can sustain. 
I want to go through just a few of the kinds of conditions that are going to be imposed here. I urge my colleagues to take a copy of S. 903 and go through it to see the kind of regime it establishes. Ask yourselves whether this is consistent with our Nation's participation in the U.N. for over 50 years now, as governed by the charter. 
First of all, we say that $80 million can only be made available semiannually every year on a certification that the United Nations hasn't taken any actions that raise their budget over what had been projected. What happens if we get a new peacekeeping responsibility? What happens if there is an outbreak of hostilities somewhere, and finally to help bring it under control the United Nations takes action, as it has done in other places, and there are costs associated with that action? Well, I take it, if they do that without finding an offset--even with our support--we must withhold the money. 
Twenty percent of the funds made available each fiscal year are going to be withheld to comply with a certification that is contained on pages 158 and 159; $50 million is going to be withheld from disbursement until the Secretary of State certifies that they have cut a thousand posts from the United Nations--995 won't do it; you have to have 1,000. Then the following fiscal year we will withhold $50 million from disbursement until there is a certification that the United Nations is running a vacancy rate of not less than 5 percent. 
Now, this isn't negotiated with the United Nations. This is not the outcome of extended discussions as to what the United Nations is going to do. This is the Congress telling the United Nations that this is what it must do. So, in effect, we are saying that we are going to run your organization and all you other countries who pay the bulk of the cost will have to live with it. I would note that even with our large assessments, we are still a minority payor in the U.N. overall. 
Then there is a provision, which I hope to address later, that provides for our withdrawal from the United Nations. We have finally come to the point in this legislation where there is a serious proposition for withdrawal of the United States from the United Nations--not an argument about how much we ought to pay, not an argument about how fast we pay the arrearages, but provisions that set out a process for withdrawal. I am frank to tell you that I never thought I would see the day we would be facing this. We ought to confront this challenge head on. If that is the agenda that is behind all of this, we ought to fight it out on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
There are additional conditions that appear in different places throughout this legislation. It is not until you identify them all and look at them all--they are not all in one place--and go through them that you begin to appreciate how heavy a burden is being created here. This bill provides, as the newspaper stories explain today, that if the U.N. does not meet all the benchmarks, they don't get the money. 
There was a press conference up in New York where some suggested that these `benchmarks' were only guidelines. But, clearly, they are not simply guidelines. In fact, they are written as binding conditions which, if adopted by the full Congress, will become U.S. law. So this legislation moves beyond suggestions, recommendations, or proposals. These conditions would be mandatory elements of U.S. law, and would have to be carried out. 
Now, there is another provision here that, in the next fiscal year, in order to release the money, there has to be a certification by the Secretary of State that the assessed contributions of the United States for the regular budget of the 
United Nations have been cut from 25 to 22 percent and the following year from 22 to 20 percent. Now, I think trying to negotiate such a reduction is acceptable as a goal or an objective of U.S. policy. But this isn't negotiating a reduction, this is a unilateral condition on which the payment of our arrearages depends. 
Here is what we are doing. We are coming along and we are saying we are not going to pay all of our arrearages. We are not even going to pay the amount that our own Government has said we owe. We are going to fall short on that score. Moreover, we are going to create new arrearages. So it is not as though we come in and say, yes, we are going to pay all of our arrearages, we will pay our current assessment in full. We do neither of those two things. 
Then we provide those partial repayments under a whole set of conditions, including that the United Nations reduces our assessment--a matter which, under the U.N. process, needs to be negotiated and arrived at by consensus. 
I ask Members again to stop and think what their reaction would be if another country showed up in this heavy-handed way and started insisting that this is what would have to be done in order for them to pay up the obligations which they owe. I daresay we would not give them the time of day. So we fall short on meeting the arrearages, we fall short on the current payment, and then we tie these payments to a whole set of conditions. In effect, we say to the United Nations: Well, if you want to get any of this money, you have to do all of this. 
Now, I think we must proceed on the basis of careful consideration of the United Nations and its role and its importance. If there are those who don't think we ought to stay in the United Nations, we ought to have that debate. As I have indicated, I think the United Nations overall has served our interests. That doesn't mean we agree with every single thing they have done or we necessarily think that it has been run in an exemplary fashion. It has had its ups and downs, no question about it. 
But the real question is: How did the United States approach the U.N.? How is the United States going to exercise its international leadership in the post-cold war-period? Is the United States simply going to dictate, to simply throw its weight around, and say, `Well, we are going to make these unilateral judgments. Congress discussed this; now we are going to bring it to the United Nations, and you had better take it, or else?' 
They held a press conference in New York the other day. Our Ambassador and one of our colleagues at the outset of this press conference tried in effect to portray the benchmarks as mere suggestions. But that portrayal comes at odds with what Senator Helms said in introducing the bill. He said, and I quote from his statement, `Most importantly, this bill would prohibit the payment by the American taxpayers of any so-called U.N. arrears until'-- with the `until' underlined--`these congressionally mandated benchmarks have been met by the U.N.' 
He continues, `The message to the United Nations is simple but clear: no reform, no American taxpayer money for arrears.' That doesn't sound like a suggestion. 
So that is where we find ourselves. I mean we are now at the point where we are going to dictate these conditions. I think it is going to cause us great difficulty at the United Nations. In fact, I think the committee's approach of seeking unilaterally to impose an American position on the United Nations may well alter the very nature of our relationship with the U.N. to our own detriment, let alone to our relationship with some of the major actors at the U.N. Many of them are our closest allies over the years and are very much interested in how the United States revolves this matter. 
So I commend the Senator from Indiana for bringing this issue forward.

Mr. SARBANES. Are these obligations to our friends, to which the Senator has referred, those instances in which our allies undertook actions under the umbrella authority of the United Nations, often with the use of their own troops, to carry out activities which the United States supported, which the United States made the judgment served our own national security interests?

Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further, in fact, in some of those instances, while we wanted the activity done, we were unwilling to commit our own forces directly in order to do it, and the problem was then resolved by the willingness of other countries to commit their forces in order to carry out these important activities; was that not the case?

Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further, in fact, if we cannot continue to work this way, I take it that if confronted with a crisis abroad, our choices would either be to do nothing or to become involved unilaterally and directly, by ourselves. We would lose what, it seems to me, has been a very effective weapon for serving U.S. interests without necessarily committing the 
United States directly in the activity. Would that be correct?

Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield on that very point, it was my very strongly held impression that obtaining the resolution of the Security Council, in effect, gave legitimacy to the strongly driven U.S. action, in terms of international approval that otherwise would have been lacking or missing in the situation. 
We treat these U.N. participations as though they don't count for very much. Yet, around the world, the fact that the United States has gone to the United Nations and gotten the United Nations to approve it, gives a legitimacy to the activity that might not be there, at least in the eyes of some countries, if the United States were simply to undertake it directly, without this approbation from the international community.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week we mark the second anniversary of the National Home Ownership Week. I rise to join with my constituents and citizens across the Nation to celebrate the efforts to promote and expand the rate of home ownership in this country. 
It is my view that home ownership activities foster and encourage the revitalization of neighborhoods. Home ownership stabilizes local communities by providing families with a renewed sense of civic responsibility and commitment to the well-being of their neighborhoods. In addition, home ownership is one of the single most important vehicles for personal financial growth and wealth accumulation. New home ownership encourages investment and job growth in areas where such investment has been lacking. While a majority of Americans today are homeowners, many moderate and low income families are unable to overcome the economic barriers to owning a home. The National Home Ownership Week is part of the national strategy to make the dream of home ownership a reality for these families. 
Study after study has demonstrated that many families with high enough incomes to buy homes and who may, in fact, be paying as much in rent as they would be in mortgage payments, are locked out of home ownership because they cannot generate the down payment or closing costs necessary. Helping families to surmount those barriers, and then providing them with mortgages at affordable rates so that they can become home owners, means moving those families toward long-term economic security. Therefore, it is imperative that we work to increase the availability of credit and affordable mortgages for moderate and low income families who labor to own their piece of the American dream. 
The number of local events being held across the country to celebrate National Home Ownership Week now exceeds 600. In my state of Maryland, I had the privilege of attending an event in Wheaton, MD, to announce the `Home Ownership Montgomery' initiative as part of this week's celebration of home ownership activities. I was proud to stand with representatives from the Montgomery County Housing Opportunities Commission, the county government, Fannie Mae and other dedicated housing advocates. As part of the strategy to increase the number of Maryland home owners, Montgomery County has partnered with Fannie Mae to make millions of dollars of low interest loans available to low income families who need assistance with closing costs and mortgage payments. It is my hope that these efforts and numerous others will increase the current home ownership rate in Maryland from 65.9 percent to 67.5 percent, the national goal set by the National Partners in Home Ownership. 
The success of National Home Ownership Week is made possible by many innovative public-private partnerships. In this age of shrinking Federal resources, partnerships have leveraged funds to support millions of dollars in home ownership activities. National organizations such as the Local Initiatives Support Corporation and the Enterprise Foundation, local nonprofits and for-profits such as Interfaith Housing of Western Maryland, and local governments have developed thousands of homes for low income families. I salute these combined efforts to rebuild local communities. At the same time, we must not forget that federal funding for affordable housing assistance and homeless individuals has been on the decline. The dream of home ownership is a dream that many families of varied incomes desire. It is my hope that National Home Ownership Week will not only help to raise the awareness of the need for increased home ownership, but at the same time, heighten the public's consciousness of the benefits of providing affordable housing for all families.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered together with Chairman D'Amato to H.R. 1306 would make three changes in the legislation. 
First, it would make the title of the legislation the Riegle-Neal Amendments Act of 1997. This reflects the fact that this legislation makes significant substantive changes to current law, and is not merely a clarification or technical change. 
Second, the amendment requires that no provision of subsection 24(j) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended by H.R. 1306, shall be construed as affecting the applicability of Federal law to State banks and State bank branches in the home State or the host State. There was a concern that subsection 24(j)(1), as amended by H.R. 1306, could have the unintended result of Federal law not applying to a branch in a host State of an out-of-State State bank that would apply to the bank in its home State. 
Third, the amendment would require the Comptroller of the Currency to conduct an annual review of the actions it has taken with regard to the applicability of State law to national banks or their branches during the preceding year, and include in its annual report to Congress the results of the review and the reasons for each action. The first such review and report after the enactment of this legislation shall encompass all such actions taken on or after January 1, 1992. 
There are a couple of reasons for the inclusion of this reporting requirement in this amendment. First, under current law, actions by the Comptroller preempting State law only benefit branches of national banks in the affected State. H.R. 1306 would expand the applicability of those preemption decisions to branches of out-of-State State banks. Given this significant expansion of the consequences of the Comptroller's preemption decisions, it seems reasonable and important to require the Comptroller to include in its annual report to Congress a review and explanation of these decisions. 
In addition, when Congress enacted the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act in 1994, it specifically provided that State laws regarding consumer protection, community reinvestment, fair lending, and intrastate branching apply to the branches of State and national banks. The act provided that this set of State laws would not apply if Federal law preempts the application of such State laws to a national bank, or if the Comptroller of the Currency determines that the application of such State laws would have a discriminatory effect on the branch in comparison with the effect the application of such State laws would have with respect to branches of a bank chartered by the host State. 
Concerns have been raised by consumer groups, both before and since the enactment of Riegle-Neal, that the Comptroller has undertaken preemptive actions which were unnecessarily expansive. The conference report which accompanied the enactment of the Riegle-Neal Act specifically addressed this point. The report stated: 
The Conferees have been made aware of certain circumstances in which the Federal banking agencies have applied traditional preemption principles in a manner the Conferees believe is inappropriately aggressive, resulting in preemption of state law in situations which the federal interest did not warrant that result. One illustration is OCC Interpretive letter No. 572, dated January 15, 1992, from the OCC to Robert M. Jaworski, Assistant Commissioner, State of New Jersey Department of Banking, concluding that national banks in New Jersey are not required to comply with the New Jersey Consumer Checking Account. It is of utmost concern to the Conferees that the agencies issue opinion letters and interpretive rules concluding that Federal law preempts state law regarding community reinvestment, consumer protection, fair lending, or establishment of intrastate branches only when the agency has determined that the Federal policy interest in preemption is clear. In the case of Interpretive Letter No. 572, it is the sense of the Conferees that the fact the Congress has acknowledged the benefits of more widespread use of lifeline accounts through the enactment of the Bank Enterprise Act did not indicate that Congress intended to override State basic banking laws, or occupy the area of basic banking services to such an extent as to displace State laws, or that the existence of State basic banking laws frustrated the purpose of the Congress. 
The ruling referred to in the conference report has been under review by the OCC but has not been changed. Other actions have been taken by the Comptroller since the enactment of Riegle-Neal which have raised similar concerns. For example, in 1996 the OCC finalized a regulation exempting national banks from State laws protecting consumers from high credit card fees. 
Given these concerns, and the more expansive application the OCC's rulings will have as a result of H.R. 1306, it is important for the Comptroller to report to the Congress annually on its preemption actions, if any, and the rationale for the preemptions.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as we mark the annual celebration of Small Business Week, I take great pleasure in acknowledging the achievements of the estimated 22.1 million small businesses in this country. Small businesses play an integral role in the American economy, generating half the gross domestic product, and driving America forward in terms of product development, employment, and ingenuity. 
Small businesses employ more than 50 percent of our private work force and have been credited with the creation of two out of every three jobs. Studies have also shown that they produce more than twice as many significant innovations per employee as large firms. But beyond the statistics, the successes of small businesses continue to prove that the American dream is still a reality. 
Small businesses provide most American workers with their first jobs. And for each job that a small business creates, one more American has the opportunity to prosper. Small businesses also play a major role in moving our economy forward, creating jobs, generating revenue, and developing new products and services that keep American business on the cutting edge. 
In my own State of Maryland, we have seen the extraordinary things that can be accomplished when creative entrepreneurs are determined to succeed. I want to share just a few of those stories. 
The 1997 Maryland Small Business Person of the year is Jamie Clark, who began his Internet service company, ClarkNet, out of a family barn in Ellicott City, MD. Jamie is deaf, and recognized the Internet as a powerful resource, a place where he and other deaf people could conduct business as easily as the hearing. With a $35,000 loan and three volunteers, who were also deaf, Jamie built a company that today employs well over 30 people and had sales totaling $2.5 million last year, up from less than $60,000 when ClarkNet began just 4 years ago. 
As someone with deep roots in Maryland--Jamie's grandfather was a circuit court judge in Howard County and his father a State senator for 24 years, 4 of those as president of the Senate--Jamie is an active member of the community, serving on the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Entrepreneurs Council, the Howard County Chamber of Commerce, the Better Business Bureau, and the Baltimore-Washington Venture Group. 
Maryland's Small Business Exporter of the Year last year, Bruce Lawson of Finksburg, MD, has turned a hobby into a business that is an industry leader. Bruce started his company, Brass Instruments, after helping his father--a retired french horn player in the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra--repair his friends' musical instruments. Appalled at the quality of the horns they were repairing, Bruce started making horns himself. Today, Brass Instruments is the top french horn maker in the world. 
Another former Maryland Small Business Person of the Year is Dorothy White, of Columbia, MD, who started cleaning houses when her husband fell ill. Dorothy's work was so impressive that her employers began asking her to clean their offices as well. What 
evolved was Dorothy's multimillion-dollar business, Miracle Services. Like many Maryland businesses, Dorothy's company also has flourished under the 8(a) program, through which she has received numerous Government contracts. 
The 1995 Regional Small Business Exporter of the Year also hails from Maryland. After immigrating from Poland to Baltimore, Jon Sakowski realized that plastic piping could make all the difference in Poland's plumbing system. When he could not find a Polish buyer who could afford the product, Jon began installing the piping for free in Poland's churches, schools, and hospitals. Then, taking a major financial risk, Jon exported the piping to Poland--without a buyer--and warehoused it himself, selling the piping off piece by piece rather than in bulk. 
We in Maryland are very proud of individuals like Jamie Clark, Bruce Lawson, Dorothy White, Jon Sakowski and the many other operators of small businesses in our State who, often beginning with very little, have accomplished so much. More than 97.8 percent of Maryland's full-time firms have fewer than 500 employees, and there are an additional 131,000 individuals who are self-employed. The significance of these businesses to Maryland's economy is evident in study after study, such as the Small Business Administration's recent report that Maryland firms with fewer than 20 employees increased employment by 10.4 percent between 1991 and 1995. 
Minority-owned businesses also have made great strides in recent years. Between 1987 and 1992, Maryland's number of women-owned businesses rose by 48.7 percent, its number of African-American owned firms rose 65 percent and its number of Hispanic-owned firms rose 148.7 percent. 
Yet despite this progress, much remains to be done. Minority-owned firms in Maryland are selling 30 percent below the national average, and bankruptcies and failures have increased. Given the important economic and social roles played by minority-owned businesses, it is essential that we strengthen our efforts to help these underserved markets succeed. 
Mr. President, as someone who has benefited personally from the opportunities afforded to small business in this country--I spent my youth working in my parents' Greek restaurant on Maryland's Lower Eastern Shore--I know how important it is to small business owners, employees, and customers that they continue to thrive. Small business success not only translates into jobs and economic growth, it also translates into a sense of pride and self-respect on the part of owners and workers and the heartening affirmation that the American dream is still alive.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, since 1963 when President Kennedy began this important tradition, May has been designated `Older Americans Month,' a time set aside each year for our country to honor senior citizens for their many accomplishments and contributions to our Nation. 
Those of us who have worked diligently in the U.S. Senate to ensure that older Americans are able to live in dignity and independence during their retirement years, look forward to this opportunity to pause and reflect on the contributions of those individuals who have played such a major role in the shaping of our great Nation. We honor them for their hard work and the countless sacrifices they have made throughout their lifetimes, and look forward to their continued contributions to our country's welfare. 
Today's senior citizens have witnessed more technological advances than any other generation in our Nation's history. Seniors today have lived through economic depressions and recessions, times of war and peace, and incredible advancements in the fields of science, medicine, transportation and communications. It is imperative that we address the needs of these Americans who have devoted so much of their life experience and achievement to the betterment of our society. The celebration of Older Americans Month provides us with the opportunity to highlight the importance of reauthorizing the Older Americans Act. As a vigorous and consistent supporter of measures to benefit senior citizens, I am pleased to be a past cosponsor and strong supporter of this important legislation. First enacted in 1965, the Older Americans Act has evolved from its original mandate to promote independent living among those older citizens with the greatest social and economic need into today's dynamic network of community and home-based services so critical to many of our Nation's seniors. 
The need for such legislation becomes especially apparent in light of current demographic trends. Senior citizens today comprise more than 12 percent of the country's population. Baby boomers, who represented one-third of all Americans in 1994, will enter the 65-years-and-older category over the next 13-34 years, substantially increasing this segment of our population. In my own State of Maryland, more than 768,400 individuals are over the age of 60, representing 15 percent of Maryland's total population. By the year 2020, that percentage is expected to increase to just over 23 percent. These demographic transformations pose significant challenges and opportunities and the Older Americans Act provides an excellent framework from which to address these challenges as we move into the next century. It is not enough to just honor our senior citizens. We must continue to enact meaningful legislation which will help meet the needs of this valuable and constantly expanding segment of our society. 
The theme of this year's celebration is `Caregiving: Compassion in Action.' In my view, it is most appropriate that--as the percentage of the population over age 65 continues to grow--we take this opportunity to focus on how we, as a society, will care for our seniors. It is, therefore, incumbent upon us all to be prepared to both understand and address the needs of our seniors as they become an increasingly larger segment of American society. Many of us are already addressing this serious need. The Administration on Aging estimates that each day, as many as five million senior citizens in the United States are recipients of care from more than 22 million informal caregivers. As programs such as Medicare and Medicaid continue to feel the pressures of the current Federal budget process, the noble and compassionate work of these dedicated individuals is particularly critical. 
Mr. President, I have always believed strongly in the potential of this significant and growing population to contribute to the development of policies that effect all Americans. Our Nation's seniors are an ever-growing resource that deserves our attention, our gratitude, and our heart-felt respect. As observance of Older American Month comes to a close, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate in implementing public policies which affirm the contributions of older Americans to our society and ensure that they continue to thrive with dignity.

Mr. SARBANES. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. President, in 1993, just 4 years ago, in order to reduce the deficit, the Congress, by a narrow margin, enacted a budget resolution which curtailed programs and increased taxes. The increase in taxes primarily impacted those at the upper end of the income scale. 
This combination of spending restraint and revenue increases represents a logical way of dealing with the deficit issue. When you are trying to reduce and then eliminate the deficit, the logical way to do it is to restrain spending and to seek additional revenues. That combination, presumably, will result in lowering your deficits. 
This approach has worked in a most impressive way. A flourishing economy has brought unemployment below 5 percent for the first time in 24 years. This chart shows the unemployment rate going back to 1971. As you can see, with one exception, the unemployment rate now is the lowest it has been in this period. Back here, in 1973, is when it just dipped below 5 percent. It has now gone below 5 percent again. 
While unemployment is at a 24-year low, inflation is at a 31-year low, as is shown by this next chart, which shows the inflation rate from 1966 to 1996. 
I do not know what better proof one can offer of a strong economy than the low unemployment rate and the low inflation rate we are now experiencing. 
As a consequence of this flourishing economy, the deficit has declined on a steady basis since fiscal year 1992. In fiscal year 1992, the deficit was at $290 billion. And it has come down in each succeeding year, to $255 billion in 1993, $203 billion in 1994, $164 billion in 1995, and to $107 billion in the last fiscal year, the year that ended this past September 30. It is now expected to be below $70 billion for the current fiscal year. In other words, we will have gone from a $290 billion deficit in 1992 on a straight downward trend, and we are expecting a deficit under $70 billion for the fiscal year in which we now find ourselves. 
As a percent of the gross domestic product, the deficit has declined in a most impressive way, from 4.9 percent in 1992 to 1.4 percent for the fiscal year that ended this past September 30. As you can see from this next chart, it declined from 4.9 percent in 1992 to 4.1 percent in 1993 to 3.1 percent in 1994 to 2.3 percent in 1995 to 1.4 percent in the fiscal year ending September 30, and it is now anticipated that the deficit as a percent of gross domestic product will be less than 1 percent for the current fiscal year, the lowest percentage since 1974. 
So you have the best unemployment rate in 24 years, the lowest inflation in 31 years, the lowest deficit as a percent of GDP in 23 years. 
By way of comparison, the Maastricht Agreement of the European Community, which established what are regarded as tough requirements for the member nations, has as its goal the bringing of deficits down to under 3 percent of GDP--3 percent. We, at the end of this year, will be down to less than 1 percent. 
In fact, just comparing the United States with the other major industrial countries, we see from this chart that our deficit as a share of GDP is 1.4 percent. Japan is at 3.1 percent, Germany at 3.5 percent, Canada at 4.2 percent, France at 5 percent, the United Kingdom at 5.1 percent, and Italy at 7.2 percent. 
Now, by any measure, this is a most impressive economic performance, and certainly a very impressive deficit reduction performance. 
Given this performance, one would think that the wise policy would be to stay the course and finish the job. I mean, this is a spectacular course that I have outlined here that we have been following. So one would assume that the wise policy would be to stay the course and finish the job. Instead, the budget resolution before us combines spending restraint with tax cuts--I repeat, spending restraint with tax cuts. 
Obviously, spending restraint, as in 1993, works in the direction of deficit reduction. As I said at the outset, that is logical. You are trying to bring the deficit down. Spending restraint works in the direction of deficit reduction. But tax cuts work against deficit reduction. And the tax cuts contained in this budget agreement will grow over time in a way that may well jeopardize the goal of reaching and staying--and staying--in budget balance. 
The capital gains, inheritance, and IRA tax cuts, all of which are provided for in the tax portion of this budget agreement, carry with them the potential for substantial increases in future years. 
In fact, this budget agreement recognizes such a trend line by providing for $85 billion net tax cuts in the first 5 years, 1998 to 2002, and almost double that, a net tax cut of $165 billion, in the next 5 years, 2003 to 2007. No agreements were made as to the following decade. But obviously, if we are concerned about the future strength and viability of the economy, it is important to look to the out years, to have some sense of where these trend lines may be taking us. 
The budget agreement itself, in the tables accompanying the text of the agreement, projects that in the 10th year of the agreement--in other words, at the end of the period when we are to have a total of $250 billion in tax cuts--the tax cuts would be $42 billion. Now this represents a rising trend line with respect to the tax cuts. In fact, the projections are that the tax cuts will increase by $5 billion in each of the last 2 years of the 
10-year agreement on which this resolution is based, that is from 2005 to 2006, and from 2006 to 2007. 
If you are at $42 billion in the 10th year, then one can anticipate two scenarios for the following decade, from 2008 to 2017. If in fact the cost of the taxes stayed at $42 billion a year for each of those years, in other words, plateaued--a most unlikely assumption given the trend line--you would then project $420 billion in tax cuts over the next 10 years. If, however, the cuts continued to increase according to the trend line established through the first 10 years, in other words, increasing by $5 billion a year through 2017, you would have tax cuts of $700 billion in the following decade. 
So we have a situation here where it is almost certain that the tax cuts that are part of this agreement will carry with them a rising trend that will, in effect, undercut the deficit reduction effort. And I ask, is it not imprudent, indeed irresponsible to commit to such tax cuts before we have actually achieved budget balance and before we have a more accurate and realistic view of whether it can be sustained? 
We are talking about responsibility here. Yet we are undertaking in this resolution to commit to tax cuts before we have actually achieved budget balance and furthermore before we have a realistic and accurate view of whether budget balance can then be sustained. 
I believe that the tax-reduction side of the budget agreement carries with it the potential for undermining the deficit-reduction effort. Furthermore, the combination of program curtailment on the one hand and tax reduction on the other represents an inequitable allocation of the burdens of deficit reduction. 
The impact of a reduction in programs will be felt by ordinary working people primarily. The tax reductions, by contrast, will primarily benefit those at the top end of the income and wealth scale. 
Consider that 75 percent of the benefits of the capital gains tax can be expected to go to those making over $100,000 a year, the top 5 percent of the population. The inheritance tax cut would benefit an even smaller percentage of the population. Yet this resolution that is before us imposes additional burdens on working people through program reductions. 
In fact, the projections are that domestic discretionary programs will be 10 percent below--10 percent below--the current service level, namely, the level adjusted for inflation, in the year 2002. At the same time that we have a 10-percent cut in programs, substantial tax reductions will be given to those at the apex of the income and wealth pyramid. This is not fair or equitable. 
A budget agreement should undertake equitable deficit reduction, namely, apportioning the burdens in a way that it is reasonably spread across the entire society, as was done in 1993, when ordinary working people made their contribution through program reductions and those at the top end of the income scale made their contribution through tax increases. 
But in this instance, we have working people bearing a burden through program reduction, but we can anticipate tax reductions which markedly benefit those at the upper end of the income and wealth scale, and impose no burden on these individuals. 
Thus, this budget fails the equity test. A budget agreement should also lead to lasting, long-term deficit reduction. As I have indicated, I am most apprehensive about this agreement because I foresee that we will not be able, even if we were to reach balance in 2002--and there is some serious doubt about that under this agreement--to sustain that balance in the subsequent decades. Thus, this agreement also fails the long-term deficit reduction test. 
In short, this budget agreement does not have either of the two essential attributes of a budget: equitable deficit reduction and lasting, long-term deficit reduction. Because of that, I do not support it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. SARBANES. I think the chart the Senator has just put up is a very dramatic chart in demonstrating what has happened here. As I understand it, this chart shows the number of judges confirmed during a second Senate session in Presidential election years. We all know that what happens in a Presidential election year is that there is a slowdown because the party that does not have the White House thinks it may get the White House and then it will be able to effect the appointment of judges. 
I ask the Senator from Vermont, as I understand his chart, this shows that in 1996, last year, with a Democratic President and a Republican-controlled Senate, there was this incredible slowdown in the number of judges confirmed, which has continued into 1997. 
But in 1996, no court of appeals judges were confirmed and only 17 district judges. Is that correct?

Mr. SARBANES. The able Senator from Vermont is very perceptive because he anticipated the next point I want to go to, which is to contrast what happened last year with what happened in the last year of the Bush Presidency, 1992, an election year. 
The Senate majority was then in Democratic hands, and yet we confirmed 11 judges for the court of appeals nominated--nominated--by President Bush and 55 judges for the district court nominated by President Bush, for a total of 66 judges. 
Last year, a comparable situation, except it was reversed. We had a Democratic President making the nominations; the Republicans controlled the Senate; 17 judges, a total of 17 judges. No court of appeals judges, 17 district judges compared with 66 judges in the last year of President Bush's term. 
In fact, the last year of President Reagan's term, again with a Democratic Senate, we confirmed 7 court of appeals judges and 35 district court judges.

Mr. SARBANES. In 1984. The Senator is absolutely correct. 
Mr. President, this is an extraordinary slowdown in the 
confirmation of judges. Then, of course, what happens is none--only two have been confirmed this year thus far. 
So in the last virtually year and a half, 19 judges. 
I just submit to you this game ought to stop. We ought not to be playing with the Federal courts in this way. If people have a legitimate objection to a particular nominee, they ought to voice that objection and vote against them and try to persuade their colleagues to vote against them. But this is crippling the courts. The Chief Justice of the United States has been driven to the unusual posture of registering his complaint about it. 
I am frank to say to you, I think that Members of this body, Democrats and Republicans alike, have a responsibility to ensure that the Federal court system can work in a reasonable fashion. It is not going to work in a reasonable fashion if you slow up the confirmation of judges to this extent. 
It has not been done before. I mean, this breaks with all previous patterns and previous precedents. I just submit that we are not going to maintain public confidence in the judicial system, and we ought not to politicize the judicial process the way it is being done. 
So I want to commend strongly the senior Senator from Vermont, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, for bringing this issue once again to our attention. It is beginning to cripple the Federal courts. There is no question about it. 
As my colleague from California pointed out, it is terribly unfair to some very able and dedicated people who have been nominated and then their life simply placed on hold in terms of their normal activities. It is a marked departure from any sense of comity that has heretofore prevailed in this body and a marked departure from the respect that has traditionally been shown to the Federal court system. 
I very much hope that we can begin to address this situation, begin to hold hearings, report the people out, confirm them when they come before the Senate. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his forceful leadership on this issue.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to recognize James R. Thomas Jr., a civil engineer from Salisbury, MD, which I am proud to say is my hometown. Jim, who commands universal respect as a leader in both his profession and his community, will be installed on May 14 as president of the American Consulting Engineers Council. 
As managing partner of the Salisbury engineering and architectural firm, George, Miles & Buhr, Jim's reputation as a dynamic and capable, yet modest, leader precedes him as he assumes the helm of the Nation's largest professional association focusing on the business interests of consulting engineers. 
ACEC is comprised of 52 State and regional member organizations and represents 5,500 independent firms, which employ almost 200,000 professionals nationwide. 
No stranger to ACEC, Jim served as a national director, then vice president, prior to his selection last year as president-elect. He has advanced steadily through the ranks of the organization, first with the Consulting Engineers Council of Maryland [CEC/MD], where he served in all the leadership posts, from secretary to president. His strong commitment to these professional organizations is clearly evident. 
Jim has spent the last 28 years at George, Miles & Buhr, the largest civil engineering firm on the Delmarva Peninsula. The firm, which employs about 50 people, specializes in water and wastewater treatment systems and devotes 80 percent of its time to engineering projects. In 1993, George, Miles & Buhr received Engineering Excellence Awards from both ACEC and CEC/MD for its design of a biological nutrient removal demonstration plant at the Back River Wastewater Treatment Plant in Baltimore. 
In addition to his professional achievements, Jim is a most dedicated and effective public servant. 
His pro bono work on a crisis center for battered spouses earned him the honor of Rotarian of the Year in 1995. He is currently a director of the Salisbury Area Chamber of Commerce. In addition, Jim has served as president of the board at Trinity United Methodist Church and as a member of the boards of the Peninsula Regional Medical Center, the United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore, and the Salisbury-Wicomico Economic Development Corp. He has also been a long-time supporter of the Holly Center Foundation for the severely retarded. 
As a parent and strong supporter of the public school system, Jim has served as president of the PTA's of both Fruitland Elementary and Bennett Middle Schools, where he and his wife, Kaye, sent their three children Andy, Tricia, and Betsy. For his efforts, the Maryland PTA gave Jim the Gold Seal Award. 
Jim also has been honored by the Governor's Salute to Excellence. Both the United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore and the Holly Center Foundation have named him Volunteer of the Year. These honors are only a sampling of the many he has received in a lifetime of stellar community service. 
A native of Cambridge, MD, and a graduate of the University of Maryland, College Park, where he earned his B.S. in civil engineering, the Salisbury community is truly fortunate to have claimed Jim Thomas for its own. 
As ACEC's next president, Jim follows in the footsteps of another Marylander, Andrew J. Parker Jr., who was ACEC president from 1990-91. Likening the ACEC position to that of CEO of a large corporation--without the pay--Parker praised the leadership abilities of his Salisbury colleague last week. 
Mr. President, in a newspaper interview, Jim Thomas said that his activism in ACEC is rooted in a desire `to give something back' to the profession. Clearly, he has already done so and, now, as president of the ACEC, he will have a further opportunity to make a contribution. It is gratifying to see him accorded this national recognition. I wish him continued success in this, and all of his future endeavors.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing on behalf of myself, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. Torricelli, legislation to create a National Military Museum Foundation. The purpose of this legislation is to encourage and facilitate private sector support in the effort to preserve, interpret, and display the important role the military has played in the history of our Nation. This legislation is, in my judgment, crucial at this particular moment in history, when we are on the verge of jeopardizing two centuries worth of military artifacts and negating the possibility of such collections in the future. 
It has been the long-standing tradition of the U.S. Department of War and its successor, the Department of Defense, to preserve our historic military artifacts. Since the days of the revolution to the conflict in Bosnia, Americans have been proud of the role that our military has had in safeguarding our democracy, and we have tried to ensure that future generations will know that role. Over the years we have accumulated a priceless collection of military artifacts from every period of American history and every technological era. The collection includes flags, uniforms, weapons, paintings, and historic records as well as full-size tanks, ships, and aircraft which document history and provide provenance for our Nation and armed services. 
In recent years, however, the dedicated individuals who identify, interpret, catalog, and showcase those artifacts have found themselves shortchanged and shorthanded. With financial resources diminishing, not only are we cheating ourselves out of the military treasures currently warehoused out of public sight, but we are in danger of lacking the funds to update our collections with new items. 
`A morsel of genuine history,' wrote Thomas Jefferson to John Adams in 1817, `is a thing so rare as to be always valuable.' Mr. President, today, significant pieces of our military history are being lost, shoved into basements, or subject to decay. With each year also comes less funding, and our artifacts are multiplying at a pace that exceeds the capabilities of those who are trying to preserve them. Since 1990 alone, the services have closed 21 military museums and at least 8 more are expected to close in the next few years. 
We cannot let this proceed any further. Military museums are vital to documenting our history, educating our citizenry, and advancing our technology. More than 81 museums in 31 States and the District of Columbia daily instill Americans from veterans to new recruits to elementary school students with a sense of the sacred responsibility that military servicemen bear to defend the values that have made this country great. 
Military museums teach our servicemen the history of their units, enhancing their understanding both of the team of which they are a part and the significance of the service they have pledged to perform. And when a museum makes history come alive to young children, those children learn for themselves what this country stands for and the sacrifices that have been made to preserve the freedoms we often take for granted. 
Many of our servicemen have learned their military history through these artifacts rather than textbooks, and many of our technological advances have come as a direct result of these artifacts. The ship models and ordinances at U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, MD, for example, have been used by the Academy's Departments of Gunnery and Seamanship. It has also been reported that a study of an existing missile system, preserved in an Army museum, saved the Strategic Defense Initiative $25 million in research and analysis costs. These museums serve as laboratories where engineers can learn from the lessons of the past without going through the same trial and error process as their predecessors. 
Yet without adequate funding, these benefits will be lost forever. According to a 1994 study conducted by the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation entitled, `Defense Department Compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act,' the Department of Defense's management of these resources has been mediocre, with the cause attributed to inadequate staffing and funding. 
More than 80 percent of the museums studied said their survival relies heavily on outside funding. When asked about their greatest needs, the response was nearly always staff and money. And those museums that reported sufficient staffing from volunteers nevertheless said that the dearth of funds for restoration and construction paralyzed them from fully utilizing the available labor. 
According to the study, money is so tight that brochures and pamphlets are often unaffordable, leaving visitors with no explanations about the objects they have come to see. A young child might be duly impressed by the sight of a stern-faced general, but the historical lesson is greatly diminished if the child is not told the significance of the event portrayed or why the general looked so grim that day. 
Perhaps most distressing, the study reported `substantial collections of rare or unique historical military vehicles and equipment that are unmaintained and largely unprotected due to lack of funds and available expertise.' In addition, the museums were found to be struggling so much with the care of items already in house, that they were unable to accept new ones. With a new class of military artifacts from the Vietnam and gulf wars soon to be retired, one wonders whether those artifacts will be preserved. If 
we do not take action to save what we have and acquire what we don't, future generations will see these pockets of negligence as blank pages in the living history books that these museums truly are. 
Only a Foundation can address these problems. The alternate solution--to press the services to devote more money to these institutions--is implausible in this budgetary climate. The Secretary of Defense must place his highest priority on the readiness of our forces. Closely allied to that priority is the effort to improve the quality of life for our citizens on active duty. And, as aging equipment faces obsolescence, the Secretary has indicated that the future will bring an increased emphasis on replacing weapons systems. By all realistic assumptions, the amount of funds appropriated for museums is likely to continue downward. 
My bill recognizes the growing need for a reliable source of funding aside from Federal appropriations. A National Military Museum Foundation would provide an accessible venue for individuals, corporations, or other private sources to support the preservation of our priceless military artifacts and records. A National Military Museum Foundation could also play an important role in surveying those artifacts that we know to exist. Currently, there is no museum oversight or coordination of museum activities on the DOD level. A wide-ranging Foundation survey would therefore not only eliminate duplication, but would most likely discover gaps in our collections that must filled before it is too late. 
Under the proposed legislation, the Secretary of Defense would appoint the Foundation's Board of Directors and provide basic administrative support. To launch the Foundation, the legislation authorizes an initial appropriation of $1 million. It is anticipated that the Foundation would be self sufficient after the first year. This is a small price to pay to save some of our most precious treasures. 
This legislation is modeled on legislation that established similar foundations, such as the National Park Foundation and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, both of which have succeeded in raising private-sector support for conservation programs. My bill is not intended to supplant existing Federal funding or other foundation efforts that may be underway, but rather to supplement those efforts. 
The premise for establishing a national foundation is, in part, to elevate the level of fundraising beyond the local level, supplementing those efforts by seeking donations from potentially large donors. I also want to emphasize the inclusiveness of the Foundation, which will represent all the branches of our armed services. 
Mr. President, statistics reveal that foundations established without the mandate of a Federal statute and the backing of an established agency seldom succeed. With ever-diminishing Federal funds, we cannot expect the Department to put our military museums ahead of national security. Truly, an outside source committed to sustaining our museums is imperative. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I strongly support the Senior Citizens Home Equity Protection Act and commend Chairman D'Amato and Secretary Cuomo for identifying this problem and moving so quickly to develop a solution. The act will give HUD the tools it needs to put an end to the unethical practice of charging senior homeowners what has amounted to millions of dollars for information which HUD provides for free on the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program. 
The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program enables seniors, who have built up equity in their home, to borrow that equity to meet medical costs, make repairs on their homes, or meet their daily living expenses. Working with participating lenders, FHA insures this loan, smoothing the way to complete the transaction. Homeowners receive payments from lenders on a monthly basis, in a lump sum, or as a line of credit. The size of the loan depends on the owner's age, the interest rate, and home's value, but the average size of the loan is $42,465. Lenders recover their loan plus interest from the sale of the home when the owner dies or moves. Typically, the seniors that use this program depend largely on social security, perhaps supplemented by a very modest pension. For them, this program provides an invaluable service. 
The initial demonstration program was authorized in the 1987 Home and Community Development Act, which I supported. Many of the roughly 20,000 reverse mortgages made to date have been made to low- and moderate-income seniors who have been able to build up equity in their homes over the years but now live on fixed, restricted incomes. This program enables them to turn a valuable but nonliquid asset into cash payments to supplement their resources. Clearly this is an important program that contributes significantly to the quality of life for our senior citizens. It is unthinkable that this important Federal program and the people it is intended to serve are being exploited by certain estate planning agencies who charge seniors 6-10 percent off the top of this loan--which, on the average $42,000 loan, can amount to over $4,000. This is tantamount to taking away the equity that seniors worked so hard to put into their homes over the years. In fact, HUD reports that some of these operators pressure seniors into taking out their equity in lump sums, just so the estate planner can collect their fee up front. A little over 77 percent of householders age 65 and older are homeowners--or 15.7 million senior Americans. The companies involved in this practice claimed to have done close to a thousand of these deals and have the potential to do much more harm if this is not addressed. 
As a nation we have long encouraged and recognized the value of home ownership--the stability it creates in communities, the asset it becomes to the owner, and the security it provides over time. I have long supported programs that increase home ownership among low- and moderate-income people, such as the Home Investment Partnership Program and affordable housing goals for Government sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae. It is the low- and moderate-income senior homeowners to whom the reverse mortgage program is so important. 
In Maryland, we are making a special effort to increase the home ownership rates in low-income communities because there is no better way to start climbing the ladder of economic opportunity. A few weeks ago, HouseBaltimore, a partnership between the city of Baltimore, the Baltimore Empowerment Zone, and Fannie Mae announced that they have increased the number of low- and moderate-income homeowners in the city of Baltimore by 6,000 over the last 3 years. Earlier this month, the city of Baltimore was awarded a home ownership zone grant of over $5 million. The zone will create 322 new home ownership opportunities, 242 newly constructed units, and 80 rehabilitated units. These so-called estate planners undermine these efforts by taking a portion of this valuable asset away from senior Americans. 
Again, I want to thank Senator D'Amato and my colleagues on the Banking Committee for their responsiveness and willingness to undertake this effort, enabling HUD to take swift action and stop this practice. We need to continue to ensure all of our citizens live in decent, safe homes.

Mr. SARBANES. I thank the able Senator from Delaware, and I commend him for his extraordinary leadership with respect to the Chemical Weapons Convention. I know personally of the time and effort he has devoted to this cause. We are all in his debt. 
Mr. President, it is now less than a week before a landmark treaty--one which the United States led the world in negotiating--goes into effect internationally. The Chemical Weapons Convention, signed by President Bush on January 13, 1993, has now been ratified by 74 countries. The eyes of the world are upon the United States as we decide whether or not to join them. 
It would be a major mistake if this treaty were to go into effect without us. Worse yet, if we fail to ratify, we could be 
jeopardizing our best chance to eliminate the chemical weapons that some day would be used against us. 
This is a treaty that was advanced, negotiated, and signed by Republican Presidents, with the encouragement, in 1989, of some 75 U.S. Senators. What a mistake it would be if the Senate were to forfeit this opportunity to protect American security, promote American interests and preserve American leadership. 
If we fail to ratify the CWC, we will have done just that. If the Senate does not approve this historic treaty, our economic and security interests will suffer. Despite widespread and continuing bipartisan support for this treaty, despite support from some of our Nation's outstanding military leaders--such as General Shalikashvili and former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell, Admiral Crowe, General Vessey, and General Jones--some of my colleagues argue that this convention does not serve our security interests. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention is an unprecedented international agreement designed to eliminate an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. Unlike earlier protocols that prohibit only the use of chemical weapons, this convention aims at stopping their production, transfer, and storage by providing incentives for participation, verification of compliance, and penalties for violation. The United States is the only major industrialized country not to have ratified it yet. Our participation is critical to its ultimate success. 
This convention will not make the threat of chemical weapons automatically disappear from the face of the Earth. But it will constrain their proliferation and make it harder for rogue regimes and terrorists to gain access to them. By increasing the legal, moral, and financial costs of acquiring chemical weapons, it will deter covert chemical weapons programs and increase the likelihood they will be discovered. 
There are three major reasons why this treaty will serve American interests and why a failure to ratify it could have severe repercussions. 
First, the convention requires other nations to do something we already plan to do--destroy chemical arsenals. Under a law first signed by President Reagan, the United States will eliminate our current stockpile of chemical weapons by the year 2004, independent of what happens in this treaty. Our own military thinks that is a wise thing to do, even on a unilateral basis. The convention will simply ensure that others do the same. 
In other words, this is not a debate over eliminating our own chemical weapons. We are already programmed to do so. This is a question of whether we can establish a regime that will require other countries to destroy their chemical weapons and stop building new ones. That is why Admiral Zumwalt had stated, militarily, this treaty will make us stronger. 
It is not enough, however, to ask other nations to ratify the treaty. We must do so ourselves. Today, we have an opportunity to lead the world in abolishing these terrible weapons, rather than providing others with an excuse not to do so. If we do not adopt this treaty, or if we add crippling amendments, we will have single-handedly undermined the hope of ridding the world of this deadly scourge and of reducing the threat to our own citizens. 
The second major reason to ratify this treaty is that it will provide us with better information about what other countries are doing in the realm of chemical weapons. We know the verification regime is not perfect. The verification regime is never perfect in any treaty. There may be states that try to cheat on this agreement and others that refuse to sign it. But if we are party to the treaty, we will have an opportunity to investigate and sanction potential violations. We will take part in the organization established to monitor implementation, and we will help enforce its rules and procedures. As former CIA Director James Woolsey noted, `We will know more about the state of chemical warfare preparations in the world with the treaty than we would know without it.' 
Moreover, once we ratify the treaty we will be in a better position to do something about noncompliance. The CWC throws the force of world public opinion behind the identification and exposure of violators. Any violations that are discovered will be made widely known and receive universal condemnation. We will be able to punish violators through multilateral action, rather than going it alone, or trying to convince the world that our suspicions are correct without revealing our intelligence sources. As former Secretary of State Christopher explained, `By ratifying the Convention, we will add the force and weight of the entire international community to our efforts.' 
The third reason we must ratify this treaty is that a failure to do so will put U.S. chemical manufacturers at a serious competitive disadvantage. Once the CWC enters into force--which will happen next Tuesday, with or without U.S. participation--chemical manufacturers in countries that have not ratified will find themselves faced with international economic sanctions. These companies will be required to obtain end-user certificates for the sale of certain chemicals abroad, and after 3 years, they will not be able to export those chemicals at all. The United States will be treated on a par with rogue states, who will no longer be trusted to conduct normal, commercial trade in chemicals. 
These dismal scenarios were certainly on the minds of the chief executives of 53 of the Nation's largest chemical firms last August, when they expressed their concern in a joint statement, warning: `Our industry's status as the world's preferred supplier of chemical products may be jeopardized if the United States does not ratify the Convention. If the Senate does not vote in favor of the CWC, we stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in overseas sales, putting at risk thousands of good-paying American jobs.' American chemical companies have indicated a willingness to comply with inspections under the treaty because they are not conducting illegal activity, and because they helped to design the treaty's inspection regime so that it would not threaten legitimate business secrets or compromise proprietary information. 
Earlier this year, President Bush reaffirmed his support for ratification, telling reporters the treaty should transcend partisanship. `I think it is vitally important for the United States to be out front, not to be dragged, kicking, and screaming to the finish line on that question. We do not need chemical weapons, and we ought to get out front and make clear that we are opposed to others having them.' 
The CWC has been before the Senate for consideration for nearly 4 years now, providing ample opportunity for examination. Last year, after exhaustive hearings and review, it was reported favorably by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but not brought to a vote on the floor of the Senate. 
Over the past few weeks a new series of hearings has been held, in open and in closed session, and all perspectives have been thoroughly aired. The administration has worked in good faith to negotiate a new resolution of ratification that addresses the earlier concerns and more, including 28 agreed conditions, declarations, statements, and understandings. The remaining five conditions that have been proposed will undercut and place in jeopardy the effectiveness of this treaty, and I urge my colleagues to reject them. 
The conditions to which the administration has already agreed will resolve every legitimate concern that has been raised. I would urge my colleagues not to vote for pending amendments that would require renegotiation, delay, or abrogation of the CWC. If we don't take this opportunity to begin abolishing these terrible weapons, we will rue the day and have only ourselves to blame.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in commemorating the 82nd anniversary of the Armenian genocide, the first such tragedy to occur in the twentieth century. Today, as we renew our commitment to the rights and freedoms of all humanity, we also celebrate the reemergence of an independent Armenia. 
It is a tribute to the indomitable spirit of the Armenian people that, after centuries of oppression, they have persevered and re-established a free and independent nation--a nation as determined as its citizens. In its short existence, the Republic of Armenia has survived the earthquake of 1988, the dissolution of the Soviet Union and a blockade by its neighbors. Truly, the spirit of the nation reflects the spirit of its people. 
Despite these hardships, the young republic has made economic progress. As the first of the former Soviet republics to record economic growth, Armenia has kept inflation under control and made great advances toward privatization. Now, it is incumbent upon nations like the United States to continue our policy of engagement and assistance, as Armenia continues its efforts toward establishing a democratic society. 
The United States has also benefitted from a strong Armenian presence. With their firm resolve and dedication to democracy, the more than one million Armenian Americans have made significant contributions to the cultural, political and economic life of this nation. At the same time, by preserving their Armenian faith and traditions, they have achieved a balance that enriches our diverse and vital American culture. 
The tragic events of 1915-1923 contain in them some important moral lessons. We now realize that a quick and decisive response by the international community might have prevented the persecution and death of more than 1.5 million Armenians. Unfortunately, the world's indifference to their plight not only sealed the futures of the Armenian victims, but paved the way for similar tragedies in the years that followed. 
It is imperative, Mr. President, that no nation or individual ever forgets the injustices suffered by the Armenians in 1915. Only by striving for human rights and civil liberties for all people can the promises of human dignity be achieved. In that regard, the highest honor we can accord the heroic Armenian people is to continue the struggle for freedom wherever we are, be it America, Armenia, or anywhere else across the globe. By pursuing that mission, hopefully we can prevent such tragedies from happening again.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing--along with a number of my colleagues--two measures to continue and enhance efforts to restore the Chesapeake Bay. Joining me in sponsoring one or both of these measures are my colleagues from Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, Senators Warner, Santorum, Robb, and Mikulski. 
The Chesapeake Bay is one of the world's great natural resources. It is a world-class fishery that still produces a significant portion of the fin fish and shellfish catch in the United States. 
It provides vital habitat for living resources, including more than 2,700 plant and animal species. It is a major resting area for migratory birds and waterfowl along the Atlantic flyway, including many endangered and threatened species. 
As our Nation's largest estuary, the Chesapeake Bay is also key to the ecological and economic health of the mid-Atlantic region. The bay is a treasured asset for all our citizens, particularly for the nearly 15 million of us who live within the six State watershed. It is a one-of-a-kind recreational asset enjoyed by 9 million people, including many Members of this body. 
The bay is also a major commercial waterway and shipping center for the region and much of the eastern United States. And it provides thousands of jobs for the people in this region. Certainly, we in Maryland regard the bay as a defining element in our State's history, and as a key to Maryland's quality of life. 
Most people are aware of these and other dimensions of the bay. Certainly, our Nation's scientists are aware, and have consistently regarded the bay's protection and enhancement as an extremely important national objective. 
When the bay began to experience serious unprecedented declines in water quality and living resources in recent decades, people in the region, including those in my State, suffered as well. We lost thousands of jobs in the fishing industry and much of the wilderness that defined the watershed. 
We began to appreciate for the first time the profound impact that human activity could have on the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. Untreated sewage, deforestation, toxic chemicals, farm runoff, and increased development resulted in a degradation of water quality and destruction of wildlife and its habitat. 
Fortunately, over the last two decades we have also come to understand that humans can have a positive influence on the environment, and that we can, if we choose, assist nature to repair much of the damage which has been done. 
We now treat sewage before it enters our waters, and even have a successful waste treatment pilot project here in Washington that utilizes state-of-the-art biological methods to significantly reduce nutrients entering the bay. 
We banned toxic chemicals that were killing the wildlife, initiated programs to reduce nonpoint source pollution in the bay's tributaries, and we have taken aggressive steps to successfully restore the striped bass and other species. 
We have undertaken the Nation's largest habitat restoration project on Poplar Island in the upper bay, and enacted legislation protecting the estuary from economically and ecologically harmful aquatic nuisance species. 
The States of Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania deserve much of the credit for undertaking many of the actions that have put the bay and its watershed on the road to recovery. 
All three States have had major cleanup programs and have made significant commitments in terms of resources. The cleanup has remained an important priority item supported by Governors, State legislatures and the public. And a number of private organizations--the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay come to mind--have done stellar work in this area. 
But the Federal Government has played a critical catalyzing role in helping to bring about these successes. Without the Federal Clean Water Act, the Federal ban on DDT, and EPA's watershed-wide coordination of bay restoration and cleanup activities, we would not have been able to bring about the concerted effort, the real partnership, that is succeeding in improving bay water quality and in bringing back many fish and wildlife species that were on the verge of extinction. 
The Chesapeake Bay is getting cleaner, but we cannot affort to be complacent. Ever increasing population and commercial stresses are imposed upon the bay. So we must not relax if we hope to maintain, and build upon, our past successes. 
The first measure I am introducing today is designed to build upon our National Government's past role in the Chesapeake Bay Program, the highly successful Federal-State-local partnership to which I made reference, that so ably coordinates and directs efforts to restore the bay. 
This legislation carries forward and enhances the role of the 
Environmetnal Protection Agency as the lead Federal agency committed to cleaning up the bay. It redoubles efforts to ensure wide compliance with Chesapeake Bay agreement goals, including habitat restoration and toxics reduction. 
And it establishes a mechanism for EPA to further assist communities with local watershed restoration and protection projects in the bay and its tributaries. This is an especially important component of this measure. Let me spend a moment to explain why. 
The initial stages of the bay cleanup focused on the mainstem bay. But it became increasingly clear that many of the bay's problems originate in the rivers and streams which flow into the bay. It also became obvious that we must expand efforts within these waters if we hope to achieve nutrient reductions and other improvements in the overall bay watershed. 
The bay partners recognized this urgent need with 1992 and subsequent amendments to the Chesapeake Bay agreement that committed the bay partners to develop and implement tributary-specific strategies throughout the watershed, and the States are making tremendous progress in this regard. 
It is clear that one of the most cost-effective ways to protect the rivers and streams in the watershed is to help, encourage and promote stewardship among citizens and others who have a direct stake in a specific local situation. After all, stewardship starts with the individual citizens who live in the watershed. And that is what this measure encourages by providing EPA with mechanisms to stimulate such local efforts. 
The second measure I am introducing today would connect natural, historic, cultural, and recreational resources to create an innovative Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network throughout the mainstem bay and its tributaries. 
The vast bay watershed contains many distinctive treasures that combine to tell a unique story about the evolvement of human settlement and culture within the area. Each region within the watershed is dotted with historic seaports, Federal and State parks, and other natural, cultural, or recreational sites. 
Many residents of the bay are familiar with the rich resources within their particular region. Similarly, countless visitors to a particular segment of the watershed are exposed to selective sites, but receive only a limited if any introduction to similar resources throughout the entire bay. They learn little about the bay's collective cultural and natural history, and perhaps little about comprehensive bay cleanup efforts. 
What we currently lack--and what this measure provides--is 
a mechanism that links these many valuable resources and sites throughout the watershed into a unified network of jewels of the Chesapeake. 
This shared linkage and identity can improve access to the bay. It can further educate residents and visitors about this treasured resource. 
It can boost the already substantial economic activity generated by tourism and recreation within the watershed, and it can entice additional residents within the watershed to play more active roles in the bay restoration effort. 
This measure would accomplish these worthy goals in several ways. First, it authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior to identify and protect resources throughout the watershed, to identify these individual jewels as Chesapeake Bay gateways, and to link them with trails, tour roads, scenic byways and other sites. 
Second, it directs the Secretary to develop and establish Chesapeake Bay Watertrails, consisting of important water routes, and connects these watertrails with gateways sites and other land resources to create a Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network. This network will guide residents and visitors alike along important water routes and the many land based resources within the watershed. 
Third, this legislation authorizes the Secretary to provide technical and financial assistance to State and local partners for conserving and restoring these important resources throughout the watershed. 
The Chesapeake Bay cleanup effort, and Federal-State efforts to protect related resources and to promote economic activity, have been major bipartisan undertakings in this body. The bay has been strongly supported by virtually all Members of the Senate, as evidenced by enactment of three of the five related measures introduced last session. I urge my colleagues to continue the momentum by supporting this legislation and contributing to the improvement and enhancement of one of our Nation's most valuable and treasured natural resources.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week from April 13 to 19 we are celebrating the 39th anniversary of National Library Week. As a strong and vigorous supporter of Federal initiatives to strengthen and protect libraries, I am pleased to take this opportunity to draw my colleagues' attention to this important occasion and to take a few moments to reflect on the significance of libraries to our Nation. 
When the free public library came into its own in this country in the 19th century, it was, from the beginning, a unique institution because of its commitment to the same principle of free and open exchange of ideas as the Constitution itself. Libraries have always been an integral part of all that our country embodies: Freedom of information, an educated citizenry, and an open and enlightened society. They are the only public agencies in which the services rendered are intended for, and available to, every segment of our society. 
It has been my longstanding view that libraries play an indispensable role in our communities. From modest beginnings in the mid-19th century, today's libraries provide well-stocked reference centers and wide-ranging loan services based on a system of branches, often further supplemented by travelling libraries serving outlying districts. Libraries promote the reading of books among adults, adolescents, and children and provide the access and resources to allow citizens to obtain reliable information on a vast array of topics. 
Libraries gain even further significance in this age of rapid technological advancement where they are called upon to provide not only books and periodicals, but many other valuable resources as well. In today's society, libraries provide audio-visual materials, computer services, facilities for community lectures and performances, tapes, records, videocassettes, and works of art for exhibit and loan to the public. In addition, special facilities libraries provide services for older Americans, people with disabilities, and hospitalized citizens. 
Of course, libraries are not merely passive repositories of materials. They are engines of learning--the place where a spark is often struck for disadvantaged citizens who for whatever reason have not had exposure to the vast stores of knowledge available. I have the greatest respect for those individuals who are members of the library community and work so hard to ensure that our citizens and communities continue to enjoy the tremendous rewards available through our library system. 
My own State of Maryland has 24 public library systems providing a full range of library services to all Maryland citizens and a long tradition of open and unrestricted sharing of resources. This policy has been enhanced by the State Library Network which provides interlibrary loans to the State's public, academic, special libraries, and school library media centers. The network receives strong support from the State Library Resource Center at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, the Regional Library Resource Centers in western, southern, and Eastern Shore counties, and a statewide data base of holdings of over 140 libraries. 
The result of this unique joint State-county resource sharing is an extraordinary level of library services available to the citizens of Maryland. Marylanders have responded to this outstanding service by borrowing more public library materials per person than citizens of almost any other State, with 67 percent of the State's population registered as library patrons. 
I have had a close working relationship with members of the Maryland Library Association and others involved in the library community throughout the State, and I am very pleased to join with them and citizens throughout the Nation in this week's celebration of National Library Week. I look forward to a continued close association with those who enable libraries to provide the unique and vital services available to all Americans.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Greek people on the 176th anniversary of the beginning of their struggle for independence. Since regaining their freedom and reaffirming their commitment to democratic principles, the Greek people have built a modern-day republic that is a strong and positive presence in the Balkans and eastern Mediterranean. 
As the only member of the European Union from the region, Greece has played a stabilizing role in the area and helped advance its neighbors' progress toward political and economic security. Greece's own efforts to continue the modernization of its economy and its steadfast defense of democratic governance are critical to the promotion of democracy and stability in neighboring lands. 
On March 25, Greece will commemorate the beginning of its quest for independence from four centuries of Ottoman rule. After nearly 10 years of struggle against tremendous odds, the Greek people secured liberty for their homeland and reaffirmed the individual freedoms that are at the heart of their tradition. 
From the beginning of their revolution, the Greeks had the support--both material and emotional--from a people who had only recently gained freedom for themselves; the Americans. And since then, our two nations have remained firmly united by shared beliefs in democratic principles and mutual understanding of the sacrifices entailed in establishing a republic. 
As a nation whose founders were ardent students of the classics, America has drawn its political convictions from the ancient Greek ideals of liberty and citizenship. And just as we looked to the Greeks for inspiration, Greek patriots looked to the American Revolution for strength in the face of their own adversity. 
Since their liberation, the Greek people have never taken their liberty for granted. In both World Wars, Greece never wavered from its commitment to the United States and the other allied nations to resist the forces of totalitarianism. Faced with a Communist uprising after World War II, Greece received support from President Truman and the American people, who helped the Greeks rebuild their war-ravaged nation. 
Along with our shared values and traditions, Greece and America share a bond by virtue of those individuals who have remained devoted to the ideals of both countries. The Greek-American community, which maintains an especially close relationship with Greece, also consistently makes significant contributions to American culture, business, and history. Truly, it is a community that enriches our life at home while strengthening our ties abroad. 
At this time last year, First Lady Hillary Clinton was in Greece. Her visit was followed by a meeting here in Washington between Greek Prime Minister Kostandinos Simitis and President Clinton, which laid the foundation for even stronger Greek-American relations in the future, and the broadening of existing ties into new arenas. 
This year, I was proud to cosponsor Senate Resolution 56, designating March 25, 1997, as `Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy,' and I was gratified to see it approved by the Senate last week. Emotionally and philosophically, Greece has remained near the hearts and minds of Americans since this Nation was founded. 
President James Monroe aptly summarized these feelings in 1822, observing: `The mention of Greece fills the mind with the most exalted sentiments and arouses in our bosom the best feelings of which our nature is susceptible.' Mr. President, more than inspiration, Greece today has a very important and tangible role to play in the democratic progress of its own region. I have no doubt that Greece is up to the task.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to improve the pay system used for Federal firefighters. This bill has three broad purposes: First, to improve pay equality with municipal and other public section firefighters; second, to enhance recruitment and retention of firefighters in order to maintain the highest quality Federal fire service; and third, to encourage Federal firefighters to pursue career advancement and training opportunities. 
Fire protection is clearly a major concern at Federal facilities and on Federal lands throughout the Nation. From fighting wildland fires in our national parks and forests to protecting military families from fires in their base housing, Federal firefighters play a vital role in preserving lives and property. One only needs to recall the terrible tragedies in Colorado two summers ago to understand the vital importance of our Federal firefighters. 
The Department of Agriculture, the Coast Guard, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Veterans Affairs are among the Federal agencies which rely on Federal fire fighters to protect their vast holdings of land and structures. Just like their municipal counterparts, these firefighters are the first line of defense against threats to life and property. 
Mr. President, the current system used to pay our Federal firefighters is at best confusing and at worst unfair. These men and women work longer hours than any other public sector firefighters--yet are paid substantially less. The current pay system, which consists of three tiers, is overly complex and, more importantly, is hurting Federal efforts to attract and retain top-quality employees. 
Currently, most Federal firefighters work an average 72-hour week under exceptionally demanding conditions. The typical workweek consists of a one-day-off schedule which results in three 24-hours shifts during the remainder of each week. Despite this unusual schedule, firefighters are paid under a modified version of the same General Schedule pay system used for full-time, 40-hour-per-week Federal workers. 
The result of the pay modification is that Federal firefighters make less per hour than any other Federal employee at their same grade level. For example: a firefighter who is a GS-5, Step 5 makes $7.21 per hour while other employees at the same grade and step earn $10.34 per hour. Some have tried to justify this by noting that part of a firefighter's day is downtime. However, I must note that all firefighters have substantial duties beyond those at the site of a fire. Adding to this discrepancy is the fact that the average municipal firefighter makes $12.87 per hour. 
Mr. President, this has caused the Federal fire service to become a training ground for young men and women who then leave for higher pay elsewhere in the public sector. Continually training new employees is, as my colleagues know, very expensive for any employer. 
The Office of Personnel Management is well aware of these problems. In fact, section 102 of the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act of 1990 [FEPCA], title V of Public Law 101-509, authorizes the establishment of special pay systems for certain Federal occupations. The origin of this provision was a recognition that the current pay classification system did not account for the unique and distinctive employment conditions of Federal protective occupations including the Federal fire service. 
In May 1991, I wrote to OPM urging the establishment of a separate pay scale for firefighters under the authority provided for in FEPCA. Subsequently, OPM established an 
Advisory Committee on Law Enforcement and Protective Occupations consisting of agency personnel and representatives from Federal fire and law enforcement organizations. Beginning in August of 1991, representatives from the Federal fire community began working with OPM and other administration officials to identify and address the problems of paying Federal firefighters under the General Schedule. The committee completed its work in June of 1992 and in December of that year issued a staff report setting forth recommendations to correct the most serious problems with the current pay system. 
Mr. President, I regret that since the release of the OPM recommendations, there has been no effort to implement any of the proposals of the advisory task force. In fact, OPM has communicated quite clearly that it has no plans to pursue any solution to the serious pay deficiencies that have been so widely identified and acknowledged. 
It would not be necessary to introduce this legislation today had OPM taken the corrective action that, in my view, is so clearly warranted. However, I have determined that legislation appears to be the only vehicle to achieve the necessary changes in the pay system for Federal firefighters. 
Mr. President, the Firefighter Pay Fairness Act would improve Federal firefighter pay in several important and straightforward ways. Perhaps most importantly, the bill draws from existing provisions in title V to calculate a true hourly rate for firefighters. This would alleviate the current problem of firefighters being paid considerably less than other General Schedule employees at the same GS level. It would also account for the varying length in the tour of duty for Federal firefighters stationed at different locations. 
In addition, the bill would use this hourly rate to ensure that firefighters receive true time and one-half overtime for hours worked over 106 in a bi-weekly pay period. This is designed to correct the problem, under the current system, where the overtime rate is calculated based on an hourly rate considerably less than base pay. 
The Firefighter Pay Fairness Act would also extend these pay provisions to so-called wildland firefighters when they are engaged in firefighting duties. Currently, wildland firefighters are often not compensated for all the time spent responding to a fire event. This legislation would ensure that these protectors of our parks and forests would be paid fairly for ensuring the safety of these invaluable national resources. 
It also ensures that firefighters promoted to supervisory positions would be paid at a rate of pay at least equal to what they received before the promotion. This would address a situation, under the current pay system, which discourages employees from accepting promotions because of the significant loss of pay which often accompanies a move to a supervisory position. 
Similarly, the bill would encourage employees to get the necessary training in hazardous materials, emergency medicine, and other critical areas by ensuring they do not receive a pay cut while engaged in these training activities. 
Mr. President, this legislation is based upon a bill I authorized in the 103d Congress. A bipartisan group of more than 150 Members cosponsored the measure in the Senate and the House last year. The legislation I am introducing today reflects several modifications that were suggested to the bill following substantial discussions with various Members. However, it is identical to the so-called compromise measure that has been discussed with the authorizing as well as the appropriations committees in previous years and received widespread support. 
To reduce initial costs and allow oversight of the effectiveness of the legislation, the bill I am introducing today would implement the new pay system and other provisions beginning October 1, 1997. However, the new rate of pay would be phased in over a 4-year period ending October 1, 2002. 
Mr. President, I consulted many of the affected groups in developing my legislation. I am very pleased that this bill has been endorsed by the American Federation of Government Employees, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Fire Fighters, the National Association of Government Employees, and the National Federation of Federal Employees. 
As I have said before, Mr. President, fairness is the key word. There is no reason why Federal firefighters should be paid dramatically less that their municipal counterparts. As a cochairman of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I want to urge all members of the caucus and, indeed, all Members of the Senate to join in cosponsoring this important piece of legislation.

But I think it is a dire mistake if this attitude carries over into our decisions regarding the judiciary, 
the third, independent branch of our Government and the one that, in order to maintain public confidence in our justice system, ought to have politics removed from it as much as is humanly possible.

Mr. SARBANES. Exactly. 
Let me say I am very deeply concerned about this development. I want to commend the Senator from Vermont because he has been speaking out on this very important matter for some time now. 
Moving to the pending nomination, I want to speak first to Merrick Garland's merits, although let me say that I do not understand any of my colleagues to be questioning his capabilities and qualifications to serve on the bench. In fact, Members on both sides have spoken very highly of Merrick Garland and noted his outstanding character. 
I was privileged, since he is a resident of my State, to have the honor to introduce him at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. That was on November 30, 1995, almost 18 months ago. I believed then and continue to believe now that he will make an outstanding addition to the D.C. circuit. 
His career exemplifies his strong commitment to the law and to public service. 
He is a magna cum laude graduate from Harvard Law School. He clerked for Judge Henry Friendly on the second circuit and for Justice William Brennan at the Supreme Court. 
He has had a long association with the Justice Department, first as a special assistant to then Att. Gen. Benjamin Civiletti. He then became a partner at Arnold & Porter when he left the Justice Department to go into private practice. 
Upon returning to public service, he has served as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, dealing with 
public corruption and Government fraud cases. He has also served as Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Justice Department's Criminal Division and as Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General, both very high ranking positions within the Department. 
In all of these positions he has served our country with great distinction. 
He has published extensively in several areas of the law and has remained active in bar association activities. 
In every respect, in his intellect, his character, and his experience, he would make an outstanding addition to the bench. 
Let me now just briefly talk about this new line of attack, so to speak, that has arisen about whether vacancies on the D.C. circuit should be filled. 
First of all, I think any analysis of the courts' need to fill vacancies cannot be based simply on caseload statistics--this is a benchmark that one needs to analyze carefully in order to determine what lies behind the cases. In fact, the D.C. circuit's situation in particular makes clear that mere case filing numbers do not tell the whole story with respect to the burdens that the court faces. The D.C. circuit receives, in complexity and importance, cases that do not come as a general rule before the other circuits across the country. It has had major, major cases that it has had to deal with as a routine matter, cases of great weight and importance to the nation.

It is very important to note that with respect to the fourth circuit, there is a nominee pending before the Judiciary Committee, whose nomination was submitted in the last Congress--two nominations, as a matter of fact, were submitted to the Committee last year--and one has been resubmitted by the administration right at the beginning of this session.

Mr. SARBANES. There is no way with a nominee having been sent to the Senate by the President, that an argument for not approving the nominee based on not needing the judgeship can be made without it carrying with it an ad hominem argument against the nominee. 
If people are really serious about reducing vacancies on the courts, they need to scrub down the number of places before the nominees are submitted, by legislation. Once the nominees come here, you cannot divorce the attack on the individual from the attack on the need for the seat on the bench. We have the chief judge of the fourth circuit coming in against filling spots when nominees are pending. 
Now, how can that position be taken and considered separate from opposition to the nominee? They say, `Well, I am not against this nominee, but I just do not think this spot ought to be filled.' Of course, that is small comfort to the nominee whose nomination is pending and has been put forward in order to fill the vacancy. 
Now, Judge Ervin, in his testimony, sets forth, I think, a very persuasive case why the fourth circuit needs to have those vacancies filled. I commend that statement to my colleagues. I will not go through it in detail here, given the fact that this debate is coming to a close. 
I do encourage my colleagues to consider carefully the political cloud with which we are now surrounding the judgeships. 
I say to my colleagues on the other side, we did not behave this way at a time when the Senate Democrats were in control of the Senate and we were dealing with the nominations of Republican Presidents. I will be very frank. I think the judiciary deserves better than that from us. I hope that game will come to an end and we will be able to move ahead with the confirmation of judges in an orderly fashion. 
In closing, let me again state that I am very supportive of the judicial nominee who is before the Senate today. I think he is a person of outstanding merit who will make an outstanding judge, and I urge his confirmation.

Mr. SARBANES. With President Reagan, a Republican President--again, in an election year--we confirmed 7 court of appeals judges and 35 district court judges. Actually, the 35 that we confirmed in that election year was better than the Republican Senate did for President Reagan in 1984 when they only confirmed 33 judges. In any event, clearly this performance in these years is in marked contrast to what happened in 1996 and what apparently is continuing now in 1997. Merrick Garland was the first judge approved this year.

Mr. SARBANES. Yes, Republican judges. And there were some Members on the Democratic side who said, why are you doing this? We are about to have an election and the result may give us control of the White House. And the Senator from Delaware said, look, we ought not to have politics play a heavy hand in the judicial confirmation process. 
One of the worst things that is happening in the Senate is what amounts to a heavy politicizing of the judicial confirmation process that is taking place in this body, and that was reflected in the performance in 1996 as compared with the performance in 1992 when the Senator from Delaware did his very best to keep politics out of the process, to fill judicial posts and to let the judiciary function as an independent branch of our Government. What is happening here is extremely serious. And of course, the Senator, with his candor, came to the floor and sort of stripped away the veneer and laid out what is going on behind the scenes, which is a complete departure from past practices. When there were Republican Presidents, I did not play a role in whom the Presidents sent up to the Senate to be nominated and confirmed in the job----

Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield. It is worse than that. It is not whether you let the President have his nominees confirmed. You will not even let them be considered by the Senate for an up-or-down vote. That is the problem today. In other words, the other side will not let the process work so these nominees can come before the Senate for judgment. 
Some may come before the Senate for judgment and be rejected by the Senate. That is OK.

Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, in effect what is happening is the court system is being held hostage, so it is not able to function properly as a court system should. I submit that is an irresponsible tactic to use. As Members of the Congress, the first branch of Government, we have a responsibility to see that the court system can function in a proper fashion. 
The Senator from Delaware, when he was chairman of the committee, always measured up to that responsibility, I think often taking a lot of political heat for doing it. But he was out to make sure the system could function. He had Republican Presidents nominating judges. He processed their nominations. He brought them to the floor of the Senate. He gave the Senate a chance to vote on them up or down for those people to get confirmed. That process is breaking down.

Mr. SARBANES. And that is what we heard on Merrick Garland. In fact, when he first came up here, he was nominated for the 12th position on the D.C. circuit. They said, `We don't need that position. We have nothing against Merrick. He is a wonderful fellow, of course. We just don't think we need that 12th position.' Of course, that does a lot for Merrick Garland. He's sitting, waiting to join the court. Then someone already on the court took senior status, and then they had two vacant positions, the 11th and 12th. Merrick Garland is nominated. He's now up for the 11th position; not the 12th position, the 11th position. The majority is right back here on the floor and it says, `We don't need this position.' This is the 11th position. They never made that argument last year when he was going for the 12th position. Then they said we need the 11th, we don't need the 12th. Now they are back, some, today--fortunately, they did not prevail--saying we do not need either the 11th or the 12th position.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National Agriculture Week and to pay tribute to the farmers of this nation whose dedication and diligence throughout our history have not only served to feed our families, but have also provided a strong framework for the economic prosperity of this country. 
At the 1896 Democratic National Convention, it was William Jennings Bryan who recognized the importance of farmers, not only as the individuals who provide our sustenance, but as integral parts of the American business community. He said, `The farmer who goes forth in the morning and toils all day, who begins in spring and toils all summer, and who by the application of brain and muscle to the natural resources of the country creates wealth, is as much a business man as the man who goes upon the Board of Trade and bets upon the price of grain.' Today, when technology like weather trackers and cellular phones plays as important a role on the fields as it does on Wall Street, Bryan's words ring true. 
Bryan's other comment about farmers reminds us of a fact too often forgotten: `The great cities,' he said, `rest upon our broad and fertile prairies.' Indeed, the productivity of America's farmers not only keeps Americans fed, it also enables the rest of our citizens to embark upon their daily tasks and diverse careers without concern that the grocery's shelves will be empty. 
Our farmers are so productive that they sustain the lives of more than 250 million Americans every day and still have enough left over to make agriculture our nation's leading export. In 1930, 1 American farmer produced enough food to feed 24 people. Today, that same 1 farmer is feeding 129 people. In fact, our farmers are so efficient that Americans spend approximately 9 percent of their income on food, compared with much higher figures in other countries, such as 17 percent in Japan and 27 percent in South Africa. 
Yet the agricultural industry's contributions to our economy often go unrecognized. I grew up on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where my parents owned and operated a local restaurant. I spent much of my childhood working in that restaurant, and one of my clearest memories is of Saturday evenings, when the farmers would come to town to stock up on supplies after a hard week's work. Every Saturday, my parents would keep the restaurant open late, waiting for the farmers to arrive. Over the years, I gained a good understanding of the successes and hardships related to agriculture. In my house, we knew that if the farmers were successful, our own business would prosper. 
Since then, and the beginning of my career in public service, my contact with farmers from across the State of Maryland has confirmed my strong view that we cannot have real prosperity in this country if the farm sector itself is not sharing in and laying the foundation for that prosperity. 
Farmers bear a weighty burden. At the same time that their work feeds millions and includes efforts to cleanse a polluted environment, that work is also part of a very modern industry, which generates billions of dollars in revenue and employs more than 15 percent of our citizens. Yet unlike many other billion-dollar businesses, almost 90 percent of American farms are owned by individuals or families. Family farmers are the backbone of America's agricultural industry and we must ensure that they remain a vital 
part of American society. 
All of this is relevant, I believe, to this year's National Agriculture Week theme, `Growing Better Every Day--Together.' Indeed, we all must remain committed to working on behalf of our farmers at all levels of government. Only through such cooperation can we look forward to a future in agriculture which is even more successful than our present. 
In the State of Maryland, our attempts at such cooperation are indeed paying off. Recently, I have worked closely with State and local officials to support the efforts of farmers seeking to increase production by bolstering their existing export capabilities and identifying ways in which additional Maryland agribusinesses can enter foreign markets. Maryland is the eastern seaboard's fastest growing exporter. And with a strong and growing trade infrastructure--which includes the port of Baltimore, the World Trade Center, Baltimore-Washington International Airport and other aggressive export-enhancing initiatives--we are hopeful that agriculture, as Maryland's number-one industry, will be able to further tap into the State's increasing number of international opportunities. New forums across Maryland--which we have initiated together with the Maryland Department of Agriculture and our terrific Maryland Secretary of Agriculture Lewis Riley--are helping farmers take full advantage of our expanding capabilities and possibilities in this regard. 
We in Maryland take much pleasure in the achievements of our farmers. Generating more than $1.6 billion a year, agriculture employs about 14 percent, or 350,000 of Maryland's workers. Maryland's agricultural industry truly helps the State live up to its often used nickname, `America in miniature.' From vegetable production and horticulture in southern Maryland, to the dairy operations and horse farms of central Maryland, to the beef cattle, forestry products and tree fruit in western Maryland, to poultry growing on the eastern shore, Maryland agriculture is indeed diverse and provides a showcase for the nation's agricultural capabilities. 
Mr. President, we in Maryland and our nation are very proud of our agricultural industry. There is still much work to be done to ensure a bright future for America's farmers, but as this week's theme suggests, through a strong commitment at all levels of government--together--we can help continue to build such a future.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit along with Senators Mikulski, Warner, and Akaka, this sense-of-the-Congress resolution. It is a simple resolution which clearly states that it is the sense of the Congress that Federal retiree COLA's should not be delayed. 
After 3 years of having their cost-of-living adjustments delayed, Federal retirees finally saw equity restored this year when their COLA adjustment became effective in January instead of April. Federal retirees should continue to receive their COLA on time, in line with all other Federal cost-of-living adjustments. 
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the average Federal retiree would lose an estimated $915 over the next 5 years if a three-month COLA delay is reinstated. To many of our Nation's more than 2 million Federal retirees, this can mean a significant difference in the calculation of their yearly living expenses. 
Further delaying Federal retiree COLA's would, in my view, set a dangerous, unfounded precedent where cutting or altering Federal retiree and employee benefits to effect cost savings becomes an all too regular and accepted practice. 
Mr. President, Federal retirees have served this Nation with the expectation that the benefits they have earned will be excluded from the pressures of achieving arbitrary budgetary targets. Disparate treatment of COLA recipients goes against longstanding congressional policy that for more than 25 years has ensured COLA equity for all retirees, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important resolution.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, as a nation we have a deep commitment to a decent home and suitable living environment for every American family. Housing is the cornerstone for healthy communities, a vibrant economy, and a competitive nation. Although we have significantly improved housing conditions in the last 60 years, we still have a long way to go. The latest figures in HUD's Report to Congress on the worst case housing needs estimate that 5.3 million very low-income renter households pay more than half of their income in rent or live in poor-quality housing. They receive no help. Many of those people are elderly or people with disabilities. 
Today, four of the leading non-profit affordable housing producers--The Enterprise Foundation, LISC--the Local Initiatives Support Corp: Habitat for Humanity International, and the National Neighborworks Network--are committing to a $13 billion investment in low-income communities across the country over the next 4 years. Each have built successful partnerships, leveraging both public and private resources. These partnerships have been critical in supporting local nonprofits to not only build affordable housing but also provide services and encourage economic development to revitalize these neighborhoods. The success of these organizations reverberates in low- and moderate-income communities across the country as they address our widespread affordable housing needs. Their work is supported by Federal programs such as HOME, the Community Development Block Grant, and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. 
The Enterprise Foundation, based in Columbia, MD, is a true success story in the affordable housing industry. Founded by Jim Rouse in 1982, Enterprise has raised and committed more than $1.8 billion in grants, loans, and equity to finance the development 
of 61,000 affordable homes. They have a number of initiatives including the Enterprise Social Investment Corp. [EISC] which works with 176 major American corporations to help them find new ways to invest in affordable housing. Much of this activity has been made possible by the low-income housing tax credit. In addition, Enterprise, along with Fannie Mae, has created the Cornerstone Housing Corp., a nonprofit that buys and preserves large blocks of multifamily rental housing for low-income families. Enterprise also runs an intensive training program to assist nonprofit organizations in increasing their technical and management abilities. 
Habitat for Humanity International, since 1976, has provided approximately 55,000 homes through 1,336 local affiliates across the country. Using volunteer labor and tax-deductible donations, Habitat builds new homes and rehabilitates existing homes. An average three-bedroom Habitat home costs approximately $38,300, making homeownership for many low-income families a reality. 
The Local Initiatives Support Corporation, established in 1979, supports 1,400 community development corporations throughout the country. This partnership has created over 64,000 homes and 9.6 million square feet of commercial and industrial space. 
Neighborworks is a network of local resident-led partnerships supported by the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a public nonprofit chartered by Congress in 1978. The Neighborworks Network has produced 38,831 units of affordable housing since its inception and in the last 5 years has leveraged $1.5 billion in investment within communities. 
In Maryland, I have seen these partnerships work. The Enterprise Foundation, along with its subsidiaries, have developed more than 3,700 units of affordable housing and 
have committed more than $12.3 million in loans and $90.3 million in equity. In Sandtown-Winchester, Enterprise's Neighborhood Transformation Program has rebuilt more than 700 abandoned homes through a comprehensive community revitalization effort that works in partnership with local residents and the city of Baltimore. Neighborworks has three neighborhood housing services affiliates in Maryland--in Baltimore, Salisbury, and Cumberland. Between 1994 and 1996 alone these three Neighborworks affiliates produced over 600 units of affordable housing and leveraged over $24 million in investments within these Maryland communities. Habitat for Humanity has 16 affiliates in Maryland which have built 89 new homes and rehabilitated another 227 homes. 
Today these four organizations are challenging themselves and challenging us to continue our successful partnerships through the Community Development Block Grant, HOME, and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. These are programs I have supported and programs which have been critical in the production of affordable housing. The HOME Investment Partnership, for example, is an initiative I championed. HOME provides flexible grants to States and units of general government to implement local housing strategies designed to increase homeownership for low-income people. By requiring a 25 percent match, HOME encourages the public-private partnerships that have proven so successful in the production of affordable housing. 
Mr. President, I commend the work of these organizations and applaud Enterprise, LISC, Habitat, and Neighborworks for their commitment to invest $13 billion in our low-income communities. I fully support our continued role in this effective and successful partnership through Federal programs like HOME, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, and the Community Development Block Grant and urge my colleagues to do the same. This is an excellent step in the right direction, and I am pleased to have the opportunity to highlight the work of these organizations and the Federal programs that support them.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, in introducing this important legislation to ensure the protection of Federal employee pay and benefits in the event of a furlough. 
We have a responsibility to the men and women who have dedicated themselves to public service and I would hope that my colleagues would join Senator Mikulski and me in our ongoing effort to maintain the Federal Government's commitment to its dedicated work force. 
Federal workers have just experienced the most difficult Congress in recent history. Federal employees became hostages in the budget battle which resulted in two successive Government shutdowns. At this time last year, Federal employees were in a constant state of anxiety--concerned about the future of their jobs, whether they would be laid off or have to work without pay, all as their workloads continued to accumulate. Despite this tremendous pressure and the constant attacks on their pay and earned benefits, Federal workers continue to provide consistent, quality service on behalf of all Americans. 
As I have stated many times before, Federal employees have already made significant sacrifices in past years in the form of downsizing efforts, delayed and reduced cost of living adjustments, and other reductions in Federal employee pay and benefits. It is, in my view, critical that we protect Federal employees from the type of senseless abuse they endured during the Government shutdowns last Congress. Federal workers should never again find themselves in a situation where, through no fault of their own, they may have to either work without pay or be prohibited from coming to work at all. 
Mr. President, Federal employees have made a choice to serve their country and we should respect and reward that choice by supporting these hardworking, dedicated individuals. Through the legislation Senator Mikulski and I are reintroducing today, we will continue to send the message to the Federal work force and to all American citizens that Congress honors and values the commitment those who work for the Government have made.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont for yielding me this time. 
Mr. President, there is no doubt that this is an extremely important vote that Senators are about to cast this afternoon. An amendment to the Constitution to require a balanced budget ought to give every Senator great pause. 
First of all, amending the Constitution is no light enterprise under any circumstances. Second, we ought to be certain that we are not falling into the trap of unintended consequences, that we do not pass an amendment that does more harm than good. In this respect, we ought to heed the advice which we have been receiving from many quarters with respect to the potential impact of this amendment to the Constitution on our ability to conduct wise economic policy. 
In this respect let me make four points in opposition to the balanced budget amendment. 
First, let me discuss the effect of this amendment on our ability to avert or slow economic downturns. 
Mr. President, over 1,100 economists have taken out an advertisement condemning the balanced budget amendment as unsound and unnecessary. Its signers include 11 Nobel laureates in economics, and they state--and I quote: 
We condemn the proposed `balanced-budget' amendment to the Federal Constitution. It is unsound and unnecessary. 
They then go on to say--and I think this is an extremely important statement: 
The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the face of recessions. 
I repeat: `The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the face of recessions.' The statement continues: 
In economic downturns, tax revenues fall and some outlays, such as unemployment benefits, rise. These so-called built-in stabilizers limit declines of after-tax income and purchasing power. To keep the budget balanced every year would aggravate recessions. 
Secretary Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury, testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee, echoed these sentiments when he stated that the balanced budget amendment threatens to turn economic downturns into recessions and recessions into depressions. 
Mr. President, along these lines, I want to draw attention to this chart beside me which shows the fluctuations in real economic growth from 1870 to 1995. This is 1870 here. This is 1995 out here. What this chart shows is that since the end of World War II, when we began using automatic fiscal stabilizers--what the 1,100 economists call the `so-called built-in stabilizers'--we have been able to greatly ameliorate the fluctuations in the business cycle. You still get business cycle fluctuations, but you do not get the boom-and-bust pattern which characterized the pre-World War II period in which a downturn would become a recession, and a recession would become a depression. 
We have had fluctuations since 1945. But they have almost always been in the positive range in terms of economic growth. 
Our economy has benefited enormously from this stability. When the economy slows down, unemployment rises, tax revenues fall off, and the paying out of unemployment benefits increases. We therefore automatically start incurring deficits which serve to slow down and head off the economic downturn. These automatic stabilizers have enabled us to significantly ameliorate the business cycle. 
As the economists' statement says, an amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget would prevent this kind of countercyclical fiscal policy and, therefore, would greatly increase the risk of severe economic fluctuations during an economic downturn. 
Amendment supporters say, well, we will be able to see an economic downturn begin and we will get a supermajority to waive the amendment's balancing requirements. The fact of the matter is, however, that it is very difficult to tell when you are in an economic downturn. The beauty of the current system is that it automatically adjusts as the economy goes soft. As the economists said in this full-page ad in the paper, `The proposed amendment mandates perverse actions in the face of recessions. In economic downturns, tax revenues fall and some outlays, such as unemployment benefits, rise.' No congressional action is required for this system to go into effect. 
If, in an economic downturn, you try to balance the budget by cutting back on unemployment benefits and raising taxes in order to balance it, you will just drive the economy even deeper. 
In short, Mr. President, this amendment prevents us from doing the very things that have allowed our economy to stay on an even keel for the last 50-plus years. 
Second, Mr. President, it is very important to understand that we do not have a capital budget at the Federal level. The argument is being used by the proponents of this amendment that because State governments have to balance their budgets, local governments have to balance their budgets, business firms balance their budgets, and private individuals balance their budgets that the Federal Government should have to balance its budget. But none of these entities--not States, local governments, private companies, or households--would balance their budgets if they kept their budget the way the Federal Government does in accounting terms. There is no capital budget at the Federal level. 
State and local governments have a capital budget, and they borrow in order to finance it. I sat on a committee that received testimony from two State Governors in favor of the balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. One of the arguments they made in favor of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution was that their State balanced budget amendments gave them a better credit rating for when they went into the bond market to borrow, allowing them to borrow at lower interest rates. 
Of course, my question to these Governors was, if you are required by your Constitution to have a balanced budget, why do you have to borrow? Their response was, `Well, Senator, you don't understand. We borrow to finance the capital budget. Our constitutional requirement for a balanced budget is for the operating budget, but we can have a capital budget for which we borrow.' 
Of course, it makes good sense to borrow for capital items. Businesses do it when they invest in new plant equipment and private individuals do it when they buy a home or a car. Very few people can afford to buy those items out of cash in the year of purchase. If you calculate prudently in terms of your expected income flow and the amount you are spending for the capital asset, it makes good sense to borrow in order to finance the capital asset, have the use of it over time, and pay it off over that period as you amortize the use of that capital asset. 
Business does it all the time. Private individuals do it all the time. 
So this analogy that amendment proponents draw to State and local government, private individuals, and business does not work because there is no capital budget at the Federal level. And amendments that were offered on the floor to introduce capital budgeting into the Federal accounting process were rejected. 
Third, it is argued that if we face an economic or military emergency, you will get a supermajority in this body in order to waive the amendment's balancing requirements. Well, Mr. President, we have seen the difficulty we have around here extending the debt limit by a simple majority. This legislation requires a three-fifths supermajority, three-fifths of the total membership of the body, in order to raise the debt limit. Very few of the efforts to raise the debt limit in recent years have had that kind of support. 
I have voted for debt-limit increases with Republican Presidents because I thought it was the responsible thing to do. But in many of those instances, even where there was some bipartisanship involved, the vote to increase the debt limit failed to garner 60 votes. 
The difficulty of gathering a supermajority simply cannot be overestimated. Yet amendment supporters assert, well, clearly, Congress will see a crisis and make the proper response. Our history, however, simply does not support that contention. 
Let me give you just one example, involving national security, because proponents of this amendment contend that it will not inhibit us from addressing our national security needs. In 1940, on the recommendation of President Roosevelt, the United States enacted a 1-year draft. The draft came up for renewal a year later, in the fall of 1941, not too long before Pearl Harbor. 
At this point, the House of Representatives had an intense debate about extension of the draft. Speaker Rayburn, in fact, went into the well of the House to appeal for the extension of the draft, saying it was essential for the security of our country. That extension passed in the House on a vote of 203 to 202. That vote would not meet the requirements of this balanced budget amendment, because to meet the requirements of the balanced budget amendment, you have to have a majority of the whole membership to waive the balanced budget amendment in time of national security emergency. The majority of the whole then--as now--would have been 218; 203 falls short of the majority of the whole requirement in the balanced budget amendment, let alone the supermajority requirements that are contained in the amendment. So those who place faith in the assumption that the Congress would easily waive the balancing requirements are much too sanguine. I am very apprehensive as to whether, either in a national security crisis or an economic crisis, we would be able to respond. In both instances, it is imperative to be able to respond early. The longer you wait, the more serious the problem, the further you fall behind the curve. This balanced budget amendment has the effect, at best, of delaying essential action, and at worst, of preventing such action at all. 
Fourth and finally, let me very quickly make the point that the way to balance the budget is to make the budget decisions that we are confronted with, not to amend the Constitution. We have been trying to do that, and we have had some good success over the last 4 years. We have brought the deficit down. 
How do you actually bring down the deficit? How do you really address this problem? What I have argued here this morning is that amending the Constitution carries with it great risks, as the economists in this article have indicated, and that we can do the job--and have been doing it--without a balanced budget amendment.

Mr. SARBANES. To summarize once again the economists' statement, first of all, the balanced budget amendment would not enable us to respond automatically to economic downturns, running the risk, therefore, of turning recessions into depressions. Second, and I quote, `Unlike many State constitutions, which permit borrowing of financed capital expenditures, the proposed Federal amendment makes no distinction between capital investments and current outlays. Private businesses and households borrow all the time to finance capital spending. The amendment would prevent Federal borrowing to finance expenditures for infrastructure, education, research and development, environmental protection, and other investment vital to the Nation's future well-being.' 
If we had a capital budget right now, we would have a balanced budget, because there is well over $107 billion worth of capital items in the Federal budget. 
Third, I addressed the escape hatches and the difficulty of obtaining these supermajorities. That is really a recipe for gridlock. 
Fourth, and this leads again to my final point, we have brought the deficit down consecutively now for 4 straight years. How? We made tough decisions on spending and taxing. We voted for the 1993 economic plan. Many of those pushing the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution voted against that economic plan with respect to the budget. That was the plan that enabled us to bring the deficit down from $290 billion in 1992 to $107 billion in the past fiscal year--a cut of almost two-thirds in the deficit. That was done by making tough decisions. The chart beside me reveals this progress. 
An amendment to the Constitution, by itself, does nothing. You still have to make the budget decisions. We have been doing a good job of it. In fact, as this next chart shows, we have brought the deficit down from 4.9 percent of our gross domestic product down to 1.4 percent. This is the best performance in a quarter of a century, as a percent of GDP. 
So, Mr. President, we have been doing the job. And the way to continue to do the job is to address the deficit. As I noted, it is now down to 1.4 percent of GDP. This is better than any other major industrial power in the world. Chairman Stiglitz of the Council of Economic Advisors says he now goes to international conferences and everyone is talking about how well and how successfully the American economy is working. This figure--deficit as a percent of GDP, 1.4 percent--is better than any of the other major industrial countries. Consider this chart beside me. This is the U.S. deficit as a share of GDP, 1.4 percent. Here is Japan at 3.1 percent; Germany at 3.5 percent; Canada, 4.2 percent; France, 5 percent; the United Kingdom, 5.1 percent; Italy, 7.2 percent. So we have been doing the job, and we have been doing the job the way it needs to be done. 
In short, Mr. President, we ought not to meddle with the Constitution. We ought not run the risk of provoking economic prices, of preventing a timely response to a national security threat, of failing to make capital investments in the future of our country. Mr. President, I urge the rejection of this amendment to the Constitution. 
I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding me time. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I simply want to make this observation. 
Well over half of those budgets that the Senator from Utah points to in that pile would have been in balance if we had a capital budget. The fact of the matter is we didn't--and don't--have capital budgets. State and local governments have capital budgets. Businesses and private individuals have capital budgets. But we have a budget accounting system that requires us to cover the capital items as well as the operating items. If we had done budget keeping the way everyone else does budget keeping, well over half of those budgets would have been in balance.

They are also born with a tremendous number of physical assets that have been purchased that are available to them for their use--a transportation network, a communication network, a research and development network, and an educational infrastructure. All have been paid for by previous generations for their use out into the future.

Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, it is certainly the dollar. Everyone is anxious to hold U.S. Treasury bonds. Let me say to my colleague, the Maastricht Agreement for the European Union set out certain criteria that countries had to meet in order to qualify for the monetary unit. These were regarded as extremely severe criteria. One criterion set out in the Maastricht Agreement was that they had to bring their deficit as a share of GDP down to 3 percent--3 percent. That is the target that those countries are working to achieve. Everyone says, well, that is a really tough standard that these European countries are trying to meet. 
The United States is at 1.4 percent.

Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely correct. Another criterion they had was that your debt, your total debt had to be at 60 percent of your GDP. We are at 50 percent. I do not have a chart on that one. But we are at 50 percent. We easily meet both of the criteria that are being used by the European countries pursuant to the Maastricht Convention guidelines. And everyone is saying, boy, this is a tough job. If you get to it, you are showing tremendous fiscal discipline. 
We are already well within both of those targets. None of the 15 countries that are members of the European Union have done as well as the United States on these two criteria, with the exception of Luxembourg.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am honored to join again with nearly 1 million Lithuanian Americans in commemorating the 79th anniversary of the proclamation of an independent Lithuania, especially at a time when the Lithuanian people are rebuilding their democracy. 
After more than seven centuries of struggle, the Lithuanians have finally succeeded in reestablishing an independent republic. While their hopes were realized once before in this century, their freedom was abruptly revoked in 1940, after 22 years of democratic governance. 
Throughout this long and difficult period, the people of Lithuania and the other Baltic nations never wavered from their beliefs in democratic values and their desires for liberty and freedom. In keeping with such a strong commitment, their independence after so many years is not only something to celebrate, it is an incentive for us all to rededicate ourselves to the democratic principles commemorated by this anniversary. 
Since 1990, when Lithuania rejoined the international community of democratic nations, the country has recognized the importance of meaningful political and economic reforms. Most significantly, Lithuania recently experienced another peaceful transfer of civilian rule, demonstrating the increasing stability of its democracy. 
Lithuania's commitment to continue along the path of economic reforms also promises greater prosperity in the years to come. A number of indicators suggest the possibility of a brighter future for the Lithuanian economy, despite the difficult period of transition that has resulted from the collapse of the Soviet Union. Gross domestic product is expected to rise this year, and continue to do so the next. Inflation is expected to decline. Industrial production is also on the rise. 
In addition, Lithuania has reached out to its neighbors, both those in the Baltic region and those further to the west. The Baltic Economic Cooperation Agreement and Lithuania's decision to join the Council of Europe are examples of this young democracy's determination to remain economically and politically engaged with the rest of the world. 
At this time of year, our thoughts also turn to those Lithuanians who suffered under the brutality of the Nazi and Soviet occupations. Many risked and lost their lives for the rights and freedoms that Lithuanians today are privileged to enjoy. Their steadfast determination and courage eventually prevailed, providing hope for all peoples who dream someday to be free. 
The writer Vincent Boris has observed that Lithuanian `statehood was reestablished within a continuum of nationhood.' Indeed, the Lithuanian people have drawn their strength from a very real sense that nationhood can never be oppressed. That sense of nationhood has been most evident here in the United States, where we have witnessed the unyielding dedication of Lithuanian Americans to the freedom of their native land. Their perseverance encouraged many of us to stand in this body over the last several decades and proclaim our support for a Lithuanian republic. 
We in Maryland, and our Nation, are particularly fortunate to have such an active Lithuanian-American community. Its longstanding traditions of self-help and voluntarism and its dedication to the democratic ideals that have prevailed in Lithuania have truly enriched the history of this country. In areas ranging from business, to academia, to the arts, Lithuanian-Americans consistently make significant contributions across the Nation. 
Mr. President, recently, Lithuanians gathered in their capital, Vilnius, to commemorate this anniversary. I am proud that we in the United States have continued to stand with them on this occasion, both in years when there was much to celebrate and in years when there were only memories and dreams of a better future. It is my sincere hope that we can celebrate this anniversary with the same optimism that we do this year for many years to come.

Mr. SARBANES. I will be very quick. 
First of all, I commend the able Senator from New Jersey for the very thoughtful and careful analysis he made in his statement upon offering his amendment. 
One of the difficulties with a balanced budget constitutional amendment generally, of course, is that it is purely symbolic. The real way to balance the budget is to do it when Congress considers and passes the budget, not by amending the constitution. 
But the Senator from New Jersey has pointed out three, I think, clear difficulties with this particular version of a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, Senate Joint Resolution 1. One is that our current Federal process does not provide for a capital budget. Every State and locality has a capital budget. Businesses have capital budgets. Private individuals have capital budgets. People do not go out and pay for a house, or an automobile, or finance a college education with cash the same year that they make these purchases. They make prudent investments in the future, and they borrow and amortize them over a period of time. State governments do exactly the same thing. It is a prudent and sensible way to do business. 
I will never forget a budget committee hearing at which we had two Governors testifying in favor of amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget. They said, well, our States require a balanced budget, and, as a consequence of our States requiring it, 
the Governors went on to say, our States get a better credit rating, so that when we borrow in the market we get a better interest rate. 
Of course, the obvious question becomes, if states have a constitutional requirement to balance the budget, why do they need to borrow money? What does a credit rating matter to these states? So I asked them that question. Of course, their response was, well, you do not understand. We have a capital budget that is separate and apart from the operating budget. We have a capital budget that we fund by borrowing--by borrowing. So I said, well, we do not have a capital budget at the Federal level. I noted that we in the Federal Government do not make a distinction between capital and operating expenses, though it is a wise distinction because then you can fund your long-term investments through borrowing, get the full benefit of the investment, and pay back the debt over the useful life of the capital asset. 
The Governors' response was that the Federal Government ought to have a capital budget. I note to my colleagues that if you are really serious about trying to write a balanced budget requirement into the Constitution of the United States, the first thing you ought to do, as a minimum, is separate out operating and capital budgets--just the way State and local governments do. 
So this analogy to State and local government falls of its own weight as soon as you recognize the fact that unlike the Federal Government, State and local governments have capital budgets which they fund by borrowing. We do not have a capital budget at the Federal level, but if we have a constitutional balanced budget amendment, we should. 
Second, I think the emphasis which the Senator from New Jersey has made on the necessity of being able to respond in a crisis situation involving either the national security of the country or an economic downturn is extremely important. 
As regards economic conditions, we have managed to ameliorate the business cycle, not to eliminate it, but to ameliorate it. We are able to do that in part because we are now able to conduct countercyclical fiscal policy when we have an economic downturn. The balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, without a provision such as is contained in the amendment that has been sent to the desk by the Senator from New Jersey, runs the very great risk of turning economic downturns into recessions and recessions into depressions, because it will not allow us to respond to dire economic circumstances when we are confronted with them. 
The same thing is true about the national security provisions of the balanced budget amendment as it has been drawn by its sponsors. 
These provisions are much too restrictive, much too confined, and they run the substantial risk that we will not be able to respond in a national emergency. 
Now, the response made to this argument by the supporters of Senate Joint Resolution 1 is that if we confront a national emergency we will get the supermajority vote in order to waive the balancing provisions of Senate Joint Resolution 1 and there will be no problem. Well, our own history does not sustain that contention. 
In 1940, the House of Representatives instituted a 1-year draft. That came up for renewal in the autumn of 1941, literally weeks before Pearl Harbor. They took a vote in the House of Representatives on extending the draft for another year. Speaker Rayburn went into the well of the House in order to plead with his colleagues to pass this extension. It passed on a vote of 203 to 202. But that vote, which is a majority, would not have met the supermajority requirements contained in the balanced budget amendment that has been brought forth from the committee by Senator Hatch. It would have fallen short because it was not a majority of the whole membership of the body, which required 218 votes, and which under this amendment is necessary to avoid the balancing requirements in Senate Joint Resolution 1. There we have a classic example of a crisis situation, right out of our own history. This is not a hypothetical. Looking at our own history, we can see that we would not have been able to respond and meet the requirements of the time, when we were facing this crisis situation, under the provisions of the balanced budget amendment as currently drafted. 
I want to strongly commend the Senator from New Jersey for the very careful analysis that has brought forth these proposals pending before us. Clearly, at a minimum, if this constitutional amendment is to move forward, it requires the adoption of the Senator's amendment. I yield the floor.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, for more than 70 years, February has been designated as the month in which we honor the achievements and contributions of African-Americans to our history, our culture and our future. One remarkable African-American leader, W.E.B. DuBois, made an observation in 1903 that bears great significance for this celebration. `Herein lies the tragedy of the age,' he said, `that men know so little of men.' Since 1926, Black History Month has challenged us to mitigate that tragedy, encouraging us to study the lives of both our most noted heroes and those whose stories have remained untold. 
As it does each year, the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History has selected a theme for this month's celebration. It's theme for 1997, `African-Americans and Civil Rights: A Reappraisal,' focuses on the pioneers, leaders, and venues in the civil rights struggle that are often unrecognized. In light of this, I want to pay tribute to an extraordinary group of African-American artists from my State of Maryland who, despite their undeniably significant contributions to our culture, nevertheless remain relatively unknown. Yet, given their landmark accomplishments, these individuals would be important role models for aspiring artists of all backgrounds. By pushing the limits of their artistic mediums, the international respect earned by these artists advanced the struggle for the equal recognition of all people, both in our society and under its laws. I salute the association for selecting a theme that focuses on more of our Nation's unsung heroes. 
At the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon, there sits a memorial chair dedicated to Ira Aldridge, one of the greatest Shakespearean tragedians of his day. Born in Baltimore in 1805, Aldridge's performances were so popular with heads of state that he was the first African American to be knighted. He drew praise from New York to Prussia, with a diverse repertoire of roles that included Othello, Macbeth, Shylock, Lear and Richard III. Known as `The Celebrated African Tragedian,' Aldridge was called `without doubt the greatest actor that has ever been seen in Europe,' by a Viennese critic, and `the most beautiful male artist that one can imagine,' by a Prussian. Pioneers like Aldridge made possible careers like those of Sidney Poitier, Lawrence Fishburne and Denzel Washington. 
From offstage, inspiring women of every color, we find Frances Ellen Watkins Harper. This poet, writer, and lecturer was the first African-American female novelist to be published in this country. She was born in Baltimore, in 1825, and attended a school for African-Americans on the present site of the Baltimore Convention Center. A writer of paperbacks and pamphlets on topics from abolition to the Bible, her popularity has been well documented. Records show that two of her poetry collections had sold 50,000 copies each by 1878. Her talents and perseverance were such that she was also the first African-American woman to have her work published in the Atlantic Monthly. Without someone like Harper, we may never have seen a Gwendolyn Brooks or an Alice Walker. 
Joshua Johnson was the first African-American artist in the United States to earn his living as a professional portrait painter. A freed slave, Johnson worked in Baltimore for 
more than 30 years and painted more than 80 portraits of Baltimore's sea captains, shopkeepers, and merchants, and their families from 1795 to 1825. Described as a `self-taught genius,' Johnson's subjects were mostly white and his style, quite realistic for the age in which he lived. While little is known of Johnson's personal history, the success and historical significance of his professional endeavors are clear. Johnson's portraits are still widely displayed in museums across the Nation, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the National Gallery here in Washington. 
The Broadway classics, `I'm Just Wild About Harry' and `Memories of You' are the works of another Baltimorean, Eubie Blake. The famous vaudevillian, ragtime pianist and composer of more than 3,000 songs was the cocomposer of the first all African-American Broadway musical, `Shuffle Along.' After its 1921 debut on Broadway, `Shuffle Along's' successful 2 year run in New York paved the way for a continued African-American presence on Broadway's brightly-lit strip. `Shuttle Along' also influenced other composers, including Gershwin who, many critics say, might never have written `Porgy and Bess' had Blake never written his musical. At age 86, Blake astonished the entertainment world by coming out of retirement to join the ragtime revival of the 1970's, inspiring a whole new generation of listeners. Two years after receiving the Medal of Freedom from President Reagan in 1981, Blake was honored at galas across the country that marked his 100th birthday with evenings of his own music. 
Baltimore is proud to claim another musical legend. Raised as Eleanor Fagen, Billie Holiday rose to outstanding levels of acclaim and popularity for her unique approach to jazz singing: She was as able to alter the rhythm and tone of her voice as the players accompanying her were able to do on their instruments. In the course of her 26-year career, so-called Lady Day recorded with musical giants including Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Artie Shaw and Teddy Wilson. Frequently called the greatest jazz singer ever, she inspired audiences from New York's Cotton Club to Baltimore's Royal theater, with ballads such as `Strange Fruit,' a song protesting lynching and discrimination. 
Baltimore is also home to the Afro-American newspaper group, the Nation's oldest continuously published African-American newspaper chain. Founded in 1892, the chain has produced as many as 13 editions, and served readers from New Jersey to South Carolina. The pages of the Afro-American have borne the bylines of the paper's many reporters who later became national figures in the struggle for civil rights. One such individual was Clarence Mitchell, Jr., the Baltimore lawyer and activist who ultimately became director of the Washington Bureau of the NAACP. Today, the Afro-American publishes editions in Baltimore and Washington DC as well as a Wednesday weekly. 
First knight, first novelist, first painter, first composer, first lady of jazz, the list goes on and on. Maryland is very proud of these great men and women. In succeeding against enormous odds, only did they inspire us, but they laid the groundwork upon which other African-American actors, painters, writers, and musicians have followed. Like Maryland's history, the history of this country is replete with the contributions of African-Americans, many of which have gone unrecognized. The names I have 
mentioned today are but a small sample, a reminder that Black History Month is also a time to silently honor those heroes whose names we may never know. 
It was another writer who often worked in Maryland, Langston Hughes, who wondered,  
What happens to a dream deferred? 
Does it dry up. 
Like a raisin in the sun? 
The accomplishments of the African-Americans I have recognized today prove that some dreams can surmount even the most difficult obstacles. A 100 years ago, who could have imagined the success of writers like Hughes and Toni Morrison? Who would have dreamed of public servants and leaders such as Maryland's own Parren Mitchell, Thurgood Marshall, and Kweisi Mfume? The achievements of these as well as the outstanding individuals who had the courage to take the very first steps, individuals like Joshua Johnson and Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, challenge us to ensure that today's budding artists and leaders will never have to confront the barriers that faced earlier generations. Given the extraordinary achievements of the artists and activists who did overcome those barriers, one can only imagine the wealth of poems, paintings, and compositions that never made it into our libraries, museums, and concert halls. Let us create an America that is America for all Americans, and let us make our history, our culture, and our future that much richer.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to convert eight remaining excepted service positions at the U.S. Fire Administration to competitive service status. 
During its first few years of operation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency used an excepted service authority provided under the Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 in order to quickly staff the National Fire Academy with personnel who were uniquely qualified in fire education. 
In the early 1980's, after the Academy's original vacancies had been filled and the Academy was up and running, it became FEMA's policy to fill openings at the NFA through a competitive civil service hiring system. Today, 91 of the NFA's 99 employees are under the general schedule with only eight employees who were hired in the 1970's and early eighties remaining in excepted service status. As a result, these remaining eight are subject to significant limitations within the USFA. Although they each average over 17 years of Federal service and were hired solely because of their strong backgrounds and unique qualifications in fire education, they are legally barred from competing for management positions within the Fire Administration. The remaining eight excepted service employees are not even allowed to serve on details to competitive service jobs--even within their own organization--without an official waiver from the Office of Personnel Management. 
Mr. President, I am proposing to remedy this situation. The legislation which I am introducing will enable the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to convert any employees appointed to the Fire Administration under the Federal Fire Protection and Control Act, to competitive service--without any break in service, diminution of service, reduction of cumulative years of service, or requirement to serve any additional probationary period with the Administration. Those converted under this legislation shall also remain in the Civil Service Retirement System and retain their seniority. This practice is consistent with other federally supported training academies. The Congressional Budget Office has indicated that there would be no cost for this conversion, and I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.

Mr. SARBANES. Well, as the Senator has noted, as economists across the country have commented, and as the chart beside me shows, since World War II we have been able to ease the business cycle because we experience automatic stabilizers during an economic downturn. We start running deficits because we are not collecting taxes and we are paying out unemployment. If you try to balance the budget, or if you are required to do so by constitutional amendment during an economic downturn, you are going to return our economy to these boom-and-bust cycles that we experienced throughout the first part of this century and we are going to lose the ability to have this kind of movement in the business cycle, which is much better for our people. 
The Senator is absolutely correct. With this amendment, we are going to be dooming ourselves to going back and turning economic downturns into recessions and recessions into depressions, as the Senator has pointed out.

Mr. SARBANES. I agree absolutely with that. We at the moment have the best unemployment situation in 20 years; the best performance on inflation in 30 years. We have now brought the deficit down as a percent of the gross national product to the best ratio in 25 years. We are making progress on all of these fronts. We have the strongest economy in the world. 
People come in with this radical notion of amending the Constitution of the United States. All we need to do is continue to make the hard decisions that are made with respect to the budget. It is one thing to balance the budget. Those are the tough decisions. Those are the ones we ought to make and not put an amendment into the Constitution of the United States which is going to deny us the ability to deal with economic downturns and recessions when they occur. The amendment they are talking about putting into the Constitution of the United States does not abolish the business cycle. It does not eliminate economic ups and downs. Yet with this amendment, we run the risk of going back to economic cycles with very deep downturns when our people are really suffering through depression. We have not had that since World War II. And I for one don't want to go back to it.

Mr. SARBANES. I want to support the very perceptive statement of the distinguished Senator from California about the reduction in the deficit subsequent to the enactment of the 1993 budget, which, as the Senator pointed out, was passed on the tie-breaking vote of the Vice President. 
In 1992, the deficit was $290 billion. We have brought it down 4 years in a row. It is now at $107 billion. Four years in a row we have had a steady decline in the deficit. We brought it down from $290 billion to $107 billion, and, as a percent of our gross product, the deficit has dropped from 4.9 percent in 1992 to 1.4 percent in 1996. The last time the deficit was this low as a percent of our gross domestic product was in 1973. This is the best performance in 23 years in reducing the deficit as a percent of our gross domestic product. This is a very good record. We are going to continue the progress. We are going to continue to bring the deficit down, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of our GDP. 
Let me show you a chart which compares what we have succeeded in doing in this country and what is happening in the other major industrial countries. 
This chart compares various nations' deficit as a share of GDP. The United States is now at 1.4 percent. Here is Japan, 3.1; Germany 3.35; Canada 4.2; France 5; the United Kingdom 5.1; Italy 7.2. We have the best performance of any of the major industrial countries. 
We have an economy now with 5.4 percent unemployment, the best unemployment in 20 years. We are at less than 3 percent inflation, the best inflation performance in 30 years. The deficit of 1.4 percent of GDP, the best since 1973. That is a vertical comparison with our past performance in this country. 
Then we look to see how we are competing with other countries. This chart shows we have the best performance of any of the G-7 countries. This economy is working. We ought not now to take this, as the Senator has described it, radical step of trying to amend the Constitution of the United States and perhaps dooming ourselves in some future crisis to be unable to confront the economic circumstances of the time. As the Senator has pointed out, that is what these over 1,100 economists across the country are saying. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from California asks a very appropriate question. In a sense, she answered it right at the end with the observation that she herself has, as I have, seen instances in this Chamber when we were scrambling to get a simple majority in order to provide disaster relief to one or another State in the country that had been devastated by a natural disaster. And many Members said, `Well, we don't really want to do that. Yes, it's a difficult situation, but we don't want to make this response.' 
I have seen the very able Senator from California personally work the floor of the Senate in order to try to get a majority vote in order to respond to what her State had been stricken with, and she was successful, I must say. But suppose you had to get a supermajority in order to do it. Past experience does not bear out the assumption that you can just get a supermajority willy-nilly. In the past, we have had to scramble simply to get a majority. 
The amendment contains a provision that states that you cannot raise the debt limit unless you have a supermajority, and obviously unless you can raise the debt limit and borrow additional funds, you are not going to be able to respond to the disaster, and particularly not respond to it immediately, which is often what is required. But time and time again in this Chamber I have seen the leadership sweating bullets in order to get a simple majority in order to deal with a debt limit issue. So it just defies past experience for Members to stand here and say, `Oh, we will get the supermajority.' As the Senator from California has pointed out, it is tough enough to get the majority, the simple majority.

Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I commend the very able Senator from California for her very fine statement. She clearly understands the pitfalls that are involved in a balanced budget amendment and, I think, has spoken eloquently to the issue. She has also spoken with a very deep personal knowledge of the situation confronting her and her State when she has had to deal with these natural disasters. I simply want to underscore, again, for those who say, `well, we will easily get a supermajority in order to waive the provisions of this amendment in an emergency situation,' that I saw the Senator working literally day and night just to get a majority in order to deal with a natural disaster and, as she pointed out, coming up with close votes in order to do it. 
She succeeded, which is very much to her credit and reflected her very effective advocacy. But had a supermajority been required, she would have fallen short. So I want to thank her for her very strong statement. 
Mr. President, I know it is late into the evening, and I am not going to take long, but I want to take just a few minutes to speak to the issue before us, and I hope at a later point to make a longer statement. 
First of all, I want to point out, as we deal with this amendment to amend the Constitution to require a balanced budget, it is very important to understand that the budget we are talking about balancing, the U.S. budget, does not have a capital budget to it. Everyone gets up and says, `well, the State governments do it, the local governments do it, private individuals do it, corporations do it, why shouldn't the Federal Government do it?' 
None of those other entities balance a capital budget as well. They all provide for capital budgets that are financed by borrowing. That is what State governments do. They have a requirement to balance the operating budget, but they then sell bonds. Why do States and municipalities issue bonds? Why is there a municipal bond market? Because they borrow in order to fund the capital budget. 
We don't have a capital budget at the Federal level, and anyone who is really serious about trying to write requirements into the Constitution, which, by the way, I think are extremely difficult to do because you can't provide for every contingency, but if you had any degree of seriousness, would first provide for a capital budget. You would set capital investments apart and say, `all right, we recognize we make investments in the future and we capitalize them, and we borrow to fund the capitalization.' 
That is what people do when they buy a home. Although it is said that everybody has to balance their budget, people don't balance their budget every year. It is wise and prudent financial policy, if your income is adequate to the task, to borrow in order to buy a home, to borrow in order to buy a car. 
If individuals had to operate under this amendment's balanced budget requirement, the vast majority of people in this country would not be able to buy an automobile and they would not be able to buy a home, because they couldn't produce the cash with which to make the full payment in the year they incur the obligation, which is what this amendment is requiring of the Federal Government. 
So that is the first point to make. You are talking about trying to balance a budget that includes within it your capital expenditures, instead of setting them aside and funding the capital expenditures through a capital budget, which is financed by borrowing and which makes prudent economic sense. After all, the highway or the building is going to last you for 20, 30, 40 years, and it makes sense to borrow, to amortize it over that period of time and have the use of it right from today out into the future. 
The second point I want to make about the balanced budget amendment is in the post-World War II period, we have used what are known as automatic fiscal stabilizers in order to ameliorate economic downturns. When the economy begins to go soft, the Federal budget automatically shifts toward deficit, for two reasons: First, people are losing jobs, and because they are no longer working, they are not paying taxes into the Treasury; therefore, the revenues into the Government decrease. This happens automatically. We don't take any action around here for that to happen. It just occurs. Because people are no longer working, they are no longer earning, and those people, at least, are not paying taxes into the Treasury. 
Second, at the same time, automatically expenditures increase, because we pay out unemployment insurance. If you have been working, you become unemployed, you are entitled to draw unemployment insurance. So those payments go up. 
The consequence of those two things happening--and there are other transfer payments also that go up in the course of an economic downturn or a recession--the deficit widens. But that 
deficit serves to cushion the economic downturn, because it helps to sustain purchasing power in the economy that would otherwise go into decline. Cushioning occurs because by providing unemployment insurance, you help to hold the economy up and to check the downturn. 
Now, that happens automatically. It doesn't require a conscious decision. If the recession is bad, we often then go on to make conscious decisions here about ways to try to bring the economy back. But under normal circumstances, this cushioning is sufficient to moderate the economic downturn. 
Because we have followed this policy essentially since the end of World War II, we have been able to check the boom-and-bust cycle of our economy, which we had previously been experiencing. Of course, that is a very good thing, because you don't put your economy and your people through the absolute wringer of a major economic downturn. 
The fact of the matter is, as the economy goes soft, you begin to run these deficits. If you try to offset the deficit, either by cutting spending or raising taxes or a combination of the two, in an economic downturn, you would only drive the economy further down. The economy, the business cycle is swinging downwards, and if you compound that swing by a policy of trying to eliminate the deficits which arise from that downturn, you only make the downturn worse, and we have experienced that in our history, during the Great Depression. 
This is why these automatic stabilizers are so important, and this is why, in many respects, this amendment is so dangerous. 
This chart beside me measures real economic growth from 1870 to 1995, and it shows the ups and downs in economic growth in our economy, beginning in 1870 and running through until 1995. The essential thing the chart shows is that since World War II, we have essentially been able to avoid deep economic recessions or, indeed, depressions. 
One of the reasons--not the only reason, but one of the reasons--we have been able to do that is because we have had these automatic economic stabilizers which have kept the economy from coming down into deep negative growth. Only a couple of times have we actually had a downturn that took us into negative growth. Most of the time we get movements, they remain in the positive level, and, as you can see, we have not in recent history experienced the kinds of deep moves we experienced pre-World War II. 
That is why the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Rubin, in testimony before the Judiciary Committee about this amendment to the Constitution, said he was fearful that what it would do is turn an economic downturn into a recession and a recession into a depression. 
Amendment supporters say, `Well, if that happens, we'll get a supermajority around here, we will waive the provisions of the Constitution, and we will take action.' 
There are a number of difficulties with that response. First of all, the automatic stabilizers work automatically. No one has to recognize there is an economic downturn. Often, we don't see an economic downturn is happening until much later, until it is well into its cycle. 
Only a few years ago, Alan Greenspan thought the economy was doing well and said so. Later, it turned out that at the moment he said that, the economy was already into a downturn, but it wasn't recognized, it wasn't seen. Later, when all the figures came in, we went back and saw that we had already gone into a downturn. This amendment is going to cost us these automatic fiscal stabilizers that operate without the need for congressional action, and that cushion a recession that we might not even know to exist. 
Second, we have a lot of arguments around here about whether we have a downturn, how serious a downturn is, how you have to respond to it. 
Franklin Raines, the Director of OMB pointed out the other day before the Budget Committee that a lot of our difficulties are regional depressions, not national depressions. Much of the country might be doing all right, but a region of the country may be in severe trouble and needs help in order to address the situation in which to find itself. 
Of course, then it is going to be extremely difficult to get a supermajority because most communities will not be experiencing a recession or downturn and their representatives will not want to waive this provision. 
I can remember during the administration of President Bush when we tried to act on extending the unemployment insurance. It took us months, months, months, and months before we were able to do it. And all the time the economic downturn was getting worse. As a consequence, all the time we were falling further and further behind the curve. 
The fact of the matter is, is that the earlier you can act, and particularly if you can act automatically, through stabilizers, the quicker you can check the downturn. If the downturn gains momentum, begins to build up steam in that direction, the amount of corrective action that has to be taken in order to turn it around is much greater. The prudent thing is to act early on, because then you do not suffer as much damage because you do not go as deep into the decline. 
But this balanced budget amendment is a virtual guarantee that that kind of early action will not be taken and that we will always be playing catch up with the economic cycle. 
The many distinguished economists who have spoken out, and to whom my very able colleague from California has made reference, have focused, amongst other things, on this aspect of the situation. We ought not to give away lightly the benefits that have come to us by developing effective fiscal policy to help restrain the movements of the business cycle. We have not eliminated it. I assume my colleagues who are pushing this amendment do not for a moment suggest they somehow have figured out a magical way to eliminate the business cycle. But we have developed policies that have ameliorated the business cycle. 
I do not want to go back to these deep declines in the economy. We ought not to be in the situation where, as in the 1930's, we would rue the day that we denied ourselves the capacity to respond to that kind of an emergency so that we actually had to experience something approximating economic devastation before we were prepared to take action. 
Why would you do that? Why would you want to do that? Is the economy not working well? Let us look at that issue for just a moment. 
The unemployment rate today is 5.4 percent. It has been down in the low range of 5 percent now for many months. It is a very good performance. The last time we had a performance anything like that over a sustained period of time was 20 years ago. 
What about the inflation rate? The inflation rate is under 3 percent. It has been there now for the last 4 or 5 years--about or under 3 percent. The last time we had a performance on the inflation front that was that good was 30 years ago. 
So we are doing very well on unemployment and inflation. 
We have created 11.5 million jobs over the last 4 years. Other countries envy us in terms of what we are doing. But, amendment proponents say, we still have a problem with the deficit? What about the deficit? Let us take a look at the deficit. 
Are we making any progress on reducing the deficit? Can someone contend that we are not making any progress on the deficit-reduction front and, therefore, we need a constitutional amendment, as risky and as radical as it might be, in order somehow, some way to compel some kind of action? We should note, however, that the amendment does not curb the deficit at all? You are still going to have to make the budget decisions with respect to the budget--your spending and tax decisions with respect to the budget. Have we been doing that already? 
In 1992, the deficit, in current dollars, was $290 billion. Since then, we brought the deficit down in each of the succeeding 4 years. The deficit now is $107 billion. And the President has submitted a budget plan that will eliminate the deficit by the year 2002. 
Some have criticisms of that plan. Others praise it. I think it is a pretty good plan but it is not written in stone and it is up to the Congress to deal with it now in consultation with the administration. But in any event, there is a plan to bring it down and eliminate the deficit by the year 2002. 
I think the President has pretty good credibility in putting forward this plan on the basis of his record. 
We ran large deficits in the 1980's and into the early 1990's. It was not just the administration that did that, the Congress was complicit in it as well. After all, you do not get a budget unless we in Congress pass it. Although I do want to point out that through those 12 years, in all but 1 year the budget passed by the Congress had a lower deficit figure than the budgets submitted to the Congress by the administration. 
In other words, in every year but one the Congress was able to do a tighter budget than what the administration had submitted to the Congress. Had we passed the administration's submitted budgets, as proposed to us, the deficits would have been larger, not smaller. We did not increase the deficits. We in fact lowered the deficits. 
But now in the last 4 years we have made this very impressive progress and we are on the path to a balanced budget. The way you make this progress is you make decisions on the budget each year. None of this progress was made because there was an amendment in the Constitution. And if you put an amendment in the Constitution, the progress still will not be made. 
The progress can only be made when you vote the budgets, when you make the spending and the tax decisions that are contained within the budget, the consequences of which then give you your deficits or your balance. That is when you make the decisions. And we have been making hard decisions, particularly the 1993 economic plan, which passed this body on the tiebreaking vote of the Vice President. 
A lot of people criticized that plan. People said `Oh, this is going to have devastating consequences on the economy.' It was a combination of spending cuts and some tax changes. But what it produced was a reduced deficit and an economy that has worked exceedingly well over the last 4 years, an economy that other countries look at with a great deal of envy. 
These are the absolute figures on reducing the deficit. Let us look at the measure of the deficit as a percent of the gross national product, which is a very important measure. It enables us to compare with our own performance over time and with other countries. Because as you strengthen your economy, you can bring your deficit down and it becomes a smaller percentage of the GDP and becomes easier to handle. It is like an individual's situation. If he has more income, he is better able to handle the deficit. If his economic strength grows more rapidly than the deficit he is trying to handle, then he gets stronger and more able to pay off the debt. 
Let us look at that. This is what has happened. In 1992, the deficit was 4.9 percent of GDP. That is not a good figure. I am prepared to state that right at the outset. The European Community now, which is trying to move toward monetary union, has established some benchmarks which it is pressing the 15 members of Europe to abide by in order to achieve the monetary union. And one of them is that deficit, as a percent of GDP, be under 3 percent--under 3 percent. That is the benchmark they have set out. 
In 1992 we were at 4.9 percent. 
As this chart beside me shows, we brought down our deficit as a percentage of GDP to 4.1 percent in 1993, 3.1 percent in 1994, 2.3 percent in 1995, and 1.4 percent in 1996. That is the best performance since 1973, 23 years ago. It is a better performance than all but 3 of the 15 members of the European Union, three of the smaller countries--Luxembourg, Denmark, and Ireland. Our projections out into the future are very positive; according to these projections, we will do even better than 1.4 percent in the future. 
So we are making very significant progress toward a balanced budget. We really are on the right track. The real place we ought to be focusing on is on the budget process and the decisions that will be made with respect to spending programs, tax programs, tax subsidies, tax expenditure issues, and so forth. 
Further, our performance of 1.4 percent deficit as a percent of GDP is better than any of the G7 countries, the major industrial countries in the world. 
I was at a Joint Economic Committee hearing this afternoon where Chairman Stiglitz of the Council of Economic Advisers was presenting the economic report of the President. He talked about how nice it was now to go to international meetings with the performance of our economy and be able to hold out as an example to other countries what we are doing. 
Look at this chart beside, which compares the deficit as a share of GDP for each of the G7 nations. Here is the United States, down to 1.4 percent. We have a game plan now, by the year 2002 to close that out completely. Now, I know we will have arguments here about the game plan, but I think it is credible. It could be changed, it could be different. I think it is credible. I think it represents a bona fide effort to close this out. 
Look at this comparison: Here is Japan with 3.1 percent deficit, Germany, 3.5 percent; Canada, 4.2 percent; France, 5.0 percent; the United Kingdom, 5.1 percent. Italy is 7.2 percent. If you make the comparisons, if you do a vertical comparison over our history, we have the best performance now, deficit as a share of GDP, since 1973. That is how we stack up in terms of our past record. If you do a horizontal comparison with other countries around the world, this is how we stack up. Any way you look at that, that is a pretty good performance. 
Now, let me finally address one other point about this amendment. I want to address this assumption here that you can simply get these supermajorities almost by the wave of the hand if you have any kind of serious problem confronting you. Now there are two kinds of supermajorities required in this proposed resolution, Senate Joint Resolution 1--either a majority of the total membership of the body or three-fifths of the total membership of the body, what they call the whole number of the House. Now, what the `majority of the whole' requirement means is in the Senate you would have to have 51 votes--although there is some argument, legally, about the role of the Vice President's vote in this process, an interesting debate that shows you the complexity of this proposal and its potential for complications. That question has never been resolved. Then there is the three-fifths supermajority requirement, which of course in this body would be 60 votes. 
I want to make historical reference to one critical vote in the House, which in a historical sense we can look at and say, `Well, that was a critical vote in the history of this country. That was really a national crisis, and clearly Members should have recognized it and should have acted accordingly. That is the kind of situation which, if it arises again, we certainly would be able to get these supermajorities provided for in this Senate Joint Resolution 1.' In 1940 the U.S. Congress, on the urgings of President Roosevelt, provided for a draft for 1 year, because President Roosevelt saw the war clouds that were gathering in Europe and felt the United States needed to undertake preparation for what might be coming. A year later, of course the issue arose, since it was only for a year, about extending the draft. We are now talking about the fall of 1941, only shortly before Pearl Harbor. The President asked the 
Congress to extend the draft so that we could continue this program of military preparedness because the war clouds were even darker and more ominous. 
The issue was so close in the House of Representatives that Speaker Rayburn, exercising a very rare prerogative of the Speaker, took the floor of the House at the close of the debate to urge extension of the draft. The vote on that issue in the House was 203 to 202, so under the Constitution it carried. You had a quorum present, had a majority of those voting, carrying it 203 to 202. Mr. President, 203 is--and was not then--a majority of the whole number of the House of Representatives, which would be 218 today, and it is certainly not three-fifths of the whole number of the House. These are the two supermajorities required in this resolution. 
Now, there you were with a crisis situation which certainly, looking back at it historically, you would have said, `Well, obviously, those Members of Congress will recognize what the country is confronting and vote to carry this forward.' They barely did it. They cast a vote that would not have worked under the supermajority requirements contained in Senate Joint Resolution 1. 
I think those who say of course we will achieve supermajorities are being much too sanguine. The amendment says that the debt limit shall not be increased without three-fifths of the whole number. We can hardly put together simple majorities in Democratic or Republican administrations to achieve this goal. I have voted in this body to lift the debt ceiling in Republican administrations at the request of Republican Presidents and Republican Secretaries of the Treasury because I felt obviously we had to do that. We could not put the credit of the United States at risk. But those votes have been exceedingly close and they have not come anywhere near meeting the supermajority requirements contained in this Senate Joint Resolution 1. No wonder the Secretary of the Treasury has voiced his apprehension that we might risk a default on the debt and hurt the creditworthiness of the United States through the passage of this amendment to the Constitution. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about this amendment. It is a very radical proposal. It has a lot of surface appeal, as my colleague from California pointed out when she quoted the editorial in the Los Angeles Times. The easy vote is obviously to be for it, as most people upon hearing it say it is a good idea. You really have to go into it and examine it very carefully and appreciate the real way you bring the deficit down is to make the budget decisions, not to amend the Constitution of the United States. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in recognition of the 4-year anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave Act. Approved by the Senate on January 29, 1993, this important legislation was the first bill of the 103d Congress signed into law by newly elected President Clinton. 
Prior to the enactment of the family medical leave law, families already confronting the hardships caused by a seriously ill relative had an additional burden to bear: a fear of losing their jobs should they choose to stay home to care for a loved one. For workers striving to meet the competing demands of home and office, there was no consistent standard of protection. 
The Family Medical Leave Act provides that basic standard of job security to more than 67 million American workers; guaranteeing employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn child or newly adopted child or to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition. In addition, the law enables workers to take medical leave when they themselves are unable to work because of a serious health condition--without fear of being fired or losing their health insurance. 
After 4 years of successfully helping American families strike a balance between work and family, it is difficult to believe that it was necessary to struggle for many years and overcome two vetoes by President Bush in order to enact this fundamental protection for working Americans. Since its enactment, this law has enabled approximately 12 million men and women to take time off from work to meet the care-giving needs of their families. 
While opponents of the Family Medical Leave Act raised concerns about the law's effect on business, their fears have been proven ungrounded by the congressionally charged Bipartisan Commission on Leave. The Commission on Leave, made up of business and labor leaders, representatives of women and families, and members of Congress, provided an initial assessment of the family medical leave law in April 1996. The Commission found that while the law has had a significant impact on employers' leave policies and practices, increasing the reasons for which employees can take leave, this impact has come with minimal administrative activities and almost no costs. In fact, a number of employers have reported a positive impact on business performance because of Family Medical Leave Act policies. 
Mr. President, as a strong supporter and original cosponsor of this significant measure, I am especially pleased with the success of the family medical leave law. Because of this law, millions of Americans, who otherwise may have been forced to choose between the demands of home and workplace, have been able to meet both their personal and professional obligations. As fundamental as the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Social Security Act and the Occupational Safety and Health Act, this law reaffirms the Democratic commitment to ensuring a measure of job protection to all hard-working Americans.

 Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, for over two decades, the Legal Services Corporation, or LSC, has been the embodiment of the words emblazoned in stone above the Supreme Court: `Equal Justice Under Law.' In its effort to fulfill this commitment, the Legal Services Corporation has provided critically needed services to millions of poor, elderly, and disabled citizens who otherwise would not have access to the American legal system and the protection it affords the many basic rights we have in this country--protection which so many of us take for granted. The Legal Services Corporation has also proven to be one of the most efficient Federal programs in existence, using only 3 percent of its total funding for administration and management. 
Yet in recent years, the Corporation's ability to satisfy its mandate has been imperiled by congressional efforts to limit its activities, both by cutting the Corporation's funding and by restricting the kinds of activities in which its lawyers could engage. Some of these efforts have already succeeded, and I suspect that further initiatives in this vein will emerge in the 105th Congress. 
But Mr. President, before we hasten down this path, let us look at what we have already wrought with respect to the ability of our Nation to provide legal services to the needy. 
I use as an example the effect of cutbacks in the Legal Services Corporation in my own State of Maryland. Maryland's Legal Aid Bureau receives by far the largest portion of its funding from the Legal Services Corporation, and over the years has done an outstanding job of representing Maryland citizens living in poverty. With the funding received from LSC, the 13 legal aid offices located throughout Maryland provide general legal services to approximately 19,000 families and individuals annually. 
In contrast to this tradition of effective service, a January 23 article in the Baltimore Sun entitled `Poor Have Trouble Getting Legal Help' demonstrates the current state of legal services in Maryland--a state in no small part due to Congress's recent scaling back of the LSC. 
The article notes that over 1 million Marylanders qualify for legal services, but that volunteer lawyers--the source of the majority of legal assistance with the implementation of Government cutbacks--are barely making a dent in the caseload. In fact, Mr. President, Robert Rhudy, executive director of the Maryland Legal Services Corporation, a State-created organization that administers legal assistance programs in the State, estimates that the Maryland Legal Aid Bureau has the ability to address only 20 percent of the matters that come to its attention. 
The article also notes that recent studies confirm these estimates, finding that about 80 percent of the State's poor lack access to volunteer lawyers. Mr. President, these developments are shameful, and cannot be tolerated by a society that prides itself on its commitment to constitutional principles of equal protection of the laws and equal access to justice. 
Part of the solution certainly lies in encouraging and facilitating volunteerism in our legal communities. Pro bono service is part of a lawyer's ethical obligations. At the same time, we in Congress bear real responsibility for the shortage of legal assistance to the poor. Our efforts to cut back LSC funding in recent years have had a devastating impact on the poor, and have tilted the scales of justice in a way that the creators and founders of LSC would have found to be intolerable. 
Mr. President, I ask that the January 23 Baltimore Sun article be printed in today's Record. I daresay that many other States have stories similar to those in my State, and I urge my colleagues to investigate their States' situation before once again lining up to do away with a program that should be one of the great prices of our Nation.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, last week, America lost a public servant and a leader of unusual intelligence and vision. It is with great sadness that I rise to pay tribute to my former colleague and friend, Paul Tsongas, whose untimely passing has deeply affected both those who knew him well and the millions of Americans who respected and admired his exemplary life. 
His frank and fearless commitment to a better America challenged us all. As remembered by the Hellenic Chronicle, a Massachusetts publication, Senator Tsongas `changed the face of politics in the 1990's and reminded us that honesty and the power of ideas can still count for something in American politics.' He was unwavering in his ideals because he truly believed them. At his funeral, Bishop Methodios of Boston spoke of Senator Tsongas' insight, integrity and intelligence; fitting qualities for a person who, as the Bishop said, `looked deep within his heart and soul and there discovered his vision for a better America.' 
The son of a Greek immigrant, Senator Tsongas went from working in his father's drycleaning store to Dartmouth College, Yale Law School, and the Peace Corps. He won his first bid for public office in 1969, when he was elected to the Lowell City Council, the beginning of an esteemed career that included service as Middlesex County Commissioner in 1973, fifth congressional district representative to the U.S. House in 1974 --the first Democrat to win in his district in a century, and United States Senator from Massachusetts in 1979, an office never before held by a Peace Corps veteran. 
In the Senate, I was privileged to serve with Senator Tsongas on the Banking and Foreign Relations Committees, where he fulfilled his duties with great capability and distinction. His understanding of the world beyond our borders, gained during his service in the Peace Corps, equipped him to make a significant contribution to a more effective American foreign policy. Senator Tsongas never took the privilege of being a U.S. Senator for granted. He was serious about his work and had high hopes and even higher standards for this country. 
`Patriotism is like charity,' wrote Henry James. `It begins at home.' For Senator Tsongas, everything began at home. Whether it was Lowell, the town in which he made his life, or the family that was his life, Senator Tsongas never lost sight of what was most important. He often questioned the legacy he would leave behind for the people and places he cared for most. He should not have been concerned. Due to his efforts both in and out of office, the town of Lowell now claims a national historic park, thousands of jobs, a minor league baseball team, 14 new schools, and a real sense of pride. As the local paper noted, `We in Lowell need only walk through our city to celebrate--every day--what Paul Tsongas did for his hometown.' 
I will always remember Paul Tsongas, as will his fellow Americans, as a highly principled public servant who, unafraid of any challenge, was exceedingly able to affect the issues of his time. I will also remember him as the individual who inspired us all by confronting his own mortality with extraordinary grace and heroism. His faith in his own instincts not only gave him the courage to step down from office when the time was right, it was also the source of his strength during his distinguished service in the Congress of the United States. 
Senator Tsongas left an indelible mark on our hearts, which now go out to his wife Niki, his daughters Ashley, Katina and Molly, and his sisters Thaleia and Vicki. They have so much to mourn, but they also have so much of which to be proud. 
There is a requiem hymn sung in the Greek Orthodox Church which, here, seems apropos: `Eonia e mneeme.' It means, `may he live in our memories forever.' In the last years of his life, Senator Tsongas struggled with the question of history, with what he would leave us. The answer is, clearly, much. Paul Tsongas will live in the memories and records of his country, his town, and his family, forever.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise for myself and my distinguished colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, to introduce a bill crucial to the administration of justice and the economy in our State. This bill provides for two additional bankruptcy judgeships in the Federal Judicial District of Maryland. A look at the conditions currently facing Maryland's bankruptcy judges reveals the critical need for these new judgeships. 
Recent years have witnessed a sharp rise in bankruptcy filings nationwide. Last year, for the first time in our history, filings during a 12-month period--June 1995-June 1996--exceeded 1 million, a 21.4-percent rise from the prior 12-month period. This trend has many causes, including greater access to credit, a lagging economy in some regions, and public and private downsizing. Such sharp increases in filings strain the ability of bankruptcy judges to administer justice promptly and effectively, and jeopardize the stabilization of creditor-debtor relations that is, after all, the goal of bankruptcy law. 
No State has been more affected by these trends than Maryland. Bankruptcies there have quadrupled in the past decade. As filings rise nationwide, Maryland rates of increase have significantly exceeded Federal rates. No end appears to be in sight. Maryland filings during January-November 1996 exceeded State filings during the same period in 1995 by 36 percent; in the July-November 1996 period, State filings exceeded by 45 percent filings during the same period in 1995. 
In 1991, the U.S. Judicial Conference, using a 1990 Federal Judicial Center time-management study, adopted a case-weighting system for bankruptcy judges, under which different types of cases were assigned different degrees of difficulty and overall weighted case-hour goals were established for the judges. Under this system, the average U.S. bankruptcy judge has a weighted case-hour load of about 1,250 hours per year. The Judicial Conference generally does not consider a request for new bankruptcy judgeships by a Federal judicial district unless the average case-hour total for the district's judges exceeds 1,500. 
Given these yardsticks, the burdens facing the district of Maryland's bankruptcy judges are truly astounding. 
In 1993, the national weighted case-hour average was 1,362 hours; by contrast, the Maryland average for that year was 59 percent greater--2,168 hours. 
In 1994, the national average was 1,227 hours; the 1994 Maryland average was 75 percent greater--2,143 hours. 
In 1995, the national average was 1,149 hours; the 1995 Maryland average was 72 percent greater--1,982 hours. 
In 1996, the national average was 1,272 hours; the Maryland total for that year was 75 percent greater--2,230 hours. 
So for each of the last 4 years, the average weighted case-hours for Maryland's bankruptcy judges have exceeded by a wide margin not only the national average, but also the 1,500-hour yardstick used by the Judicial Conference to rate requests for additional judges. 
Other States have faced temporary overloads, but only Maryland can claim the dubious distinction of having one of the Nation's most overworked bankruptcy courts for each of the last 4 years. In fact, only the District of Maryland has ranked in the top 3 among the 91 Federal judicial districts during each of the 8 biannual evaluations of bankruptcy judges' case-hours since September 1992. 
This situation cries out for remedial action. Recognizing as much, the Judicial Conference recommended to the 104th Congress that Maryland receive an additional bankruptcy judgeship. Unfortunately, this proposal was not enacted into law and, as a result, the problem has worsened considerably. 
I have cited data on increased bankruptcy filings in Maryland during late 1996. If Maryland received one additional bankruptcy judge tomorrow, the case-hours per judge in the district would still be 1,784, 141 percent of the national average and well in excess of the 1,500-hour mark used to rate a district's need for new judges. 
In fact, even if Maryland received two new bankruptcy judges, its per judge caseload would still exceed the national average by 18 percent. To place Maryland at the national average, three additional bankruptcy judges would be required. Yet this bill adds only two judgeships, the minimum response according to those most familiar with the problem. This is the number recommended to the Judicial Conference by the Fourth Circuit Judicial Council, and I fully expect the Judicial Conference to include two new Maryland judgeships in its spring recommendations to Congress. 
New judgeships are essential not only for effective judicial administration, but also for Maryland's economy. Bankruptcy laws are crafted to foster orderly, constructive relationships between debtors and creditors during times of economic difficulty. This in turn results in businesses being reorganized, jobs--provided by creditors and debtors--preserved, and debts managed fairly. Overworked bankruptcy courts have a destabilizing effect on this system. 
Consider an example. Bankruptcy law provides debtors temporary relief from the claims of creditors, allowing the debtor to adopt a reorganization plan, thereby improving its chances of recovery, and keeping creditors from cutting in line in front of other creditors who have priority claims on debtor assets. But the law also allows a court to grant creditors relief from a stay where the creditor shows that its claim will not receive adequate protection under normal procedures. Under this procedure, a court 
must hold a hearing 30 days after an application for relief from the stay, or automatically grant relief. 
Because of the importance of these hearings, Maryland's bankruptcy judges routinely set aside 1 day per week to conduct them. One such judge, on December 6, 1996, had on his calendar 125 motions for relief from stay, a caseload that obviously precludes these cases from being fully heard. Thus, creditors seeking to cut in line, to the detriment of the debtor, other creditors, and the orderly administration of the bankrupt estate, may file for relief from stay, knowing that the case will not likely be heard and that the creditor will receive automatic relief under the law. Failure to hold a timely hearing may result in the inability of a debtor to reorganize, or in the cheating of other worthy creditors. 
Similarly, the extreme caseloads faced by Maryland's bankruptcy judges allow dishonest debtors to dissipate assets, again at the expense of worthy creditors. 
In short, the inevitable delays occasioned by the lack of judges harm both creditors and debtors, thereby imperiling businesses and the people employed by them. Is it any wonder that private bankruptcy practitioners and business groups also support additional bankruptcy judges for the District of Maryland? To quote Susan Souder, president of the Maryland Federal Bar Association, `Maryland citizens, businesses, and lenders should be entitled to the same protection of the courts as their counterparts in other States.' Currently they do not receive such protection. Two new bankruptcy judges in the District of Maryland are imperative if we are to address this critical problem. 
In closing, let me commend the dedicated efforts of Maryland's four sitting bankruptcy judges--Chief Judge Paul Mannes and Judges Duncan Kier, James Schneider, and Steve Derby. Their dedication to the administration of justice is especially impressive given the extraordinary burdens placed upon them.

Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I join my colleague, the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator D'Amato of New York, in strong support of the nomination of Andrew Cuomo as the next Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
In my judgment, Mr. Cuomo is well qualified for this position. In addition to his background, experience, and record of significant achievement, Andrew Cuomo will provide the Department with stability and continuity since he has been an Assistant Secretary at the Department over the past 4 years. 
As HUD's Assistant Secretary for Community and Planning Development, Andrew Cuomo played a significant role in this administration's efforts to revitalize America's distressed communities and a significant role in their efforts to restructure the Department itself. In that regard, outgoing HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros--who I think deserves the thanks of all of us for the very stellar service he has given to the Nation--made significant progress in addressing the management difficulties that confronted the Department at the beginning of his tenure. Andrew Cuomo was part of that team, and his familiarity with the way the Department works and the reforms now underway will provide for a smooth transition that will allow this progress to move forward. 
Mr. Cuomo's activities in the realm of housing and urban development prior to his joining the Department at the beginning of the first Clinton administration demonstrated the initiative and innovation that he has brought with him to the Department. He created HELP, a homeless assistance organization that is now the Nation's largest provider of transitional housing for the homeless. He also developed the alternative approaches to urban revitalization and community development that led to the founding of the Genesis project, a program that has created partnerships 
between State and local governments and the private sector to provide affordable housing. 
Mr. Cuomo has put this past experience and the vision connected therewith to work over the past 4 years as HUD Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development. His achievements during this period in that office were many. This morning, I want to underscore three achievements, in particular, that indicate his promise as he takes on the larger challenge of stewardship of the entire Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
First, I want to commend Mr. Cuomo's administration of the HOME Investment Partnership Program. Chairman D'Amato and former housing subcommittee chairman, Senator Alan Cranston, were very much involved in establishing the HOME program. When the Clinton administration arrived, the relatively new HOME program was moving slowly, seemingly mired in regulation. Mr. Cuomo took the initiative in eliminating those regulations that were obstructing the program's progress. He worked closely with State and local governments and the private sector--both for-profit and nonprofit--to identify the features of the HOME program that needed to change in order to allow the program to function better. The result of his hard work is the effective housing program that HOME has become today. State and local governments, in conjunction with private for-profit and private not-for-profit partners, are producing significant results using HOME funds for activities ranging from housing rehabilitation to home ownership assistance. 
Mr. Cuomo has also earned praise for his tireless work on behalf of the homeless. After 4 years as Assistant Secretary, he can take the credit for changing the way that our Nation's homeless programs are administered at the local level. Under his leadership communities have now instituted a continuum of care approach. The continuum of care is a phrase that Andrew Cuomo coined for a comprehensive system of assistance that provides prevention, outreach and screening, emergency shelters, transitional and supportive housing, and permanent housing with services to the homeless where needed. I have seen the effectiveness of the service delivery that comes with the local planning and coordination that are at the core of the continuum of care approach. Andrew Cuomo has made these happen. 
Third, Mr. Cuomo deserves recognition for his direction of the HUD programs that assist local economic development. He has worked hard to make the Community Development Block Grant Program a more effective tool for local communities pursuing new economic development opportunities. He has also expanded the section 108 loan guarantee program, greatly improving that program's use by local government. And, he has served ably as the principal Federal official charged with the implementation of the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community Programs. All of these activities will become increasingly important as the Nation struggles with its commitment to move families from welfare to work. 
Andrew Cuomo reiterated his commitment to his role as HUD Secretary in his statement before the Banking Committee last week, and I quote him:  
Our goal must be to create a future unlike any that has come before--a future open to all--in which no person is left behind and in which no community is forgotten. A future in which everyone willing to do his or her part will be empowered with the tools to reach as high as their talents and hard work will take them. 
Mr. President, it is clear why President Clinton has selected Andrew Cuomo as the next Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this very fine nomination. 
Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Connecticut whatever time he may require.

Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as an original cosponsor of the Family Farmer Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 1997. This legislation will provide relief for family farmers from a recent Internal Revenue Service decision regarding deferred payment contracts which could result in sizable and unexpected tax bills for the coming year. 
For over 16 years, family farmers in Maryland and across the country have used deferred payment contracts to sell their crops and livestock in order to better manage and even out their business income from year to year. The tax code has specifically permitted farmers to manage their business on a cash basis of accounting and use deferred payment contracts without AMT liability. However, a recent IRS decision to enforce alternative minimum taxation on all crop and livestock sales, including deferred payment contracts, effectively repeals farmers' ability to use these contracts to move their tax liability into future years. If relief is not soon provided, many family farmers will face sizable--and unexpected--tax bills for the coming tax year. The purpose of this legislation is to clarify the law and ensure that family farmers can continue to receive the tax benefit provided from the use of the cash method of accounting and from installment sales for their deferred payment commodities contracts as Congress originally intended. 
I hope the committee will schedule hearings on this matter as quickly as possible so that this legislation can be enacted prior to the taxation filing deadline. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.

Mr. SARBANES. I rise in very strong and enthusiastic support of the nomination of Madeleine K. Albright to be Secretary of State. 
In my judgment, Ambassador Albright is an outstanding choice for this position. Her experience, both personal and professional, as well as her demonstrated leadership ability, her steadfast adherence to the values and principles that Americans hold dear, and her vast and indisputable knowledge of the many complex issues that will no doubt confront our next Secretary of State, make it clear why President Clinton has selected her. 
Ambassador Albright's work with the administration over the past 4 years testifies to her ability to excel at two very different aspects of the position for which she has been nominated. She has worked within the administration to craft effective responses to the international challenges we face--obviously a prime responsibility of the Secretary of State. She also during these last 4 years has articulated those policies in a clear and persuasive manner, building support among the American people and winning the cooperation and respect of the international community. Her capability in both the private and public arenas of policymaking is most impressive. 
It is abundantly clear to those familiar with her record that she represents a very tough-minded and perceptive choice on the part of the President. She has distinguished herself in many institutions and aspects of foreign policymaking, from the executive and legislative branches to the world of academia. Over the past two decades, she has served as a staff member both at the National Security Council and in the Senate, where she worked with our former colleague, Ed Muskie, who himself then later became Secretary of State. As a scholar, she has earned respect in the academic community as a researcher and teacher, consistently drawing high praise from her students--further testimony to her ability both to come up with solutions to complex issues as well as to explain them to the community at large. 
As president of the Center for National Policy, a nonprofit research organization formed by representatives from government, industry, and labor, she not only gained an understanding of the nonprofit sector but worked to bring together these diverse groups in the interest of domestic and international policy. 
For the past 4 years she has served in the President's Cabinet as Permanent Representative to the United Nations, where she has addressed issues ranging from economic development to peacekeeping to counternarcotics, and has dealt with conflicts that span the globe. 
Under her leadership the United States gained Security Council approval for the United States-led, multinational effort to restore democracy in Haiti, for resolutions condemning human rights violations in countries including Cuba, Sudan, Burma, Nigeria, Iran, and Iraq, and for the establishment of an inspector general to crack down on waste and fraud within the U.N. system. That she accomplished these and many other important goals at a time when the United States was the world's largest debtor to the United Nations, thereby undercutting our influence in that institution, bears witness to her formidable diplomatic skills. 
What Ambassador Albright will bring to this position, however, reaches far beyond the qualifications that are listed on her impressive resume. Her own personal family history of escaping from persecution, first at the hands of the Nazis and subsequently at those of the Communists, has given her a profound understanding of the values and interests at the very heart of U.S. foreign policy. At her hearing, she eloquently reminded us that freedom and democracy can be challenged from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. She told the committee, `It might be said of America that we have no permanent enemies, only permanent principles. Those principles are founded in respect for law, human dignity and freedom, not just for some, but for all people.' 
Referring to the United States as `the indispensable nation,' she challenged us to become `the authors of the history of our age' by seizing the opportunity to meet the demands of a new century. 
I think we all agree on the importance of having the President's new foreign policy team in place as quickly as possible, and I am pleased that the Foreign Relations Committee and the full Senate are acting upon this nomination in such an expeditious manner. I understand the Armed Services Committee is also moving expeditiously to consider the nomination of our former colleague, Senator William Cohen, to be Secretary of Defense. We have before us a full and pressing agenda: the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention and budgeting adequate resources for the effective conduct of our foreign policy, to mention only two. Ambassador Albright's confirmation hearing proved to all of us President Clinton's insight in selecting her for this significant and weighty assignment. He chose her for her demonstrated competence, her broad range of experience, for her consistently sound advice, and her exceptional ability to explain international issues to Americans while conveying U.S. policies and principles to the world. 
I believe that Madeleine Albright is eminently qualified to become Secretary of State. I urge my colleagues to join with me in approving her nomination. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.
