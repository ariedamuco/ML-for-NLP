Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on October 15th, America lost it's reigning Polka King, and Wisconsin lost a beloved friend: Frankie Yankovic. 
From the day he debuted in the Milwaukee area at Bert Phillips Ballroom in Menomonee Falls, Frankie Yankovic has had a special place among Wisconsin's polka fans. Wisconsinites loves to polka, so much so that it's our state's official dance. And no polka musician has won more accolades, had more devoted fans, or taught more Americans to love that simple dance than Frankie Yankovic. 
While he was born in West Virginia and was a long-time resident of Cleveland, Frankie Yankovic felt a special connection to Milwaukee. `I should have come here and made Milwaukee my hometown,' he once said. There is nothing we'd have liked better, but Wisconsinites were lucky for the many chances we've had to enjoy Yankovic's music, and to pay tribute to his myriad achievements in the music world. 
In fact, it was in Milwaukee that Yankovic was crowned as America's Polka King in 1948. Just one year later, his `Blue Skirt Waltz' hit number two on Columbia Records' bestseller list, just behind Gene Autry's `Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,' one of the best-selling records of all time. He was the first inductee to both the Polka Hall of Fame in Minnesota in 1988 and the Wisconsin Polka Hall of Fame in 1996. 
Yankovic didn't just contribute to popular music, he revolutionized it by infusing traditional polka music with a smoother style, and introducing new instruments, such as the bass fiddle, to polka arrangements. 
Throughout his career, Yankovic's singular style energized audiences. His compositions were legendary, including such Wisconsin-inspired tunes as the `Kringleville Polka,' about Racine, and `There's No Joy Left Now in Milwaukee,' about the Braves leaving for Atlanta. 
Yankovic was a man who made audiences roar and floors shake as he brought capacity crowds to their feet to do that simple step that just, as Yankovic put it, `makes people happy.' He often rallied audiences by asking `What do you think this is, a concert? Let's get up and dance!' 
Milwaukeeans know that Frankie Yankovic was loved coast to coast, appearing on Johnny Carson and performing with the likes of Milton Berle and Doris Day. And we know that Cleveland was his permanent address. But in Wisconsin, we proudly count him as one of our own. `I love Milwaukee,' he often said, and Milwaukee loved him back. On behalf of the people of Wisconsin, I thank Frankie Yankovic for the happiness he brought to Wisconsin's polka fans over the years, and I pay tribute to his memory.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to state my opposition to the omnibus appropriations bill, and outline some of my concerns with both the content of that measure, and with the process in which it was crafted. 
First and foremost, Mr. President, this omnibus appropriations bill shreds the tough spending limits established by last year's bipartisan budget agreement. It does so through the expedient of declaring nearly 21 billion dollars in spending as a budget emergency, thus exempting that spending from the spending caps and budget discipline that was so central to last year's budget agreement. 
Mr. President, as I have noted on the floor previously, the emergency exception to our budget rules was intended to allow Congress to act quickly to provide funding to assist victims of natural disasters or to help ensure an adequate and timely response to an international crisis. Sadly, that exception has now become the rule, and we now see emergency declarations attached to appropriations provisions not because those provisions were unexpected or urgent, but because doing so permitted Congress to duck its budget responsibilities. 
That is a gross abuse of the emergency provisions incorporated in our budget rules, and it must stop. 
Mr. President, of particular concern is the use of the emergency exception to add funds to an already bloated defense budget. 
Mr. President, the only emergency in our defense readiness is the sorry state of posturing by Congress for more defense spending. Some Members insist Congress must throw more money into the Department of Defense, even when our military leaders say they don't need it. 
But, Mr. President, the Pentagon does not need more money. The money going to the Pentagon needs to be spent more wisely. Unfortunately, too often Congress does everything in its power to make sure that does not happen. 
Congress continues to spend billions of dollars on pork-barrel projects that the Pentagon does not need and does not want. Congress bars the closing of unnecessary bases, and refuses to address accounting fraud so destructive that Senator Grassley recently stated that, `If we put adequate controls on the money we have, there should be no need for more defense spending.' 
Last week, Mr. President, the Washington Post reported there were at least 30 items that appeared for the first time in the fine print of the $250 billion defense spending bill. These included: $250,000 to study the potential uses of a caffeinated gum, reportedly slipped into the defense spending bill by a Member of the other body on behalf of the firm in his Illinois district that makes this gum; $2.4 million for a device called the American Underpressure System, reportedly another late addition to the defense spending bill pushed by the San Diego businessman who holds the patent on the device; and, $5 million to fund the purchase of electronic locks manufactured by a Kentucky firm, reportedly added by a member of that State's delegation to the defense spending bill during conference deliberations. The Washington Post story reported the Kentucky lockmaker was able to obtain still another earmark in the Energy Department spending bill for $2 million. 
Mr. President, this practice is an outrage, but one many in both chambers choose to ignore, or, worse, perpetuate. If we cut the pork and allowed the Pentagon to close inefficient bases, we would not even need to discuss so-called emergency spending for defense. 
Among the most abusive uses of the emergency exception in the defense budget is the proposed $1.9 billion in funding for U.S. troops in Bosnia. 
Mr. President, I have always had serious questions about U.S. involvement in this mission. I was the only Democrat to vote against the deployment of U.S. troops back in 1995, in large part because I did not believe that the United States would be able to complete the mission in the time projected and for the price tag that was originally estimated. Unfortunately, I have been proven right, and I take no pleasure in it. 
U.S. forces have now been in Bosnia for almost three years, much longer than the original one-year mandate, and I do not think anyone has a good idea how many more years we will be there. More significantly, the cost of our involvement in Bosnia has increased dramatically--easily more than quadrupling the original $2 billion estimate to more than $8 billion, not including the $1.9 billion now proposed to be added by the omnibus appropriations measure. 
But beyond the strict policy concerns of our mission in Bosnia, Mr. President, is the troubling budget maneuvering that has been done to add still more funding to this questionable mission. 
Mr. President, the funding for the Bosnia mission will not be forced to comply with our budget caps. The additional $1.9 billion provided in this bill is designated as emergency funding. 
Mr. President, our Bosnia mission can hardly be characterized as an unexpected event, something deserving of emergency funding. Far from it. Our mission in Bosnia is a substantial, long-term commitment. It is something the United States has, for better or worse, decided to do for the long-term. 
Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines the word `emergency' as follows: `an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action.' 
This definition clearly does not apply to the Bosnia mission. The Bosnia mission is an emergency only in the strange language of appropriations bills. The Bosnia `emergency' is a legislative fiction. 
U.S. troops have been on the ground in Bosnia for nearly three years. In December of 1997 the President announced that he would forego imposing a deadline altogether, and opt instead for a policy of benchmarks whose definitions remain open to interpretation. 
Given that policy, Mr. President, how can Congress and the President possibly argue to the American people that the additional costs for the Bosnia mission constitute an emergency? On the contrary, it has been clear for quite a while now that the cost of this mission would again rise substantially. Some would say it has been clear from the start. 
Ironically, Congressional appropriators and our military leaders have planned for many months on obtaining these so-called emergency funds. 
Mr. President, the mission in Bosnia does not represent an emergency that legitimately calls for us to depart from our established, vital budget rules. 
Mr. President, as I noted, the Bosnia funding is only one example. What compounds this dangerous trend away from budget discipline is the reported evolution of much of the emergency spending. In particular, it has been reported that the negotiations surrounding the omnibus appropriations bill at one point centered on the insistence of some that for every emergency dollar added for one group of programs, another had to be added for a 
different set of programs. Essentially, the budget negotiation became a bidding contest in which deficit-financed spending was the currency. 
This brings me to my second serious objection to the measure before us, namely the process by which it was crafted. 
Mr. President, continuing resolutions and omnibus appropriations are fast becoming the standard process in Congress. Deliberate, careful, and open consideration of agency budgets, with the full participation of everyone's elected representatives in a public forum has been shunted aside, and instead we have a process of back room deals by a powerful few. 
Mr. President, that is not democracy in action, and it rewards those well-funded, well-connected special interests that already distort the policy agenda of the Federal government. 
We should not be surprised, then, when dozens of special interest earmarks and policy riders find their way into the omnibus measure with little or no public debate. 
The normal appropriations process is already tainted to a great extent with this kind of influence. The closed door dealings in which this legislation was developed only make that problem worse. 
A telling example of the policy that can result from this flawed process is the language delaying implementation of the most modest of reforms in our nation's dairy policy. 
Language included in this omnibus measure extends USDA's rulemaking period on Federal Milk Marketing Order reform for six months. This extension will delay implementation of the new federal milk pricing system to October of 1999, instead of the original date of April, 1999 set in the Farm Bill. Mr. President, officials at USDA have assured me that they did not request this extension nor do they need it. 
Mr. President, this dairy provision was included solely to intimidate and bully USDA and Secretary Glickman into an anti-Wisconsin dairy pricing reform. Instead of allowing USDA to do its job, some Members of Congress want to do it for them, and do it to benefit their own producers at the expense of dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest. 
It is ridiculous that today, in times of advanced technologies, Wisconsin producers receive a Class I differential of $1.20 per hundredweight, while producers in Kansas City, Missouri receive $1.92, and our friends in Miami get $4.18. Dairy farmers in Miami make nearly $3.00 more per hundredweight than farmers in the Upper Midwest for the same product. The current system just does not make sense in today's world. 
The extension of USDA's rulemaking had another intent as well. Extending the rulemaking period automatically extends the life of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The 1996 Farm Bill requires a sunset of the Compact when the new federal pricing system is implemented. At the rate Congress is going, tacking this issue onto appropriations bills, there is no telling when implementation will now occur. 
The effects of the Compact on consumers within the region and producers outside of it are indisputable. Dairy compacts are harmful, unnecessary and a burden to this country's taxpayers. 
The worst part of this entire sixty-five-year dairy fiasco is its effect on the producers in the Upper Midwest. The six-month extension puts an additional 900 Wisconsin producers at risk. Wisconsin loses approximately three dairy farmers a day. Producers cannot stand six more days of the current program, let alone six more months. 
Mr. President, not only is legislating dairy policy on this bill inappropriate, it is bad precedent, it circumvents the appropriate committees, the Agriculture and Judiciary Committees, and circumvents USDA's authority. We ought to give USDA the opportunity to do the right thing for today's national dairy industry and put an end to the unfair Eau Claire system now, not six months from now. 
Mr. President, once again I urge my colleagues to take a second look at this antiquated and harmful policy. Stand up for equity, fairness, and for what is best for America's dairy industry, our consumers and our taxpayers. 
Mr. President, the omnibus measure is also the vehicle for a number of anti-environment riders. Here again, by burying these provisions in this mammoth appropriations bill, those promoting these anti-environmental provisions are able to avoid full and open debate of their proposals. They succeed in avoiding a separate vote on matters that are quite controversial. 
That is the nature of this kind of bill and this kind of process, Mr. President. An unamendable, `must pass' bill inevitably will be a magnet for proposals that cannot stand up to the scrutiny of open debate. 
Mr. President, some may blame the nature of the annual budget process for putting Congress in the position of having to pass an omnibus appropriations bill. Some might suggest the inability to pass all the appropriations bills in a timely manner is inherent in the annual budget process, and in this regard I am certainly willing to give the biennial budget process a try. I was pleased to cosponsor the measure offered by the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) to move to a biennial process. 
But the annual budget process is not the central problem. The central problem is the corrupting influences that permeate the entire policymaking environment, from our system of campaign finance, to the problems of revolving door hiring practices, to the inadequate lobbying and gift restrictions on Members. 
And the incentives in such a corrupting environment all encourage just this kind of process--back room negotiations, among only a few powerful people, with little or no outside input or public scrutiny. 
Mr. President, as this bill so graphically demonstrates, until the Senate and the other body do something to address that underlying problem, Congress cannot be trusted even to abide by the spending limits to which it agreed only a year ago.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of S. Con. Res. 128, introduced last week by the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy]. I believe that this resolution is both timely and important. 
This resolution calls on the Secretary of State to take a number of steps to foster improvement in the human rights situation in Mexico and to end the violence in the state of Chiapas. These steps include ensuring that any assistance and exports of equipment to Mexican security forces are used primarily for counter-narcotics and do not contribute to human rights violations, encouraging the Mexican government to disarm paramilitary groups and decrease the military presence in Chiapas, and encouraging the Mexican government and the Zapatista National Liberation Army to establish concrete conditions for negotiations for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Chiapas. 
Mr. President, allow me to just review briefly what is going on in Chiapas today. Just over four years ago, in January 1994, the Zapatista National Liberation Army, an organization of peasant and indigenous peoples seeking political and social changes, launched an uprising by seizing four towns in the Chiapas region of southern Mexico; fighting in the region resulted in nearly 100 deaths. Although the Mexican government initially countered the rebellion by sending troops to the region, issuing arrest warrants for all Zapatista leaders, and creating a new military zone near the site of the Chiapas rebellion, Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo subsequently canceled the arrest warrants, ordered the cessation of all offensive actions against the Zapatista Army, and called for dialogue between Zapatista leaders and the Mexican government. Since August of 1995, the Zapatistas have participated intermittently in peace negotiations with the Mexican government. 
Last December, 45 indigenous peasants in the village of Acteal, Chiapas, were killed by armed men reportedly affiliated with President Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). Following this incident, President Zedillo appointed a new Minister of Government and a new peace negotiator for Chiapas, the Governor of Chiapas resigned, and Mexican authorities arrested more than 40 people in connection with this incident, including the mayor of a nearby town. 
These incidents renewed calls for peace in Chiapas. The Zapatistas rejected legislation submitted to the Mexican Congress by President Zedillo in March 1998 to promote indigenous rights in Chiapas. President Zedillo visited the region several times in mid-1998 to promote dialogue, but the talks fell apart after the June 1998 resignation of Bishop Ruiz from the mediation commission, and the commission subsequently dissolved. In July 1998, the Zapatistas advanced a proposal for mediation and for a Mexican plebiscite on President Zedillo's indigenous rights legislation. 
But, Mr. President, efforts for dialogue between the Mexican government and the Zapatistas have been largely fruitless, and the violence continues. I am deeply troubled by this situation. 
I am also deeply troubled by the cool reception that the Mexican government has given to some international human rights observers, including people from my home state of Wisconsin. Many of these individuals have worked tirelessly from the beginning of the Chiapas conflict to help organize humanitarian assistance for the indigenous peoples of the troubled region. Some of these individuals feel that there has been a concerted effort by the Government of Mexico to keep foreigners out of the region in order to limit this kind of humanitarian assistance and to limit the ability of outsiders to monitor and report on the human rights situation there. Many humanitarian workers have been detained for long periods of time and summarily deported from Mexico. 
The deficient reception of humanitarian workers in Chiapas casts doubt on the sincerity of the Mexican Government when it says it wants to work with the United States and others to control drug trafficking or to enter into end-use monitoring agreements on the transfer of military equipment. 
Mr. President, I believe the United States has an obligation to be an advocate for human rights protections around the world. I am not convinced that the Mexican National Commission on Human Rights (CNDH), which was established in 1990, has done enough to prevent continuing violations by Mexican law enforcement officials and the Mexican military. I believe the United States must make human rights a top priority in our relations with Mexico, and I do not believe Mexico can reach stability without permitting its citizens to exercise their basic rights. In light of the proximity of Mexico to the United States and the myriad ties between our two countries, we have a clear interest in working to ensure that human rights are respected in Mexico. 
Again, Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S.Con.Res. 128, which, in my view, will further call attention to the on-going human rights abuses in Chiapas. I hope that the Administration will actively work to put human rights at the very top of our priority list with respect to Mexico, and that the Mexican government will take concrete steps to end the violence in Chiapas and to respect the rights of all Mexican citizens and international visitors.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to bring to the Senate's attention an excellent editorial published by the Washington Post on Wednesday, October 7, 1998 concerning the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. 
This convention seeks to establish worldwide standards for the criminalization of the bribery of foreign officials to influence or retain business. Just over 20 years ago the Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. This landmark legislation, which I am proud to say was sponsored by one of Wisconsin's most respected elected officials, Senator William Proxmire, was enacted after it was discovered that some American companies were keeping slush funds for making questionable and/or illegal payments to foreign officials to help land business deals. 
For these 20 years, the FCPA has succeeded at curbing U.S. corporate bribery of foreign officials by establishing extensive bookkeeping requirements to ensure transparency and by criminalizing the bribery of foreign officials. 
The OECD treaty, which passed the Senate unanimously earlier this year, would bring most of our major trading partners up to the same standards that U.S. companies have been exercising since the FCPA became law. 
Mr. President, I consider this treaty, and the implementing legislation, S. 2375, that accompanies it, to be important work of the Congress. However, as the Washington Post noted in its editorial, the House of Representatives has yet to pass this legislation. 
As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, which had the responsibility to recommend the Senate provide its advice and consent on this treaty, I hope the House will move quickly to pass the implementing legislation prior to adjournment.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we are now in the closing days of this congressional session. A lot is happening in these final hours. With the clock ticking we almost always knuckle down and get things done. But it has become clear that one thing that this Congress will not do before it adjourns is pass meaningful campaign finance reform. 
Today I want to serve notice that this fight is not over. If the people of Wisconsin in their wisdom send me back to this chamber next year, the Senate will hear about campaign finance reform again and vote on campaign finance reform again because our democracy has been made sick by the corrupting influence of big money, and the future of our country is at stake. 
And Mr. President, this fight will continue regardless of what I say. Because the fight for campaign finance reform is bigger than any one Senator or any one political party. It is as big as the idea of representative democracy itself, and just as resilient. This is a fight for the soul and the survival of our American democracy. This democracy cannot survive without the confidence of the people in the legislative and the electoral process. The prevalence--no--the dominance--of money in our system of elections and our legislature will in the end cause them to crumble. If we don't take steps to clean up this system it ultimately will consume us along with our finest American ideals. 
Mr. President, there has been alot of discussion on this floor in recent weeks about morality. Indeed, we are now engaged in a process, both constitutional and political, that may ultimately lead to an impeachment trial in this historic chamber. Questions of morality are at the center of that process, which has consumed much of the public's and the press's attention over the past several months. 
I submit that questions of morality should be central in this body's treatment of the campaign finance issue. Along with millions of other Americans, religious leaders from across a wide spectrum of denominations have urged us to enact reform. They see how this corrupt system is undermining the moral authority of our government. How can we pretend to be following the dictates of conscience, and not politics, as we prepare to judge the President, while simultaneously ignoring this moral crisis in the process by which the people elect their representatives? 
There has also been a lot of discussion about high crimes and misdemeanors. 
I haven't decided yet whether the President's misbehavior meets that high standard. Many of the American people seem skeptical. 
But they do think it's a crime that the tobacco companies can use money to block a bill to curtail teen smoking. They do think it's a crime that insurance companies can use money to block desperately needed health care reform. They do think it's a crime that telecommunication companies use money and can force a bill through Congress that's supposed to increase competition and decrease prices, but leads to cable rates that keep on rising and rising. And they do think it's a crime that corporations and unions are able to give unlimited soft money contributions to the political parties to advance their narrow special interests. 
They think it's a crime. And you know what, it should be a crime. But here in Washington it is business as usual--until we manage to pass meaningful campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, it was very disappointing to me that 48 of our colleagues voted against the McCain-Feingold bill a few weeks ago, killing reform for this year. It was especially disappointing that we were unable to break through the filibuster here, after the enormous accomplishment of our colleagues in the other body who passed reform by a lopsided 252-179 margin. 
It was especially disappointing that all the votes to kill our bill in the Senate came from one party. Facing the determined opposition of the leadership, reformers in the House succeeded not only in bringing campaign finance reform to the floor but in passing it with a strong bipartisan majority. When we failed to invoke cloture on the McCain-Feingold bill last month, we missed a golden opportunity to together do something positive for the American people on a bipartisan basis. 
I emphasized the strong bipartisan vote in the House, Mr. President, because this effort has been a bipartisan effort all along. The senior Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and the Senior Senator from Tennessee and Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Thompson, have been in the forefront of this effort from the beginning. Five other distinguished Republican Senators voted for the McCain-Feingold bill. In the House, fully 1/4 of the Republican Members voted for the bill. Senator McCain and I recognized a long time ago that a partisan campaign finance bill will never become law. A serious effort to actually do something about this problem, Mr. President, has to be bipartisan. 
It is significant, Mr. President, that many of the leaders in this body on campaign finance reform were part of the Governmental Affairs Committee's year long investigation of campaign finance abuses in the 1996 campaign. Not only the Chairman, Senator Thompson, but two other highly respected Republican members of the committee, Senator Collins and Senator Specter, supported the McCain-Feingold bill. And Democratic members such as the Senator Glenn, Senator Levin, and Senator Durbin, have also been very active and outspoken in pushing for reform. These Senators saw--up close and personal--how the excesses of the 1996 campaign stem from problems with the law, particularly the enormous loophole known as soft money. 
I want to thank all of them for their hard work on the investigation and on this legislation, and promise them that their work shall not have been in vain. It is unfortunate that the investigation did not lead to legislative correction in this Congress, but the factual record they amassed remains the most powerful and detailed argument for reform, and it will undoubtedly shape our efforts in the future. 
There are plenty of scandals in this scandal-obsessed town--but when it comes to campaign finance, the greatest scandal of all is not about laws that were broken. The greatest campaign finance scandal is about the outrageous practices and compromising contributions that are perfectly legal. Yes, those who broke the current campaign finance laws should be punished, but that will hardly begin to solve the problems in this corrupt campaign finance system. 
We've heard the horror stories again and again. The parties have special clubs for big givers and offer exclusive meetings and weekend retreats with officeholders to the donors. And it's totally legal. 
The tobacco companies have funneled nearly $17 million in soft money to the national political parties in the last decade, $4.4 million in 1997 alone when the whole issue of congressional action on the tobacco settlement was very much alive--and it's totally legal. 
In 1996, the gambling industry gave nearly $4 million in soft money to the two major political parties at the same time that Congress was creating a new national commission on gambling, but with limited subpoena powers--and it's totally legal. 
The National Republican Congressional Committee is engaged in a $37 million dollar effort called Operation Breakout, funded largely by soft money, to attack Democratic candidates with advertisements that aren't considered election ads and don't even have to be reported to the FEC because they don't use certain `magic words' like Vote For or Vote Against--and it's totally legal. 
And we're even starting to extort money from our own colleagues. It was recently reported that Republican leaders actually threatened to deprive their own Members of appropriations subcommittee chairmanships if they didn't cough up up to $100,000 for the Operation Breakout plan. And it's totally legal. 
There are some in this body, of course, despite what the Thompson investigation uncovered and what news stories show on almost a daily basis, who don't see or won't acknowledge the corrupting influence of these unlimited soft money contributions, which are now totally legal. In our most recent debate, the junior Senator from Utah gave us a history lesson intended to convince us that we should not fear enormous campaign contributions. He recounted the frequently told story of how Sen. Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968 was jump-started by some very large contributions by some very wealthy individuals. 
He also noted that Steve Forbes was apparently prepared to make similarly enormous contributions to support Jack Kemp in a run for the Presidency in 1996, but was prohibited from doing so by the federal election laws and so decided to run his own campaign, a decision from which we might infer that the money is more important than the candidate. And he recounted as well the story of Mr. Arthur Hyatt, a wealthy businessman who gave large soft money contributions to the Democratic Party in 1996, but decided after that election not to give soft money to the parties anymore, and instead to fund an advocacy group that is promoting public financing of elections. 
The point of these examples was supposed to be that wealthy donors are motivated by ideology and the desire to benefit the public as they see it rather than by the desire to gain access and influence with policy makers through their contributions. And I suppose that is sometimes the case. Of course, there is also the well known story of Roger Tamraz, who testified under oath to our Governmental Affairs Committee that he never even votes, and the only reason that he gave soft money to the DNC was to gain access to officials he thought could help him with his business. I mean no disrespect to the Senator from Utah and the civic-minded millionaires he cites, but Mr. Tamraz, I suspect, is more typical in his motives, if not his methods, of big contributors. 
I'm not cynical, Mr. President. There is a reason that I hold that suspicion. And the reason is that the vast majority of soft money contributions to our political parties are coming from corporate interests. And it simply cannot be argued that these interests are acting out of public spiritedness or ideological conviction. Corporations do not have an ideology, they have business interests. They have a bottom line to defend, and they have learned over the years that making contributions to the major political parties in this country is a very good investment in their bottom line. Campaign money buys access, and access pays off at the bottom line. 
Corporate interests are special interests. Special interests have self-interested motives. They are concerned with profits, not what is best for other citizens or consumers or the country as a whole. They like to cast their arguments in terms of the public interest, and they certainly will argue that if the Congress follows their advice on legislation the public will be better off, but in the end it is their own businesses that they care about, not the public good. Indeed, the boards of directors and management of corporations have a legal duty to act in the best interests of their shareholders, not the public at large. 
And I have no problem with that, and no illusions about it either. It's OK with me that the corporate special interests are looking out for number one in the public debate, but I object when their deep pockets give them deep influence that ordinary Americans don't have. 
Take the tobacco companies. They oppose increasing the taxes paid by consumers of their products, they promote putting caps on the damages that smokers and their families can be awarded in personal injury or wrongful death actions, but they oppose ending government subsidies for tobacco farmers. In each case, they say they are supporting the public interest, but in the end they are protecting their own bottom line. And they have invested heavily in this Congress, and in our political parties, millions upon millions of dollars to protect their bottom line. 
These are the folks who raised their right hands and swore that tobacco was not addictive. These are the companies that concealed crucial studies on the dangers of their product for years. These are the people who spent millions on a misleading advertising campaign to kill the most important public health initiative that the Congress considered this year because it threatened their economic health. I'm not willing to rely on them to look out for the public interest, particularly when the voices of opposing views can hardly be heard because they don't have a lot of money. 
Most soft money donors are using their contributions like Roger Tamraz and the tobacco companies do. That is borne out by a recent study by Common Cause of the major soft money donors so far in this election cycle. The political parties have already raised over $116 million in soft money in this cycle, the most ever in a non-presidential cycle and more than twice the amount given in a similar 18 month period in the 1993-94 cycle. 
As is always the case, corporations with business before the Congress, not disinterested, public-spirited millionaires, and certainly not ordinary citizens, are leading the way in soft money giving in this cycle. Securities and investment companies and their executives have given $8.5 million, the insurance industry has given $7.3 million, the telecommunications industry $6.1 million, the real estate industry $5.9 million, the pharmaceutical industry $4 million, and the tobacco industry $3.9 million. All of these amounts are at least double and in some cases triple the amount given in 1993-94. 
And one very interesting set of contributors shows that access, not ideology, is the main reason for soft money donations. Fifty-seven donors in the first 18 months of this cycle gave more than $75,000 to both parties. 15 companies, including Philip Morris, AT&T, Walt Disney Co., MCI, Bell South Corporation, Atlantic Richfield and Archer Daniels Midland gave more than $150,000 to both parties. 
Now I suppose there might be some in those companies, or even in this body, who will argue that all of these `double-givers' just really want to help the political process. That they are motivated not by their bottom line but by a deep desire to assist the parties in serving the public. But if that is the case, why is that in every Congress since I have been here the industries most seriously affected by our work pony up to give huge contributions to us and to the political parties? 
In 1993-94 it was the health care debate. Hospitals, insurance companies, drug companies, and doctors all opened their wallets in an unprecedented way. Then in 1995 and 1996, the Telecommunications Act was under consideration and lo and behold the local and long distance companies and the cable companies stepped up their giving. Now in this Congress, we've been working on bankruptcy reform and financial services modernization, and the biggest givers of all in this cycle according to Common Cause's research report are securities and investment companies, insurance companies, and banks and lenders, eager to have their business interests protected or expanded. What's going on here? I submit that it's not a spontaneous burst of civic virtue. And if we don't finish work on these bills this year, you can bet that the money will be there for us in the Congress as well--it has been suggested that sometimes the very members of Congress who most want a big bill to pass will slow its progress to keep the checks coming in and the money flowing that much longer. 
Mr. President, not surprisingly, there's also a powerful new player in the soft money game in this Congress--the computer and electronics industry. According to Common Cause, these companies have given the parties nearly $2.7 million so far, more than twice as much as they gave four years ago. And why is that, Mr. President? Could it have anything to do with the ongoing antitrust investigations and the possibility of congressional action in connection with those investigations? Or is it that the industry suddenly became more public spirited than it was in the past? 
Mr. President, the American people are not gullible or naive. They know that these companies contribute these enormous sums to the parties because their bottom line is affected by what the Congress does and they want to make sure the Congress will listen to them when they want to make their case. And they know that the big contributors get results. 
And frankly, Mr. President, it's a two way street. The parties are hitting up these donors because they know that most companies, unlike Monsanto and General Motors who announced early in 1997 that they would no longer make soft money donations--most companies don't have the courage to say no. Most companies are worried that if they don't ante up, their lobbyists won't get in the door. Our current campaign finance laws encourage old fashioned shakedowns, as long as they are done discreetly. 
Faced with this kind of evidence, it is beyond me how any Senator could support this soft money system. We simply must pass comprehensive reform, including a ban on soft money at the beginning of the next Congress, and we must make that ban effective immediately to prevent the presidential election in the Year 2000 from being contaminated with this corrosive and corruptive force. The consequences of failing to make these reforms will be devastating to the confidence of average citizens in the fairness and impartiality of the legislative process and the actions of a future Chief Executive. 
Let me be clear Mr. President, I'm not suggesting that any individual Member of Congress is corrupt. I don't know that any Member of this body has ever traded a vote for a contribution. But while Members are not corrupt, the system is riddled with corruption. It is only human to help those who have helped you get elected or reelected, to agree to the meeting, to take the phone call, to allow the opportunity to be persuaded by those who have given money. It is true of the parties, and it is true of the Members, even those who seek always to cast their votes on the merits. The result is that people who don't have money don't get heard. 
So we don't need to point fingers at one another, we just have to rise above politics and do the right thing by the American people. We must clean up our own house, Mr. President. We cannot continue to ignore the corruption in our midst, the cancer that is eating the heart out of the great American compact of trust and faith between the people and their elected representatives. 
We know that unlimited soft money contributions make a mockery of our election laws and threatens the fairness of the legislative process. We know that phony issue ads paid for with unlimited corporate and union funds undermine the ability of citizens to understand who is bankrolling the candidates and why. We can find bipartisan solutions to these problems that protect legitimate First Amendment rights if we are willing to put partisan political advantage aside and sit down and work it out. 
Senator McCain and I are ready--we have been ready ever since we introduced our bill--to make changes to our bill that will bring new supporters on board and get us past the 60 vote threshold that the Senate rules have placed in our way, so long as we stay true to the goal of a cleaner, fairer, system in which money will no longer dominate. 
I look forward to continuing this work next year Mr. President. And I am confident that we will succeed. Again, I want to thank Senator McCain and all the Republicans who joined our bill this year. And of course, Senator Daschle and all the Democratic Senators who have so steadfastly supported bipartisan reform in this Congress. 
Mr. President, most important legislative accomplishments take more than one Congress to enact. Rome was not built in a day, and campaign finance reform obviously could not be enacted in a year. But I believe that early in the next Congress there will be a real chance to deal with the campaign finance issue in a bipartisan fashion to make the election in the Year 2000 cleaner and fairer than the one we just had or the one we are about to have. The American people deserve that as we enter a new century, and here is a promise: I will never, ever, give up this fight until we give it to them.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in these last few days of the 105th Congress, when I come to the floor, I often look wistfully to the aisle just to my left here, where Dale Bumpers has trod up and down yanking the microphone cord and dispensing wisdom for just about twenty-four years now. The other day he gave his last speech here, and it was brilliant--an eloquent and moving reminder of the best purposes of politics. But now I want to look back and pay tribute to my friend Dale Bumpers for what he has done and what he has been for me, for the Senate, for his beloved Arkansas and for our country. 
Dale Bumpers was born in Charleston, Arkansas in 1925, and it's from that little town he first drew the values he has eloquently proclaimed on this floor for two and a half decades. In a small town in western Arkansas during the Depression, young Dale Bumpers learned about human suffering and deprivation, learned to believe that it could be defeated and came to understand, on his father's knee, that the government could be a force for good in that struggle. He saw typhoid in his hometown and saw a New Deal program put an end to it. He saw rural electrification light the countryside, projects that made the water cleaner, the roads safer, he saw the WPA and he saw the tenacity, and the ingenuity and the sense of community of the American people. One day as a boy he went to the nearby town of Booneville and saw Franklin Roosevelt himself, and he heard his father tell him that politics is an honorable profession--he took all that to heart and we are all the richer for it. He sometimes says, as his father did, `When we die, we're going to Franklin Roosevelt.' 
In 1943, Dale Bumpers joined the Marines. He shipped out to the Pacific and he expected to be a part of the invasion force that would hit the beaches of Japan. He did not expect to survive it. The invasion never came, but that experience made a profound impression on him. When I hear him speak about the Constitution, our Founding Fathers and the flag on this floor it is plain how that wartime experience helped him comprehend the true stakes of the constitutional debate, how it informed his notions of patriotism and his sense of what America means. When he returned from the service he got a first-rate education at the University of Arkansas and Northwestern University Law School, all paid for, he is quick to point out, by Uncle Sam under the GI bill. He has been returning the favor to the American people ever since. 
Dale Bumpers started his career as a country lawyer in Charleston, a very successful one by all reports, and he got a reputation around Arkansas, even if he was, as he says, `the entire membership of the South Franklin County Bar Association.' As time went by, his practice grew, he took over his father's hardware store, he taught Sunday School and sang in the church choir and he and his wonderful wife Betty started a family. But he wasn't feeling complacent. 
There are a lot of great Dale Bumpers stories many people don't know. In the days following the Brown v. Board of Education decision, tension was building in the South as school integration looked more and more inevitable. By 1957, we had the Little Rock Crisis, but there was one town in Arkansas that had already integrated by then, without any great trouble. It was the first in Arkansas, maybe the first in the entire south. It was Charleston, Arkansas, where Dale Bumpers was a young lawyer, representing the school board. He saw what was coming and he knew what was right. He did a little research and he found out how much the district was spending to bus its black students to Fort Smith. He made his case to the school board about the right course, working those numbers into the argument. The board then voted to do what he had advised them to do--integrate the schools. It was not long after that he helped to integrate his church--the pastor of the local black Methodist church approached the all white congregation of his Methodist church, seeking help to repair a leaky roof. Why spend all that money and have two churches, why not just join our two churches together, said Dale Bumpers, and it was done. Those are two quiet little pieces of history that tell us plenty about the principles and the persuasive powers of Dale Bumpers. 
Well, after a while, school board politics were getting to him, so Dale decided he would like to be the Governor of Arkansas. So off he went, eighth out of eight in the early primary polls, to do battle with Orval Faubus and other established politicians. His critics said he had `nothing but a smile and a shoeshine.' But then the people of Arkansas heard what he had to say. He beat everybody but Faubus in the primary, beat Faubus in the runoff and then he beat Winthrop Rockefeller. Arkansas had never seen a governor like Dale Bumpers. He reformed everything from education to heath care and gained the lasting affection of the people while doing it. 
After four years as Governor, he decided he wanted to go to the Senate. All that stood in his way was J. William Fulbright, an institution in his own right. But Bumpers won, and he came to the Senate. As we have seen, this chamber is the place where he always belonged. 
When I came to the Senate, I had heard of Senator Bumpers' intelligence, his quick wit, his impatience with wasteful spending, his vigorous defense of the environment and his role as a relentless guardian of our Constitution. When it comes to amending the Constitution. Dale Bumpers always says, `I'm a founding member of the `Wait Just a Minute' club.' That is a great line, but it tells of a Senator who has risked defeat, has felt real contempt from those who disagree, all because he would not stand for the political use of the Constitution. He gave a great speech once called `The Trivialization of the Constitution' in which he made the case that we must never casually fiddle with our Constitution for political gain or to deal with transitory policy issues. His work to defend the Constitution and inject sobriety into the constitutional debate, all by itself, qualifies him as a great patriot and senator. Let the record reflect that I too am a member of the `Wait Just a Minute' club. 
Dale Bumpers' leadership in cutting wasteful spending and his fiscal foresight are unsurpassed. In 1981, when Ronald Reagan was calling the shots in the budget debate, Dale Bumpers was one of only three Senators to oppose Reagan's tax cuts and support the spending cuts. If their position had prevailed, the budget would have been balanced in 1984. That was fourteen years ago. Now there's a fiscal role model. 
Senator Bumpers went after what we now call `corporate welfare' years before the term was coined, and years before others were willing to focus on the problem of government waste. From the international space station to the 1872 Mining Law, Senator Bumpers has been resolute in his pursuit of excesses in the federal budget. He has gone after sacred cows and hidden pork, and faced strong opposition from both sides of the aisle. But he has continued his work, tirelessly and often thanklessly, because he knows he is doing what is right for the American people. I have often felt great pride standing with Dale Bumpers on an amendment, even when we knew we would lose, because when he made a stand, his allies knew they were doing the right thing. 
His campaign against government waste is matched only by his efforts to protect the environment as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Senator Bumpers has been an outstanding leader on the committee, and has exhibited a conservation ethic unparalleled in the U.S. Senate. Dale Bumpers was the first Senator to sound the alarm about the ozone layer and the danger of ozone-depleting gases, long before most of us had ever heard of them. And he always remembered his father's hardware store--there never was a more relentless defender of small business in the Senate. 
I have been honored to work with him on a number of conservation efforts, including public land reform and nuclear energy issues, and I know the Senate will miss his leadership in that area. His work to reform the 1872 mining law is the issue where his environmental stewardship and his determination to cut wasteful spending have gone hand-in-hand. I have been proud to join him in this fight, because it's a crucially important one, an `outrage,' as he calls it, that wouldn't be under scrutiny today if it weren't for the work of Senator Bumpers. And I am confident, Senator Bumpers, that your view will prevail on the mining law soon enough, because you are right and everybody knows you're right. 
Everybody thinks of Dale Bumpers first and foremost as an orator, a story teller, a raconteur and a dispenser of folk wisdom. He is common sense with a silver tongue and a sense of history. So let me finish my remarks with a tribute to his oratorical style. Dale Bumpers often decried the idea that we could eliminate the deficit by cutting taxes and raising spending, he said `That reminds me of the combination taxidermist/veterinarian in my hometown. His slogan was `Either way you get your dog back.' When he saw a flaw in his opponent's argument he jumped on it like a duck on a junebug. He might declare. `His argument is as thin as spit on a rock!' Why is he such a masterful debater? Because he can explain the complex in a simple way, and expose the truth in uncomplicated language, without demagoguery or distortion. As he would say, `You gotta throw the corn where the hogs can get at it.' He hated deficit spending, and when he saw a budget full of red ink, he said, `Well, you pass that and you'll create deficits big enough to choke a mule. That's just eating the seed corn!' 
Being in this body, and having the honor of serving with Dale Bumpers, has given me an invaluable chance to get to know a remarkable man, and to understand what his legacy in this body will mean for generations to come. The greatest thing he has taught me is not to fear the tough votes. Time and again, from the Panama Canal to the flag amendment, he has cast the hard votes. Time and again, he has gone home to Arkansas and made his case, explaining his votes to the people. He didn't always persuade them all, but he convinced them that his were votes of principle--and the poeple's confidence in his integrity has sustained him in the affection of even those Arkansans who disagreed. 
Dale Bumpers has plenty to be proud of, but he has always remembered who he is and where he came from. He mixed it up with the best of them during debate, but never with rancor. He is quick to point out the work of other Senators and his staff when things are accomplished. The other day he stood on this floor and thanked his grade school teacher, Miss Doll, for encouraging him more than sixty years ago! He never fails to credit all his success to his remarkable wife Betty, who has achieved so much in promoting peace and the health of children. He speaks always of his family as the wellspring of his values and the source of his priorities. 
So now he leaves the Senate having enriched this country and this institution in a thousand ways. His wisdom and courage and his persistent voice will echo long into the future. To every member of the Senate, on both sides of the aisle, Dale Bumpers is an admired friend and colleague. To those of us who share his principles and have learned from his leadership, he is nothing less than a hero. He is one of the great ones--and you don't need to be all broke out in brilliance to know that. Thank you Dale Bumpers and good luck! I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to honor Senator Wendell Ford for his long and distinguished record of service in the United States Senate. 
A vigorous defender of his home state, Wendell Ford's raspy voice has spoken out for the people of Kentucky and the entire nation with intelligence, tenacity and humor, winning him the respect and affection of his colleagues. 
Of Senator Ford's many accomplishments during his years of public service, his positions in the Senate's Democratic leadership and as Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee stand out as invaluable contributions to his party and his country. I have greatly appreciated, as have all my Democratic colleagues, the outstanding job Senator Ford has done as the Democratic whip, and the dedication he has shown to the caucus. Here on the floor, Wendell Ford has exhibited an uncommon commitment to fairness. 
Kentuckians can also be proud of Senator Ford's sponsorship of the Motor Voter bill and longstanding support of government reforms, which are a testament to his commitment to the democratic principle of government. 
I want to wish Senator Ford all the best for his well-earned retirement, and thank him for his many contributions to American political life.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to wish all the best to Senator Kempthorne as he leaves the Senate. Senator Kempthorne and I both joined the Senate in 1992, and both, as very junior senators, initially found ourselves with offices in the basement of the Dirksen building. 
Senator Kempthorne has always demonstrated a strong grasp of policy issues, including his work on unfunded mandates, and has always conducted himself with the highest degree of professionalism in the Senate. I thank him for his service, and wish him well in his new endeavors. 
Now he returns to Idaho to seek the office of governor. Whatever happens in that race, the people of Idaho will know that he is a thoughtful man of grace and civility.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator John Glenn for his long and distinguished service in the United States Senate. He has served this body with great dignity, and with an unparalleled commitment to our country. 
Of course, Senator Glenn is known for a great deal more than his Senate service, as the first man to orbit the earth and a hero in both World War II and the Korean War. But his contributions here in the Senate, all by themselves, have made for Senator Glenn the legacy of an American hero. 
I worked with Senator Glenn in 1993 on an amendment to the Clean Water Act, which was just one of his many efforts to focus environmental protection efforts on the Great Lakes region. The Great Lakes states owe a great debt to Senator Glenn for his work in this area, which has included chairing the Senate's Great Lakes Task Force and helping to get Great Lakes regional offices for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Fish and Wildlife Service. 
As the Chair and Ranking Member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Glenn has been fairminded and provided outstanding leadership on the committee, in particular during the recent hearings into campaign finance violations. During those hearings, Senator Glenn showed his keen understanding of the flaws in the current system and his commitment to its reform. As someone who cares deeply about campaign finance issues, I was grateful for his leadership. 
Senator Glenn has also worked tirelessly on nuclear proliferation issues, and been a valued member of the Armed Services Committee, the Select Committee on Intelligence, and the Special Committee on Aging. 
Now Senator Glenn is moving on to his newest challenge, and, as usual, making history. At the age of 77, he will again launch into space, this time for a nine-day ride on the Shuttle Discovery. Most of us would be content being the first man to orbit the earth, flying 149 combat missions, and breaking a transcontinental flight speed record in a Navy jet. But then John Glenn has more determination, more talent and more courage than most of us can imagine. He must know that he is not just respected and famous, he must know that he holds a special place in the hearts of his fellow Americans and in American culture, yet there is no humbler man in the Senate. We admire him for that, we thank him for his dedicated service to the U.S. Senate, to the people of Ohio and to America. We wish him every success on his next mission, and wish him all the best in his retirement.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to offer my best wishes to Senator Coats as he retires from the Senate this year. I have enjoyed working with him in areas where we agree, and I have always respected his viewpoint when we have differed. He is a gentleman in the best tradition of the Senate. 
I have appreciated Senator Coats leadership in several areas, including his commitment to the line-item veto, which I agree can be a powerful tool against wasteful spending. Senator Coats has also taken on the issue of solid waste disposal, calling for more state discretion over what types of waste are disposed of within individual states. In Wisconsin, where we have a strong recycling program and create less solid waste than many states, we share Senator Coats' belief that states deserve to be heard on this issue, and not be forced to accept unwelcome garbage. 
Senator Coats has also been a leader among the `donor states' in ISTEA funding for a more equitable distribution of highway funds, another issue of great importance to Wisconsin, where we again appreciate his commitment to fairness. 
Senator Coats now voluntarily walks away from the Senate, still a young man, with humility and dignity, sure to find success in private life. As he leaves the Senate, I thank him for his years of service in this body and in the House of Representatives, and I wish him all the best in his new endeavors.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last night, the Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act of 1998. I wanted to voice my support for this bill. In particular, I appreciate the section that reauthorizes the Army Corps' Upper Mississippi River Environmental Management Program, known as EMP. I wish to commend the hard work of the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Chafee) and the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) and their staff members, Dan Delich and Jo Ellen Darcy, in order to complete a WRDA bill prior to the adjournment of the 105th Congress. I appreciate the time and attention they have paid to ensuring that EMP is reauthorized in this bill. 
I also want to extend my sincere thanks to the Senior Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond), who shepherded the EMP provisions through the Committee. I have enjoyed working with him on the reauthorization of this important program. He and his staff have worked along with me and my staff to make sure this section was well crafted and met the needs of the Upper Mississippi states and the Mississippi River environment. The manager's amendment makes the necessary changes to the Committee language to meet the needs of all interested parties. 
From its inception, the EMP has been a program that enjoys bipartisan support. Initially conceived and sponsored in the House by my former colleague from Wisconsin (Mr. Gunderson) and the Congressman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), the EMP was originally authorized in the Water Resources Act of 1986. At the same time, Congress designated the Upper Mississippi River `a nationally significant ecosystem and a nationally significant commercial navigation system.' 
Since its inception, the EMP has been a cooperative effort between the Corps, the Upper Mississippi states, conservationists, and commercial shipping and other economic interests. The program's purpose is to regain and protect significant areas of diverse, productive fish and wildlife habitat, to establish long-term resource monitoring which gauges dynamic changes and impacts of future developments, and to improve and assess recreational uses so vital in our nation's midsection. The EMP involves extensive federal-state planning, coordination, and cost-sharing. 
I am pleased that this legislation will prevent termination of this program in 2001, as provided in the earlier authorizing legislation. This bill will ensure that necessary funding, and approved habitat rehabilitation and enhancement projects will continue. I also recognize, with a total ten year authorization of $350 million, that it is among the largest program authorizations contained in the bill. 
I am very pleased that the collegial spirit surrounding work on EMP is also well-rooted on the House side. My colleague in the Wisconsin delegation (Representative Kind) is working with Representative Oberstar in steadfastly pursuing this reauthorization this year. 
The manager's amendment reauthorizes EMP through 2009 at an increased total funding level of $33.5 million per year. It also makes some important changes to the program. It creates an independent technical advisory committee to review habitat projects and monitoring plans. It authorizes the Corps to complete a habitat and natural resource needs assessment of the Upper Mississippi Basin within three years of WRDA enactment. And, it provides Congress with another comprehensive assessment of the program, its projects and effectiveness, by 2005. 
I believe these to be positive changes to the program. I look forward to the Conference on this matter, and I urge my colleagues in the other body to act quickly on this legislation.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I offer my comments on the Nickles substitute amendment to H.R. 2431, the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. 
Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] for all the hard work that he and others have devoted to this important piece of legislation. These Senators, and our House colleagues, have recognized the importance of promoting religious freedom abroad, and have tried to craft legislation that both emphasizes our serious concerns about this issue, and provides authority to the President to react to governments which abuse these fundamental rights. 
In particular, I appreciate their efforts to make improvements to the original bill, most of which I support. 
Mr. President, the issue of religious freedom is especially important for our country. Freedom of religion is one of the bedrock principles of American democracy. Our founders, who came to America in part to flee religious intolerance, championed freedom of religion as a universal right, and made it an integral part of the Constitution through the Bill of Rights. 
Throughout our history, immigrants from every corner of the globe have arrived on our shores seeking a community where they could practice their religion openly and without fear of persecution. Today, we value the separation of church and state as one of our guiding principles. 
But we are all well aware that such liberties are not fully enjoyed everywhere, and there are millions of people who daily face persecution or intolerance because of their religious beliefs. Worse yet, the exploitation of religious and ethnic differences for political ends has become all too common in the post-Cold War era. 
These trends have been around for centuries, but have been getting more serious press attention in the last several years. They mirror the myriad other abuses that are conducted, or at least tolerated, by non-democratic regimes around the world. Examples of restrictions on basic freedoms--of expression, of association, of the press--abound, and those who dare violate such restrictions face imprisonment, repression or even death. As we consider this legislation today, it is likely that somewhere, a political prisoner is being beaten by the police or armed forces, or by some paramilitary group whose members might include police officers or soldiers. It is likely that somewhere a union organizer is being detained or harassed by authorities, that a woman is being raped by government thugs, that a newspaper is being shut down, or that a prisoner has `disappeared.' 
The question for us today is this: what is the appropriate U.S. policy response to such acts of oppression by other nations on the basis of religious beliefs? We should also ask: what is the appropriate response to oppression of any kind? 
I firmly believe that the defense of human rights around the world relates directly to our `national interests' and therefore justifies leadership from the United States, a nation founded on respect for individual rights and liberties. 
We are bound by our country's founding principles to promote and defend certain ideas: that we are all created equal, that we are born with certain inalienable rights, that government is legitimate only with the consent of the people, and that government should exist to promote the general welfare and to secure the blessings of liberty for all. Our other national interests--security and economic opportunity--have the best chance for advancement in a climate of freedom and respect for individual rights, and are undermined where that climate does not thrive. 
I have never shied away from the use of every economic, diplomatic, or rhetorical tool to advance our human rights agenda. It is through the vigorous use of these tools that the United States can exercise the type of leadership such fundamental violations of justice demand. To a certain extent, this is the approach implicit in the bill we are considering today, which provides a menu of presidential actions to respond to violations of religious freedom. 
But, with deference to my colleague from Oklahoma and the work he has done on this bill and although I support the bill, I have some outstanding concerns regarding this legislation. I believe that if we had been able to fully consider this bill in the Committee on Foreign Relations, we would have been able to work out some of these issues. 
I strongly support the basic premise of the bill, that the United States should defend religious liberty, but I am concerned that it might appear to subordinate other fundamental rights to the right to religious freedom. As we defend the freedom of religion, should we not just as vigorously defend the rule of law, basic human rights and the exercise of political rights? We would be pleased if, tomorrow, Sudan's ruling National Islamic Front suddenly lifted its Shar'ia law and allowed Christians to worship freely. But would we then tolerate the forced conscription of children, the lack of press freedom and the manipulation of humanitarian assistance that also takes place in the Sudan? 
I also have some concerns about a few specific provisions. 
First, this bill creates a new commission, the `Commission on International Religious Freedom.' Although I am open to arguments on this subject, I am not convinced a new commission is needed. We already have in operation the Advisory Committee on Religious Freedom. This body, which is broadly representative of various religious communities, has been in operation since early 1997 and has already produced several useful reports about the state of religious freedom around the world. Its work has helped focus administration attention on the issue of religious persecution and the conditions of religious minorities. 
Second, Section 205 of the bill authorizes $6 million over two years to carry out the work of this new Commission. The protection of religious freedom is vital work that must be done, but I believe this is an enormous amount of money to be devoting to a commission of any sort, and I have seen no explanation of why $6 million is required. The Advisory Committee was able to conduct its work with existing resources from the Department of State. I understand that the Committee's work greatly strained the resources of the Department's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, but I also understand that, even if staff salaries are included, the Committee could have been run with a budget of less than $500,000. Also, the new Commission proposed by the legislation would be comprised of nine commissioners, rather than the 20 on the existing Advisory Committee, so it might be expected to require less resources. 
In addition, I am concerned that because of the narrow language of Section 205, the authorized funds might be used only for the specific activities of the Commission, and not for the many additional requirements of the bill which would then have to borne by the already stretched resources of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. 
Mr. President, I hope there will be further clarification of the intended uses of these funds, and--if the Congress does appropriate such high levels of funding--I hope it will be used to further the goals of the whole bill, and not simply Title II. 
Third, another provision that raises some concerns is Section 107, which provides equal access to the premises of diplomatic missions to any U.S. citizen seeking to conduct religious activities. It is in the best American tradition to provide a haven for Americans of faith who find themselves in a country that is not hospitable to their religion, but I wonder if some might argue that this provision would expand what the Supreme Court has determined constitutes a `public forum' with respect to equal access for religion. In practice, it is possible that it might then be deemed by some court to be an unconstitutional endorsement of a particular religion. That is not what we intend, so I hope the provision allows for discretion on the part of the chiefs of mission to appropriately respond to requests from the American community. 
My fourth concern relates to the provisions in Section 108--not what is in those provisions, but rather, what has been left out. Section 108 requires the Secretary of State to prepare and maintain issue briefs on religious freedom on a country-by-country basis. These will be similar to the annual country reports on human rights, which have proven to be an excellent source of information on conditions in individual countries. However, the briefs are also required to include lists of `persons believed to be imprisoned, detained, or placed under house arrest for their religious faith.' In cases where the production and publicizing of prisoner lists is useful, perhaps we should devote similar attention to individuals detained in the pursuit of other internationally recognized human rights. The Secretary should consider exercising her authority to broaden the list to include all prisoners of conscience, as appropriate. In addition, there may be cases where the production or publication of such a list might actually be harmful to the individuals in question, or indeed to our intelligence resources. I believe on this point the administration is given considerable discretion. 
Fifth, in an earlier draft of this legislation, included in the description of what might constitute a violation of religious freedom was `arbitrary prohibitions or restrictions on the grounds of religion on holding public office, or pursuing educational or professional opportunities.' For unknown reasons, this language unfortunately was deleted from all subsequent drafts of this bill, including the current version. However, the bill's definitional language is merely suggestive, indicating areas the administration can take into consideration when making a determination about a given country. I will assume that the administration will also consider restrictive prohibitions on education and employment, among other factors, when making such determinations. Any kind of religious discrimination is unacceptable. 
Finally, Section 103 provides for the establishment of a religious freedom Internet web site which would contain major international documents relating to religious freedom, among other items. This is a fantastic way to disseminate information about this issue to individuals around the world who can use it to help promote their causes in their own countries. Already we have seen the importance of the Internet in promoting civil society. The Internet is the modern version of the underground literature of the Cold War, only it does not require printing presses which can be taken away, and it is more readily available to its audience. I hope, however, that the Secretary of State will take the opportunity to also include in the web site other important documents related more generally to human rights. In that way, we can be sure to pursue the protection of all human rights through the most modern technology possible. 
Also, Mr. President, just to make the record clear, I do not support the provisions of Section 406 which allow an exception to the sanctions in this bill for defense contractors. 
Again, I commend the sponsors of this legislation and everyone who has worked so hard to produce a consensus package.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am submitting an amendment to S. 1966, Gaylord Nelson Apostle Islands Stewardship Act of 1988, a bill that I introduced on April 22, 1988. In keeping with my belief that progress toward a balanced budget should be maintained, I am proposing that a section be added to the bill which offsets the $4.1 million in authorized spending for the Apostle Islands contained in my original bill, with the $20 million in funds appropriated in FY 99 to the Denali Commission. The Secretary of the Interior would be required to transfer $15.9 million above the money that it needs to take actions at the Apostle Islands back to the Treasury. 
Mr. President, the Denali Commission is not currently authorized. Authorization for this new commission was included in the Senate version of the FY 99 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, but was removed in conference. Nevertheless, the appropriators decided to set aside $20 million in funds pending the authorization of the Commission. Whatever the merits of this proposed commission may be, Mr. President, I am concerned that we have set aside such a large amount of money when we have acute appropriations needs at places like the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, for an unauthorized program. 
I am further concerned, Mr. President, about creating a new Federal commission to address economic development and other State specific issues when Congress is seeking to back away from such commitments. For example, in the same bill that provides funds for the Denali Commission, the Congress terminates appropriated funds for the Tennessee Valley Authority, known as TVA, an action I have had legislation to accomplish since I became a Member of the Senate. I applaud congress for acting to end appropriated funds for TVA, but I fear we may take a step backward if we create a new entity that we now need to fund. 
I look forward to Senate Energy Committee consideration of the Gaylord Nelson Apostle Islands Stewardship Act of 1988, and its eventual passage.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I intend to vote against the Conference Report on Fiscal Year 1999 Agriculture Appropriations bill for a number of reasons. In the final version, the congressional majority has added a $3.6 billion unfunded emergency spending provision, while simultaneously stripping out consumer and farmer protections. 
However, today I will focus on the worst provision in the conference report. I am extremely disappointed that the final version contains language from the House bill extending USDA's rulemaking period on Federal Milk Marketing Order Reform. Once again, on the issue of milk orders, bad politics prevailed over good policy. 
This extension will require the new milk pricing system to be in place in October of 1999, instead of the original date of April, 1999 set in the Farm Bill. Mr. President, officials at USDA have assured me that they did not request this extension nor do they need it. 
House Appropriators argued that the extension was necessary to give Congress ample time to review, comment and act on the final rule. They claim that if the rule were to be announced in late November, they would not have time to act on it. Mr. President, let's examine this argument because it does not hold water. My House and Senate colleagues who support this provision on these grounds surely remember passage of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996. This law empowers Congress and the courts to overturn regulations with Presidential approval. This law gives Congress 60 days to act, once a rule has been published in the Federal Register. So, whether the rule is published in late November, early December, or mid-February of 1999, Congress has 60 days of session to act. So this really tells us what is going on here. 
Mr. President, this dairy provision was included solely to intimidate and bully USDA and Secretary Glickman into an anti-Wisconsin dairy pricing reform. Instead of allowing USDA to do its job, some Members of Congress want to do it for them, and do it to benefit their own producers at the expense of dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest. 
Let's just take a look at the current system which is shown on this chart, which some have called the Eau Claire system. I like to call it the anti-Eau Claire system because it is an unfair system for Eau Claire, WI, and our entire state--in fact, the entire upper Midwest. 
This chart shows that the Class I differential received by dairy farmers in Eau Claire, Wisconsin is $1.20 per hundredweight. Believe it or not, Mr. President, Federal pricing policy dictates that the farther you travel from Eau Claire, WI, the higher your Class I differential. You will notice that the price in Chicago is $1.40, in Kansas City, Missouri it's $1.92 and in Charlotte, NC it's $3.08 per hundredweight. Our friends in Florida make $3.58 in Tallahassee, $3.88 in Tampa, and $4.18 in Miami. Dairy farmers in Miami make nearly $3.00 more per hundredweight than farmers in the Upper Midwest. Does that make any sense? Absolutely not. 
Let me illustrate this with another chart. 
To illustrate just how senseless this whole system is, I have borrowed this graphic from my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Rod Grams. As you can see, pricing milk based on its distance from Eau Claire, WI, is as arbitrary and ridiculous as pricing oranges from their distance from Florida, computers from their distance from Seattle, or--even more shocking to some of us--country music from its distance from Nashville. But wait, now that I think about it, maybe Congress should pass legislation to price maple syrup based on its distance from Burlington, VT, and white wine on its distance from California. While we are at it, lets pass a law to pay Members of Congress according to the distance of their hometown from Washington, DC. Sound ridiculous? It is, just as the current milk pricing system is ridiculous. It would almost be funny if it weren't so destructively unfair to Wisconsin's dairy farmers, undermining the livelihoods of their families. 
Mr. President, the current system desperately needs reform, a reform the Secretary of Agriculture has indicated he is willing to make--but that some members of Congress are very anxious to prevent. This poster is an illustration of today's Federal milk pricing system--how milk is produced and priced in America. You can see that the price of milk begins not with the cow, but with the Congress. Its interesting to note that the market and the farmer don't enter into the equation until two-thirds down the page. I could walk you through all the confusing steps shown here, but I understand we are scheduled to recess sometime in October, and frankly, I would need until mid-November to describe fully the inequity of this system. 
This system has outlived its usefulness, its patently unfair and its bad policy. 
The extension of USDA's rulemaking had another intent as well. Extending the rulemaking period automatically extends the life of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The 1996 Farm Bill requires a sunset of the Compact when the new federal pricing system is implemented. At the rate Congress is going, tacking this issue onto appropriations bills, there is no telling when implementation will now occur. 
The effects of the Compact on consumers within the region and producers outside of it is indisputable. Dairy compacts are harmful, unnecessary and a burden to this country's taxpayers. 
The worst part of this entire 65 year dairy fiasco is its effect on the producers in the Upper Midwest. The 6 month extension puts an additional 900 Wisconsin producers at risk. Wisconsin loses approximately 3 dairy farmers a day. Producers cannot stand 6 more days of the current program, let along 6 more months. 
I am truly troubled by this turn of events and would like to read into the record a few excerpts from letters I have received from struggling dairy farmers in my home state of Wisconsin. 
From Pulaski, Wisconsin a constituent writes:  
I would love to encourage my son or daughter to take over this farm someday. But without a fair pricing system, they cannot earn a decent living, and I cannot and will not encourage them to farm. That will be a great loss to the world of agriculture. 
A letter from Bloomer, WI reads: 
We, in the Upper Midwest are not asking for a handout, just a more level playing field. Fair competition and price reform is our only hope. 
Another constituent writes: 
In my opinion, just because a pricing system has been in implementation for years, doesn't make it useful today. It must also change with the times. How many more farms are we willing to let fall victim to the prejudiced pricing? . . . Its much easier to put a pillow over our heads, roll over and ignore the cry for help from the Wisconsin dairy farmers . . . I realize changing the present milk pricing system will not heal the strained economics of dairy farming. It's only a step . . . I urge you to take this step and . . . hear the cry of dairy farmers like me. 
And finally, a dairy producer makes this comment: 
Eau Claire was chosen as the reference point because it was judged by the government to be the center of the dairy industry's most productive region. Since California now produces more milk than Wisconsin, this [rule] should no longer apply. Maybe we should change the [milk pricing] reference point to Fresno, California, to encourage dairy production in the Midwest. 
These examples illustrate the need for dairy pricing reform and illustrate the state of Wisconsin's dairy industry- struggling needlessly under the burden of current dairy policy. 
Mr. President, not only is legislating dairy policy on this bill inappropriate, its bad precedent, it circumvents the appropriate committees, the Agriculture and Judiciary Committees, and circumvents USDA's authority. We ought to give USDA the opportunity to do the right thing for today's national dairy industry and put an end to the unfair Eau Claire system now, not 6 months from now. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take a second look at this antiquated and harmful policy. Stand up for equity, fairness, and for what is best for America's dairy industry, our consumers and our taxpayers. I yield back the floor. 
Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to register my opposition to the fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense Authorization conference report. Sadly, we continue to spend precious military resources on unneeded, unwanted, pork-barrel projects, all at the expense of our military's legitimate needs. 
Mr. President, our military needs to be lean and mean, not weighed down with unnecessary, unwanted, expensive pork. We don't need to spend more money, we need to spend money more wisely. Our military leaders have begun to recognize this and some of my colleagues in Congress have recognized it. I hope we can work together toward a more wisely funded military. 
I am not alone in my call for more efficient and accountable military spending. Lawrence J. Korb, President Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Defense, recently issued a rebuke of the state of the Pentagon's military spending. He said, 
The problem is not lack of money or aging equipment . . . the Pentagon is buying the wrong weapons. The military behaves as if it is still in an arms race with the Soviet Union, buying $2 billion bombers, $3 billion submarines and $5 billion aircraft carriers . . . Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea--throw in Libya or whoever else you want--all of them together don't spend as much on the military as we do. 
Mr. President, I couldn't agree more. There is no Cold War. It's over. We need to move toward a 21st century military force. This conference report fails to adequately modernize our armed forces and move toward that goal. 
As my friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, has so eloquently stated year after year, it's unconscionable that we spend billions of dollars on pork-barrel projects that the Pentagon doesn't need and doesn't want. 
Mr. President, we can't afford to pretend we're still dealing with the Cold War Soviet threat. Military leaders agree that we need lighter, faster and more agile forces. This strategy does not include wholesale purchase of cumbersome B-2 bombers, new attack submarines, or Cold War-era heavy tanks. 
One particular program epitomizes the worst of pork-barrel politics. The C-130 air cargo planes have sapped billions of dollars from vital military programs even though our military leaders are incessant in their pleas to end the harmful practice of forcing the Pentagon to buy more planes than it needs. 
Mr. President, since 1978, the Congress has added a whopping 263 C-130s for which our Department of Defense has not asked. That's right--the taxpayers have paid for 263 C-130s the Pentagon didn't need. If you lined them up wing to wing, that would be six and a half miles of unwanted airplanes, with the taxpayers on the hook for $22.4 billion. This assault on military planning hamstrings readiness, equipment, and compensation for our soldiers. As we all know, these are the precise areas which the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified this week were at greatest risk. Politicians who want to bring home the bacon at taxpayers' expense should not be second-guessing the judgment of our military leaders in this way. 
This conference report follows in the dubious footsteps of its ancestors by authorizing 7 C-130s, while the Pentagon asked for only one. Not only does it take from other procurement money, but DoD must divert operations and maintenance money to look after all these unneeded planes. This is the height of irresponsibility and shortsightedness. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would like to congratulate my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley. He held a hearing on Tuesday to discuss accounting fraud at the Pentagon. His continued efforts to rein in obvious and debilitating fraud at the Pentagon need to be applauded. Perhaps the Senator's most important finding is summed by his quote, `If we put adequate controls on the money we have, there should be no need for more defense spending.' 
That, Mr. President, sums up my point, as well. We don't need to throw good money after bad with pork-barrel spending in our military budget. What we need to do is spend our money more wisely. That is how we will move toward a lean, efficient, and effective military. This conference report does not move toward the new 21st century military force. 
I thank the chair and I yield the floor.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Senior Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) in his efforts to describe some of the provisions of concern that were attached to the Interior Appropriations legislation, the fate of which is now uncertain. I hope that all the provisions that will harm the environment, impede the enforcement of environmental law, or weaken federal environmental policy, will be removed from this legislation if it either returns to the floor or is incorporated in a broader appropriations bill. 
This is not the first time that I have supported the Senior Senator from Montana in his efforts to address environmentally harmful legislative riders in appropriations legislation. In September 1995, I joined in his efforts to mitigate the effects of riders in the FY 96 VA-HUD appropriations legislation regarding the operations of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Once again, I applaud his leadership in championing the protection of the environment. 
Mr. President, for more than two decades, we have seen a remarkable bipartisan consensus on protecting the environment. As a consequence of this broad agreement, today we breathe cleaner air, drink cleaner water, and enjoy spectacular public lands. 
Unfortunately, again during this Congress, we have faced numerous proposals to modify the environmental protections upon which American families depend. We have seen bills that would undermine the Wilderness Act and the management of our public lands, block implementation of the Endangered Species Act, rollback wetlands standards and weaken enforcement of clean water laws, and slow down or stop cleanup of hazardous waste sites. Congressional consideration of these proposals has been divisive, time-consuming, and ultimately unproductive. 
Mr. President, I believe we have a responsibility to the American people to protect the quality of our public lands and resources. That responsibility of stewardship requires that I oppose legislative efforts to include proposals in routine spending bills that weaken environmental laws or prevent potentially beneficial environmental regulations from being promulgated by the federal agencies that carry out federal law. 
In addition to my substantive concerns, Mr. President, I also share with the Senator from Montana a procedural concern about these riders. The people of Wisconsin have been calling my office in the last few weeks to express their grave concern that when riders are placed in spending bills major decisions regarding environmental protection are being made without the benefit of an up or down vote. Wisconsinites have very strong views that Congress has a responsibility to discuss and publicly debate matters effecting the environment. Thus, the Senior Senator from Montana is making an important procedural point for the Senate. We should be on record with regard to our position on this matter of open government and environmental stewardship. 
Though I have substantive concerns about all of the riders that the Senior Senator from Montana has detailed, and others, I wanted to share my concerns by highlighting in detail a few riders contained in the Interior Appropriations legislation. 
I am concerned about the language on forest road decommissioning that is contained in Title II of the Interior bill. This language prohibits the use of funds to decommission National Forest System roads until the Regional Forester certifies that all `unauthorized' roads are decommissioned or reconstructed. Mr. President, this mandate simply does not recognize that maintaining existing roads is a priority both in Wisconsin's national forests and throughout Forest Service Region 9. Our existing road system in the Nicolet and Chequamegon National Forests not only serves those who visit our forests, but also serves our local communities. Forest Service roads are important routes between communities in the northern part of my state. I also travel them when I attend Listening Sessions and other events in northern Wisconsin. I am concerned that if our forests have to spend time documenting all unauthorized roads this fiscal year, such as snowmobile crossings and other rights of way, we will neither get to accomplish any needed decomissioning, nor any much needed maintenance. 
I also oppose the rider regarding logging in Tongass National Forest contained in the Interior bill. While Wisconsin's national forests have struggled to bring their timber sales above cost, I am concerned that this rider requires that the Forest Service offer for sale, and allow the logging of, ninety percent of the timber volume proposed by the Tongass Land Management Plan, a plan which is currently under appeal to the Secretary of Agriculture. Moreover, this rider contains a dangerous, precedent-setting provision that makes this requirement legally enforceable. I strongly believe that taxpayers should be getting a better return for the sale of timber from public lands, and I am concerned about increasing cut volumes when we still need to address below cost issues on the Tongass. 
These are a few of my concerns, Mr. President. I believe that the Senate should act to strip these riders from the bill and send clean Interior funding provisions to the President for his signature. I encourage my colleagues to take the advice of the Senior Senator from Montana, and act to fund the programs we must fund without taking environmental policy actions that the public opposes.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer a few comments on the budget picture and the tax measure that appears likely to move through Congress in these few days remaining in the session. 
Over the last several days, a number of my colleagues have come to the floor to voice concerns about the increasing use of the emergency spending provisions in our budget rule as a device to circumvent the tough limits we have imposed on our budget requiring that all new spending be paid for. 
Those Members are properly alarmed because those spending provisions, which by any reasonable measure were predictable and expected, have now been designated as emergency appropriations precisely to avoid the need for offsetting spending cuts. 
Mr. President, I want you to know that I share the concerns of those Members. 
The spending limits to which we agreed in the bipartisan budget agreement last year are indeed tough. They were intended to be tough. But if we are to make progress toward a truly balanced budget, those limits have to be respected--not just last year's but also this year and into the future. 
Along those same lines, I have some very serious concerns about the proposed tax bill that is working its way through Congress. To many it will not come as a surprise that I have serious concerns about this measure. 
In 1994, I was the first Member of either House to fault both parties for the irresponsible tax policies they were advocating while our Nation still faced a very serious budget deficit. Then, as now, I firmly believed that balancing the budget has to be our highest economic priority, and that the irresponsible tax legislation being offered at that time made that task much harder. I think that subsequent events have proved that point. 
The 104th Congress pursued the so-called Contract With America budget, a proposal that featured massive cuts in Medicare and Medicaid to help fund an irresponsible tax cut. That proposal in effect tried to serve two masters at the same time--a reduced deficit, and a massive tax cut. 
The result was a measure that was unsustainable economically and politically, and the political gridlock that followed in the wake of that budget produced a Government shutdown, and little, if any, new progress toward balancing the Federal budget. 
So the result was that the 104th Congress missed an important opportunity to finish the job that we started in the 103d Congress with the successful enactment of the historic deficit reduction package passed in August of 1993. It was the 1993 deficit reduction package that helped finally turn the budget around. It also helped turn Congress around by focusing attention on the need for continuing deficit reduction. 
Unfortunately, the 104th Congress failed to advance the work of the 103d Congress. It sadly lost the focus of deficit reduction and the politically driven tax cut proposal undercut the potential for a sustainable deficit reduction package. 
Then, at the beginning of the 105th Congress, we began to regain part of our focus on reducing the deficit. The political gridlock that characterized most of the previous Congress was really a slap in the face to many, and the following Congress--this Congress--there was a historic bipartisan effort to get back on track. 
As a Member of the Senate Budget Committee, I was proud to be part of that bipartisan effort. 
Once again, let me pay special notice to our distinguished chairman, the Senator from New Mexico, and our ranking member, the Senator from New Jersey, for their leadership in helping to craft a bipartisan spending-cut bill that we passed in 1997. 
Mr. President, taken together, the 1993 deficit package, and to a lesser but still important extent the 1997 budget-cutting bill, have put this Nation on the road--`on the road'; we are not there yet, but on the road--to a truly balanced budget. We are not there yet, but the goal is in sight. 
As I noted, I was proud to support the budget-cutting bill last year. I voted for the tough spending cuts that included. However, I did not support the separate irresponsible tax-cut bill that was also part of those discussions. 
A large part of the reason we have not reached our goal of a balanced budget is last year's tax-cut legislation. In fact, that tax cut should not have been enacted for a great many reasons. But first and foremost, Mr. President, it shouldn't have been enacted because it was premature. In effect, it created over a 10-year period a $292 billion net tax cut--a net tax cut of $292 billion--while we were still facing significant budget deficits. 
Mr. President, the bottom line is that because our budget is still in deficit, the tax cut was effectively funded with Social Security revenues. Make no mistake about it. That $292 billion comes out of the Social Security trust fund, because it is the only pot that is left when you have a deficit. 
Mr. President, this terrible problem in last year's tax bill is the very same problem that plagued this year's tax proposal. 
There are other problems, as well, with last year's tax bill. Not only was it premature, but the bill's costs were heavily backloaded, putting even a greater burden on our children and grandchildren, and even adding more complexity, if you can believe it--even more complexity--to a Tax Code already thick with it. 
And by committing revenues to a variety of specific interests, it further jeopardized the broad-based tax reform that so many of us genuinely want to see, and that we really thought was going to happen after the 1994 election. 
Mr. President, the most telling legacy of last year's premature tax cut is that, if it had not been enacted, our Federal budget would have finally achieved a significant surplus by 2002 instead of having to wait until at least as long as 2006, 4 years earlier. 
Mr. President, this bears repeating. 
As we have talked for years about how we wanted to have a truly balanced budget by the year 2002, that goal and that achievement was sacrificed to the desire to give out a premature tax cut last year. If Congress had not enacted last year's premature tax cut, today we would be looking at the chance of real budget surpluses in the year 2002 instead of having to wait at least until the year 2006, and perhaps beyond, if the appetite for premature tax cuts is not satiated. 
Mr. President, this mistake of last year should have been a lesson for us. Regrettably, it appears at least some have not learned a lesson. 
We now come to the end of the 105th Congress, and again we are presented with yet another tax-cut proposal. 
Estimates from the Joint Committee on Taxation puts the cost of the tax cuts in this new proposal at about $86 billion over the next 5 years. Naturally, all of us who care about truly balancing the budget say, `OK. Where are the offsets? What about the offsets? What revenue increases or spending cuts are included in the package to offset this cost of $86 billion in lost revenue?' 
Apparently, other than about $5 billion in revenue offsets, there are none. So it begins to look an awful lot like the 1997 tax bill, which involved at least $86 billion to $90 billion in net tax reductions--not offsets--over the course of 5 years. 
Mr. President, this new proposal essentially has no offsets. It is a net $80-billion-deficit increase. 
How can this be? What possible justification is offered to again balloon the deficit in this way? 
The answer is the same shell-game explanation that has been given to the public for about 30 years. 
Proponents of this legislation argue that somehow there is no deficit, that the budget currently has a surplus, and that all this tax bill does is merely return some of that surplus to the taxpayer. 
That portrayal of our budget is simply wrong and, frankly, is misleading. 
We do not have the surplus. The budget this year is projected to have about a $40 billion deficit. And except for briefly achieving balance in 2002 and 2005, the Congressional Budget Office does not project a significant budget surplus until at least the year 2006, 8 years from now, if, and only if, their economic assumptions hold. And they, of course, are optimistic economic assumptions based on the rather healthy economy we have enjoyed for several years. 
In response to a letter from our ranking member on the Budget Committee, the Congressional Budget Office indicates that if a recession similar to the one that occurred in 1990 and 1991 were to begin in late 1999, the budget's bottom line in that year would be close to $50 billion worse than is currently projected. CBO goes on to note that this impact on the budget would grow to almost $150 billion by the year 2002. 
Put simply, if we were to experience a recession similar to the one we experienced in 1990 and 1991, instead of having a balanced budget in the year 2002, we would have a budget deficit of $150 billion--all the more reason for us to be fiscally prudent. 
Let me reiterate, we do not have a budget surplus today. Our budget is currently projected to end the current fiscal year with a deficit of about $40 billion. How can proponents argue that we have a budget surplus when we do not? What is the difference? What is the difference between their view and their argument and the real budget? The difference is Social Security. Those who are pushing this tax measure want to include Social Security trust fund balances in our budget. They want to use Social Security balances to pay for their tax cut. And that is what is wrong with this tax cut. 
A recent release from the Concord Coalition said it quite well. They said, `It is inconsistent for Congress to say that Social Security is `off budget' while at the same time using the Social Security surplus to pay for tax cuts or new spending.' 
That is exactly what is being proposed here. Years of fiscal discipline are being squandered for the sake of an election year tax cut bill. 
What is equally troubling, the future discipline that will be needed to finish the job and balance the budget is also put at risk by this tax bill. Our budget rules cannot by themselves eliminate our deficit and balance the budget, but they can help sustain the tough decisions we make here. They play an important role in ensuring that Congress does not backslide in efforts to balance the budget. 
The tax measure as it currently is being debated in the other body appears to violate several critical budget rules. It violates the pay-go rule, which is supposed to ensure that tax and entitlement bills do not aggravate the deficit. It violates section 311(A)(2)(b) of the Budget Act by undercutting the revenue levels established in the most recent budget resolution. And it may violate section 306 of the Budget Act if, as some believe will happen, the majority includes language which would include further provisions to avoid the automatic cuts made by the sequester process. 
This proposal may well become a triple threat. It ignores rules requiring offsets, it ignores rules establishing revenue floors, and before we are done it may also seek to circumvent the sequester provisions--the last line of defense to protect the budget. 
I know this can sound very complicated. The people pushing this tax bill are counting on it sounding complicated. But it is really not complicated. Put simply, what they want to do, just like they did last year, is to use the Social Security trust funds to pay for an election year tax cut. They will balloon the deficit and imperil Social Security, and that is a bad idea. 
This is the legacy of the tax bill as it is the legacy of the 1997 tax bill--raiding the Social Security trust fund, busting the budget and trashing budget discipline, all for an election year tax cut. For the sake of expediency, this body will be asked to put fiscal prudence on the block. 
Last year's tax bill was premature. This year's tax bill is equally reckless. We are within sight of our goal of a truly balanced budget. We really should not stray from that path. I urge my colleagues to join with me to oppose any tax measure which violates our budget rules and sets us once again on a fiscally irresponsible course. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, although I object to numerous provisions in the underlying bill, S. 1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, I was pleased to work with the Chairman and Ranking Member to include provisions important to the farmers of this country. 
Mr. President, everyone knows that family farming is a high risk business. One that's effected more by outside, unanticipated forces--for example, unstable markets, weather, and disease--than any other industry. To survive in such a volatile vocation, farmers are often given a bit of flexibility. This flexibility is the key to the survival of most family farms. 
Unfortunately, some farmers become overburdened by the financial hazards associated with the business and seek assistance in dealing with their creditors. In 1986, Senator Grassley added Chapter 12 to the bankruptcy code to satisfy the unique risks and needs of family farmers. Prior to that, farmers were forced to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 11, the Small Business specific Chapter. 
Although Chapter 12 has provided much needed relief for hundreds of family farmers, through the years, Chapter 12 has become outdated; its definitions, eligibility requirements and other provisions have not kept pace with changes in agriculture or in the nation's economy. Most disturbingly, the out of date eligibility requirements of this provision have excluded many who need it most and forced many farmers into Chapter 11. 
I was pleased that three amendments I authored with Senators Conrad and Bob Kerrey were accepted by Senators Grassley and Durbin and included in the manager's amendment. Two of these provision change the eligibility requirements of Chapter 12 to include those originally intended under the 1986 statute. 
One provision indexes the Chapter 12 debt limit. The current maximum debt limit on Chapter 12 is $1,500,000. This limit has not been changed since the 1986 law took effect, while most other Code dollar figures have been increased for inflation and will have automatic adjustments in the future. At this point, the debt limits exclude many farmers for whom Chapter 12 was originally intended. 
A second eligibility problem had been the requirement that more than 50% of a farm family's taxable income for the prior year came from a farming operation. Farm families, expecting low return on their commodities, usually seek off-farm employment for one of the household adults. A few years of low prices and negligible farm income would make many farmers ineligible under this provision. Current law assumes that farmers throw in the towel after just one bad year. I cannot think of one Wisconsin farmer that gives up that easily. They keep working and hope for better markets next year. My provision changes this requirement so that farmers have a bit more flexibility. More specifically, my amendment will allow the 50% income requirement can be satisfied in any of the past three years. 
The last provision simply prohibits retroactive assessment of disposable income by the courts. To have a payback schedule confirmed by the bankruptcy courts, a debtor in Chapter 12 must commit projected disposable income--over and above living expenses, operating expenses and secured debt payments--to pay unsecured debtors. Some courts have started `adjusting' these payments upward in hindsight, if the debtor's income was greater than projected. My amendment will make Chapter 12 consistent with Chapter 13 and prohibit the retroactive assessment and instead modifies the coming year's payment schedule to reflect the additional income. 
Again, Mr. President, I wish to thank Senators Kerrey, Conrad, Grassley and Durbin for their work on these amendments. It will give family farmers across the country the flexibility they need to make good on their debts.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support efforts to increase the federal minimum wage by passing the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998. This important legislation will provide American laborers with a 50 cent increase to the minimum wage on January 1, 1999, and a second increase on January 1, 2000. This modest increase, which would raise the minimum wage to $6.15 per hour, will help 12 million lower income Americans. 
Our country's economy is growing. It's economic vitality and the success of welfare reform have resulted in better news and a better life for working people. Or have they? 
The truth is, even though the economy is on an up-swing, wages are stagnant and people are still living in poverty. In fact, over half a million people live in poverty in our own state of Wisconsin. 
Despite successes in the welfare to work initiative, last year, a US Conference of Mayors study indicated that eighty-six percent of cities reported an increased demand for emergency food assistance. Thirty-eight percent of those people seeking food at soup kitchens and shelters were employed. This is an increase of fifteen percent since 1994. It is evident that, in many cases, minimum wage workers can not afford to feed themselves or their families. 
Mr. President, no hard working American should have to worry about affording groceries, shoes for their kids, or medicines. The people whom the bill will help are not people who spend their money frivolously, these are the families who scrimp and save to provide their children with the necessities of life: shelter, food, clothes and an education. 
In a recent study, The State of Working Wisconsin--1998, by the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, we find some troubling news regarding wages. Today, the Wisconsin median hourly wage is still 8.4% below its 1979 level. Since 1979, Wisconsin's median wage declined 50% faster than the 5.3 percent national decline over the same period. These numbers are, sadly, not Wisconsin specific. This is the situation all over the country. 
I urge my colleagues to bring some respect and dignity to the federal minimum wage. America's labor force deserves a chance to be successful and we need to give them the tools. I urge them to support the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998. Its a vote in support of every full time worker hoping to make ends meet.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the original version of S. 1301 would have made a debtor's attorney responsible for the panel trustee's costs and fees if the attorney lost a 707(b) motion brought by the trustee--not if the filing was made in bad faith, not if the filing was frivolous, but simply if he or she lost the motion. 
Fortunately, an amendment was accepted at the Judiciary Committee markup which would make the debtor's attorney liable only if he or she was `not substantially justified' in filing the petition. Even this standard, however, is untenable. 
The opponents of the Feingold-Specter amendment argue that debtors attorneys are notoriously bad actors who abuse the bankruptcy system. No credible evidence, however--beyond an unsubstantiated story here and an unsubstantiated story there--has been offered to support the proposition that debtors attorneys are more likely to act in bad faith than any other type of attorney. 
Why then would we allow this bill to contain a provision which applies a stricter standard of conduct to consumer debtors' attorneys than to any other type of attorney--a provision which is, as pridefully noted by the opponents of my amendment, designed to punish debtors' attorneys? 
I have heard from bankruptcy judges in my home State of Wisconsin and they strongly object to the premise that debtors' attorneys are by any measure less admirable or honest than other types of attorneys. Moreover, they believe that this provision of the bill is fundamentally wrong and endangers debtors' access to the system. 
The conduct of consumer debtors' attorneys should meet the standards set for all attorneys in Federal Civil Rule of Procedure 11, which is incorporated in Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedures 9011. 
Every other fee-shifting provision in Federal law which holds the attorney liable require affirmative wrongdoing by the attorney. With or without my amendment--indeed, with or without this bill--if a debtor's attorney brings a `frivolous' or `improper' Chapter 7 filing--the court can order sanctions against that attorney. 
Let me be clear--under current law, debtors' attorneys can already be fined if they act in bad faith. There is simply no legitimate basis for a different and more punitive standard that only applies to debtors' attorneys in bankruptcy proceedings. 
Should not the purpose of this bill be to rid the bankruptcy system of abuse, not to punish a particular type of attorney? The basic premise of this bill--the fundamental tool it uses to weed out abuse--is the 707(b) motion. That is, the motion which is filed by the panel trustee when she feels that the debtor is abusing the system. 
To supposedly encourage a trustee to file such a motion, this bill would award her costs and fees only when the debtor's attorney's actions were not substantially justified. Under the Feingold-Specter amendment, the trustee would be rewarded for her efforts whenever she wins a 707(b) motion. 
Let me ask you--if you were a panel trustee charged with the duty of protecting the integrity of the bankruptcy system and your primary tool for doing so was the 707(b) motion, would you be more likely to file such a motion when you got paid whenever you won such a motion or only when the debtor's attorney was demonstrated to have been not substantially justified? 
Before you answer, let me ask you one more question. What if, before you could get paid--as under the current bill--you, a panel trustee--not the court or an independent third party--also had to incur the additional time and cost of bringing and arguing another motion to prove that the debtor's attorney was not substantially justified? 
The answer to these questions is clear. If you were a panel trustee you would have a stronger incentive to bring a 707(b) motion--that is, a stronger incentive to rid the bankruptcy system of abuse--under the Feingold-Specter amendment than you would under the current language of the bill. 
So, the Feingold-Specter amendment seeks to maintain the incentive for trustees while preserving a debtor's access to justice and representation. It does so by making the trustee's fees and costs an administrative expense under Section 503(b) if the trustee is successful in her 707(b) motion to convert the case into Chapter 13. If the court dismisses the Chapter 7 filing, the debtor would be required to pay the trustee's cost and fees. 
Your vote on the Feingold-Specter amendment comes down to this--if you want to muddle the system with needless additional hearings and to strike a mean-spirited, unfounded blow against debtors attorneys, vote against our amendment; if on the other hand, you want to rid the bankruptcy system of abuse in the most equitable and efficient manner, then vote for our amendment.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Ironically, bankruptcy is the only Federal civil proceeding in which a poor person cannot file in forma pauperis. 
What this means, in any other Federal civil proceeding you can file a case without paying filing fees if the court determines you are unable to afford the fee; but in bankruptcy, you either pay the filing fee or are denied access to the system. That is right, the bankruptcy system--which is by definition designed to assist those who have fallen on hard times--is unavailable to the poorest of the poor. 
This prohibition against debtors filing in forma pauperis is a clear obstacle to their efforts to gain access to justice. The current fee is $175; $175 is roughly the weekly take-home pay of an employee working a 40-hour week at the minimum wage. 
I think it is unrealistic and unreasonable to expect an indigent in this case to raise such a fee simply to enter the system.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, section 102(A)(3) of S. 1301, the section of the bill that would make a debtor's attorney responsible for the costs and the fees of the trustee if the attorney loses a 707(b) motion and the chapter 7 filing if it is found not to be `substantially justified' is a very troubling provision. 
As we know, a 707(b) motion does allow the court to dismiss or convert a bankruptcy petition. This is an important safeguard that protects the bankruptcy system from having abusive chapter 7 filings. There certainly is some abuse by some debtors' attorneys. However, this provision does not punish the attorneys. It actually punishes their clients. 
This provision, Mr. President, in effect, will deny debtors their right to be represented by counsel. What it will do is deny debtors any meaningful access to chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code. Therefore, ultimately, this provision will have the effect of denying debtors equal access to justice. 
This bill makes the debtor's attorney responsible for the costs and fees of the trustee--not if the bankruptcy filing was brought in bad faith, not if the bankruptcy was frivolous, but only if the motion was `not substantially justified.' 
I believe this is unprecedented in American law. Parties--not their lawyers--are sometimes assessed fees under fee shifting statutes that are designed to level the playing field or encourage certain types of suits. However, unlike section 102(A)(3), every other provision in which lawyers are assessed fees requires affirmative wrongdoing by the lawyer. In every other case the lawyer has to be found to, in effect, have been guilty of affirmative wrongdoing. 
As we all know, the standard of `not substantially justified' is a significantly lesser standard than a `frivolous' standard. Indeed, the Supreme Court held in Pierce v. Underwood that `not substantially justified' is a standard `greater than general reasonableness,' but a standard which `falls short of that necessary to issue sanctions for frivolousness.' 
Given the vaguely defined contours of this standard, it is likely that cases would be dismissed in which there was a good-faith argument that the chapter 7 filing was proper. Indeed, in other contexts, courts have interpreted that the `not substantially justified' standard is widely varying. 
The impact in this provision will be, in effect, to eliminate the filing of chapter 7 cases by debtors' attorneys except in the most clear-cut cases, regardless of whether a chapter 7 filing would actually be in the best interest of the client. Obviously, very few, if any, debtors' attorneys are likely to put their own finances and welfare on the line for such a filing. Or if a few debtors' attorneys do continue to handle such cases, they will likely raise their fees to account for this tremendous risk, thereby pricing themselves out of the market except for the most wealthy of debtors. It is an oxymoron to talk about the wealthiest of debtors. 
In the end, the result of this attorney's fees provision is that many debtors will be denied the benefit of counsel if they wish to file for chapter 7. In other words, many chapter 7 debtors will be forced to proceed pro se. As we have recently seen in the well-publicized abuses by Sears and others, many pro se debtors, due to their lack of knowledge about the system, suffer abuse under existing bankruptcy law. 
The bill, as a whole, supplies potentially unprincipled creditors with many new tools to take advantage of pro se debtors. The bill would allow an unscrupulous creditor to make threats of 707(b) motions, threats of discharge ability complaints, and threats of repossessing household goods, which may ultimately result in debtors signing ill-advised reaffirmation agreements. 
In addition, the attorney's fees provision, because it will compel many debtors now to file pro se, will likely result in a number of debtors having their petitions dismissed for even trivial or procedural mistakes. 
As you know, pro se cases are frequently dismissed because debtors file papers incorrectly and cannot correct them quickly enough. And, of course, this bill, by forcing more and more debtors to go with pro se representation, simply exacerbates this problem. 
Mr. President, Section 303 of the bill creates a presumption of bad faith when a case is dismissed for failure to file the required papers in the proper form. This provision, coupled with the fact that significantly more debtors will be forced to file pro se, will mean that many people who filed in good faith will have their petitions dismissed and, thus, will never receive their rightful bankruptcy relief. 
Moreover, in this the bill's current attorney's fees provision is maintained; it will have the perverse effect of increasing abuses in this area. As previously noted, this provision will cause attorney fees to increase; therefore, more people will be unable to pay attorneys. In addition to catalyzing the pro se problems that I have already discussed, the provision will also cause nonattorney petition preparers to proliferate and they--much more so than debtors' attorneys--have, unfortunately, historically been the No. 1 source of the abusive bankruptcy filings, which this entire bill is so focused upon. 
Indeed the nonattorney petition preparers have always been most prevalent where bankruptcy attorney's fees are the highest, notably in southern California and, to a lesser extent, in cities like New York. Very few pro se debtors actually prepare their own papers. Most have to seek help from these petition preparers who sometimes do a terrible job for them, give faulty legal advice, and file cases that often prejudice the debtor as well as landlords, mortgage companies, and other creditors. 
Mr. President, in the end, on an issue like this, we have to be honest with ourselves. These attorney fees provisions are designed to intimidate lawyers into counseling against a chapter 7, plain and simple; that is the goal. This is inherently troubling, but such a provision, Mr. President, creates a blatant conflict of interest between the debtor's attorney and his or her client. What if the client has a valid chapter 7 case and would be better served by a chapter 7? Under this new rule, if we don't change it with this amendment, the attorney will have the perverse incentive to counsel his or her client to enter into chapter 13 in order to protect the attorney's financial interests. 
This issue was actually raised at one of the hearings called by the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley. A powerful and troubling example was offered to illustrate the dilemmas that bankruptcy lawyers will potentially face under this bill. 
The scenario presented was that of a client who supports an elderly relative. Since a lawyer could not be sure if supporting an elderly relative would be considered a `reasonable living expense,' the lawyer would be taking a risk, a personal risk, by filing for chapter 7 and zealously arguing--as the attorney is required to do--her or his client's case. Indeed, rule 1.7(b) of the Rules of Professional Conduct specifically prohibit a lawyer from handling a case `if representation of that client may be materially limited by the lawyer's * * * own interests.' Mr. President, this bill would institute a scenario in which a debtor's attorney would arguably violate this rule whenever chapter 7 is at issue. 
The amendment I am offering aims to prevent the inevitable conflicts of interest, perverse incentives, and harm to vulnerable good-faith debtors that this provision would create. My amendment would simply make all reasonable costs of prosecuting a 707(b) motion incurred by a trustee an administrative expense. Characterization of trustees' fees as an administrative expense would then ensure that the trustee receive reimbursement if the debtor's case is dismissed or converted; but what it would do, also, is prevent the conflict of interest specifically prohibited by the Rules of Professional Conduct that I just mentioned. 
Senator Specter and I offered in committee an amendment that would have amended the bill to provide that the debtor's attorney would only be liable if his or her chapter 7 filing was frivolous. This amendment would have simply placed debtors' attorneys in the same position as all other attorneys. That is, they would only be held personally liable if they engaged in some kind of affirmative wrongdoing. 
This proposed amendment was, however, defeated in committee, but it was defeated by a 9-9 vote. Those Senators who voted no on our amendment claimed they were doing so because they wanted to maintain the financial incentive for panel trustees to challenge allegedly abusive chapter 7 filings. We have carefully, and in response to that, recrafted our amendment to retain this financial incentive. Under this amendment, the panel trustee who successfully challenges a chapter 7 filing will be rewarded for their efforts. 
In addition, if the debtor's attorney does file a frivolous chapter 7, that attorney will be punished. Just as every other attorney can be sanctioned for frivolous filings, the bankruptcy code already provides for sanctions to be assessed against an attorney who has actually acted in bad faith. 
So, Mr. President, in sum, my amendment seeks to equitably reimburse the panel trustee if he or she is forced to prosecute a party who inappropriately filed for chapter 7; but it also tries to strike the right balance by striving to protect a debtor's right to counsel. Nothing is more fundamental to our legal system than the right of every American to be represented by a qualified and zealous attorney. We should not risk compromising this right, particularly for vulnerable parties who often seek protection under the bankruptcy system. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to make this change, which I think would be in the spirit of improving this piece of legislation that both the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Illinois have worked so diligently on. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I enjoy and appreciate working with the Senator from Iowa on many issues, and I have enjoyed all of his remarks except for the suggestion that somehow this is going to be a bad-faith attempt to try to improve the bill, or somehow attempt to benefit attorneys. 
I feel like I identified some very specific arguments that are real and that are important to the legal system; and, that, although I share the concerns of the Senator about the general system, in fact I think there are abuses in chapter 7. There is no question about that. But what I tried to do is craft an amendment that creates a fair balance. I am not trying to prevent punishment of an attorney who does something wrong. 
But let me just quickly review the arguments about why this is a reasonable amendment and I don't think was responded to. 
First of all, I heard nothing about my argument that this creates a conflict of interest. A lawyer has a responsibility under the rules of professional conduct to zealously advocate on behalf of their client. Therefore, it is very rare that our legal system would function well and that attorneys would zealously advocate for their clients if they are afraid that their family and their house could possibly be taken away because they might be assessed with the entire cost of litigation. That is the conflict of interest that this creates. 
The Senator suggested in an attempt to suggest that we are going to leave no opportunity to punish a wrongdoing lawyer that there is nothing left. That isn't true. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and under the Bankruptcy Code there are rules about filing frivolous claims. In fact, I remember when I was a young attorney. The first thing I learned when I came into the office as a young associate was you had better not file a pleading that is frivolous or you might be personally assessed for having done so. That is applicable to these situations and would be effective. 
There is no truth to the suggestion by the Senator from Iowa that the attorney can go off scot-free, if he brings up a ridiculous claim. 
Furthermore, in fairness to the Senator from Iowa, he did make a point about whether a trustee would be protected in getting his fees in a situation where the case is dismissed. We sent a modified version of this to the desk which addresses that issue. We understood the point of the Senator from Iowa. We listened to him and modified our amendment from committee, because it was pointed out in that there was a conversion from a chapter 7 to a chapter 13; that in that case the trustee would be protected, but not if the chapter proceeding was actually dismissed. That is a fair point. We changed it. It applies to both the dismissal as well as the conversion. 
I hope it is clear from the Record that the Senator's comments about that provision relates to the amendment we originally proposed, but not the amendment that was sent to the desk. 
Finally, Mr. President, let's talk for just one second about the real effect of this. 
The provisions that are in the bill relate only to `counsel'--an attorney, a licensed attorney. If this goes through and attorneys feel a fear of being assessed these fees in a case where they can't bring a case that they know is airtight, and they don't represent the client, who do they go to? They go to these petition preparers. These petition preparers are the very people who are most likely to do a sloppy job and not care if they bring a frivolous proceeding. 
But guess what, Mr. President? The petition preparer isn't responsible. The petition preparer would not be under this standard. So what you are doing is pushing these debtors from legitimately licensed attorneys, who know what they are doing, hopefully, to people who are basically in many cases scamming people, and they would have no responsibility at all. That is bad for the debtor. It is bad for the creditor. That is bad for the legal system. That is bad for the congestion in the courts as a result of the bankruptcy system. For all of these reasons, we have a frivolous standard. 
We make sure that the trustee is protected, whether it is a dismissal, or a conversion. And we try to address the inherent conflict of interest that exists when an attorney has to wonder if their own personal finances are going to be affected because they think they have addressed the best interests in arguments on behalf of a client but they are not certain. 
This goes too far, and I really hope in good faith that the Senator takes a look at these arguments and the modifications we have made, and considers that this really is a reasonable balance in the context of the larger bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is fairly easy to try to make the words `not substantially justified' sound like a reasonable standard. But what really is going on here is an intrusion into the attorney-client relationship that is very dangerous. 
I practiced law for several years before running for the Wisconsin State Senate, and I remember always when looking at a client's argument--first of all, I obviously didn't think I could file any argument that was frivolous. That was prohibited both under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and under the Wisconsin Rules of Civil Procedure. But there would be a number of occasions where we would have two or three possible arguments to make. One we might think was our strongest argument, and then another might be our sort of middle argument, and then there might be a third legal argument where it was a long shot but we thought the facts were strong. Any good lawyer would bring all three of those arguments, in most cases, because if a judge found any one of the three to be persuasive, that could be the basis. 
I like to think I would have had the courage as a young attorney to go forward with that third argument, even with this provision. But I didn't have any money, and if I thought that bringing that third argument could cause me to be assessed with attorney's fees that would make it impossible for me to pay my mortgage--I am human. I wonder if I would have done what is right, which is to counsel that client: This one is about a 25-percent possibility, but under the right facts, and I think you might have the right facts here, sir, you ought to bring it. 
Lawyers should not be put in a position where they believe, except for cases where there is a frivolous claim, that bringing an argument will cause them to have personal harm come to them. That destroys the whole notion of zealous advocacy. This is a serious problem for the relationship between attorney and client, and I really do think to suggest that the `not substantially justified' standard is simply a reasonable restraint does not show an understanding of what really goes on in a situation where a lawyer and client sit down and try to come up with the best argument possible. So I reject that suggestion and again urge the adoption of the amendment.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, when I heard that bankruptcy was the only Federal Court proceeding in which a poor person is not entitled to file an in forma pauperis petition, I thought there must be some mistake. I found it somewhat surprising, counterintuitive, that bankruptcy, which by definition deals with people who are broke or have very limited funds, does not provide even the poorest of debtors a waiver of the filing fee. 
The filing fee for consumer bankruptcy is $175. Mr. President, $175 is more than the take home pay of an employee working 40 hours a week at the minimum wage. Tell me, how are the indigent--those who desperately need bankruptcy protection--going to afford $175 simply to file for such protection? 
Congress acknowledged that the bankruptcy system may need an in forma pauperis proceeding when it directed the Judicial Conference to implement a pilot program in six judicial districts around the nation. This pilot program operated from October 1, 1994, through September 30, 1997, in the following six districts: the Southern District of Illinois, the District of Montana, the Eastern District of New York, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the Western District of Tennessee, and the District of Utah. The pilot program was clearly a success. Many of the judges who administered the program, and who were initially skeptical, now support it. In particular the pilot program revealed the following information: 
An application for waiver of the filing fee was filed in only 3.4% of all Chapter 7 cases, and the large majority of those waivers were granted. Indeed, the U.S. Trustees Office filed objections to less than 1% of the applications. In other words, only those very few individuals who really needed the fee-waiver applied for it. 
The fee-waiver program enhanced access to the bankruptcy system for indigent single women more than any other group. We have heard a great deal about how this bill, S. 1301, will hurt women and children. We cannot strike another blow against single mothers and their children by denying them access to the bankruptcy system because they cannot even afford the filing fee. 
The nature of the debt for those who filed for the fee-waiver differed from that of other debtors in that their debts more often related to basic subsistence--education, health, utility services and housing. Moreover, 63 percent of the housing-related debts of those who filed for the fee-waiver owed their debts to public housing authorities. Only one of the debtors who owed a debt to a housing authority did not file for a fee waiver. These findings show that indigent debtors were not filing bankruptcy to escape paying for their boats or their fancy entertainment systems. They were filing bankruptcy merely to subsist. Oftentimes these people use the bankruptcy system simply to prevent homelessness. 
There was only a minimal increase in the number of filings, and there was no indication that debtors filed for Chapter 7 rather than Chapter 13 just to obtain the benefit of the fee-waiver program. Simply stated, the debtors typically did not abuse the system. 
A nation-wide program would cost between $4 and $5 million in lost filing fees. Projections state that there will be 1.5 million Chapter 7 filings next year. We can, therefore, off-set the cost of a nation-wide program by merely raising the price of Chapter 7 filings by between $2.70 and $3.40. If we increase filing fees for all bankruptcy filings we can reduce that cost to about $2 per filing fee--a negligible amount. 
In short, the pilot program was a resounding success. 
I offered this amendment in committee, where it was defeated by a 9-9 vote, with all the Democrats supporting it. One concern articulated by Senators who voted against the amendment in committee involved the possibility that, if we implement a fee waiver program, unscrupulous lawyers would advertise `free filings' and make a profit. However, under the program, debtors cannot obtain fee waivers if they can pay their lawyers; therefore, private lawyers would have no incentive to encourage in forma pauperis cases. 
Let me repeat that point: debtors who can pay their lawyers cannot obtain fee waivers. Only truly indigent people, those who need bankruptcy protection the most, can have their fees waived. 
The Specter-Feingold amendment would build upon the strong foundation established in the pilot program, and direct the Judicial Conference to establish a nation-wide in forma pauperis program for the bankruptcy court system. If we examine the findings of the pilot program we find that: (1) only those who really needed the assistance of the program used it; (2) that there was little to no abuse of the fee-waiver program; and (3) that the program in large measure helped those who needed it to subsist and, in many cases, avoid homelessness. 
Given these findings, how can we choose not to implement a nation-wide program? Why did we direct the Judicial Conference to conduct a pilot program if we were not going to use the results to shape public policy? How, in good faith, can we deny bankruptcy relief to those who truly need it--those who cannot even afford the filing fee? I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to restore some fairness in the bankruptcy filing process for the most financially strapped filers. I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote to sustain the President's veto of HR 1122, the so-called partial birth abortion bill, that seeks to outlaw a particular abortion procedure, which is most closely analogous to the intact dilation and extraction procedure, sometimes called Intact D&E. I do support a ban on post-viability abortions, if the ban is subject to important exceptions to protect a woman's life and prevent grievous injury to her physical health. I am disappointed that the proponents of HR 1122 have steadfastly refused to accept any amendment, no matter how tightly crafted, which would include provisions to protect a woman's physical health in extreme circumstances. 
I have said repeatedly here on the floor of the Senate, during hearings in the Judiciary Committee, and at listening sessions held across the state of Wisconsin that I believe post-viability abortions should be banned, with two exceptions. The first is an exception to save the life of the woman, which is an important and necessary provision. I hope we can agree on that point. The second is to protect a woman from grievous injury to her physical health. I hope we can also agree on that point. I am sensitive to the fears of the bill's proponents that any health exception might serve as a major loophole, and I agree that the definition of a threat to physical health should be narrow. But it should be there. 
Let me remind my colleagues that the Supreme Court has clearly ruled that, although states have the right to restrict post-viability abortions, exceptions must always be made to protect the life and health of the mother. Twenty-eight states, including my own home state of Wisconsin, have passed so-called partial birth abortion bans, and the statutes in ten states are substantially identical to HR 1122. Wisconsin's experience in the wake of the passage of its partial birth abortion ban should give all of us, as we consider whether to override the President's veto of HR 1122, some additional pause. For nearly two weeks following the passage of the state bill, physicians struggled to determine which procedures, if any, were allowed under the bill; prosecutors proclaimed that they couldn't enforce the new law in their communities until it was clarified by a court. 
Last year, I voted for the bipartisan alternative amendment to HR 1122 introduced by Senator Daschle and others. I voted for that amendment because it took a comprehensive approach to banning abortions on viable fetuses, rather than merely banning a single procedure. I did so, Mr. President, because I was concerned that the language contained in HR 1122 was imprecise. I looked closely at the bill to see how it addressed the significant concerns raised by my constituents based upon accounts and descriptions of the `procedure' they had heard. The text of HR 1122 does not specify a gestational age, such as `late term;' it does not mention any specific part of the fetus, such as the head; and it does not mention any specific medical instruments, medical situations or circumstances. 
I believe that the Daschle amendment provides that needed clarity while being sufficiently narrow to satisfy most reasonable people's concerns about healthy women with normal pregnancies who might seek to terminate those pregnancies in the third trimester. It would have required a physician to certify that continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the woman's life or risk grievous injury to her physicial health. Grievous injury was define in the amendment as `a severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically caused by the pregnancy, or any inability to provide necessary treatment for a life threatening condition.' 
The other side claims that abortion is never necessary to protect a woman's health. But Mr. President, I have met women whose doctors believed differently. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society of Physicians for Reproductive Health supports them. ACOG has stated that although Intact D & E may not be the only option to save a woman's life or preserve her health, it sometimes may be the best or most appropriate procedure, depending on the woman's particular circumstances. Precisely because I am not a doctor. I think it is important for us to uphold the President's veto. The point is, Mr. President, that there is a dispute within the medical community about the necessity for and the risk associated with Intact D & E. And that is where it should be resolved. It should be women and their doctors, not politicians, who decide which medical procedure is appropriate within the confines of the Daschle amendment. 
The Daschle alternative amendment struck the right balance between protecting women's constitutional right to choose abortion and the right of the state to protect future life. It would have protected a woman's physical health throughout her pregnancy, while ensuring that only grievous, medically diagnosable physicial conditions could justify ending a viable pregnancy. Within the terms of that amendment, both fetal viability and women's health would have been determined by the physician's best medical judgement, as they should be. 
I hope, as we vote today, we do so in full knowledge of the strong feelings about this issue on all sides. We should respect these differences, avoid efforts to confuse or distort each others views before the public, and maintain a level of debate that reflects the importance of relying on the facts about this issue and finding a response that is sensitive and constitutionally sound.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the amendment offered by the Senator from New York (Mr. D'Amato). 
This amendment is about simple fairness. 
Mr. President, banks, credit unions, and the other owners of automatic teller machines are entitled to be compensated for the service they offer. 
But consumers are also entitled to be treated fairly. 
The D'Amato amendment strikes that balance. 
This amendment does not fix prices. 
It does not limit what ATM owners may charge for using their machines. 
It simply prohibits charging consumers twice for the same service. 
Mr. President, consumers become subject to ATM charges when they obtain an ATM card through their bank or credit union. 
While the consumer's bank or credit union often has its own ATM machines at which account holders can bank, increasingly, banks and credit unions join a network of ATMs to give their account holders greater access. 
Mr. President, when your bank or credit union joins an ATM network, it pays what is called an interchange fee to the network, and your bank or credit union may pass the cost of that interchange fee directly to you, or it may just add it into their overall cost of doing business--a cost that account holders help to bear. 
But, Mr. President, consumers are now being forced to pay an additional fee, a surcharge, for using a network ATM. 
When that happens, the consumer is being billed twice for the same transaction--once by their own bank, and once by the ATM owner. 
Mr. President, consumers who are already charged by their own banks or credit unions for using an ATM feel that once is more than enough. 
When consumers are charged twice for the privilege of accessing our own hard-earned money through an ATM, it's time for this body to take some action. 
Mr. President, not only are consumers now being asked to pay twice for the privilege of accessing their own money, the second fee, or surcharge, often represents a big portion of the cash they want to withdraw. 
The Senator from New York noted consumers may be hit with a surcharge of $3 or more just to take $20 out of their account. 
This is especially a problem for consumers in under-served areas. 
Because they lack ready access to their bank or credit union, those consumers are much more dependent on ATMs for every day financial services. 
Mr. President, let me note here that not all ATM networks subject consumers to this double billing. 
I understand there have been efforts, especially by community banks, to form networks that explicitly do not charge consumers twice. 
While I applaud those efforts, they may not be enough. 
Mr. President, in addition to the fundamental unfairness of these double charges to consumers, I am troubled that this fee structure may also put smaller banks and credit unions at a competitive disadvantage. 
Customers seeking to avoid these double charges may move their accounts to larger banks that own these broad-based ATM networks, and as we've seen recently, these big banks are now merging with each other, which will only make matters worse for their smaller competitors. 
Indeed, Mr. President, in this regard there have been some troubling developments in the past few weeks. 
In particular, I was disturbed to hear reports that the Department of Justice is investigating whether or not some of the large ATM networks are engaging in illegal restraint of trade by seeking to prevent smaller banks from forming those very alliances that promise not to double charge consumers. 
Mr. President, this amendment will end double-billing at ATMs. 
It will ensure fairness for consumers, and it will put a stop to efforts that undermine the ability of our smaller community financial institutions to retain their customer base. 
Mr. President, it's time to demand fairness for ATM users. 
Paying additional fees at the ATM is something consumers can afford to live without.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to S. 1981, the so-called `Truth in Employment Act' and urge my colleagues to do so as well. 
Mr. President, this legislation is an affront to the American worker. It opens the door to abuse of good workers and unfair job termination. This measure would undermine a worker's right to organize, to seek better working conditions, to work to reduce racial tension, and to seek higher wages and better benefits. This measure seeks to undermine and penalize most every action an employee might take to improve the lot of workers. 
In a unanimous 1995 decision, NLRB versus Town and Country, the United Sattes Supreme Court held that a `union organizer is an employee, with all the protections of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), if acting as a union organizer does not involve abandonment of his or her service to the employer.' This legislation makes a mockery of the Court's decision by requiring that workers be, what it calls, `bona fide' job applicants and by subjecting workers to an outrageous test of motivation as a condition of enjoying the protection of the NLRA rights. This bill provides a legal shield to employers who refuse to hire applicants who are union members or who have worked for an organized employers. 
Mr. President, its not my intention to stand here telling the business community of this country that they do not have the right to terminate union employees for cause or that they must hire only applicants who claim a union affiliation. In my eyes, anyone who does not produce quality work product or who consistently ignores the rules of the workplace should face the threat of termination. Along those lines, any applicant who does not have the skills or experience to perform a job well should not be hired and the law today does not require that any unqualified person even be considered for a job. Mr. President, that's just common sense--that's just fair. This bill, the deceivingly named `Truth in Employment Act,' is not fair. 
Mr. President, since being elected to the Congress, the Senate majority has used every possible opportunity to attack worker rights. They have used a variety of vehicles, ranging from their anti-overtime bills, to repeated efforts to water down OSHA requirements, to their opposition to an increase in the minimum wage or any expansion of the Family Medical Leave Act. This latest measure is just the latest in a long history of anti-worker legislation presented to us by the majority party. 
This bill is blatantly anti-union, anti-worker and anti-American. I urge my colleagues to stand up for the ordinary American workers in their state. I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on this harmful measure.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to just take a moment of the time to point out that once again a case that the Senator from Kentucky has been discussing is a case that is appropriate in some situations but is not really applicable to the current provision of the McCain-Feingold bill that is before the body. The Senator can stand up and cite all kinds of cases about a lot of provisions, but the provisions are not in the bill at this time. So I hope those who are listening don't get confused about case law that has nothing to do with our actual amendment. 
Previous versions of the McCain-Feingold bill included a codification of the Furgatch decision, but with the passage of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment in February, the provision that we have before the Senate now simply doesn't include that approach. It takes a different approach to the issue advocacy problem. A number of constitutional scholars, including Dan Ortiz of Virginia Law School, believe this approach is constitutional. 
I understand the strategy--keep bringing up aspects of the bill that were concerns in the past, make people think those are still there and get people to be uncomfortable with the bill. I understand the strategy because we have 52 votes already for this amendment as it actually is being presented. So that everyone understands, these are arguments against a bill that is not before the Senate. I assume that is because they don't have very strong arguments against the bill that is, in fact, before the Senate. 
This afternoon we will vote once again on the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. Twice before we have debated this issue and twice we have been blocked by filibusters--I might add, not just by filibusters conducted after an amending process has occurred, but filibusters used to prevent the legitimate and normal process of allowing Members of the Senate to amend a bill. 
Some may ask, Why do you keep bringing us back to vote on it? The reason, quite simply put, is that this is a crucial issue. It is a defining issue for the 105th Congress. After all, we spent an entire year investigating the campaign finance abuses of the 1996 elections. That investigation, as the distinguished Senator from Tennessee who led the investigation I am sure will tell us when he speaks today, showed beyond a shadow of doubt that reform is needed. Of course, in response to that, the House has passed a strong campaign finance reform bill, very similar to the amendment we have offered here. 
We owe it to the American people to finish the job. The American people elected us to be legislators, Mr. President, not just investigators. Investigations are fine and appropriate, but we will have failed in our duties as legislators if we do not enact laws to address the problems that our investigations uncover. With the House vote early last month, meaningful campaign finance reform is in sight. This Senate has an obligation to address the campaign finance issue, and the public expects us to act. We know that a majority here understands that obligation. The question is whether we can get closer now to the supermajority of 60 votes that we apparently will still need in order to end debate on this amendment and get to a vote on the merits. 
I hope that in the short time we have to debate this issue today we will actually debate our amendment, what is before the Senate. Again, yesterday we heard a number of opponents of the bill speak at length about cases that have nothing to do with the provisions that are actually in this bill. We heard a lengthy discussion of the history of campaign spending, with interesting, but really not very relevant, expositions about donors to an unsuccessful Presidential campaign 30 years ago. 
I really hope we hear an actual justification from those on the other side today, an actual justification for voting against a ban on the unlimited corporate and labor contribution to political parties known as soft money. I hope that when they wax eloquent again about the first amendment rights of citizens, they will actually direct their criticism to our bill, to the Snowe-Jeffords amendment on electioneering communications, rather than severely exaggerating the effect and intent of those provisions. 
To no one's surprise, the headlines this morning in the newspapers are not about campaign finance reform. The scandal that has occupied the Nation's attention for the past 8 months has reached a new and critical phase with the delivery of the Starr report to the House of Representatives. Many Senators are understandably very much concerned about how the impeachment process will play out. But for now, the report is on the other side of the Capitol. We still have a job to do here. We have many things to do here. But first on the list has got to be to somehow address the scandals that occupied our attention for much of 1997. Of course, the matters of 1998 have to be addressed, but are we just going to leave the scandals of 1996 behind, let them be washed away as if nothing wrong was done? 
The biggest threat to our democracy still comes from this out-of-control campaign finance system, notwithstanding the very serious news of the day. Let us not be distracted from our duty to address that threat. 
There are many Senators who support reform who would like to speak today, and our time is limited. So let me conclude by putting my colleagues on notice. The vote this afternoon on cloture will not be the end of the effort to pass campaign finance reform this year. I am sorry if this is an issue that is inconvenient or uncomfortable for some Senators to deal with. The American people didn't send us here for our convenience or for our comfort. They sent us to do a job, and we are going to do it. 
This amendment that is pending will continue to be pending. I hope it will become the subject of a legitimate legislative process. What I mean by that is, when there is an amendment that has a majority of support in this body, at the bare minimum Senators should be allowed to offer amendments, offer their ideas and their concepts about how to make it better. I understand the argument that you need 60 votes to pass it anyway. That has a lot of truth to it. But this process has repeatedly and cynically denied us the chance to simply amend the bill. That is how they passed it in the House. Everybody didn't love the bill right away. They adopted a number of amendments. They were allowed to offer their ideas and vote on them. 
We have been prohibited from improving this bill beyond the Snowe-Jeffords amendment. Of course, we know why. When we did Snowe-Jeffords, lo and behold, we got three more votes and we had a majority. Then the game was declared over. That is not a legitimate legislative process. That is not a fair process. That is the intentional denying of the majority of both Houses their right to fashion a bill that they can send on to the President. So I am not denying the right to filibuster. But denying the right to amend this amendment is well beyond the norm in this body, especially when we have demonstrated that 52 Senators are already committed to this amendment as it currently stands. So they continue to deny the majority even the right to make a reasonable change, to ask each other, `What change would you like in order to make this bill acceptable to you?' I think that is highly inappropriate. 
So the only way to avoid this discomfort is for Members to vote for cloture and let the majority do its will on this issue.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
In light of that, I wonder if the Senator from Minnesota has any additional remarks. I am prepared go forward, if he does not. 
Mr. President, we have heard a lot of criticism of our bill during this debate on constitutional grounds. The Senator from Kentucky said once again yesterday something that he has said many times. He expressed his opinion that there is `absolutely no way' that our bill will be held constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court. And obviously I disagree with that analysis. 
Our bill has been carefully crafted to be consistent with the Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo. The only way to find out who is right, of course--because you cannot call up the Chief Justice and ask him for advice or his opinion--the only way is by passing this bill, and allowing a court challenge to take place. I and other supporters of the McCain-Feingold bill are ready to defend this bill in court, and I sincerely hope that we will have a chance to do so. 
The Senator from Kentucky does have one group on his side that does specialize in the first amendment, the American Civil Liberties Union. And he is fond of reminding us that the ACLU, `America's expert on the first amendment,' as he likes to say, opposes our bill. Let me say, I have a great deal of respect for the ACLU in many areas. In fact, I may have agreed with them on more issues over the years than the Senator from Kentucky. But I think it is worth pointing out two things with respect to the ACLU's position on campaign finance reform. 
First, the ACLU is on record many times as opposing the Court's decision in Buckley that limitations on campaign contributions are constitutional. In other words, the ACLU disagrees with the Court's ruling in Buckley. The ACLU believes, for example, that limitations on soft money donations to political parties would be unconstitutional. But that is an opinion that is by no means in the mainstream of constitutional thought. 
In fact, as we have noted many times over the last year, we have a letter signed by 127 law professors who wrote to Senator McCain and to me and gave their opinion that a soft money ban would be fully consistent with the first amendment and the Buckley decision and therefore would be constitutional. 
Senator McConnell once said it would be easy to find 127 law professors of his own to say that soft money cannot be banned, but so far no such letter has ever materialized. Senator McConnell has been completely unable to come up with a list of constitutional scholars that would suggest that we cannot ban soft money, and I doubt that he ever could. 
Second, there is a serious split within the ACLU itself. One of the most interesting and significant developments in this whole debate occurred just this past June during the House debate on campaign finance reform when a group of former leaders of the ACLU released a statement on their opinion of the constitutionality of the House version of the McCain-Feingold bill.  
Mr. President, this isn't just one, if you will, disgruntled former leader of the ACLU. This statement was released by nine former leaders of the organization. They include every living person who has served as president, executive director, legal director, or legislative director of the ACLU for the past 30 years, except for one person who is currently in Government service and is not free to express his opinion. 
That is quite a thing--all of those former ACLU officials indicating they do believe that this bill is constitutional. Let me just read from the letter of June 19, the statement of persons who have served in the American Civil Liberties Union in leadership positions supporting the constitutionally of efforts to enact reasonable campaign finance reform. They say: 
We have devoted much of our professional lives to the ACLU, and to the protection of free speech. We are proud of our ACLU service, and we continue to support the ACLU's matchless efforts to preserve the Bill of Rights. We have come to believe, however, that the opposition to campaign finance reform expressed by the ACLU misreads the First Amendment. In our opinion, the First Amendment does not forbid content-neutral efforts to place reasonable limits on campaign spending. 
We believe that the First Amendment is designed to safeguard a functioning and fair democracy. The current system of campaign financing makes a mockery of that ideal by enabling the rich to set the national agenda, and to exercise disproportionate influence over the behavior of public officials. 
Later in the letter the same individuals said, 
. . . even within the limitations of the Buckley decision, we believe that significant campaign finance reform is both possible and constitutional. We support elimination of the `soft money' loophole that allows unlimited campaign contributions to political parties, undermining Congress's effort to regulate the size and source of campaign contributions to candidates. We believe that Congress, for the purpose of regulating the size and source of federal campaign contributions, may treat a contribution to the political party sponsoring a federal candidate as though it were a contribution to the candidate directly. 
We also support regulation to the funding of political advertising that is clearly intended to affect the outcome of a specific federal election, but that omits the magic words `vote for' or `vote against'. We believe that Congress may draft a narrowly tailored provision regulating the funding of so-called `issue advertisements' that mention one or more of the candidates, appear shortly before the election, and are geographically targeted in an obvious effort to affect the outcome of a specific federal election. 
These individuals conclude by saying: 
We believe that the current debate over campaign financing reform in the House of Representatives and the Senate should center on the important policy questions raised by various efforts at reform. Opponents of reform should no longer be permitted to hide behind an unjustified constitutional spokescreen.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Let me take this opportunity to thank all of the cosponsors and all the supporters of this bill, especially the senior Senator from Arizona who came here with the idea for this legislation I guess it is now 4 years ago. 
I thank everyone for their efforts in the past but, more importantly, for their continued efforts in the future, including this year, on trying to finish the job. So I have a feeling of gratitude, not only for what we have done but for what we will accomplish before we are done. 
Let me take the very brief time I have just to refer to a statement by the Senator from Idaho which I think really sums up this whole issue. He just got done saying on the floor that the current campaign system is `a system that works very well.' He said, `The campaign finance system is alive and well, as it should be.' That is what the Senator from Idaho said. 
Well, if you agree with that statement, I guess you will want to vote against cloture. But that is not what the American people believe. They think this system is broken. And it is not just a few people who are corrupting the system, it is the system that is corrupt, and we have to do something about it now. 
So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture. The time has come for the additional eight Senators to allow the majority of both Houses of the Congress to send this bill on to the President. 
I yield the floor.

Let me indicate, as I indicated before, if the process of debating campaign finance reform would ever be permitted to involve the normal amending process, without even insisting on giving up the right to filibuster, that that is the critical element, because without that, we are not in a position here to do what was done in the House where there was a lot of debate over many months, but they were able to offer amendments. Here, as soon as we won on the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, it was over, there were no more amendments. This has happened three times now.

Our amendment came up and did prevail, and there were many other amendments and we just stopped. I recognize there may be another version of the Paycheck Protection Act that may prevail. My problem is that it stopped at that point, and that is not the normal procedure. That is what I am asking for, that everybody do their amendments, and at the end of the day, I know, unless you change your mind--and I recognize you don't need to--that we still need 60 votes, but to have the amendments, to have everybody's ideas presented and voted on, is what we are asking for here.

I think it is essential for the country that this process--and I realize it is a difficult one--be completed this year because of the danger of what will happen in the year 2000 election. We cannot let another 2-year cycle begin with the corruption that already existed in the 1996 elections and the problems with this year's elections to not finish the job in whatever form it is, however we can reach a consensus. You and I know we reached a consensus on the gift ban. We sat down in a room, and we worked it out.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I repeatedly asked the Senator from Kentucky if he would yield for a question about his statements about the case law, and he refused on several occasions. That is regrettable because I hope we will have a debate here, but I do appreciate his review of the case law. I think it is helpful, and I do want to hear Senator Byrd's remarks very shortly. 
Let me quickly point out that I heard the Senator from Kentucky discussing a Nevada case regarding restriction on spending on issue advocacy. But the bill before the Senate has no such restriction. So that case is not applicable to what is before the Senate. 
The Senator referred to the Cincinnati spending limits case. The problem is, our bill before the Senate does not have any spending limits in it. 
The Senator is arguing case law that has absolutely nothing to do with what we are debating here today. I think that is regrettable because this is supposed to be a debate about the amendment before the Senate. 
The Senator discussed a case involving in-state contributions. But there are no in-state limits included in this bill. And the same for the California case involving small donor----

Mr. FEINGOLD. None of the provisions that were specifically cited with regard to those cases has anything to do with the legislation before us. I will make the point now and continue to make the point throughout this debate that when case law is cited, it ought to have something to do with the matter before the Senate, or that clouds the issue of constitutionality in a way that is a disservice. If the Senator from Kentucky is going to make his arguments based on court cases, he should at least recognize and acknowledge that this version of the bill does not include many of the red herrings that he keeps presenting before the Senate. As we say in the law, these cases are readily distinguishable from the matter before us. 
With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as cosponsors to the McCain-Feingold amendment, in addition to Senators Thompson, Snowe, Collins, and Jeffords, Senators Levin, Glenn, Lieberman, and Wellstone, who are long-time and vigorous supporters of this bill.

<TEXT>
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the McCain-Feingold bill was first introduced in the fall of 1995, just about 3 years ago. To date, thanks to the truly extraordinary efforts of our colleagues in the other House, we are as close as we have ever been to passing that bill and making a start on cleaning up the corrupt campaign finance system that has seemed so intractable for so long. As we stand here today, only eight votes stand between this bill and the President's desk--just eight votes. Only eight Senators out of all Members of the Congress are preventing this body from joining the other body in passing campaign finance reform. Eight Senators are blocking the Senate from banning soft money. 
Mr. President, the time for excuses is over. It is time to finish the job. It is time to pass campaign finance reform and send it on to the President. 
Let me first take a moment to remind my colleagues of what happened in the other body the week after we in the Senate left for the August recess. This campaign finance reform bill that all the pundits thought was dead and constantly claimed as dead actually passed the other body by a very strong vote. The vote was 252 to 179. That is right, Mr. President, 252 to 179 in the House. It wasn't even close. By any measure, the passage in the House of the Shays-Meehan version of the McCain-Feingold bill was a landslide. Sixty-one Republicans, over one-quarter of the Republican caucus in the entire House, voted for this bill. Mr. President, I think that should answer once and for all the allegation that the McCain-Feingold bill is a partisan piece of legislation. It is not. 
Sixty-one Republicans would not vote for a bill that is a Trojan horse for the Democratic Party. No, this bill has now been shown in both Houses to be a bipartisan solution to a bipartisan problem. 
The House vote was the culmination of literally months of debate on campaign finance reform. The debate actually started, if you can believe this, on May 21 and did not conclude until August 6. There were 72 amendments offered to the House version of the Shays-Meehan bill. There were a total of 41 rollcall votes on those amendments. The House spent over 50 hours debating campaign finance reform, an amount of time that is almost unprecedented to spend on one bill over there. I think we do it fairly frequently here, but it is almost unprecedented in the House. 
The opponents of reform tried to take a page from the Senate playbook and openly proclaimed that they were going to try to kill the bill with amendments. Just like here, they offered poison pills and they tried to overwhelm the reformers with just the sheer number of amendments. They tried to drown them in amendments, but they failed, and they failed miserably. 
In the end, a reform bill emerged and passed the House that retained all of the essential features of the McCain-Feingold bill--a ban on soft money, improved disclosure of campaign contributions, codification of the Supreme Court Beck decision, and provisions designed to deal with campaign advertising that is dressed up as issue advertising. 
After many months of debate in the House, the bill has come back to the Senate. It is now on the calendar and is awaiting action. 
The majority leader objected to bringing up the House-passed version of McCain-Feingold, but, fortunately, that was not the end of the matter. Because we have the right as Senators to offer amendments to pending legislation, we were able to bring it up on this bill, and that is exactly what Senator McCain and I have done. We would have been delighted if the majority leader had agreed to bring up the House-passed version of the bill, and some comments that he made on `Meet the Press' this weekend suggested that he was going to do just that. But by offering our amendment, we will assure that the Senate will again vote on this issue, which is what the people of this country want. 
Once again, I want to say that I am very proud of the solid, 100-percent support of the Democratic Senators for this bill. I am grateful for the efforts of the minority leader, Senator Daschle, to keep this issue on the agenda and line up our caucus in support of the McCain-Feingold bill. 
But we are not doing this for partisan reasons. We are doing this because it is the right thing to do for our country. This campaign finance system is sapping the confidence of the American people in their Government. People have seen time and time again that these huge soft money contributions do influence the congressional agenda. They understand that we cannot act in the interest of average people if we are spending too much time trying to woo the big contributors. They know that soft money must be eliminated before it just totally swamps our elections and our legislature. 
It is absolutely critical that we finish the job now; that we finish the job now before the end of this Congress, otherwise, we will undoubtedly see an explosion of soft money fundraising as the parties get ready for the next big show, and that is the next Presidential election in the year 2000. 
If we go home and allow this soft money system to continue into the next Presidential election cycle, we will reap scandals that will make the scandals of 1996 look pale by comparison. 
Look at what has happened in this cycle already will give you a clue as to what is going to happen. Already in this cycle, according to Common Cause, the parties have raised a total of $116 million, and that is the most ever in a non-Presidential cycle. Soft money fundraising more than tripled from 1992 to 1996--from an already troubling amount of $86 million to the now staggering amount of $262 million. Based on that growth, some estimate that the parties could raise $600 million in soft money in the year 2000 cycle--$600 million. Over half a billion dollars in soft money is likely to be the consequence and the disgusting display in the year 2000. 
Mr. President, we already have a majority in this body, and with just eight more votes in the Senate we can stop this escalation of soft money. We can say to the political parties, Enough is enough. Go back to raising money under the limits established in the Federal Election Campaign Act. And then if somebody says, `Well, we need more money,' then start raising money from more people; get more people involved. Don't just extort more and more money from the major corporations and labor unions that are eager to curry favor with the Congress or the President. 
Mr. President, the American people are sick of tales of big money fundraisers. It is a terrible turnoff for a citizen of average means to read that people give $100,000, or $250,000 to sit at the head table with the President, or have a special meeting with the majority leader of the U.S. Senate. They do not want more stories like the story of Roger Tamraz who gave $300,000 to the Democratic National Committee hoping for the special access he needed to promote his pipeline project. Tamraz told the Governmental Affairs Committee that as he thought about it, the next time he would give $600,000 if he thought this would help his business and that getting special access was not just one of the reasons he gave to the DNC, he said it was the only reason he gave the $300,000 and would give $600,000--for special access. 
But these kinds of scandals are bound to come back again and again because our political parties, Mr. President, are addicted to soft money. They cannot get enough of it. And the reason is that they have found a way to make soft money work directly for them in Federal elections. This is an incredible twist of a loophole that was established by the FEC in 1978. Remember that prior to 1996, most of the parties' soft money went into what were called party building activities--get out the vote drives, voter registration efforts, and the like. 
But then in 1996, the parties discovered the issue ad, and it was off to the races. Both Presidential campaigns directly benefited from these kinds of ads--you know, the ones that do not explicitly say `vote for' or `vote against' a candidate, but they are nonetheless obviously aimed at directly influencing an election, obviously intentionally intended to cause someone to vote specifically for one candidate or another. And they used party soft money to pay for the ads. 
Now, here is an irony, Mr. President. Just yesterday, Attorney General Reno announced yet another 90-day inquiry into the campaign finance scandals of the 1996 campaign. It has to do with issue ads run by the DNC, a portion of which were paid for with soft money. The allegation is that it was improper for the President to have participated in the development of that ad campaign. The McCain-Feingold amendment that is before us makes it very clear that such ads cannot be paid for with soft money and cannot be coordinated by the parties with their candidates. Yet some of the very people who are calling on the Attorney General to appoint this independent counsel are staunchly opposed to this amendment anyway. 
We also already have seen the parties and outside groups preparing to exploit the phony issue ad loophole in this election. Over the next month, more and more election ads will begin appearing around the country, but because of that loophole, in many cases there will be no disclosure either of the spending itself or of the identity of the donors who are really behind the ads. These issue ad campaigns, Mr. President, are blatantly targeted at specific elections, but again their creators intentionally avoid the elections law, but avoiding the so-called magic words of `vote for' or `vote against.'

Mr. FEINGOLD. This arms race of soft money spending on issue ads has to stop. And the way to do that is to ban soft money and bring these types of ads within the election laws in a fair and reasonable way that respects the constitutional rights of all citizens. That is what we have done in the McCain-Feingold bill. Contrary to the completely inaccurate and sometimes dishonest advertisements that have been run across the country saying that we use a different approach, we, in fact, maintain a clear respect for free speech, which both Senator McCain and I strongly adhere to. We have addressed in our bill, which is in the form of the amendment before us today, the two biggest problems in our campaign finance system--soft money and phony issue ads. 
Mr. President, if we do not act on this bill, the exploitation of the loopholes will continue to spiral out of control. In the year 2000, we will see both Presidential candidates promising to limit their private fundraising in order to receive public funds while their parties pursue parallel or even intertwined campaigns with issue ads funded by as much as $600 million in soft money. 
Is that the kind of campaign we want to see in the first Presidential election of the next century? I do not think so. We need to make the next campaign a cleaner, less corrupt, less out of control Presidential campaign. We do not want more of the same of what we saw in 1996. 
Mr. President, all across the country the American people are telling us that they do, in fact, overwhelmingly support the McCain-Feingold bill. Recent polls conducted in eight States during the month of August by the Mellman Group for the advocacy group Public Campaign showed that strong majorities, ranging from 58 percent in Mississippi to 75 percent in New Hampshire, are in favor of the McCain-Feingold bill. And this support is constant --it is constant, Mr. President--across demographic groups and across party lines. In fact, in seven of the eight States polled, believe it or not, Republican voters were more likely to support the bill than Democrat voters. 
Editorial boards across the country are constantly calling on us to act. And it is not just the Washington Post and the New York Times, although they have been wonderful advocates for this much-needed change; it is also the Hartford Courant, the Kansas City Star, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The Tennessean, and the Charleston Gazette. 
The message from each of these editorial boards is that this body, the Senate, has one last chance to salvage some semblance of respect on the issue of campaign finance reform. After all the investigations, all the allegations, and all the finger-pointing of the last 2 years, this is the chance to show that we care, that we think there is something wrong with such a corrupt system. This is the chance. 
Now, these writers know that McCain-Feingold is not perfect, and I agree with that. But they think it will make a difference and that it should be passed and that it should be sent to the President.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, again, we are down to 8 votes out of 535 Members of Congress. After a clear demonstration that a bipartisan majority in both Houses support this bill, we are just down to eight votes, eight votes to break the filibuster that is holding up this important reform bill. 
This isn't one of those situations where we haven't had votes to see if there might be a majority. We have. We had the votes in March, in February, and it was clear that a bipartisan majority of this body supports McCain-Feingold. So it is only the filibusterers, a minority of this body, who are standing against the majority of this body and the other body. We will soon see whether eight more Senators are ready to do what so desperately needs to be done. 
Time and time again the senior Senator from Arizona and I have said we are more than willing to entertain changes to our bill that will allow us to get those eight votes, as long as the basic integrity of the bill remains intact. We reached that kind of agreement with Senators Snowe, Jeffords and Chafee, and it led to our proving that a clear majority in this body supports McCain-Feingold. 
I say to all of my colleagues, but especially the 48 who have not yet joined the majority, if you are one of the potential eight votes, if before the end of this year you want to show that you do care about the corrupting influence of money in our political process, and if you have a particular concern or problem with the amendment that is on the floor now, please come talk with us. I have had several fruitful conversations with some of these potential Senators and I look forward to more of them. Let's try to come to some agreement that will allow us to give the American people what they so desperately want from this Congress--a campaign finance reform bill that will make the first election of the next century one of which we can all be proud. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me first express my admiration for the Senator from Washington's interest in first amendment and free speech issues, and his very careful presentation. 
I would just like to ask, in light of his earlier comments, if he believes the Buckley v. Valeo decision was correctly decided?

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I recognize the point that in Buckley v. Valeo the Court did suggest that there was some magnitude of contribution that might be needed to constitute a corrupting influence on the political process. But the Senator apparently accepts the notion that it is constitutional to have some kind of limitation on what a person can give to a candidate.

Mr. FEINGOLD. I think the Senator has been--if I can continue, Mr. President--has been very candid on the floor as to whether it would be constitutional to prohibit soft money contributions. I think you have spoken to that. Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe you have indicated you believe that, under Buckley v. Valeo, it would be constitutional to do that although it may not be wise to do so. Is that a fair statement of the Senator's position?

Mr. FEINGOLD. I was wondering if the Senator would briefly be willing to continue the discussion of the constitutional issues. 
Mr. President, I appreciated the Senator's candid responses on the relationship of the Buckley v. Valeo decision to the issues of contributions. He also talked a little bit about corporate and union spending and what should be done there. 
Does the Senator have a constitutional problem with the current law's ban on corporate union spending in connection with Federal elections?

Mr. FEINGOLD. That is exactly the point. 
To continue, is that not a reason that a majority of this body, as expressed in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, believes that this is a very simple and logical extension on the ban of corporate and union campaigning by saying that a corporation and union cannot directly fund issue ads that directly mention a candidate's name in the last 60 days? Is that not simply an extension of, in effect, what has always been the law?

Mr. FEINGOLD. It is interesting that the Senator makes that comment because a few years ago, for example, there was no question that Philip Morris could not write out a million-dollar check and run ads like that, but somehow now it is almost standard practice. Somehow the law has been moved away from almost a century-long prohibition on corporate spending in connection with Federal elections to the ability to have unlimited spending on Federal elections through the ruse of pretending that an issue ad is an issue ad when it actually does everything but say the words, of course, `vote for' or `vote against' a certain candidate. 
Isn't that just, in effect, eliminating the whole corporate prohibition that has existed for such----

We would find out if in fact the Supreme Court would find that an ad that does everything to promote a candidate or attack a candidate but say `vote for' really is an issue ad. That would be a matter for the Supreme Court to determine. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Washington in responding to a series of questions. 
I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Bryan, be added as a cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold amendment before the body.

The question that I would ask is, if you have a concern with regard to the bill at this point concerning individuals and groups that are not corporations or unions, the whole purpose of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment was to make it clear. And in the spirit of compromise that it would not affect what the individuals have been able to do in the past in that area, I just wanted to make sure the record is clear, because much of the comments of the Senator from Utah have to do with individuals who are not restricted in the way that the Senator has suggested.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to reflect for a moment on recent events in Northern Ireland, highlighted by the President's trip there last week. As every member of this body knows, the violent political and religious conflict in Northern Ireland has claimed the lives of more than 3,200 people since 1969. In April of this year, after many failed attempts at a political solution to this violence, a settlement was announced that was deemed acceptable to all sides of this conflict. The so-called Good Friday peace agreement is an historic achievement in the struggle for peace in Northern Ireland. It seemed that finally, peace had won out over war and intolerance, and that the children of Northern Ireland, both Protestant and Catholic, would finally be able to move hand-in-hand toward a shared future. 
As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I have closely monitored that Northern Ireland peace process, and I welcomed this peace agreement, which was expertly brokered by our former colleague, and the former Majority Leader of this body, Senator George Mitchell. 
In a May 22, 1998, referendum, a convincing majority of the people of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic embraced this peace plan. On June 25, 1998, the people of Northern Ireland went to the polls and elected representatives from Protestant, Catholic, and non-sectarian parties to sit in the newly created Assembly, which will gradually assume rule of Northern Ireland from Great Britain. 
This election was perhaps one of the most historic aspects of the Northern Ireland peace agreement. For the first time, the people of Northern Ireland elected representatives for an Assembly that will not be located in Westminster, but rather in Northern Ireland itself. The British Parliament must still draft and adopt legislation that will transfer the necessary powers to the Assembly that will make that body truly independent from Westminster, and I hope this will be done at the earliest possible time. 
This brief but promising time of peace and cooperation was shattered on July 5, 1998, during the annual and often contentious `Marching Season,' during which time it is common for Protestant groups to conduct sectarian marches throughout Northern Ireland. Tensions rose as many would-be marchers resisted a Parades Commission decision to reroute a march through a Catholic neighborhood in Drumcree planned by a Protestant group to commemorate the Battle of the Boyne, a 1690 skirmish in which the Protestant King William III of Orange defeated the Catholic King James II. The ensuing riots and violence culminated in a firebombing on July 11 in Ballymoney that left three young Catholic brothers dead. Both the Protestant and Catholic communities denounced this attack, which has been attributed to a loyalist paramilitary group. 
This senseless attack was particularly ironic because it appears that the house of the three young victims was targeted because their family was mixed--part Catholic and part Protestant. 
Violence ripped through Northern Ireland again one month later, on August 11, when a car bomb exploded in a busy marketplace in the town of Omagh. Twenty-eight people, including an elderly woman, her pregnant daughter, and her young granddaughter, were killed, and more than 200 were injured. It is ironic that the most horrible act of violence to occur in the last 30 years in a country that has suffered so much throughout its tumultuous history occurred just as the people of Northern Ireland finally embarked on the road to peace. 
Reports indicate that a warning was issued to police prior to the bombing, but that the terrorists gave false information which lead police to move those in the marketplace to the site where the bomb was located, thereby increasing the number of casualties. 
A fringe group which calls itself the `Real IRA' has claimed responsibility for this monstrous attack. This group, and one other anti-British fringe group, have since announced cease-fires. It is my strong hope that those responsible for this cowardly act will be identified and prosecuted for their crimes. 
Recently, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern recommitted themselves to the success of the Northern Ireland peace agreement and vowed that this attack would not destroy the progress of the last several months. They also announced new security measures that will be put in place to help prevent future attacks, and that the British Parliament plans to take a hard look at ways to improve security. 
I am pleased that President Clinton visited Northern Ireland, and the town of Omagh, last week and met with some of the victims of the attack in Omagh and their families, as he did last Thursday. The United States has invested much in the long and sometimes harrowing journey toward a lasting peace in Northern Ireland, and we must remain engaged there and continue to offer our encouragement and friendship to the people of Northern Ireland. While tremendous progress has been made in the last year, there is still much work to be done as the people of Northern Ireland strive to live and govern together in peace.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as children around the country head back to school this week, I come to the floor to speak about 44 Wisconsin schools with an extra reason to be excited on their first day of school this year. The students, teachers and parents at these 44 schools are excited because they are now participants in Wisconsin's successful pilot program, the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education, known as the SAGE program. These 44 schools deserve congratulations and I want to recognize some of them here today on the Senate floor. 
New SAGE participants include Giese Elementary School in Racine, McKinley Elementary School in Kenosha, Allen-Field Elementary School in Milwaukee, Chegwin Elementary School in Fond du Lac and many, many, more. 
The new SAGE schools are spread throughout Wisconsin from LaCrosse in the east, to Sheboygan in the west, Ashland in the north and Madison in the south. They include schools in Wisconsin's most populous areas, such as, Milwaukee, Madison, Racine and Waukesha, and also, the rural communities of Winter, Kickapoo and Baraboo. 
Mr. President, Wisconsin's SAGE program is a model for the nation in how to implement successful education reforms in our public schools, most importantly, reducing public school class size. I congratulate those in Wisconsin that have made the SAGE program possible for these additional twenty schools and take this opportunity to again alert my Senate colleagues to Wisconsin's innovative SAGE program. 
Mr. President, for many years now, I have been a strong advocate of federal support for states that are trying to reduce class size in their schools. I have witnessed first-hand, how reducing class size enhanced the overall quality of education in Wisconsin's SAGE classes. Those participating in SAGE, teachers, parents, students and school administrators, report that student academic performance, student behavior and teacher morale all improved. In addition, comprehensive evaluations of Wisconsin's SAGE program have confirmed that small class size promotes effective teaching and learning. 
Leading scientific studies of the impact of small class size, including Tennessee's STAR study and its follow-up, the Lasting Benefit study, found that students in small classes in their early years earned higher scores on basic skills tests in all four years and in all types of schools. Follow-up studies have shown that these achievement gains were sustained in later years, even if students go on to larger classes. Along with important factors in quality education like teacher quality, high expectations, and parental involvement, the significance of small class size should not be underestimated and cannot be ignored. 
When asked about her experience as a kindergarten teacher at Webster Stanley Elementary School in Oshkosh, a new SAGE school, Lauren Flanagan said she noticed that she could visit with each table more frequently and the children listened and learned more readily. In addition, she said about the SAGE program, quote, `It just makes such a difference. I had a chance to visit schools around the state participating in the SAGE program, and what I observed is that they were much further along in their curriculum. The students were much more advanced.' end quote. 
Mr. President, I have been so impressed with the success of the SAGE program that I introduced the National SAGE Act, legislation to offer grants to qualifying states to assist them in reducing public school class size in the earliest grades. The National SAGE Act authorizes $75 million over five years to fund a limited number of demonstration grants to states that create innovative programs to reduce public school class size and improve educational performance, as Wisconsin has done. The Secretary of Education would choose the states to receive funding based on several factors, including a state's need to reduce class size, the ability of a state education agency to fund half the program, and the degree to which parents, teachers, administrators, and teacher organizations are consulted in designing the program. 
The National SAGE Act is fully offset by cuts in a wasteful and unnecessary federal subsidy that benefits research and development for the world's largest aircraft manufacturer. We can fund this important SAGE program, while simultaneously reducing the federal budget deficit by more than $2.1 billion over five years. 
My legislation also includes a comprehensive research and evaluation component that would document the benefits of smaller class size in the earliest grades, and support efforts to reduce class size in schools all over the country. 
I think we all can agree that there are no easy solutions to the problems in our public schools. I believe, however, that targeting federal funds, matched on a 50-50 basis with state funding, to assist school districts moving toward smaller class size, is an effective use of federal dollars. The federal government, in cooperation with local school boards and state governments, has a responsibility to take positive steps toward helping school districts reduce class size as a part of an overall effort to improve student learning. As we near the end of the 105th Congress, I hope my Senate colleagues will embrace SAGE as a serious and exciting reform effort and act to assist states trying to reduce public school class size. 
Again, congratulations to the twenty new Wisconsin SAGE schools--you are off to a great start for a successful school year.

One of the criticisms made of this bill consistently, which I obviously have never found very valid, is that it is a partisan bill. The fact is that seven Republicans have supported this bill out here on the floor, and the number in the House was overwhelming. 
I wonder if the minority leader is aware that a quarter of all the members of the Republican Party in the House supported this legislation.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is precisely the reason the senior Senator from Arizona and I announced yesterday that we will be forcing the issue if your proposal is not agreed to, to bring this up, because we do believe that there will be Members on the other side of the aisle here who will support us. In fact, we are down, now, to only eight people. 
The fact is that originally people said, `You only have several cosponsors. You only have two Republicans. It will never get through the House.' That is just a series of what I regard as excuses. 
Mr. President, now it is very simple. The President has said he is ready to sign the bill. A majority of this body has indicated on the record they are for the bill and a majority of the other House is dramatically in favor of the bill. 
I just wonder if the leader would comment for a minute on the significance if we don't get this done this year. Unfortunately, we can't pass a bill that will affect this election, the one that will happen in 60-some days. That was an agreement we had. We worked hard and we would have loved to avoid the abuses that are going on right now as we speak. But there is another election coming up in the year 2000. 
I wonder if the leader would talk for a minute about what it means if we don't get the job done now.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of development assistance for Africa, which is included in the fiscal year 1999 Foreign Operations appropriations bill. 
For fiscal year 1999, the total funding for development assistance has gone down once again. At the same time, there are still earmarks for many programs in all regions in this bill. Given that there will be necessary cuts throughout all of these accounts, Africa should not suffer any more than other accounts simply because it lacks the earmarks that have been given to other regions of the world. 
Development assistance for Africa used to be provided through a separate account called the Development Fund for Africa (DFA), which was created in the fiscal year 1988 appropriations bill to meet a broad range of objectives specifically aimed at Africa, including rural and sustainable development, private sector development, maternal and child health needs, and educational improvement, particularly in the primary grades. For a variety of reasons, the DFA has been dropped as a separate funding account. Nevertheless, the goals and programs embodied in the DFA continue to be important in terms of our Africa program. 
For many years, these goals were championed by our former colleagues and former Chairmen of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, Senators Nancy Kassebaum-Baker and Paul Simon. As the current Ranking Member of that subcommittee, I share their commitment to these goals. I have seen how the 48 countries of sub-Saharan Africa are increasingly becoming even more relevant to United States interests, and our economic, political, humanitarian, and security concerns. 
Long-term development assistance to African nations--whether through bilateral or multilateral channels--directly complements U.S. foreign policy goals and national security interests. 
There are several examples of this complementary relationship. 
First, we have an interest in a safe and healthy environment. The rapid spread of the Ebola virus demonstrated some of the areas of vulnerability on the African continent. Now, unfortunately, the rates of HIV and AIDS infections in Africa are the highest in the world, and they are continuing to rise rapidly. As we have seen, viruses do not need visas. 
Second, we have an interest in expanding trade and investment ties with the African continent. U.S. exports to Africa expanded by 22.7 percent in 1995--this is nearly twice the growth rate of total U.S. exports worldwide. Already U.S. exports to Africa equal 54 percent more than our exports to the former Soviet Union. We export more to South Africa alone than to all of Eastern Europe combined. 
Third, we have an interest in democracy. More than half of African nations now can be considered democratic or have made substantial progress toward democracy. Many of these nations also are moving toward free-market economies. 
Fourth, we have an interest in human resource development. Sub-Saharan Africa has the fastest growing and poorest population in the world. A substantial percentage of Africa's population is under 18 years of age. These children will soon grow to adulthood and I hope there will be opportunities for them to lead productive and dignified lives, in which their basic human needs are met. At the same time, Africa's infant and child mortality rates are 2 to 3 times higher than those in Latin America or Asia. 
Finally, we have an interest in security. It is unfortunate, but Africa also is home to terrorist activity and to drug and arms trafficking. As the recent bombings of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and the bombing of a crowded restaurant in South Africa have painfully demonstrated, Africa is not immune to the scourge of terrorism. 
Mr. President, a stable African continent serves American interests. The Development Fund for Africa was created to ensure a steady source of long-term development funds for Africa. Over the past decade, the DFA has contributed to substantial gains in health care, education, small business development, democracy, and stability. A sustained assistance program for Africa helps African nations to invest in development and not in crises. The types of challenges we face in Africa today are very complex and require long-term solutions. And this requires long-term investment. 
As a result of DFA assistance, African farmers are growing more food, more children are attending primary school, and more informal sector entrepreneurs have access to credit than was possible 10 years ago. And the United States has played a key role in helping several African countries experience dramatic drops in fertility through effective family planning and health care programs. 
In sum, Mr. President, our assistance program represents a sound investment in our relationship with the continent of Africa that signals our continued interest in remaining engaged with Africa. I hope that during consideration of this bill in the Senate, in the House, and in conference, as well as during the United States Agency for International Development budgeting process, that we can maintain a similar proportion of the total development assistance appropriations as that requested by the President in the congressional presentation documents for foreign assistance.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Committee on Appropriations for including language in its report on S. 2334, the Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill for FY 1999, related to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification. In its discussion of funding for the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the Committee notes its support for that organization's efforts to implement this important Convention. The United States was instrumental in negotiation of this treaty, and has signed it, but the Senate has yet to exercise its advice and consent responsibilities on it. 
Mr. President, desertification is a serious problem with which many of my colleagues may not be familiar. I fear the Convention may be overlooked because of this ignorance, but at great cost and with little reason.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to comment on one provision of the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill that does not appear in this year's bill, for fiscal year 1999, and that is the provision that would impose certain restrictions for security assistance to Indonesia. 
As many of my colleagues may know, since 1992, the Congress has imposed restrictions on the provision of International Military Education and Training, known as IMET, to Indonesia, in response to the despicable treatment by the Indonesian military in East Timor the previous year, when more than 100 civilians were brutally massacred. In the Foreign Operations bill that year, for FY 1993, the Congress cut off all IMET assistance for Indonesia. 
A few years later, in the Foreign Operations Appropriation bill for fiscal year 1996, Congress authorized a limited form of IMET, known as `expanded IMET,' meaning military training courses focused on the management of defense resources, improvement in domestic systems of military justice in accordance with internationally recognized human rights, and the principle of civilian control of the military. This was the result of a compromise between those of my colleagues who support close ties between the United States military and Indonesia, and those of us, myself included, who remained skeptical and opposed because of continuing human rights abuses in Indonesia. 
In 1997, Indonesia withdrew completely from the program because it recognized the continuing opposition from some of us in Congress to these relations. President Suharto wanted to avoid what he knew would be criticism over his military's treatment of East Timor, and he decided that IMET, ultimately, was not worth it to him. 
This year, the Appropriations Committee has decided to remove the limitations on IMET for Indonesia. I welcome the Committee's report language urging the Defense Security Assistance Agency to consult with Congress regarding its plans for IMET training in Indonesia, particularly given past human rights concerns. However, since such consultation is not mandated, I would hope the DSAA will follow this proscription, and consult early and fully with the relevant appropriations and authorizing committees of both Houses of Congress. 
Nevertheless, it is my strong view that 1998 is not the year to change our policy with respect to IMET in Indonesia. 
Congress wisely restricted IMET at a time when the Indonesian military was clearly involved in myriad abuses. This year, Indonesia has certainly undergone tremendous changes. We have seen the country suffer through a quickly downsliding economy. We have seen student demonstrations not thought possible in that country's restrictive political environment. And then, amazingly, we have seen the resignation of long-time authoritarian leader Suharto. 
The country's new leader, President B.J. Habibie, has certainly taken some steps that are encouraging. He has released some political prisoners, and allowed workers to form unions. He has pledged to hold parliamentary elections by May and presidential election by December 1999. And, he has even broached the sensitive subject of East Timor, agreeing to hold talks on the region's status, and announcing a drawdown of some troops. 
But, in my view, these actions should still be considered mere preliminary steps. They are promising, but do not yet warrant a policy change with respect to our military training. 
Notably, Nobel Peace Prize winner Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, and other reliable sources in Dili, the capital of East Timor, believe the situation in East Timor remains substantially unchanged. Asked if he saw any concrete results after the UN action, the bishop said firmly, `Not yet.' In early August, Belo stated, `There is still intimidation and terror.' 
In late July, there was a widely publicized announcement of Indonesian troop withdrawal from East Timor, with about 100 foreign journalists brought there for the occasion. The problem is that there is every indication that the drawdown may not actually have taken place. Bishop Belo stated on August 20 that the troops were actually shifted to the western side of the island and later brought back to East Timor in trucks. `We must denounce this,' Bishop Belo said at the time. Other sources note that the army in East Timor's rural areas does not seem to act in the same spirit of reform that the leadership in Jakarta is professing. 
With all the political changes taking place in Indonesia, generally, it remains critical that the country's government make strong efforts to demilitarize East Timor as quickly as possible, and establish a United Nations or other international presence to protect human rights. Until such measures are in place, any claims of progress can have little credibility. There is a strong need to monitor closely conditions on the ground. 
Given this unsure environment, and particularly the unclear role of the military in the transition process, I believe restrictions on IMET training continue to be appropriate. 
As a result, I am disappointed that this year's bill does not include the restrictions that were first included in the Foreign Operations bill for fiscal year 1996, and continued every year since then. I believe removing these restrictions represents a radical step that I fear will send the wrong signal to the Indonesian Government. 
It is, however, my understanding that the House version of this bill, which is still in committee, is likely to include these restrictions. If this is the case, it is my sincere hope that the Senate conferees will agree to accept the House version of these provisions.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act of 1998. 
While alternative dispute resolution such as arbitration can serve a useful purpose in resolving disputes between parties, I am extremely concerned with the increasing trend of stronger parties to a contract forcing weaker parties to waive their rights and to arbitrate disputes. Earlier this Congress, I introduced S. 63, the Civil Rights Procedures Act, to amend certain civil rights statutes to prevent the involuntary application of arbitration to claims that arise from unlawful employment discrimination and sexual harassment. 
It has come to my attention that the automobile and truck manufacturers, which present dealers with `take it or leave it' contracts, are increasingly including mandatory, binding arbitration clauses as a condition of entering into or keeping an auto or truck franchise. This practice forces dealers to submit their disputes with manufacturers to involuntary arbitration. As a result, dealers are required to waive access to judicial or administrative forums, substantive contract rights, and statutorily provided protection. In short, this practice clearly violates the dealers fundamental due process rights and runs directly counter to basic principles of fairness. 
Historically and currently, franchise agreements for auto and truck dealerships are nonnegotiable with the manufacturer; the dealer accepts the terms offered by the manufacturer or they lose the dealership; plain and simple. Dealers, therefore, have been forced to rely on the states to pass laws designed to minimize the manufacturers' greater bargaining power and to safeguard their rights. The first such state automobile statute was enacted in my home state of Wisconsin in 1937. Since then all states, except Alaska, have enacted substantive law to balance the enormous bargaining power enjoyed by manufacturers over dealers and to safeguard small business dealers from unfair automobile and truck manufacturer practices. 
In addition, the majority of states have created their own alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and forums which specialize in auto and truck industry disputes. These administrative forums are inexpensive, efficient, and unbiased. For example, in Wisconsin mandatory mediation is required before the start of an administrative hearing or court action. Arbitration is also optional if both parties agree. These state dispute resolution forums, with years of experience and precedent, are greatly responsible for the small number of manufacturer/dealer lawsuits. 
Unfortunately, when mandatory binding arbitration is included in dealer agreements, state laws and forums established to resolve auto dealer and manufacturer disputes are essentially null and void. Under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) arbitrators are not required to apply federal or state law. The stronger party--in this case the auto or truck manufacturer--can, therefore, use mandatory arbitration to circumvent the state laws which were specifically enacted to regulate the dealer/manufacturer relationship. Not only is the circumvention of these laws inequitable, it also eliminates the deterrent to prohibited acts that these state laws provide. 
Besides losing the protection of state law and the ability to use state forums, there are other numerous reasons why a dealer may not want to agree to binding arbitration. Arbitration lacks some of the important safeguards and due process offered by administrative procedures and the judicial system. For example: (1) arbitration lacks the formal court supervised discovery process oftentimes necessary to learn facts and gain documents; (2) an arbitrator need not follow the rules of evidence; (3) arbitrators generally have no obligation to provide factual or legal discussion of their decision in a written opinion; and (4) arbitration often does not allow for judicial review. 
The most troubling problem with this sort of mandatory, binding arbitration may be the absence of judicial review. Take for instance a dispute over a dealership termination. To that dealer--that small business person--this decision is of paramount importance. Even under this scenario, the dealer would not have recourse to substantive judicial review of the arbitrators' ruling. Let me be very clear on this point; in most circumstances a dealer cannot appeal an arbitration award even if the arbitration panel disregarded state law which likely would have produced a different result. 
This problem is growing. The use of mandatory binding arbitration is increasing in many industries, but nowhere is it growing more steadily than the auto/truck industry. Currently 11 auto and truck manufacturers require some form of such arbitration in their dealer franchise contracts. 
In recognition of this problem, many states enacted laws to prohibit the inclusion of mandatory, binding arbitration clauses in certain agreements. The Supreme Court, however, held in Southland Corp. v. Keating, 104 S. Ct. 852 (1984), that the FAA by implication preempts these state laws. The Southland Corp. decision has, in effect, nullified many state arbitration laws that were designed to protect weaker parties in unequal bargaining positions from involuntarily acquiescing--often without other meaningful options--to these mandatory, binding arbitration clauses. 
The legislative history indicates that Congress never intended that the FAA be a tool that the stronger party to a contract could use to force the weaker party into binding arbitration. Congress certainly did not intend the FAA to be a weapon used to coerce parties into relinquishing important protections and rights that would have been afforded them by the judicial system. Unfortunately, this is precisely the current situation. 
Although contract law is generally the province of the states, the Supreme Court's decision in Southland Corp. has in effect made any state action on this issue moot. I, therefore, along with Senator Grassley, am introducing this bill today to ensure that auto and truck dealers are not coerced into waiving their rights. Our bill, the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act of 1998 would simply allow each party to an auto or truck franchise contract to voluntarily agree to arbitration; mandatory, binding arbitration would be prohibited. The bill would not proscribe arbitration, however. On the contrary, our measure would encourage arbitration by making it a fair choice that both parties to such a franchise contract willing and knowingly select. In short, this bill would ensure that the decision to arbitrate is voluntary and that the rights and remedies provided for by our judicial system are not mandatorily waived. 
Today if a small business person wants to obtain or keep her or his auto or truck franchise, she or he may only be able to do so by relinquishing her or his statutory rights and foreclosing the opportunity to use the courts or administrative forums. Mr. President, I cannot not say this more strongly--this is unacceptable; this is wrong. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to join with Senator Grassley and me to put an end to the invidious practice.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to explain an amendment related to U.S. development assistance to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DROC) that the managers of this bill have agreed to accept. As the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Africa, I am pleased to have been joined in this effort with the Chairman of that Subcommittee, my colleague from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] as well as the junior Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth]. 
This amendment revises Section 574 of the foreign operations appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999 to define restrictions on aid to DROC. It mandates that no aid may be granted to the Democratic Republic of the Congo until the President certifies that the DROC government is investigating and prosecuting those responsible for human rights violations or atrocities and is taking specific steps to implement a credible democratic transition program. 
When I originally began thinking about an amendment of this nature, I was concerned about the inability of the DROC government to follow up on what were really gross abuses of human rights committed during the takeover of the former Zaire by the rebel movement that became known as the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL). During the takeover, which took place from late 1996 through the Spring of 1997, thousands of civilians, mostly Hutu refugees, were slaughtered reportedly by rebel troops, some of them possibly Rwandan or under Rwandan command. The facts have never been clear on these massacres, but credible information from human rights groups clearly indicate that massacres were carried out throughout the country--in Mbandaka, in the west; in Kisangani, in the middle of the country, and in the Kivu region in the east--leading even a casual observer to surmise it was a well planned military operation. 
In July 1997, U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan named an investigative team to investigate gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Congo since March 1993. Not only was the team mandated to look into the general question of the massacres themselves, but also to establish responsibility for the massacres. 
Unfortunately, the government of Laurent Kabila continually obstructed the work of the U.N. team--imposing various conditions, delaying meetings, harassing 
potential witnesses, refusing permission to deploy to certain sites, and apparently organizing demonstrations against the U.N. teams, to name a few. Eventually, in April 1998, Mr. Annan felt compelled to withdraw his teams since it became impossible for the team to conduct its work. 
Nevertheless, it remains important that these atrocities be fully investigated and that those responsible be brought to justice. Our amendment calls for the investigation and prosecution of these abuses. This could mean that the government conduct its own transparent and credible investigation. It could mean that the DROC government cooperates with a future UN mission, if the UN decides to launch a new commission of inquiry. Or it could mean that the government cooperates fully with an appropriate judicial body, possibly an international tribunal, which would be charged with investigating the massacres. We have left the desired method intentionally vague so that all options might be considered. 
The amendment also calls for the implementation of a credible democratic transition program, which includes the establishment of an independent electrical commission, the release of individuals detained or imprisoned for their political views, the establishment of an environment conducive to the free exchange of political views, and free and fair elections. 
The discussion of both the investigation of past abuses and of the implementation of political reform may seem academic at a moment when we are watching Congo disintegrate into civil war for the second time in less than two years. A slightly different rebel movement is trying to recreate the `success' of the AFDL in 1996 by taking control of large portions of Eastern and Central Congo. However, the latest events only underscore the critical need for U.S. policy to focus on the protection of human rights, an end to impunity for gross abuses, and democratization in DROC. It has been precisely the lack of attention to these issues that fueled the conflicts throughout central Africa, and which now threaten the entire region. 
Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to say unequivocally that I condemn actions by all the governments and other movements in the region to become involved in violent conflict in DROC. I am sorely disappointed that despite repeated efforts to discourage them, the governments of both Rwanda and Uganda sought early on to support the rebel movement. Now, the involvement of Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia on the other side is no less constructive. In fact, we are now seeing an almost total regionalization of this conflict that risks bringing more and more African countries into it. 
Clearly, this is no way to further the African `renaissance' that we had reason to believe was underway. 
I hope the parties will quickly move to declare a cease-fire, and to try to negotiate an end to this terrible situation. 
In the meantime, I thank the managers for the consideration of this amendment.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the managers of the foreign operations appropriations bill have agreed to accept my amendment regarding development assistance to Nigeria. 
My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the assistance program in Nigeria has not been sufficient and should be expanded, and that the recent political upheaval in the country requires a new strategy for development assistance. The amendment specifies that no direct aid shall be provided to the government `unless and until that country successfully completes a transition to civilian, democratic rule.' It also encourages the development of a more robust presence in Nigeria, including placing development personnel outside of Lagos, the capital. Finally, it requires the President to submit a report to Congress on the new strategy. 
This amendment reiterates part of the basic policy expressed in a bill I introduced earlier this year, S. 2102, the Nigeria Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act of 1998. That bill declares that the United States should encourage the political, economic and legal reforms necessary to ensure the rule of law and respect for human rights in Nigeria and should aggressively support a timely and effective transition to democratic, civilian government for the people of Nigeria. The bill codifies many existing sanctions, authorizes the President to impose new sanctions if conditions sour in Nigeria, and would provide for $37 million in development assistance over three years to support democracy and governance programs and the activities of the U.S. Information Agency. 
My amendment would pick up on the development assistance provisions of S. 2102 without specifying an amount. Like S. 2102, this amendment authorizes no new money. All spending in Nigeria would come out of existing USAID appropriations. 
The United States Agency for International Development has already, correctly, noted that its program in Nigeria needs considerable re-thinking. It recently submitted a notification to certain congressional committees for some $5 million to support an immediate and effective transition to democracy. But activities under this notification were not fully defined, and approval would have granted USAID broad leeway in its budgeting for this project, so the Congress has asked USAID to provide additional details. 
My amendment would require the administration to submit a report with a more defined strategy for its Nigeria program within 90 days of enactment of the Foreign Operations bill. I would hope that the preparation of this report will help the administration focus its development efforts in Nigeria, so that we do not receive such vague notifications in the future. 
With the replacement of longtime ruler General Abacha by the current military leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, there has been reason to be optimistic about Nigeria's future. Although General Abubakar has not yet moved to repeal the repressive decrees that place severe restrictions on the basic freedoms of Nigerians, he has taken some positive steps, including the release of several prominent political prisoners, and has indicated a willingness to move his country once and for all in the direction of democracy. But he had yet to deal with some of the more vexing issues related to such a transition, which were further complicated by the untimely death last May of Chief Moshood Abiola, the presumed winner of the 1993 elections. 
These are not easy times in Nigeria, nor for U.S.-Nigeria relations. As the Ranking Member of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, and as someone who has watched Nigeria over the past several years, I look forward to working with the administration on the development of a coherent Nigeria policy, beginning with a more robust development assistance presence.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment to the fiscal year 1999 Foreign Operations appropriations bill offered by the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin]. The amendment requires a report to the Congress from the Inspectors General of the Departments of Defense and State detailing the type and purpose of military training provided to foreign military personnel within the United States during fiscal years 1998 and 1999. I am pleased the Senate has adopted this amendment. 
I have long been opposed to the continued operation of the United States Army's School of the Americas (SOA), located at Fort Benning, Georgia. This amendment will ensure that the Congress receives a full accounting of the duration, cost, purpose and nature of the foreign military training at all sites within the United States, including the School of the Americas. The report required by this amendment will also include a list of the number and country of origin of foreign military officers trained and the units in which these officers serve. Further, the report must include an analysis of whether or not the training these officers receive conflicts with the foreign policy objectives of the United States. 
While the Senator's amendment includes all foreign military training that is conducted in the United States, this is an especially appropriate time to talk about the training at the School of the Americas in particular. All across our country, millions of children are beginning a new school year. Most students this year will study math, science, history, and English, and perhaps foreign languages, art and music. And they will learn the basic values of our society--honesty, integrity, and how to get along with each other. 
There is one school in our country, however, that has not subscribed to these basic American values. It is called the School of the Americas--a name which evokes the idea of a shared system of values among the United States and our democratic neighbors in the Americas. This school was created in 1946 with the best of intentions--to train Latin American military officers in combat and conterinsurgency skills, with the goal of professionalizing Latin American armies and strengthening the new democracies in our hemisphere. Its curriculum has included some history and math and science and foreign languages, to be sure. But this school has replaced the traditional three Rs with the three As--arrest, abduction, and assassination. Because many of its graduates have excelled at the three As, the school has earned the nickname the `School of the Assassins.' Others call it the `School of Dictators.' 
In 1991, following an internal investigation, the Pentagon removed certain SOA training manuals from circulation. On September 22, 1996, the Pentagon released the full text of those training manuals and acknowledged that some of those manuals provided instruction in techniques that, in the Pentagon's words, were `clearly objectionable and possibly illegal.' The techniques in question included torture, extortion, false arrest, and execution. And the students have learned these lessons very well. 
The school's alumni directory reads like a who's who of international criminals. Among its graduates are Manuel Noriega, at least 19 Salvadorean officers implicated by El Salvador's Truth Commission in the murder of six Jesuit priests, and officers who participated in the coup against former Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
Since I first came to the Senate in 1993, I have been contacted by hundreds of Wisconsin residents, including religious and school groups, who see the closure of this school as a moral imperative. The importance of removing the imprimatur of the United States from this school has been driven home many times during the listening sessions I hold in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties every year. I share my constituents' shock and disappointment that our government continues to operate a school with the miserable record of the School of the Americas. As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I am committed to promoting human rights throughout the world. We cannot do that by continuing to operate this school. 
I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of S. 980, legislation introduced by the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] to close this school. The movement to close the School of the Americas is not a new one. Over the past several years, there have been a number of votes on this issue in the House of Representatives. Many of our colleagues in the other body share my concern about this school. Last year, an amendment to close SOA was defeated by the narrowest of margins. It is clear that the momentum behind the bipartisan effort to close this school is growing, and I believe that SOA's days are numbered. 
While it may be appropriate under certain circumstances for the United States military to offer training to military forces from friendly nations, it is a mistake to conduct this training at the School of the Americas. I have no objection to training military officers from Latin America, but to continue to do so at this school places all future training under a sinister shadow of doubt. This school's reputation has been irrevocably tainted by the blood of the victims of its graduates. In order to remove any suggestion of responsibility for the deaths of these innocent people from the United States, and in order to lift the cloud of suspicion over American military training, we must separate the legitimate training exercises conducted by the United States military from the sordid acts most notorious graduates of SOA. The only way to do that is to close the School of the Americas once and for all.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, and am pleased that the Senate is poised to ratify it today. 
This convention seeks to establish worldwide standards for the criminalization of the bribery of foreign officials to influence or retain business. That this treaty has overwhelming bipartisan support is not surprising. But that we have this treaty to consider at all is a rather exceptional event. 
For it was just over 20 years ago that the Congress passed the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA. This landmark legislation, which I am proud to say was sponsored by one of Wisconsin's most respected elected officials, Senator William Proxmire, was enacted after it was discovered that some American companies were keeping slush funds for making questionable and/or illegal payments to foreign officials to help land business deals. 
For these 20 years, the FCPA has succeeded at curbing U.S. corporate bribery of foreign officials by establishing extensive bookkeeping requirements to ensure transparency and by criminalizing the bribery of foreign officials. 
These very important principles do not simply reflect an American sense of morality and fair play in business. They also strengthen America's trade policy, foster faith in American democracy, and protect our interests in requiring an open environment for U.S. investment. 
Certainly, these are principles and guidelines in everyone's best interest, and as such, well worth promoting worldwide. 
Yet there has been a price for taking the ethical high road. U.S. companies that are trying to pursue opportunities in the global marketplace are forced to compete with firms from countries whose national laws take a more--shall we say--`laissez-faire' approach to this issue, and turn a blind eye to the corruption and graft evident in many business transactions. Some countries--Germany is the most-often cited example--even allow companies to take a tax deduction for bribes paid to foreign officials as a business expense. 
I call such practices corporate welfare of the worst kind! 
These laws and practices by our closest trading partners clearly put our businesses at a disadvantage. I have heard from more than one Wisconsin company about international contracts lost as a result of some non-American company paying a bribe to a foreign official. These lost contracts represent lost employment and revenue opportunities for my state, and I am sure for many other states. A 1997 report by the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee estimates that in a single year, U.S. firms lost at least 50 international commercial contracts--valued at more than $15 billion--as a result of bribes by competitors. 
But with the signing of the OECD Convention last December, the rest of the industrialized world, along with several key lesser developed countries, is finally beginning to follow America's lead. What this convention does is initiate several significant steps to raise the standards of our major trading partners to the level established by the FCPA. 
Specifically, the convention obligates the parties to criminalize bribery of foreign public officials in all branches of government. Individuals who bribe public officials will be subject to `effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties,' and the parties agree to cooperate in investigations and proceedings related to such crimes. 
I have been keenly interested in anti-corruption efforts for many years. In 1994, I authored a provision to close a loophole in defense contracting by outlawing kickback payments in the conduct of offsets--an issue brought to my attention by a major Wisconsin corporation. I have raised the potential problem of corruption in taxpayer-supported export promotion programs to a Wisconsin State trade promotion commission, the Lucey Commission. 
In 1995, I introduced legislation that would have specifically barred the extension of U.S. export financing and trade promotion to U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations which have not adopted and enforced a company-wide anti-bribery code. I also introduced a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that bribery is indeed a morally reprehensible business practice and has destabilizing consequences for the international trade environment. Finally, I offered an amendment to the 1996 State Department authorization bill requiring an inter-agency study on bribery and corruption and the impact it has on American businesses. 
I believe the Administration's actions with respect to negotiation of this convention have been consistent with my intent in all of these efforts, as well as the intent of the authors of the 1988 amendments to the FCPA. I commend all the individuals involved for their efforts. 
In addition, I commend the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations for moving the Committee quickly to recommend ratification of this convention. 
I will highlight for my colleagues several provisions in the resolution of ratification. Section (c)(1) requires the President to submit to Congress an annual report that sets out various details regarding ratification, relevant domestic legislation of the parties, and enforcement. It also requires a description of the future work of the parties to expand the definition of `foreign public official.' In particular, the President will need to report on the steps taken by the Parties to specifically make illegal the bribery of foreign political parties or party officials and candidates for public office. This provision reflects the strong views of the Committee on Foreign Relations that the pernicious practice of bribery also pervades the political world, and it too must be stopped. 
Finally, Section (c)(1)(F) requires the President to provide a description of U.S. efforts to encourage other non-OECD members to sign, ratify, implement, and enforce the treaty. This provision, which I encouraged the Committee to include, is important because it recognizes that while most major international companies are based in OECD members states--the major industrialized nations of the world--it is vitally important to include less developed countries in an undertaking of this nature. As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright noted at the December 1997 signing ceremony for the Convention, `supplier nations have a special responsibility to stop this destructive practice. * * * At the same time, * * * it is vital that nations in the developing world meet their responsibility to act.' As noted in the Committee report, we expect the Executive to work through bilateral and multilateral fora to encourage other non-OECD members to join this effort by ratifying the treaty and implementing its provisions. 
I think those of us that are members of the Foreign Relations Committee can help in this effort. For example, at the most recent hearing of the Subcommittee on Africa to consider ambassadorial nominations, I asked a panel of seven nominees to provide their views on the effectiveness of the efforts of their respective, prospective host countries' governments to combat corruption, and asked them to comment on how they might work individually with these governments to become more active in dealing with this issue at a multilateral level. These nominees provided quite thoughtful responses, and I certainly encourage all of our ambassadors to pursue similar goals in their respective countries. 
Mr. President, in sum, I believe this is a vitally important treaty, and I am thrilled that the Senate has moved so quickly to ratify it. As a direct descendent of Senator Proxmire's Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, it represents the best of a long Wisconsin tradition of good government and ethics, and I am proud to have been a part of the Senate's ratification of this effort.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the Hutchison amendment, No. 3413, to the DOD appropriations bill concerning Bosnia. 
I want to very sincerely commend the Senator from Texas for all the hard work she continues to devote to this important issue and for trying to craft a compromise that would be acceptable to a majority of our colleagues regarding the United States' ongoing presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
As my friend from Texas has already explained, this amendment mandates a withdrawal of U.S. forces participating in the NATO Stabilization Force, or S-FOR, requiring that that force, or any future multi-national successor force, shall not exceed 6,500 troops by February 2, 1999, and 5,000 troops by October 1, 1999. The amendment enforces these levels by tying any appropriated funds for the Bosnia mission to this troop reduction. 
This amendment represents something less than a funding cut-off for the mission, although that is a policy I have pursued in the past. 
Rather, it suggests a slow and careful drawdown of U.S. forces in the region. In fact, it allows for troops to stay there past October of next year! 
Mr. President, this is July 30. This is exactly 1 month after the date that we were supposed to be out of Bosnia in the first place. That isn't even accurate, because really we were supposed to be out of Bosnia in the first place, according to the promises that were made by both parties, by December 30, 1996. So we are way beyond that date. 
Our troops have been there since 1995--much longer than the original 1-year mandate, and already longer than the expanded 18-month mandate for S-FOR--and I do not think anyone has a good idea how many more years we will be there. 
More significantly, the cost of our involvement in Bosnia has increased dramatically--easily more than quadrupling the original $2 billion estimate to over $9 billion. 
The estimate is that it is now well over $9 billion for this commitment that has already been spent or obligated. 
Mr. President, I regret that the managers of this bill earlier today agreed to a provision that would allow $1.8 billion in additional funds for the Bosnia mission to be added to this bill with an emergency designation. 
Mr. President, the mission in Bosnia has clearly ceased to be an emergency, and this amendment even recognizes that fact. 
The fact that the emergency designation was inserted into the bill this morning unfortunately highlights the fact that we in Congress continue to be lax in establishing some kind of accountability for our continued operation in Bosnia, and particularly for the taxpayer dollars that are needed to support that operation, soon to approach the astounding figure of $10 billion. 
I recognize that my continued opposition to the mission in Bosnia is not shared by everyone in Congress. But I think all of us would agree that the Congress has a constitutional responsibility to provide a check on the manner in which the executive branch spends money. 
This is the way the President spends an annual budget request to the Congress with his plans for the following year's spending. From time to time there are emergencies that can not be foreseen, and we deal with those accordingly as emergencies. 
But let me repeat again, U.S. involvement in Bosnia has ceased to be an emergency. 
Rather, our presence in Bosnia has clearly become a substantial, long-term commitment. It is something the United States has, for better or worse, decided to do for the long-term. And we need to evaluate this operation on its merits accordingly, and not pretend that it is an appropriate occasion for an emergency designation. 
The amendment by the Senator from Texas can at least put some real pressure on the administration to develop plans for a reduction in troop levels in Bosnia. The amendment also would have a positive budgetary impact, because we would need fewer resources to support a smaller troop presence. 
Mr. President, with or without this amendment, I think we all recognize that there will be troops in Bosnia next year. 
So, this is not an emergency, and I think the Congress has a responsibility to face that fact and deal with it accordingly. 
I hope, therefore, that those of my colleagues who do support the mission in Bosnia will cease to resort to maneuvers regarding the funding of this mission that seek to avoid our budget spending caps! This has been going on far too long, and has eaten up too many of our resources--human, financial and otherwise. We cannot continue with this budgetary game. 
Mr. President, I am pleased once again to join the junior Senator from Texas in trying to assert some kind of accountability for this mission. I urge my colleagues to support her amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to the fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense appropriations bill. 
Once again, we have loaded up this bill with unnecessary, extravagant, and flat-out wasteful items. In a time when we are cutting programs and fighting for a true balanced budget, we cannot afford to insulate any department from scrutiny as we seek to reduce the Federal debt. Unfortunately, the DoD budget remains immune to any and all attempts at responsible spending. 
Mr. President, I offered an amendment to this bill that aimed to invest fully in the best bargain in the Defense Department. According to a National Guard study, the average cost to train and equip an active duty soldier is $73,000 per year, while it costs $17,000 per year to train and equip a National Guard soldier. The cost of maintaining Army National Guard units is just 23 percent of the cost of maintaining Active Army units. 
It failed, however, but that should not come as a surprise. DoD and a complicit Congress have never been known as a frugal or practical when it comes to defense spending. From $436 hammers to $640 toilet seats to $2 billion bombers that don't work and the department doesn't seem to want to use, we have a storied history of wasting our tax dollars. I presented an opportunity to spend defense dollars on something that works and is worthwhile, but the lobby for the wasteful and unnecessary Super Hornet prevailed. 
Speaking of which, the bill appropriates $2.9 billion for the procurement of 30 Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornets. 
The current Hornet program has been proven reliable and cost-effective. Why do we want to replace the Hornet with a bloated, cost-prohibitive aircraft that offers marginal benefits over a reliable fighter? 
This bill also contradicts the House's overwhelming recommendation on Super Hornet procurement. Twice, once in their authorization bill and again in their appropriations bill, the House, by margins of nearly 300 members, voted to procure 27 Super Hornets in fiscal year 1999. 
The House correctly notes that the Navy asks for an inexplicable procurement increase from fiscal year 1998; that the Navy's low rate initial production schedule is not consistent with its procurement objective of 548 aircraft; and that the wing drop problem has not been resolved. 
Mr. President, it seems we have thrown rationality out the window when it comes to this plane. Judging by the Super Hornet's past performance, I'm sure we'll be hearing more about it soon. 
Finally, Mr. President, authors of the bill have again loaded it up with projects and hundreds of millions of dollars the Pentagon didn't even ask for. Just to give my colleagues a taste of these extravagant morsels, the bill adds: $78.5 million for 8 additional UH-60 helicopters; $30.0 million for JAVELIN anti-tank missiles; $208.3 million for Marine Corps procurement priorities; $50 million for advance procurement of the LHD-8 amphibious ship, which is a program DoD didn't even want to fund next year; $65.7 million for Humvee vehicles; $90 million for C-135 aircraft; and $40 million for F-15 Eagles. 
Further, there is $1.8 billion in additional funds for the deployment of U.S. troops in Bosnia that are designated as `emergency' funds. The Bosnia mission is no longer an emergency. It is a long-term commitment for the United States military, and we should pay for it on budget. 
Mr. President, this is shameful. We have a duty to act responsibly with our constituents tax dollars. Instead of looking after our constituents, we continue to pick their pockets. 
We have to make smart choices, Mr. President. A truly balanced federal budget is in sight for the first time in three decades. But we are not going to be able to maintain a balanced budget, let alone start bringing down the federal debt, so long as we continue to commit to programs and force structures that are so blatantly unaffordable. We must continue to fight for further spending reductions until we achieve the most effective and cost efficient military which serves our national security interests. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment would allow the National Guard to almost fully fund its operation and maintenance, or O&M account, for the coming fiscal year. This year's Defense Department budget request left the National Guard with a $634 million budget shortfall, including a $450 million shortfall in the Guard's O&M account. This request fell on the heals of a $743 million shortfall for the current fiscal year. I think these shortfalls are wrongheaded and unacceptable. 
Fortunately, both Houses of Congress have acted more responsibly in funding the National Guard. Even with the improvements from both Houses, though, the Senate appropriations bill we are currently considering leaves the Guard's operation and maintenance account $225 million short. The House bill leaves an even greater gap of $317 million. My amendment would add $220 million to the National Guard's O&M account, leaving just a $5 million shortfall to that account. 
According to the National Guard, shortfalls in the operation and maintenance account compromise the Guard's readiness levels, capabilities, force structure, and end strength. Failing to fully support these vital areas will have a direct as well as indirect effect. The shortfall puts the Guard's personnel, schools, training, full-time support, and retention and recruitment at risk. Perhaps most importantly, however, I know firsthand that it is eroding the morale of our citizen-soldiers, as I have had the opportunity to visit some of the armories in Wisconsin and have heard this concern firsthand. 
With that in mind, 26 State adjutants general--a majority of the adjutants general in this country--have contacted my office to voice their support for this amendment. The leaders of the National Guard units in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wyoming, and my own home State of Wisconsin support my amendment. I would like to thank them for their dedication and support, and I hope we decide to heed their call for support of the National Guard. 
Mr. President, in spite of the National Guard's budget concerns, the administration continues to deliver insufficient budget requests given the National Guard's duties; yet, the administration increasingly calls on the Guard to handle some very wide-ranging tasks. These shortfalls have an increasingly greater effect given the National Guard's increased operations burden. This is as a result of new missions, increased deployments, and training requirements, including the missions in Bosnia, Iraq, Haiti, and Somalia. 
As I am sure my colleagues know by now, the Army National Guard represents a full 34 percent of total Army forces, including 55 percent of combat divisions and brigades, 46 percent of combat support, and 25 percent of combat service support; yet, the Guard only receives 9.5 percent of Army funds. 
To offer a comparison with the other Army components, the National Guard receives just 71 percent of requested funding, as opposed to the Active Army's 80 percent and Army Reserve's 81 percent. I think it is time we move toward giving the National Guard adequate and equal funding. This amendment almost achieves funding equity for the National Guard, and the National Guard is the Nation's only constitutionally mandated defense force. 
Not only have we failed to invest fully in the National Guard, we have failed to invest fully in the best bargain in the Defense Department. That should not come as a surprise, however. DOD has never been known as a frugal or practical department--from $436 hammers to $640 toilet seats to $2 billion bombers that don't work and the Department doesn't seem to want to use. The Department of Defense has a storied history of wasting our tax dollars. Here is an opportunity to spend defense dollars on something that actually works, that is worthwhile, and enjoys broad support on both sides of the aisle. 
In this regard, the National Guard fits the bill. According to a National Guard study, the average cost to train and equip an active duty soldier is $73,000 per year, while it costs only $17,000 per year to train and equip a National Guard soldier. The cost of maintaining Army National Guard units is just 23 percent of the cost of maintaining active Army units. It is time for the Pentagon to quit complaining about lack of funding and begin using their money a little more wisely and efficiently. 
Finally, my amendment doesn't terminate any program, nor does it create unsupported cuts to existing programs. This amendment merely follows the recommendation of the other Chamber. 
Early this year, the House overwhelmingly supported DOD authorization and appropriations bills that provide $2.6 billion to procure 27 Super Hornet aircraft. I think, and the General Accounting Office thinks, that is actually far too much money for a plane that provides only marginal benefits over the current, reliable Hornet. But it is better than the $2.8 billion for 30 Super Hornets that the bill contains. I think we should follow the prudent lead of our colleagues in the other body on this issue.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to quote the chairman of the House Military Procurement Subcommittee, Duncan Hunter. Speaking of the National Security Committee's Super Hornet procurement decision, Representative Hunter said, `We think it's a rational, responsible reduction, a balanced reduction.' 
Mr. President, it is time we prioritized this Nation's defense needs. The National Guard provides a wide range of services, from combat in foreign lands to support in local weather emergencies, all at a fraction of the cost of the Active Army. The National Guard needs and deserves our full support. And it is for that reason that I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me first of all say that the two Senators who have spoken in opposition to this amendment are not only very sincere in their support of the National Guard but they have demonstrated in committee a serious concern about increasing funding. And their efforts have gone a long way to make sure that we have less of a shortfall than was originally occurring. That is encouraging. However, as was admitted by those opposed to this amendment, we still have a $225 million shortfall in the O&M account at the National Guard. This is a serious shortfall. 
I am not suggesting that we remove this funding from vital areas, but this is about priorities within the defense budget. I think it is a pretty easy call. Although I would prefer that we not move forward with the Super Hornet airplane, what I am suggesting here is not a dramatic reduction in those planes. I am simply suggesting we take what has already been passed in the House; that is, instead of having 30 of the Super Hornets, we procure 27--3 fewer. For three fewer of these planes, we could fully fund the National Guard O&M account. 
This is not an attempt, as the Senator from Alaska, suggested, to seriously disrupt the production of the Super Hornet. Very candidly, Mr. President, I would prefer to do that, because the General Accounting Office has pointed out that the Super Hornet is not substantially better than the current plane. It is going to cost $17 billion more than the current plane. That is a huge amount of money. 
But that is not what this amendment does. All this amendment does is say let's adopt what the House did, which is have 27 Super Hornets instead of 30, and use the money that is saved to fully fund the National Guard, or virtually fully fund the National Guard O&M account. 
Mr. President, these shortfalls for the National Guard are serious. I have had the opportunity to visit armories in Oak Creek, WI, and Appleton, WI, and spend a fair amount of time speaking to the officers and the guardsmen and guardswomen who are trying so hard to do the job that they are expected to do, constituting 34 percent of our entire Army's sources and resources. They are having morale problems. Otherwise, why would 26 adjutant generals in this country write in support of this amendment? They are very concerned. 
Mr. President, my amendment is simply about priorities. It is a modest reduction in the number of these Super Hornets that are going to be procured, and in return for something that is far more vital at this point. 
And that is fully funding the O&M account for the National Guard. 
Mr. President, in light of the fact there will be a motion to table at some point, I strongly urge my colleagues to put these modest resources in the National Guard, which supports our Army and which exists in our communities in every one of our States, rather than three more airplanes that, frankly, have not been proven to be substantially better than the current plane that has done a good job in the Gulf war and other situations. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Missouri states that my amendment is a `reckless assault' on the Navy's Super Hornet program. This could not be further from the truth. 
My amendment to increase funding for the National Guard is simply that; an amendment to correct most of a dangerous shortfall in funding for the National Guard's operations and maintenance account. To raise as little controversy as possible in finding an offset to the funding increase, I chose a provision already agreed to by the other chamber. Not only did the House agree to funding procurement of 27 Super Hornets in FY99, the body authorized funding for the identical amount. 
In speaking to the reduction, Chairman of the House Military Procurement subcommittee, Duncan Hunter said, `We think it's a rational, responsible reduction, a balanced reduction.' Does this mean Chairman Hunter is recklessly assaulting the Super Hornet program? Is Chairman Hunter diminishing the value of the Navy's aviation fleet? Is Chairman Hunter questioning the value of the Super Hornet? I don't think Chairman Hunter was, or ever will be, accused of any of those things. That's why, Mr. President, it boggles my mind why I now stand accused of all those things. It's a plain mischaracterization of my amendment. 
This amendment is not about gutting the Super Hornet program. This amendment is not about pitting one service against another. This amendment is not about diminishing the Navy's aviation fleet. This amendment does not question the value of the Super Hornet. 
Mr. President, this amendment is about an adequate level of funding for the National Guard and priorities in our armed forces. This amendment is about giving priority to the National Guard's readiness levels, capabilities, force structure, and end strength. This amendment is about bringing the Guard's personnel, schools, training, full-time support, and retention and recruitment to adequate levels. This amendment, is about ending a slide in the morale of our citizen-soldiers. 
Finally, my friend from Missouri states that the National Guard Association of the United States does not support this amendment. I'm sure he made his case very forcefully to them. I counter by saying that the association does not oppose this amendment either. In fact, a majority of State Adjutants General, 26 of them so far, have contacted my office to add their names in support for my amendment. I hope my colleagues will draw their own conclusions from that figure. Indeed, I urge my colleagues to contact their State Adjutant General and ask them for their opinion of my amendment. 
I urge my colleagues to support the National Guard, as I do. I urge my colleagues to vote against tabling my amendment.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern regarding three provisions of the Biomaterials Access Assurance Act of 1998. Although I have broader concerns with the bill including federalism issues, consumer protection issues, and evidentiary issues, I would like clarification from one of the sponsors of the bill, Senator McCain, on three specific points. 
First, Section 7(a) the language reads that only `after entry of a final judgment in an action by the claimant against a manufacturer' can a claimant attempt to implead a biomaterials supplier. I am concerned that this could be interpreted to mean that the manufacturer must lose the underlying suit before the claimant may implead the supplier. Is this correct?

Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky. I already spoke at length on the floor against a very similar amendment in its other incarnation in the other House. Fortunately, that body did not keep this provision on the bill. 
What is happening here is the opposite of reform. It is the opposite of reform. This is an effort, plain and simple, to hamstring the agency that is charged with the very important responsibility of enforcing the Federal election law to which we all have to adhere--the Federal Election Commission. This effort has deadly serious consequences in terms of the independence of this Commission, and it has to be defeated. 
The effect of the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky would be to result in the firing of the Commission's general counsel. The amendment involves the Congress in the personnel decisions of the FEC, the agency that we have charged with overseeing the way we conduct our reelection campaigns. 
The Senator from Kentucky wants to get rid of a career civil servant who is simply trying to do his job to enforce the election laws. The current general counsel's institutional memory and knowledge is critically important now, because we are poised to confirm three new Commissioners, perhaps before the August recess. 
If we do that, Mr. President, the Commission will be at full strength for the first time in almost 3 years. It has been that long since all six slots on the Commission were filled. And right as that happens, if we adopt this amendment, we are going to throw the Commission into turmoil once again by getting rid of the general counsel and forcing this newly constituted Commission to come to agreement on someone else. That could take months and hamper the enforcement efforts of the Commission at a crucial time, a very interesting time, right after the 1998 elections. 
Mr. President, I want my colleagues to understand, as the Senator from Ohio has well stated, just how unprecedented this micromanaging of an agency's personnel decisions is. 
No other agency must reappoint or replace its top staff every 4 years--not one. According to the Congressional Research Service, there are three independent agencies where the general counsel is actually a political appointee, nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In each of these cases, the general counsel has direct statutory authority. 
But in every other independent agency, including the FEC, the general counsel is appointed by either the chairman or the entire body and serves at the pleasure of the appointing entity. That is what the law is now with respect to the FEC, and there is no reason to change it. 
In recent years, the FEC has undertaken a number of controversial actions in a very reasonable attempt to enforce the law that the Congress has written. Some of these cases have taken on very powerful political figures or groups--and they have done it on both sides of the aisle. And the crucial point is that the FEC itself has authorized all of these cases by a majority vote. If you don't like a case that the FEC has filed, you need to look to the Commission, not the general counsel. He is just trying to do his job as he sees fit. 
What we have here, Mr. President, is an effort to intimidate an agency. The proponents of this firing want to punish the FEC's general counsel for bringing forward recommendations to enforce the law, even though in all of the cases I have mentioned, a bipartisan majority of the commission has agreed with him. In every one of those cases a bipartisan group has agreed to take the action. 
Mr. President, I submit that we cannot let this happen. We need to let the professional staff of the FEC do its job. Surely the 3 to 3 party split on the Commission is enough to make sure that the Commission doesn't go off on some partisan vendetta. We must stop the partisan vendetta that this proposal represents. Protect the independence of the FEC and the nonpartisan nature of its staff by defeating the McConnell amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I'm pleased to cosponsor and rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio, Senator Glenn. And how fitting that Senator Glenn has taken the lead on this issue since he spent much of last year investigating the fundraising scandals of the 1996 election. I congratulate him on that work and on offering this very modest, but very important amendment today. 
Mr. President, as you know, I have spent a lot of time on this floor in this Congress debating the McCain-Feingold bill, and the issue of campaign finance reform. It has been a very difficult issue to make progress on. We have a strong bipartisan majority, including seven Senators from the Republican side of the aisle, in support of reform. A partisan minority continues to block our bill. 
But one area on which this entire body is united, Mr. President, is the need to enforce the laws that are already on the book. In fact, time after time when we debated the issue last fall and again early this spring, opponents of our bill raised that issue as a reason that they opposed McCain-Feingold. Why should we enact new laws, they said, when we can't even enforce the ones on the book? No less than eight Senators made some version of that argument in last fall's debate, right in the middle of the Thompson Committee hearings. More still raised it when we revisited campaign finance reform in February. 
In fact, given the arguments made by the opponents of the McCain-Feingold bill, I would hope this amendment would be adopted by 100-0 when we vote. Because all the amendment does is give the resources that the Federal Election Commission says it needs to carry out the duties that we have given it under the law. The very small amount of money that this amendment proposes to add to the FEC's appropriation--just 2.8 million dollars--will bring the FEC's funding up to its full budget request, which is the level that the House passed bill includes. 
This is a particularly good and important time to fully fund the FEC. The Rules Committee recently recommended approval of three new nominees to the Commission, and one reappointment. If the Senate follows that recommendation, the FEC will have a full complement of Commissioners for the first time since October 1995 when then Chairman Trevor Potter left the Commission. We therefore have a chance to have a fully functioning Commission prior to this year's elections. What better time to have a fully funded Commission as well. What better time to give the FEC the resources it says it needs to do its job right. 
The additional funding provided in this amendment will go directly to hiring new personnel to beef up the FEC's enforcement capacity. And there is no doubt at all that these additional investigative and legal staff are truly necessary. The FEC simply is not able to keep up with the workload as things now stand. In Fiscal Year 1997, it dismissed 133 cases as being too minor or too old to be worth pursuing. Through June of this year, three quarters of the way through this Fiscal Year, the FEC has already dismissed 144 cases. Now these are not frivolous cases, these are cases that staff has determined are worth pursuing. 
And here is the most disturbing statistic, Mr. President. In every year since the FEC adopted this practice of dropping cases that it can't get to the number of cases that are dropped because they are not that important has exceeded the number that are dropped because they are stale. Until this year. This year, nearly 60 percent of the cases dropped were high priority but stale. This is a very disturbing fact. The FEC is having a harder and harder time getting to the cases that it deems to be significant because of the rising caseload and inadequate resources. 
So, Mr. President, frankly, I can hardly imagine how one could argue against this amendment. The FEC is a very small agency, with a very small appropriation, and a very big job. Campaign spending by candidates continues to increase. Involvement in election activity by outside groups continues to expand. We simply cannot pretend that we want the laws to be enforced at election time and then ignore the FEC at budget time. 
There is nothing that undermines the public's faith in government more, Mr. President, than a feeling that the rules of the election game are being ignored. In a very real sense, Mr. President, this amendment gives us the chance to put our money where our mouth is. I hope we take it. 
Once again, I congratulate the senior Senator from Ohio for offering this amendment, and I urge its adoption.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the past, the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill has been the vehicle for proposals relating to an area of great concern to me; namely, growing numbers of executive branch political appointees, and I want to offer a few comments on this matter. 
I was pleased to introduce legislation early in this session to address this issue. That bill, S. 38, would cap the total number of political appointees at 2,000, and I am pleased to be joined in that effort by my good friend, the Senior Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain). Our proposal to cap the number of political appointees has been estimated by CBO to save $330 million over five years. 
Mr. President, our bill was based on the recommendations of a number of distinguished panels, including most recently, the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on the Presidential Appointment Process. The task force findings are only the latest in a long line of recommendations that we reduce the number of political appointees in the Executive Branch. For many years, the proposal has been included in CBO's annual publication, `Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options,' and it was one of the central recommendations of the National Commission on the Public Service, chaired by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker. 
Mr. President, our proposal is also consistent with the recommendations of the Vice President's National Performance Review, which called for reductions in the number of federal managers and supervisors, arguing that `over-control and micro management' not only `stifle the creativity of line managers and workers, they consume billions per year in salary, benefits, and administrative costs.' 
Those sentiments were also expressed in the 1989 report of the Volcker Commission, when it argued the growing number of presidential appointees may `actually undermine effective presidential control of the executive branch.' The Volcker Commission recommended limiting the number of political appointees to 2,000, as our legislation does. 
Mr. President, it is essential that any Administration be able to implement the policies that brought it into office in the first place. Government must be responsive to the priorities of the electorate. But as the Volcker Commission noted, the great increase in the number of political appointees in recent years has not made government more effective or more responsive to political leadership. 
Between 1980 and 1992, the ranks of political appointees grew 17 percent, over three times as fast as the total number of Executive Branch employees and looking back to 1960 their growth is even more dramatic. In his recently published book `Thickening Government: Federal Government and the Diffusion of Accountability,' author Paul Light reports a startling 430% increase in the number of political appointees and senior executives in Federal government between 1960 and 1992. 
In recommending a cap on political appointees, the Volcker Commission report noted that the large number of presidential appointees simply cannot be managed effectively by any President or White House. This lack of control is aggravated by the often competing political agendas and constituencies that some appointees might bring with them to their new positions. Altogether, the Commission argued that this lack of control and political focus `may actually dilute the President's ability to develop and enforce a coherent, coordinated program and to hold cabinet secretaries accountable.' 
The Volcker Commission also reported that the excessive number of appointees is a barrier to critical expertise, distancing the President and his principal assistants from the most experienced career officials. Though bureaucracies can certainly impede needed reforms, they can also be a source of unbiased analysis. Adding organizational layers of political appointees can restrict access to important resources, while doing nothing to reduce bureaucratic impediments. 
Author Paul Light says, `As this sediment has thickened over the decades, presidents have grown increasingly distant from the lines of government, and the front lines from them.' Light adds that `Presidential leadership, therefore, may reside in stripping government of the barriers to doing its job effectively. . .' 
Mr. President, the report of the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on the Presidential Appointment Process identified another problem aggravated by the mushrooming number of political appointees; namely, the increasingly lengthy process of filling these thousands of positions. As the Task Force reported, both President Bush and President Clinton were into their presidencies for many months before their leadership teams were fully in place. The Task Force noted that `on average, appointees in both administrations were confirmed more than eight months after the inauguration--one-sixth of an entire presidential term.' By contrast, the report noted that in the presidential transition of 1960, `Kennedy appointees were confirmed, on average, two and a half months after the inauguration.' 
In addition to leaving vacancies among key leadership positions in government, the appointment process delays can have a detrimental effect on potential appointees. The Twentieth Century Fund Task Force reported that appointees can `wait for months on end in a limbo of uncertainty and awkward transition from the private to the public sector.' 
Mr. President, there is little doubt that the large number of political appointments currently made aggravates a cumbersome process, even in the best of circumstances. The long delays and logjams created in filling these positions under the Bush and Clinton Administrations simply illustrates another reason why the number of positions should be cut back. 
Mr. President, let me also stress that the problem is not simply the initial filling of a political appointment, but keeping someone in that position over time. The General Accounting Office reviewed a portion of these positions for the period of 1981 to 1991, and found high levels of turnover--7 appointees in 10 years for one position--as well as delays, usually of months but sometimes years, in filling vacancies. 
Mr. President, I was pleased to see the Government Affairs Committee beginning to examine issues surrounding political appointees and the political appointment process. The issues of vacancy rate, turnover, delays in the appointment process, and of course the total number of appointees, all merit scrutiny by that Committee, and I would very much like to work with Chairman Thompson and the Committee in crafting a bipartisan response to the set of problems that have been identified in this area. 
I am also encouraged that the Administration is moving forward as well. The total number of appointees is down from last year, and down significantly from the levels seen in 1992. This is a healthy trend, and I very much hope it continues. 
Mr. President, because the Government Affairs Committee is examining a variety of issues surrounding the presidential appointment process, and with the modest improvements in the overall number of political appointees, I will not pursue an amendment to the Treasury-Postal Appropriations measure capping the number of political appointees. 
I will, however, continue to monitor the progress made both by the Government Affairs Committee and the Administration. This issue is important not only because of the potential to realize significant deficit reduction, but also because of the impact the appointees have on the day to day functioning of government. 
As we move forward to implement the NPR recommendations to reduce the number of government employees, streamline agencies, and make government more responsive, we should also right size the number of political appointees, ensuring a sufficient number to implement the policies of any Administration without burdening the Federal budget with unnecessary, possibly counterproductive political jobs.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the wake of the terrible crime committed in the Capitol last Friday, I want to take a moment to reflect on the courage exhibited by the Capitol Police force in the face of that attack at the heart of America's democracy. 
The Capitol Police have guarded the U.S. Congress since 1828, but their finest, yet most tragic, moment came on July 24, 1998, when two officers gave their lives to defend their fellow citizens, and our Capitol and all that it represents. 
Officer Jacob J. Chestnut and Detective John M. Gibson, like all the quiet heroes of the Capitol Police force and their colleagues across America, came to work each day, performing their duties with dedication and professionalism, prepared at any moment to lay down their lives so that others could be saved, and the security of the Capitol could be preserved. 
In a few terrifying minutes on the afternoon of July 24th, that moment came, as Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut gave their lives for ours, and for countless other people working and visiting here that day. As they bravely defended the Capitol, Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut showed the enormity of their courage, the depth of their character, and the fullness of their commitment to duty as Capitol Police officers. 
As Americans, we owe Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson a debt that can never be repaid. Instead, we can only offer our deepest sympathies to the families of these two brave officers, and pledge to honor their memories with the same enduring strength and vigilance with which they defended our lives. 
I also want to recognize the other Capitol Police officers involved in apprehending the gunman, rushing people in the building to safety, and conducting the subsequent investigation with such a high degree of professionalism. We commend their service in protecting our Capitol and reaffirm with confidence that under their watch the house of the people will stay open to all the people. 
Americans can take great pride in the heroism the Capitol Police displayed last Friday, and in the bravery they summon every day as they protect our nation's Capitol. To them I offer my thanks, and the thanks of my staff and the people of the State of Wisconsin, for their courageous work.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to express my concern about Section 342 of the Senate FY 99 Transportation Appropriations Bill. That section creates an exception in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act allowing helicopter landings by the general public on federally-designated wilderness and other protected lands within Alaska. 
Federal wilderness lands in Alaska are covered by two federal laws: the Wilderness Act of 1964 and the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, known as ANILCA. To describe the interaction of these statutes in more detail, Mr. President, the Wilderness Act establishes a federal definition of wilderness, and governs the use and administration of land within the various states that have been designated by Congress as federal wilderness. ANILCA, which passed in 1980, is the statute which designated various lands within the state of Alaska as federal wilderness. It also conferred other federal land use designations, creating parks, monuments and other protected status lands in Alaska. 
The reason I am concerned about Section 342 of the bill before us is that it replaces the word `airplane' with `aircraft' within ANILCA. Though such a change would appear benign to those who do not know the statute well. However, that is not the case. The practical effect of the proposed amendment would be to permit helicopter landings by the general public in federal wilderness areas and other protected lands in Alaska. 
Why is this such a concern, Mr. President? There are two major reasons why I find this one-word switch troubling. First, expanding the type of aircraft allowed in federal wilderness areas violates the Wilderness Act and sets an alarming precedent. 
Section 1110 of ANILCA presently permits the general public use, on lands protected under the act, of `snow machines, motorboats, airplanes, and nonmotorized surface transportation methods for traditional activities.' Although airplane use is specifically permitted in Alaska under ANILCA, helicopter landings by the general public are prohibited in all federal wilderness. However, helicopter landings are permitted on a discretionary basis by the federal land management agencies for emergency situations. All public lands in Alaska allow helicopters to land for that purpose. 
I strongly support allowing helicopters in wilderness areas to rescue injured or lost visitors. And those uses are already allowed. However, I have concerns about allowing helicopter landings in wilderness for other than emergency reasons, for purely recreational purposes. 
In my home state of Wisconsin, people love the wilderness areas they visit such as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and the wilderness areas in the Nicolet and Chequamegon National Forests. The reason they love those places, Mr. President, is not only because they are among the most beautiful spots in the Upper Midwest, but also precisely because they are remote and are challenging to reach. National Parks are beautiful places. I support them, and I visit them with my family. However, National Parks, which have roads and restaurants and maintained campsites, are not the same as the lands protected under the Wilderness Act. National Parks are maintained for public access, wilderness areas by contrast, are areas where one can bring one's canoe and tent and hike in, or fly to in a float plane, as permitted today under ANILCA. By these means of transportation visitors can enter wilderness areas in a relatively low impact manner. 
Allowing helicopters into wilderness areas would mean managing lands, that according to the Wilderness Act are supposed to remain undisturbed by human access, in a contradictory manner. Imagine being in a remote spot surrounded by nature on a nice getaway and having a helicopter land right next to you to drop people off for an afternoon of wandering around? I believe we should not sacrifice the very reasons we have protected wilderness in an effort to increase access to the wilderness. If it's easy to get to, it's not a wilderness. 
Second, Congress and federal land management agencies have already considered the issue of helicopter use on wilderness lands in Alaska and have found it to be inappropriate and incompatible. The Forest Service has explicitly considered and rejected helicopters in Alaska's wilderness. In 1997, the Forest Service completed an EIS specifically addressing helicopter landings in more limited circumstances than the language in this bill. At that time, the proposal was to allow helicopters in areas other than specifically designated wildlife, cultural resource, and research areas. Section 342 would allow helicopters in all areas. 
The legislative history of ANILCA also specifically excluded helicopters from lands designated under that Act. The Senate Energy Committee considered special access to lands subject to ANILCA, and the Committee Report stated `the transportation modes covered by this section are float and ski planes, snowmachines, motor boats, and dogsleds.' 
Congress has already considered this issue, Mr. President, and we have found that helicopters for general public access do not have a place in Alaska's wilderness areas. I would urge that we not go back on this sound judgment. I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my good friend, the Senator from South Carolina, in offering this amendment to express the sense of the Senate regarding the Social Security trust fund balances. 
I could not agree more with the Senator from South Carolina and also the Senator from North Dakota that there really isn't anything more important than stopping this practice of using Social Security dollars for things they are not supposed to be used for, including premature tax cuts. That is the central budgeting issue in this country. The Senator from South Carolina has been the leader for years and years in making that point. I have greatly enjoyed working with him on this. We are going to continue to work on this until this practice is stopped, until this theft of Social Security funds is prevented. 
Mr. President, there is a fundamental difference between the way many in Congress approach the budget and the way the Senator from South Carolina and I approach it. That difference is Social Security. 
For 30 years, Presidents of both parties, and Congresses controlled by both parties, have included the Social Security trust fund balances in their budget calculations. As I had a chance to 
mention during the debate over the budget resolution itself, the result is a false picture of our country's fiscal health. And just like a false medical report that covers up a serious illness, it can lead to major problems in the future. 
This false budget picture has been used so often that, in effect, it has almost become a `budget convention.' It has so impressed itself into the vocabulary of the budget that we now hear this word `surplus' over and over again when there is no surplus. We hear people talking about a budget `surplus' in Congress, we see it in the newspapers, and we are even seeing it in letters from constituents who are, in effect, being misinformed into thinking that there is somehow a surplus at this time. 
Mr. President, the recent CBO estimates of our budget picture have made this matter all the more urgent. Using this budget sleight-of-hand known as the `unified budget,' some are pointing to significant surpluses as a justification for their own budget agenda, as the Senator from South Carolina has very eloquently outlined in his remarks. 
Mr. President, we have not achieved a budget surplus, and despite the greatly improved budget picture, CBO still estimates that we will not achieve anything indicating a true surplus until at least the year 2006. There is a deficit that is still being hidden, and Social Security is the curtain that is being used to hide it. 
For the current fiscal year, CBO expects the deficit to be roughly $41 billion. That is a great improvement over the $340 billion deficit we experienced in 1992. I am proud to have been a part of bringing that deficit down, but that is still a significant deficit. 
While the deficit picture improves slightly in the next few years, we still face a real problem on the budget deficit. It is true that if all of CBO's assumptions are borne out, we will barely achieve a balanced budget in 2002 and then again in the year 2005--just in those 2 years. And, of course, this is encouraging news. But it is hardly the kind of significant surplus on which to establish any major new initiatives, whether they be in the spending area or in the tax area. 
It is obvious that the economy may not perform as well as CBO expects, and the slightest change in the underlying assumptions could mean something very different from surpluses. It could mean deficits that are billions of dollars greater than are currently estimated. CBO itself makes this point in its current estimates. 
The report states, `* * * if any of a number of assumptions that CBO has made turn out to be off the mark, budget outcomes could be quite different than projected, even if there are no changes in policy.' 
Mr. President, the CBO projections also assume that Congress will be making the spending cuts necessary to comply with last year's balanced budget agreement. Mr. President, as is sometimes said in court, when it comes to assuming that Congress will do everything it should do with regard to making those spending cuts, CBO could be `assuming facts that are not in evidence.' 
Congress has not yet made those spending cuts, and the attitude that is being exhibited by some Members of Congress is not reassuring. We are already seeing a bidding war develop over how to spend the so-called surplus. It is a surplus that isn't even projected to really exist for another 8 years, Mr. President, but they are falling all over each other to figure out how to spend it before we finish the job. 
With so many focused on how to dispense this phantom surplus, there is an increasing risk that we will not actually finish the important work of truly balancing the budget. Mr. President, just a little over a year ago, a lot of our colleagues were saying it was the most important matter before us and urging us to amend the Constitution itself to ensure that outlays did not exceed receipts in any given year. Now, here we are, just a few months later, and many who supported this drastic step--and, as it turned out, unnecessary step--to amend our Constitution are now very ready to spend a surplus that we don't have. It could not be more inconsistent with what was at least said to be the spirit and the purpose of the balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, it has taken us several years and many tough votes to get where we are today, to get within reach, within vision of truly balancing the budget. It will take more tough votes to finish the job. Unfortunately, the notion of a so-called unified budget, which just began as a political convenience to mask the deficit almost 30 years ago, has now become budget reality for many, many people. This has to stop. 
`Surplus' is supposed to mean something extra like a bonus. What it is supposed to mean is that all the bills are paid and there is really money left over. But, Mr. President, as I noted during the budget resolution debate, one dictionary defines `surplus' as `something more than or in excess of what is needed or required.' But the so-called unified budget, the surplus is not `more than or in excess of what is needed or required.' 
Those funds are needed; they are needed to pay future Social Security benefits. They were raised by the Social Security system, specifically in anticipation of commitments to future Social Security beneficiaries. 
There is, however, one simple, straightforward step that this body can take to help Social Security and to protect the trust fund. It is very simple. Just do not spend it. Don't spend it. We have no right to spend it. 
I urge my colleagues to join the Senator from South Carolina and the other cosponsors of this amendment in passing this amendment and expressing the sense of the Senate that we understand this essential fact: That when Congress makes budget obligations today based on the Social Security funds, whether in the form of tax cuts or spending increases, we are committing to a fiscal path that jeopardizes future Social Security benefits. 
Mr. President, let me once again sincerely thank my friend from South Carolina for his tremendous leadership on this issue. It has been a pleasure to serve with him on the Budget Committee, and I deeply respect his work to promote not only deficit reduction, but honest budgeting as well. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today is prompted by the continuous rise in cable rates across this country over the past few years. You will remember when Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, we were promised that competition would bring lower cable rates for consumers. Well, it hasn't happened. In fact, rates have gone up--alot--in many communities around the country. 
About two-thirds of the households in this country now rely on cable for their television programming. More and more, cable is part of the monthly budget for the average consumer. It is not a frill or a luxury. We rely on cable for information and for entertainment. And instead of the cost going down because so many people now use the service, the cost just keeps rising. 
In my home state of Wisconsin, the cable company in the Madison area raised its rates by 9% in June. That's on top of a 7% increase just a year ago, and an 18.8% increase in 1996. According to the Federal Communications Commission, average cable rates across the country rose 8.5% from July 1996 to July 1997, three to four times faster than the rate of inflation. 
Now, Mr. President, I voted against the Telecommunications Act in part because I was concerned that it would not really promote competition in the cable industry. And look what has happened. The top two cable companies now have over 50% of the market in this country, and the top four cable companies have over 60% of the market. 
And the biggest problem, of course, is that despite the promises of those who promoted the new telecommunications law, there is no competition at all in the vast majority of cable markets. In all but a handful of communities in this country, consumers still have no choice in buying cable service. Alternatives to cable, such as satellite services, are not readily available to most consumers, or they are too expensive to offer much competition. The number of areas where consumers have a choice between cable operators is very small indeed. Only five million homes out of the 94 million that are capable of receiving cable programming can now choose between two cable operators. 
Now here's a shocking statistic from the FCC's most recent annual study of competition in the video programming market: Cable rates have gone up more slowly in areas where there is competition! 
Mr. President, in a truly competitive market, the cable companies would try to keep their rates as low as possible to retain their customers. Companies could charge higher rates based on new investment in facilities or programming only if they could convince their customers to accept those increases rather than take their business elsewhere to a competitor in the same town. 
Just think about it. You get a notice that your cable bill or a bill for any other crucial service is going to go up significantly. What is the first thing you would do? The first thing you would do in a competitive situation is check out the competitor's rate, of course. But without competition, cable companies are able to increase rates with very little fear of losing their customers. Most people will endure a pretty big increase before they decide to give up their cable service. But even a minor increase might prompt a call to the competitor down the street, if only such a competitor actually existed. 
The FCC has made it very clear that notwithstanding the fact that its authority to regulate cable rates does not expire until March 1999, it does not intend to take any action this year to hold down cable rates. I am concerned that when the power expires next year we will see even greater rate increases than we have seen since the Act passed in 1996. And those have already been dramatic increases. 
Earlier this year, I wrote to the Chairman of the FCC, asking him to give serious consideration to a request that had been filed by Consumers Union to freeze cable rates until the FCC could investigate the reasons for the recent increases and also determine whether current cable TV rates are reasonable. 
In response, FCC's Chairman William Kennard indicated that he believes a rate freeze would be unfair to cable companies that have acted responsibly, and that it would hurt small independent cable operators. With all due respect, I don't think this is an adequate response. The FCC has essentially said that it does not know why cable rates are going up. If that is the case, then it has no idea whether cable companies are acting responsibly or not. And it certainly is in no position to ensure that cable rates are reasonable for consumers. Furthermore, the Telecommunications Act has already deregulated the small operators who serve rural communities. So that is not particularly relevant or a justification for not examining what is happening with these cable companies. 
At the same time, Mr. Kennard told me that the FCC `continues to aggressively enforce its cable rate regulations to ensure that cable rates are reasonable under the law.' 
I'm not sure what the FCC means by aggressive enforcement, but I don't see it, and certainly consumers whose rates have risen at three times the rate of inflation are not seeing the aggressive enforcement either.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered is designed to tell the FCC that this situation is unacceptable. It makes findings to which I have alluded here--that cable rates are rising and there is no competition in the cable market--and asks the FCC to report back to us within 30 days as to whether it believes that these findings are consistent with the FCC having fulfilled its responsibilities under federal law to promote competition and ensure that cable rates are reasonable. 
I do not believe that the FCC will be able to tell us in the face of these findings that it has fulfilled its responsibilities. The amendment therefore requires that the FCC inform us of the steps it intends to take to ensure that those responsibilities are fulfilled. 
The Telecommunications Act was enacted in early 1996. For over two years, the American people have watched with alarm as cable rates have gone in exactly the wrong direction. It is time for the Congress to tell the FCC that is not what was supposed to happen, and that the Commission has to do something to change it. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment. It, of course, will not singlehandedly solve the problem, but it should move the Commission, and I hope cable rates, in the right direction.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the ranking member, the Senator from South Carolina, about the amendment. I simply want to point out that, in fact, this 30-day period is not 30 days from today that the FCC would have to complete this report, it is 30 days from the time of enactment of this bill, if the amendment were successful, and that is obviously some weeks, if not months, down the road, to the point where the President would actually sign it. 
All we are asking here is that a report be issued, not that actions be taken to change the cable rates during this period, but that the Commission actually give us a sense of whether they agree with the findings we have in this report or not and what they intend to do about the problem. I don't think that is an unreasonable request for a 30-day period, or even realistically what it is more likely to be, which is a 60-day to 90-day period. 
Just to illustrate why we are concerned, why we think it is 
appropriate that Congress agree to this amendment and make this statement, it is because, in fact, the studies the FCC is doing now I don't think are getting done in a timely manner to answer the questions that have to be answered. 
For example, Chairman Kennard recognized that there was a problem with regard to its annual assessment of competition in the video-programming market when he said in his statement: 
Less than 15 months away from the sunset of most cable rate regulation, it is clear that broad-based, widespread competition to the cable industry has not developed and is not imminent. 
He also noted that perhaps the Commission ought to do something to address the problem. He said: 
When confronted with allegations of price gouging, cable operators reflexively point to additional programming costs. The Commission's own rules and policies may be a source of this problem. We need to examine whether there are targeted adjustments that should be made to our rate rules. For example, our rules allow programming cost increases to be passed on to subscribers. But is this right? 
The Chairman went on to say that the FCC was going to look at the problem of programming costs, and that is the study that has been referred to. He said about this: 
I am therefore directing the Cable Services Bureau to commence a focused inquiry into programming costs to determine the sources of these increases, the variance in costs among various distributors, whether existing relationships impact the prices charged, and if programmers restrict consumer choice. This inquiry will require the cooperation and forthrightness of the industry. 
I don't know if the FCC got the cooperation of the industry. What I do know, and what is in response to the comments of the Senator from South Carolina, is that it is now July and there is still no report or result from that inquiry. 
I also know, as I have indicated before, that rates have continued to go up, with many increases taking effect at midyear. I also know that in May the Chairman told the world that the FCC was not going to take any further action to address rising cable rates. 
So, this amendment is not duplicative of what is going on at the FCC. It has a deadline and a requirement the FCC outline a specific action plan to address the problem of the lack of competition in the cable industry. 
Based upon the track record that I have just described with respect to the narrower issue that there was supposed to be a study on, it is not getting done. I think we need to follow up on previous congressional directives and have the entire Senate and the other body direct that a more specific study and plan of action result within the timeframe that this amendment calls for. 
Mr. President, I think this is a reasonable amendment. It is not too much to ask this agency to take a look at the dramatic increases, whether they are reasonable and what they intend to do about it. 
I urge my colleagues to back the amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I always enjoy debating with the Senator from South Carolina. I have to differ, though, with the characterization of the words that are in this amendment. It says: 
. . . the report shall include a statement of the actions to be undertaken by the Commission to fulfill the responsibilities. 
If the Commission determines it doesn't need to take any action, this doesn't require them to do anything. There is no mandate at all. We just want to know what they are planning to do. That is all this calls for, a statement of the actions to be undertaken by the Commission. 
There is simply nothing mandatory about that language at all. We are just asking for a statement of the ideas they have about what to do about the increases in cable rates, if anything. 
I differ with the Senator from South Carolina that there is no language in here that asks for anything other than a report as to what the Commission may plan to do in the future about the problem of cable rates. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment simply states what we all know to be true, and that is that cable rates across the country have risen steadily since the Telecommunications Act of 1996. And there is virtually no competition in the industry. The amendment instructs the FCC to report to us whether this situation is consistent with the FCC's responsibilities, which it still has until March of 1999, to make sure that cable TV rates are reasonable. If not, the amendment asks the FCC to give us an action plan; in other words, what is it going to do to carry out its duties? 
This is an amendment designed to hold the FCC accountable. We gave it a mission to promote competition and ensure that the rates are reasonable. The American people deserve to know why the agency has not succeeded. The amendment is supported by the Consumers Union and will be a signal whether this body is content to see cable rates rise as high as three to four times the rate of inflation, as has happened during the past year. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this simple amendment.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment aimed at preserving America's small farms. This amendment costs nothing and was inspired by a recommendation included in the January, 1998 publication of the National Commission on Small Farms. 
Mr. President, there is no question that America's small farms are struggling. Their struggle is detailed in `A Time to Act', the report issued by the National Commission on Small Farms, which outlines the crisis small farmers will face as they enter the next century. 
Mr. President, 94% of the farms in America are small farms, yet they receive only 41% of all farm receipts. Simply put 6% of our farms collect 59% of the receipts. Also, data shows that, on average, these farms actually earn a negative return on equity. Mr. President, many feel that one cause of the problem is that USDA does not emphasize the needs of small farms in its strategic plans, partly because Congress does not require that emphasis. References to small farms appear seldom in USDA policy and Congress is to blame. Lets use this opportunity to right a wrong and attempt to preserve small farms throughout the country. 
Mr. President, the Feingold amendment will turn the USDA's attention to the plight of the small farmer. This amendment directs the Secretary of Agriculture to establish an Office of the Small Farms Advocate within six months of enactment of the underlying bill. This office will be headed by an Administrator who will be appointed by the President and who will report directly to the Secretary of Agriculture. This office will be created without going outside current budget or personnel resources. The Office of the Small Farms Advocate will ensure that USDA and its programs work to meet the needs of today's small farmers. 
The Office of the Small Farms Advocate will accomplish this by: working with all USDA agencies to ensure that they consider the needs of small farmers; providing formal input on major programmatic and policy decisions by USDA agencies; developing a plan to enhance small farm program delivery at USDA; and being a constant advocate for small farms and small farm policies. 
Let me assure my colleagues that it is not my intention to create another layer of bureaucracy--it is my intention to coordinate USDA programs to meet small farmer needs and make the bureaucracy more responsive. 
Mr. President, this amendment will not increase USDA's authorized budget, but instead directs USDA to use its current financial and personnel resources. Finally, this amendment does not increase the number of political appointees within the Department of Agriculture. 
Mr. President, day after day, season after season, we are losing small farms at an alarming rate. In the United States, we have 300,000 less farms than we did in 1979. In 1980, there were 45,000 dairy farms in Wisconsin. In 1997, there are only 24,000 dairy farms. That is a loss of more than 3 dairy farms a day--every day for 18 years. And it does not begin to measure the human cost to families driven from the land. As small farms disappear, we are witnessing the emergence of larger agricultural operations. This trend toward fewer but larger dairy operations is mirrored in most states throughout the Nation. 
For many of the rural communities of Wisconsin, small family-owned farms are the key component of the community. They provide economic and social stability. The reduction in the number of small farms has hurt their neighbors as well and deprived the merchants on Main Street of many lifelong customers. We need a system in which small farms can be viable and the work of the producer can be fairly rewarded. 
Mr. President, many feel federal policy and federal investments focus almost solely on the needs of larger scale agricultural producers--neglecting the specific research needs of small producers. Small producers need more Federal research and extension activity devoted to the development of these alternatives. It is my hope that this new office at USDA will be committed to help develop and promote production and marketing systems that specifically address the needs of small farms. This bias has hamstrung small farmers, depriving them of the tools they need to adapt to changes in farming and the marketplace and accelerating the trend toward increased concentration. 
Mr. President, this country's small producers should not be forced to become larger in order to remain competitive. Bigger is not necessarily better. Maintaining the economic viability of small operations has benefits beyond those gained by farmers and the communities in which they reside; they can also provide environmental benefits. For example, as operations expand, manure storage and management practices become more costly and more burdensome for the operator and raise additional regulatory concerns associated with runoff and water quality among State and Federal regulators. Federal policy that helps small operators to remain competitive and profitable without dramatic expansion will help minimize these concerns. And in fact, M. President, expansion is often counterproductive for small operations, requiring them to take on even greater debt. Unfortunately, federal agriculture policy has put many producers in a situation where they must choose to expand their operations or throw in the towel. Farmers should not be forced into that position. We must provide the tools necessary for farmers to survive and prosper regardless of the size of their operation. 
We all congratulated the USDA when it convened the National Commission on Small Farms in July 1997. We applauded the appointment of farmers, ranchers, staff of nonprofit farm and farmworker advocacy organizations, Extension professionals, current and former public officials, and philanthropic foundation program staff. We all held up the final report as our signal to rural America that we were going to do something. M. President, we haven't done anything yet. The Commission important report and recommendation have fallen by the wayside. It would be a travesty if the U.S. Government spent taxpayer money on a worthwhile project such as this--then didn't act on those recommendations. This amendment is the first step in our commitment to not preserve a large sector of our agriculture community, and an important piece of America's heritage. 
I urge my colleagues to support this no-cost, pro-farmer amendment and yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, just briefly, my amendment accomplishes three things: It provides States some modest funding to promote one of the single most effective reforms we can make to improve the education of our children, and that is smaller class size; it eliminates a notorious piece of corporate welfare in the budget; and it reduces our budget deficit by $2.1 billion over the next 5 years. 
The amendment authorizes a limited number of innovative demonstration grant programs to assist States in their efforts to reduce public school class size and to improve learning in the earliest grades. 
My State of Wisconsin has been a leader in the effort to reduce public school class size, and this amendment is modeled after Wisconsin's successful pilot program, the so-called Student Achievement Guaranty in Education, or the SAGE Program. 
Mr. President, we have been very proud of this program. It has worked well, and I think a model for it on the national level would be extremely helpful. 
The amendment is fully offset by cuts in a wasteful and unnecessary Federal subsidy that benefits research and development for the world's largest aircraft manufacturer. We can fully fund this important SAGE Program and still reduce the Federal budget by more than $2.1 billion over 5 years if this amendment is adopted. 
As we near the end of the 105th Congress, I fear that Congress will somehow go home having done nothing to reduce public school class size. My amendment approaches this issue without expanding the deficit and it eliminates an expensive corporate subsidy. 
Briefly, passage of this amendment will save $2.2 billion by dealing with certain research efforts that have the explicit goal of maintaining the company's market share in the global aircraft market. 
For the information of my colleagues, this company has reported profits in excess of $5 billion over the last 5 years, and I don't think there is any justification for this kind of subsidy. It flies in the face of free-market economics and it wastes billions of our constituents' tax dollars. 
My distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Texas, in speaking out against this subsidy, said, `The market system is much more efficient at creating jobs and opportunities than the Government is.' 
So I urge my colleagues to take his heed and eliminate this form of corporate welfare. As I noted before, we would produce in our amendment a $2.1 billion net deficit reduction over the next 5 years. 
To some of us, we may sometimes feel we are belaboring the obvious, but I feel constrained to point out that we still do have a deficit in our Federal budget and that this amendment will be very helpful in that regard. 
I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and my friend, the senior Senator from Wisconsin, for deferring to me briefly so I could have the opportunity to speak about this amendment and offer it. In light of the understanding that the Senate wants to move forward on this bill, let me, in a moment, withdraw my amendment, but indicate I hope to offer it on another appropriations bill later this year. 
With that, Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment and yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator Nickles, Senator Kohl and Senator Mack in supporting this amendment to strike language raising the ceiling on mortgage limits insured by the Federal Housing Administration. 
Mr. President, the appropriations bill we are currently considering includes language that would raise the ceiling on the Federal Housing Administration's loan limit from the current level of 75% of the conforming loan limit--approximately $170,000--to 87% of the conforming loan limit, which is approximately $197,000. 
Mr. President, it is--quite frankly--astounding to me that Congress is considering action that would raise the FHA loan limit. In a time when Congress needs to be focusing on balancing the budget, it is truly ironic to me that some members seem to want to increase the burden to taxpayers by expanding a government program into an area already well-served by the private sector. In case you or any of our colleagues is wondering, a $197,000 loan translates to a house worth over $200,000. To afford such a house, a family would have to have annual earnings of over $75,000--an income level that only about 16% of American families are at. I don't know about you, Mr. President, but in Wisconsin, we don't consider folks who own $200,000 homes to be `needy.' These upper-income families are already well-served by the private market. 
Mr. President, the arguments against raising FHA loan limits are overwhelming: HUD's own FY 1999 Budget proposal predicts a 100% increase in the default rate for 1998--totaling $4 billion. The very same Committee Report seeking to raise the loan limits also acknowledges, and I quote, `concern[s] about HUD's capability to manage the FHA mortgage insurance programs and the potential exposure of the Federal Government if there is an economic downturn.' Since 1990, while the mortgage delinquency rate in the conventional market fell by 8%, the FHA delinquency rate rose by 23%. FHA backs 100% of every loan it insures, and so those delinquencies and defaults are borne 100% by taxpayers. It would seem to me, Mr. President, that those who seek to increase FHA's loan-limits are sending a strong message that they are willing to let American taxpayers pick-up the tab.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Responding to several constituent inquiries on this matter, I wanted to clarify with the Subcommittee Chairman and the Ranking Member of the purposes for which the funds contained in FY 1999 Department of Veteran's Affairs and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill for Section 319 of the Clean Water Act can be used. Is this Senator correct in his understanding, Mr. Chairman, that Phase I, II, and III projects, and lake water quality assessments which were previously done under the Section 314 Clean Lakes Program may be funded with the funds provided for Section 319 grants?

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join the National Taxpayers Union, the Friends of the Earth, Citizens Against Government Waste and other pro-consumer government watchdog groups in supporting Senator Bryan's amendment to terminate the Market Access Program. Throughout the years, this wasteful program has sometimes carelessly used taxpayer money to help those who can afford to help themselves--instead of this country's struggling small farmers. 
Mr. President, over the last ten years, the USDA has shelled out $1.4 billion for the Market Access Program (MAP), which is intended to promote U.S. products abroad. MAP has been roundly criticized for giving away millions of taxpayer dollars to agribusiness giants in the name of trade, but the program has managed some unusual feats, including scaring off foreign consumers. As we face the already challenging task of reducing the deficit and preserving Social Security, MAP is a program that the federal budget, and the taxpayer, can do without. 
I do not need to remind members of the millions of dollars wasted on MAP and the programs preceding it. In 1989, we had the Japan/California raisin fiasco. The California Raisin Board ran untranslated ads to promote their raisins in a market where raisins were rare. Baffled at the sight of these strange dancing blobs, many Japanese children were frightened. Mr. President, it's safe to say that if the California Raisin Board had done any market research, they would not have wasted $3 million on those commercials. They wouldn't have been so careless. 
MAP is the kind of program most taxpayers know little or nothing about, but we are paying dearly for it. Though the program has undergone some changes over the last nine years, it continues to dole out money to some of the largest agriculture companies in the country with funds that could instead be used to help small farmers. 
Some of the companies receiving MAP funds in fiscal year 1998 include Sunkist Growers and Blue Diamond Growers. Both are big companies that can afford to market their own products abroad without spending tax dollars. The list includes a host of other beneficiaries of MAP's 1998 $90 million dollar budget, including the California Pistachio Commission, the Mohair Council of America, Kentucky Distiller's Association and the Wine Institute. 
Mr. President, it is true that MAP was changed in the 1996 Farm bill to direct funds to cooperatives and trade associations instead of corporations, but a loophole still allows the companies that belong to those trade associations to continue to receive and spend taxpayer funds. 
Mr. President, I believe in supporting and strengthening America's position in foreign markets, but when we allocate precious tax dollars to be used toward that end, we must spend them on concrete efforts to get American products on to the shelves in those markets, instead of subsidizing advertising campaigns for major corporations. 
The USDA's own estimates put U.S. agricultural exports in 1998 down more than two billion dollars from the previous year. More than ever, Wisconsin farmers need the USDA to promote and place U.S. agricultural products in foreign markets through more successful export programs, not to line the pockets of big agribusiness and Madison Avenue. 
I urge support of the Bryan amendment and yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments to state my opposition to S. 2271, the Private Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998. 
First, Mr. President, on behalf of my constituents, I want to indicate my strong concerns about the manner in which this bill has come to the Senate floor, and indicate why I opposed cloture on the motion to proceed to this bill. If necessary, I will return to the floor to discuss my concerns about this legislation in greater detail. The Senate Judiciary Committee, upon which I serve, reported H.R. 1534, the Citizen's Access to Justice Act of 1997, with amendments. I voted against reporting that measure. 
In an effort to address concerns raised in Committee debate when the bill was reported, the Chairman and Senior Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) announced that he would work with Committee members to seek necessary improvements. The bill now before us embodies what the Chairman would have offered on the floor as a substitute amendment to H.R. 1534 as reported. Not only do I take exception to the result of this attempt to `improve' the bill but I am also alarmed at the speed with which this measure has been brought to the floor. The resulting bill number shuffle and procedural debate over whether or not the proponents would be offering a substitute amendment has left my constituents, on both sides of this issue, frustrated and confused. 
This extremely technical and complicated matter is of critical importance to a wide variety of interests in my state who have followed this legislation since the early days of this Congress. Thus, I had hoped to act with greater concern for those constituents interested in the outcome of this measure as we sought to move it to the floor. 
Procedurally, I am also concerned, Mr. President, that S. 2271 differs significantly from the legislation the Judiciary Committee reported. Members, for the first time, have heard about the substance of this bill through floor debate today. Given the potential impact of this legislation on both the federal government and local governments' financing and regulatory structures that we should have given members both a comprehensive written description of the changes contained in S. 2271 and additional opportunities to discuss this legislation with their constituents. 
I voted against this measure in Committee and oppose the bill currently before the Senate for a number of reasons. First, this bill will result in a increase in litigation over local zoning matters in federal courts. As a result of the Listening Sessions I hold in every Wisconsin county every year I have worked with constituents on a number of regulatory red tape issues. It is clear that the last thing Wisconsinites want or need is a bill that `takes' scarce resources away from local governments by exposing state and local officials in our state to threat of federal liability in their attempts to control local land use and follow federal law. 
As my colleagues have pointed out, this bill creates an opportunity for clever lawyers to profit at the expense of local ordinances to which we in the Judiciary Committee, and in this body, normally claim to defer. Certainly, this bill is not consistent with any claim of deference to state and local authority. It is an explicit transfer of power to the federal government. 
This bill purports to lessen the impact upon the prerogatives of local governments, but it continues to allow broad exceptions to the very abbreviation of local land use processes which the bill itself mandates, a process which can be now be the subject of federal litigation. 
As the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee (Mr. Leahy) has explained that S. 2271 lowers two threshold barriers to bringing takings claims against federal and local governments in federal courts. It does so by legislating both the circumstances under which courts can abstain from hearing a case and dictating when a claim may be heard by a federal court --known as `ripeness.' 
In the case of takings lawsuits against the federal government, a case is ripe for adjudication when, as the bill defines it, a federal agency has made a `final decision.' A `final decision' exists when an either an application or an appeal to use the property has been submitted but not been approved `within a reasonable time.' Similar language is incorporated to specify when suits can be brought against local governments, and that section is somewhat more deferential to local governments. The bill is more deferential to local land use regulatory bodies, unlike when a claim is brought against a federal agency, by arguably making it more likely that an initial application will be filed. 
Let me repeat that for colleagues, to make it clear. Under this legislation in certain circumstances an individual is able to sue the federal government for a taking without even submitting an application to a federal agency to determine whether the action they propose violates federal law. The bill says that the party seeking redress under this bill would not be required to submit an application or appeal if the district court holds that such actions would be futile. Futility is defined as the inability to seek or obtain approvals to use real property as defined under applicable land use or environmental law. I would point out that while futility is defined for actions in district courts, there is no definition of futility for the Court of Claims, though an individual making a claim against the federal government has the option under this legislation, which also concerns this Senator, to sue in either court. These provisions allow litigation not when a Constitutional right is deprived, that is when the government denies compensation for restricted use or condemnation of property, but rather when the use of the property itself has some conditions placed upon it. 
I would like my colleagues to think for a moment about what kind of anti-regulatory and anti-compliance actions the futility exemption in this legislation would encourage. Such language suggests that if one knew or might know, as an experienced developer, that a particular type of wetland filling activity would not be likely to be permitted under the Clean Water Act, then one would be free to claim that requesting a permit for such an activity would be futile and sue the federal government. 
Even if the government dismisses that case, as I am sure the bill's supporters argue it would, because there are no supporting facts and no application, under the language of this bill the court isn't allowed to abstain. Aren't we sending the wrong message, Mr. President? In Wisconsin, often my constituents are unaware when an action they have taken requires them to interact with a federal agency, and my office helps constituents in those circumstances. But this legislation explicitly provides that if know that an action is prohibited, you may sue to be compensated being denied the right to do it anyway. And for those who will argue that such suits won't happen, I'd reply by saying it's a genuine risk under this legislation. If an extreme suit against the government is successful, the federal government is obligated to pay the court costs of prevailing plaintiffs. 
These same provisions apply to suits against local governments, though courts can abstain if an initial application isn't filed and there is some discretion given about whether prevailing plaintiffs would have to be awarded court costs. I also want to make clear that this bill applies to local land use decisions because I believe there may be some Senators who are under the impression that this bill applies only to actions taken by federal agencies. 
However, this is not the case. S. 2271 contains additional provisions which limit local decision making, expanding upon similar provisions contained in the House-passed version of this legislation. For example it would require a land-use applicant to `take into account' any suggestions given by the land use agency which denied the application when reapplying before the applicant pursues federal litigation. This language is still unclear, and certainly local governments that will have their hands tied by this bill share this view. 
Second, I remain concerned that this bill applies to all forms of property. Proponents claim that it only applies to real property. It may indirectly expand of the definition of private property. This will undoubtedly lead to creative lawsuits and increased costs for the taxpayers. 
This bill allows vindication of `all interests constituting property rights, as defined by Federal or State law, protected under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.' I would remind my colleagues that `all interests constituting property' is a much broader category than real estate. Moreover, the bill creates the right of access to federal court for any actions taken by federal agencies as described in Section 6 that `infringe or take' 
the rights to `use and enjoy real property.' 
Starting down the road of extending litigation rights to all forms of property, and all uses of property may lead the federal government to protect interests we might otherwise not protect. 
Take for example contractual rights to receive water from the federal government. At present, there is no federal right to `receive' water except as provided by a contract, even though a supply of water clearly is related to the ability to produce crops on one's real property. The Bureau of Reclamation delivers water in 17 Western states, pursuant to contracts, for primarily agricultural purposes. Each year, it allocates water based upon supplies available in reservoirs and other storage facilities. Most contracts generally anticipate that delivered quantities may vary on an annual basis. 
During the drought of 1993, the Bureau of Reclamation reduced the quantities of water supplied to the Westlands Water District. It allocated a portion of the limited water available to protect fish in accordance with the requirements of the Endangered Species Act. When agricultural users received only 50 percent of their contract quantities, Westlands sued alleging that the liability limitations of the contract were invalid and that the agricultural users were guaranteed a fixed quantity of water at a fixed price. They contended that despite the liability limitations of the contract, the Bureau's water allocation decisions improperly deprived them of water and entitled them to compensation. 
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed Westlands' claim, sustaining the federal government's contract defense. This legislation would create an expedited procedure for bringing takings claims, and specifically provides for causes of action when `use' is restricted, thus potentially compromising the federal governments' argument in the Westlands case that the government was in compliance with the contract. In response to questions I submitted about last Congress's takings legislation, which had similar definitions of `use,' then Counselor to the Secretary of the Interior Joseph Sax wrote explicitly about the Administration's concerns with the potential for property rights legislation to create a new category of federal water law:  
Where Congress has recently restructured federal reclamation projects to direct more economically and environmentally sensitive management, as it has done for example in California's Central Valley Project,. . .[a]ny steps the Department of Interior takes to implement these congressionally ratified improvements would doubtless result in demands for compensation by affected interests if these bills became law. 
Other portions of the bill raise similar questions. For example, is it the intent of the language to suggest that any person taking an action that causes injury to a property right, but doesn't actually take the property, creates the right of access to federal courts? Even if that action is supported or mandated by a local or state ordinance or statute? How would one substantiate an action which damages the `right to enjoy' one's property? This is just another example of the kinds of problems this legislation poses. And what about the distinction the bill makes by including special reference to `real property' without defining that term? 
Wisconsin communities are deeply afraid of the litigation costs and general erosion of the notion of community that will be implicit in the answers to these questions. Mr. President, I have heard almost unprecedented levels of opposition to this legislation from local governments all over my state, from large cities like Milwaukee and Madison to small communities like the Village of Park Ridge near Stevens Point and Cudahy, Wisconsin. Individuals of every political affiliation oppose this legislation, and editorials opposing similar bills have appeared all over my state. 
To me, however, one of the best arguments against this legislation was sent to me by the former Mayor of New London, Wisconsin, Gregory Mathewson. After the H.R. 1534 passed the other body and was sent to the Senate Judiciary Committee former Mayor Mathewson wrote: 
Our fear with this legislation is that it tilts the current balance and increases the range of things a property owner has a right to do. Meaning that communities no longer have any clear authority to zone property or decide between conflicting interests on the basis of the best interests of the community as a whole. 
We often have homeowners who do not wish to see apartments of any type built near them, owners of large houses who do not want small houses built near them, and we routinely have to tell people that the City exists for all persons not a few, and that the poor, the non-land owning and others shall be welcome. 
We fear now that these decisions will involve us in continuous litigation in federal court, and all notions of community will be eroded as the questions and issues will be so generalized by the courts that local reasons, customs and planning will be irrelevant. 
I ask you to see that a balance is maintained, the community ought to have rights balances against individual rights. In its current form, H.R. 1534 appears to eliminate this balance. Everybody seeks out places to live which offer a high quality of life. It must be clear that there is no quality of life if someone can do anything they want with their property or sue over any perceived impact on their property. In either case, the individual controls the community and this is the operational definition of anarchy. 
Mr. President, Wisconsin communities respect property rights, and want to have well developed and well planned cities, towns, and villages. This legislation goes too far in seeking not just to clarify but to enhance the procedural rights of property owners to seek compensation under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution. In doing it would have unintended consequences that might undo the unique character of towns across America and within my home state. It is for this reason, and the others I have described, that I oppose this legislation. I urge other Senators to join me in seeking its defeat.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it is with great dismay that I wish to note the passing of Chief Moshood Abiola, the apparent winner of the 1993 presidential elections in Nigeria. Chief Abiola was apparently stricken by heart failure during a meeting with senior U.S. officials, including Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering and Assistant Secretary of State for Africa, Susan Rice, on July 7. In great ironic tragedy, the U.S. delegation was in Nigeria, in part, to push the new government of that country for the release of Abiola and dozens of other political prisoners. There was broad speculation that Abiola would have been released within days. 
Mr. President, Abiola's death comes during a tumultuous moment in Nigerian history, just one month after the death of military leader Gen. Sani Abacha. Gen. Abacha was by any definition an authoritarian leader of the worst sort. He routinely imprisoned individuals for expressing their political opinions and skimmed Nigeria's precious resources for his own gains. With the replacement of Abacha by the current military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, there has been reason to be optimistic about Nigeria's future. Although he has not yet moved to repeal the repressive decrees that place severe restrictions on the basic freedoms of Nigerians, Gen. Abubakar has taken some positive steps, including the release of several prominent political prisoners, and has indicated a willingness to move his country once and for all in the direction of democracy. But he had yet to deal with one of the more vexing issues related to such a transition, and that is the role that Chief Abiola would assume. 
News of Abiola's death has sent shock waves through the country. Since last night, there have been sporadic riots throughout the country, and particularly in Lagos, the center of Abiola's supporters. At least 19 people are known to have died in the ensuing violence. And, according to news reports, heavily armed police continue to patrol the streets. 
Abubakar is making efforts to calm the country. First, he has ordered, with the consent of the Abiola family, a complete autopsy, under the supervision of Abiola's own doctor, of the cause of death. This is extremely important in order to quell the rumors already circulating that the military injected Abiola with poison prior to his meeting with the American officials. Abubakar also today announced the dissolution of the Abacha-appointed Cabinet. These are, indeed, positive steps, but they are not enough. 
Earlier this session, I introduced the Nigerian Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act, S. 2102. The provisions of my bill include benchmarks defining what would constitute an open political process in Nigeria. Despite all the tumultuous events that have taken place in these past few weeks, I still believe these benchmarks are important, and I continue to call on Gen. Abubakar to implement as soon as possible these important changes, such as the repeal of the repressive decrees enacted under Abacha's rule, so that genuine reform can take place in Nigeria. 
Finally, in this time of great uncertainty in the country, I urge all Nigerians to exercise restraint. Let's wait to see what Abubakar chooses to do next. Let's wait to evaluate the results of the autopsy. Nigeria has suffered enough already. It would be a shame if Abiola's death were to lead the country into armed conflict. 
Let us hope this will not be the case.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor to lend my support to the amendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas. 
Senator Bumpers has led a long, and often lonely, battle against the International Space Station. Since I joined this body in 1993, I have supported his efforts to terminate the program on the basis of its extraordinary cost and its crushing burden on the Federal budget deficit. 
We now see that the space station is not only far more expensive than previous cost estimates, but also significantly behind schedule and losing the support of partner nations, including the Russians failing to keep its financial commitments. The reasons for terminating the space station are now more compelling than ever. Senator Bumpers has been prescient in his efforts to save our tax dollars on this wasteful program. 
In a May, 1998, report, the General Accounting Office stated that the new cost estimate for the space station had risen to almost $96 billion. And this extraordinary cost doesn't even include the cost of decommissioning and deorbiting the space station at the end of its useful life. This, in and of itself, will cost billions more. 
Even a NASA-appointed commission found that NASA's own cost estimates were vastly underestimated. The blue ribbon Cost Assessment and Validation Task Force recently reported that the cost of simply developing and building space station hardware will probably cost $24.7 billion. Just last year, NASA officials promised Congress that developing and building space station hardware would cost $17.4 billion. Mr. President, how in the world did cost estimates rocket up by 42 percent in the course of one year? 
The same blue ribbon panel also estimates it will take two years longer to assemble the space station than NASA now plans. The report pushes the completion of the space station back to early 2006. Let me remind my colleagues that in September, 1994, NASA said it would complete assembly of the space station by June, 2002. The schedule has slipped by four years, let me repeat, four years since 1994. Ironically, NASA recently announced a delay in launching the first piece of the space station by five months. According to the commission, each month of delay will add about $100 million to the final cost of the project. 
Finally, Mr. President, NASA enlisted the support of Russia as a means of fostering collaborative energy and as a means of defraying program cost. As we know, Russia is in the midst of economic instability and an unreliable space program, witness the problems with the Mir space station. 
NASA estimated that the American taxpayers would save $2 billion by working with the Russians on this new space station. That savings is already gone. On top of that, the Russian Space Agency doesn't even have the money to safely deorbit Mir. How, then, can we safely rely on Russia to fulfill its obligations for the International Space Station? 
Even our European partners in the European Space Agency are beginning to reconsider their commitment to the International Space Station. French Space Minister Claude Allegre said of the International Space Station project, `People often do stupid things. There is no reason we should applaud them.' 
Fortunately, Congressional leaders are growing skeptical of NASA's plans. Last month, the chairman and ranking member of the House Science Committee wrote the President asking for a plan for controlling cost growth and delays on the space station. Given the Administration's reluctance to offer such a plan and NASA's resistance to cutting back the program, I don't see how we can support putting good money after bad. 
Mr. President, it is time to end this program.

Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will give some relief to the taxpayers of this country, who now pay millions every year to cover the storage costs of cotton farmers. This year alone, this program has provided more than $23 million to store the cotton crop of participating farmers. This measure puts all commodities on a more equal footing by eliminating the storage subsidy for cotton, the only commodity that still enjoys that privilege. 
Mr. President, prior to the passage of the 1996 Freedom to Farm bill, farmers producing wheat and feed grains relied heavily on the Farmer Owned Reserve Program to assist them in repaying their overdue loans when times were tough. They would roll their non-recourse loans into the Farmer Owned Reserve Program which would allow them the opportunity to pay back their loan, without interest, and also get assistance in paying storage costs. Although cotton producers were not eligible to participate in that particular program, they were offered the same opportunities and others through the heavily subsidized cotton program. Those were the days of heavy agriculture subsidization, when the government dictated prices, provided price supports, and more often than not, had over-surpluses of wheat, corn and other feed grains--driving down domestic prices. The 1996 Farm Bill, sought to bring farm policy up to date with prevailing modern agricultural thought--that the agriculture industry must be more market oriented--must survive with minimal government price interference. 
Mr. President, although the Farm Bill was successful in ridding agriculture policy of much of the weight of government intrusion that burdened it for years, there are still hidden subsidies costing taxpayers billions. This legislation would prevent USDA from factoring cotton industry storage costs into Marketing Loan Program calculations. This costly and unnecessary benefit is bestowed on no other commodity. 
Farmers, except those who produce cotton, are required to pay storage cost through the maturity date of their support loans. Producers must prepay or arrange to pay storage costs through the loan maturity date or USDA reduces the amount of the loan by deducting the amount necessary for prepaid storage. Cotton producers are not required to prepay storage costs. When they redeem a loan under marketing loan provisions or forfeit collateral, USDA pays the cost of accrued storage. 
It is interesting to note, Mr. President, that in a 1994 audit of the cotton program, USDA's Office of Inspector General found no reason for USDA to pay for the accrued storage costs of cotton producers. The Inspector General recommended that USDA `revise procedures to eliminate the automatic payment of cotton storage charges by CCC and make provisions consistent with the treatment of storage charges on other program crops'. 
Although those in the cotton industry will argue that the automatic payments were eliminated in the Farm Bill, in reality, those payments are now simply hidden. It's true that certain provisions have been removed from the statute which mandates that USDA pay these charges. Now, USDA freely chooses to waste the taxpayers money by paying these costs, allowing cotton producers to subtract their storage costs from the market value of their cotton, providing a larger difference with the loan rate, and therefore receiving a higher return. 
Marketing Loan Programs are designed to encourage producers to redeem their loans and market their crops, but USDA payment of cotton storage costs discourage loan redemption. As long as the adjusted world price is at or below the loan rate, producers can delay loan redemption in the secure expectation that domestic prices will rise or the adjusted world price will decline regardless of accruing storage costs. 
Mr. President, its time to stop kidding ourselves. Let's eliminate this subsidy before it costs hardworking Americans any more. Let's bring equity to the commodities program. Lets finish what the Farm Bill started--a more market oriented agriculture program. One that benefits us all.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the first observance of International Day in Support of Torture Victims and Survivors. This day, which was designated last year by the United Nations General Assembly, serves as a reminder to all of us that, sadly, at this very moment, somewhere in the world a prisoner is being beaten, a woman is being raped, or a child is witnessing the torture or murder of a loved one at the hands of a hostile force. 
Along with guns and bombs, torture unfortunately has become just another weapon in the arsenal of war. In generations past, we like to believe that wars were fought between combatants according to an unwritten code. In some conflicts of the past, fighting was suspended after dark and during the winter months so as not to give one side an advantage over the other. But the rules of contemporary wars are much less clear. Combatants fight, not merely against each other, but against civilians, including women and children, on the opposing side. War is no longer just a means to acquire territory or settle long-running disputes, but often it is used as a means to attempt to obliterate entire ethnic or religious groups. 
In this past decade alone, the world has been witness to inconceivable acts of horror committed against specific populations in such places as Rwanda, Sudan, Iraq, the former Yugoslavia, and Kosovo. The terms `ethnic cleansing' and `genocide' have become all too common in describing events around the world. And the stories of those torture victims who live to tell of their experiences continue to shock and horrify the international community. 
Earlier this month, during the National Day of Action for Tibet rally which took place on the Capitol steps, I was privileged to hear the comments of Palden Gyatso, a Buddhist monk who was imprisoned for 33 years by the Chinese force which unlawfully occupies his homeland. He told of unspeakable acts of torture that are routinely committed against the Tibetan people by the Chinese military. The myriad forms of torture he was forced to endure included being hung upside down while his naked body was repeatedly stung with an electric cattle prod and having boiling water poured over his body. That he was able to survive this brutal treatment is a testament to his faith, which his captors attempted to squelch through these and other inhuman acts. 
But for every person like Palden Gyatso, who somehow managed to survive such brutal treatment, there are countless others, whose names we may never know, who did not. These people endured their fate with a quiet courage that inspires hundreds of thousands worldwide to fight against the practice of torture as a weapon of war. 
I find it particularly ironic that the President is spending the first International Day in Support of Torture Victims and Survivors in the People's Republic of China as the guest of a government that has sanctioned the torture of its own citizens. I hope the President will mark this day by calling on Chinese leaders to open a meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama regarding Tibet and to gain assurances that the basic human rights of all Chinese citizens will become a top priority. 
Since coming to the Senate in 1993, I have been contacted by numerous Wisconsin residents who share the concern of the international community about the prevalence of torture in our world. As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I will continue to speak out against such reprehensible acts at every available opportunity. I look forward to the day when the use of torture as a weapon of war is consigned to history books instead of daily news reports from around the world.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the distinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee has agreed to cosponsor my Child Exploitation Sentencing Enhancement Amendment and add it to the authorization bill for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). 
As we all know, miraculous advances in computer technology have opened new worlds to citizens all across this country. It's an exciting future. But it is also a future filled with risk for vulnerable children because some in our country have chosen to exploit the new technologies to commit crimes. According to the NCMEC, criminals are increasingly using computer telecommunications technology as a means to assist in the sexual victimization of young children and teenagers. 
To combat this growing problem of the use of computers and the Internet to sexually exploit and abuse children, I introduced the Child Exploitation Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1997 last June. The amendment adopted by the Senate today incorporates that bill--S. 900--which was also co-sponsored by my friend from Ohio, Senator DeWine. 
Mr. President, the same marvelous advances in computer and telecommunications technology that allow our children to reach out to new sources of knowledge and cultural experiences are also leaving them unwittingly vulnerable to exploitation and harm by pedophiles and other sexual predators in ways never before possible. Advances in technology should not be the shield from behind which pedophiles and sexual molesters target and prey upon our children. When new technologies are used to further the criminal sexual exploitation and abuse of children, it is essential, that this conduct be punished severely. 
This amendment directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase criminal penalties for people who use a computer to entice children into illicit sexual conduct. The amendment also directs that sentences be increased for those criminals who seek out children on the Internet and misrepresent their true identity in a knowing effort to gain the trust of the child they intend to victimize sexually. 
The provisions in this amendment are directed squarely at those molesters and sexual predators who go on-line and use computer chat rooms to target young victims. One distinct advantage of the Internet for criminals is that they are able to reach a much wider audience of potential victims than they would if they had to be physically present at a schoolyard or playground. Another advantage for cyber-criminals is that they have near fool-proof anonymity while they cruise the Internet looking for victims. In some cases, victims are enticed or lured to meet with the sexual molester. The opportunites for the criminal to misrepresent his true identity and thus gain the confidence of the victim is a significant aspect of these crimes. Director Freeh noted this problem last year in testimony before an appropriations subcommittee. He said:  
Pedophiles often seek out young children by either participating in or monitoring activities in chat rooms that are provided by commercial on-line services for teenagers and preteens to converse with each other. These chat rooms also provide pedophiles an anonymous means of establishing relationships with children. Using a chat room, a child can converse for hours with unknown individuals, often without the knowledge or approval of their parents. There is no easy way for the child to know if the person he or she is talking with is, in fact, another 14-year-old, or is a 40-year-old sexual predator masquerading as a peer. 
Director Freeh's testimony also noted that sexual criminals also target young victims by posing as children looking for pen pals or by posting notices on computer bulletin boards in order to facilitate and develop relationships which can in turn provide a victim for the predator's illegal sexual activity. 
One chilling example of this problem comes from my own state of Wisconsin. 
In June 1997, a federal grand jury indicted a Jacksonville, Florida man for child enticement and for traveling in interstate commerce to commit a sex act with a fifteen-year-old girl. The defendant first contacted the girl via the Internet and over time began sending her increasingly sexually explicit messages. The defendant offered to pay for the girl to visit him in Florida. The entire time, the defendant told the young girl that he was 21 years old when, in fact, he was 39. 
As the sexually explicit messages escalated and it became apparent that the girl would not be able to go to Florida, the man ultimately traveled to Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin to meet her. 
Believing she was going to meet a 21-year-old, the girl took a friend and waited for the defendant at a restaurant. Upon being confronted by the man--who was clearly not who he said he was--the young girl fled into a restroom while the defendant stood outside and demanded that she come out. 
Later that day, based upon information provided by the girl, the man was arrested by Sturgeon Bay police at a local motel at which he had registered under an assumed name. 
This is a chilling example of how criminals can use the Internet to facilitate crimes against children. Thankfully, this incident did not end in the sexual abuse of a fifteen-year-old. But it is frightening to consider what might have happened if the defendant had been able to lure her to the unfamiliar area of Jacksonville, Florida. 
This is not an isolated incident; there have been other similar instances in Wisconsin and across the nation. And many have not ended as happily as this one did. 
In addition to increasing sentences for criminal activity involving this type of conduct, my amendment expands the `pattern of activity' sentencing enhancement to a wider range of sexual abuse and exploitation crimes. Those criminals who have shown an ongoing pattern of sexually exploiting minors will be held accountable for their conduct through longer prison sentences. These longer sentences incapacitate the criminal for a longer period of time, reducing the potential that they will be set free to victimize again. This sentencing enhancement will now be applicable in cases of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, and the coercion and enticement of minors for an illegal sexual activity. 
In addition, the amendment targets repeat offenders by increasing penalties for repeat offenses and by increasing maximum penalties available under the Federal criminal code. And finally, the amendment authorizes funding to be used to appoint guardians ad litem for children who are the victims of, or witnesses to, crimes involving abuse or exploitation. 
Mr. President, our children are our most precious resource. I am the father of teenage children. Like any parent, I worry about the health and safety of my children. I encourage my children to utilize the Internet and to gain the benefits of these amazing new technologies--technologies which simply did not exist just a few years ago, not to mention when I was growing up. During my tenure in this body, I have been a strong believer in the potential of the Internet and sincerely hope that as we move toward the next century that potential will be realized to the benefit of all our citizens. 
But I am also mindful of the dangers that arise when criminals exploit a new technology to further their illicit criminal activity. This amendment speaks directly to the small percentage of individuals who intentionally misuse the Internet to prey sexually upon children. The adoption of this amendment will send a message that the we will not tolerate the sexual exploitation of our young people on the information superhighway. Pedophiles and sexual predators are not welcome on that road. 
Mr. President, there are many different views on the best approach to the potential dangers of the Internet. We have disagreements in this body, as we do in the country, about the best way to protect children from sexually explicit images on the Internet. But I think we all can agree that when the Internet is used to facilitate criminal abuse of chilren, punishment should be swift and severe. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss briefly the Supreme Court's decision earlier today to strike down the line-item veto law and to a new approach to the line-item veto that aims to cut some of the vast fat contained in our annual spending bills, but will stand up to constitutional scrutiny. 
Though the Court found that the line-item veto legislation was flawed, I supported the experimental line-item veto authority we gave the President in 1996 as a means of controlling Congress' voracious appetite for pork. 
I had great concerns about many aspects of the legislation. My greatest concern was granting a greatly expanded veto authority that retained the two-thirds override threshold that the Constitution provides for the Presidential veto of entire bills. Extending that authority for individual sections of a bill worried me. And the Court found that this represented an inappropriate shift in the balance of power from the legislative branch to the executive. I do not question the Court's decision. 
Mr. President, I don't believe, nor have I ever believed that enhanced rescission authority, whether it be the line-item veto or some other vehicle, is the whole answer to our deficit and spending problem, or even most of the answer, but it certainly can be part of the answer. 
I am working on a bill that would allow expedited rescission. It promises to be a useful tool to help reduce the Federal deficit and bring the Federal budget truly into balance, and more importantly to bring reform to our appropriations process. 
The introduction of this bill would be extremely timely given this body's consideration of the fiscal year 1999 spending bills. Ideally, we would have an expedited rescissions law in place for this year's appropriations bills, but I know that won't happen. What surely will happen is the stealthy insertion of an extensive list of wasteful and unnecessary projects and programs that pick clean the wallets of this country's taxpayers. 
This bill would allow the Congress and the President to work together to exercise the kind of specific budget pruning that many of us feel is a necessary response to the budget abuses that persist in the appropriations process. 
Mr. President, this bill would enable the President to propose eliminating specific spending items for veto and would allow Congress to support or oppose the President's suggestions on a simple up or down vote. 
This bill would accomplish the objectives of the line-item veto--eliminating wasteful and unnecessary spending--but without violating the constitutional principles of separation of power and balance of power. 
Mr. President, I believe this bill would be an effective means of fighting wasteful spending, certainly something everyone opposes.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the provisions of the Department of Defense authorization bill relating to the United States military mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The amendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Thurmond) expresses the sense of the Congress that United States ground troops should not remain in Bosnia indefinitely. The amendment offered by the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Smith) would have required that none of the funding authorized or appropriated for the Bosnia mission under this bill be expended after March 31, 1999, unless both Houses of Congress had voted on the continued deployment of U.S. ground troops in Bosnia. 
I supported both of these amendments because I firmly believe that it is of paramount importance for the Senate to go on record at every opportunity with respect to the U.S. mission in Bosnia. It is especially important that the Senate go on record as a part of the Department of Defense authorization bill, which is perhaps the most important piece of defense-related legislation that this body debates each year because it is the framework under which our military will be funded over the next fiscal year. 
I have opposed the Bosnia mission since its inception because I did not believe then--and I do not believe now--that the Administration has presented a list of clear, achievable objectives and a definite exit strategy to the American people. To date, taxpayers have paid more than $9 billion for this ill-defined mission. 
I am pleased that the second-degree amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) to the Thurmond amendment calls upon the President to submit a report on the status of the Bosnia mission with each future request for additional funding for this mission. To date, the Administration has repeatedly come to the Congress seeking more and more money for this mission and offering little justification in return. The McCain language asks the Administration, with each additional funding request, to provide specific information on the Bosnia mission, including objectives for reaching a self-sustainable peace and a schedule for achieving them, and future cost and risk assessments involved with this mission. 
Of course, I support our men and women in uniform and the commendable job they have done to help to implement the Dayton Accords and to achieve a lasting peace in Bosnia. What I cannot accept is the mission creep and uncertainty that these men and women are forced to live with, and the hefty price tag the American people have been forced to pay. 
While I supported the Thurmond amendment, I would have liked to see stronger language, including calling on the President to devise an exit strategy that included a date certain for the transfer of chief responsibility for this mission from United States forces to European forces. It is my firm belief that the longer U.S. troops remain in the region, the harder it will be for them to leave. We must call upon our NATO allies to assume responsibility for this mission. 
In the past, I have supported both a date certain for troop withdrawal, and efforts to cut funding for this mission. I also have come to the floor to express my concerns about the expanding nature of this mission. I would also like to express again my continuing frustration with the emergency designation for the funding for this mission, which is clearly no longer an emergency. 
I regret that the Administration chose to deploy troops to Bosnia in 1995 without seeking prior congressional approval. I also regret that this mission has continued far past its original one-year time frame, and that our troops have been asked once again to continue down an uncertain path toward an ill-defined goal. In December 1997, the President abandoned the purported June 1998 exit date and replaced it with a series of so-called `benchmarks' for U.S. withdrawal. Today, on the 25th day of June 1998, the end of this mission is nowhere in sight. I hope that the Administration will hear clearly the sentiments expressed by the Senate through the Thurmond amendment, which has been adopted overwhelmingly by this body.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment terminates the Navy's Extremely Low Frequency Communications System and uses the savings from it to offset funding increases for our National Guard. I am very pleased to be joined in introducing this amendment by our senior Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl. 
Mr. President, the amendment would limit funds appropriated in this bill for the Navy's Extremely Low Frequency Communications System or, as is it called, Project ELF, and it involves the termination of this program. It is time to mothball the project and use the savings to correct a significant shortfall that we have in this authorization bill in the funding for the National Guard's operations and maintenance account. Project ELF is in Wisconsin, but it is an ineffective, unnecessary, outdated, cold-war relic that is not wanted by most residents of our State. 
The members of the Wisconsin delegation have consistently fought for years to close down this Project ELF. I have introduced legislation during each Congress that I have been here to terminate it. And I have also attempted and have, in fact, recommended it for closure to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. 
This project has been opposed by residents of Wisconsin since its inception, but for years we were told that the national security considerations of the cold war outweighed our concerns about having this installation in our State. As we continue our efforts to reduce the Federal budget deficit and as the Department of Defense continues to struggle to meet a tighter budget, it is just absolutely clear that Project ELF should be closed down. If enacted, this amendment would save approximately $12 million a year. 
Project ELF is simply a one-way, primitive messenger system designed to signal to but not actually communicate with deeply submerged Trident submarines, so it is really just a bellringer. It is like a pricy beeper system used to tell the submarine when it should rise to the surface to get the actual detailed message through real communications systems. This was designed a long time ago. It was designed when the threat and consequences of detection to our submarines was real. But ELF was never developed to an effective capability, and the demise of the Soviet threat has certainly rendered at least this program unnecessary. 
With the end of the cold war, Project ELF has become harder and harder to justify. Trident submarines no longer need to take this extra precaution against Soviet nuclear forces. They now can surface on a regular basis with less danger of detection or attack. They also receive more complicated messages through very low frequency, or VLF, radio waves or lengthier messages through satellite systems if it can be done more cheaply. 
During the 103d Congress, Mr. President, I worked with our former colleague, Senator Nunn from Georgia, and included an amendment in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 that required a report by the Secretary of Defense on the benefits and the costs of continued operation of this Project ELF. The report issued by DOD was particularly disappointing because it basically argued that because Project ELF may have had a purpose during the cold war, it should somehow continue to operate after the cold war as part of the complete complement of command and control links that were configured with the cold war in mind. 
So if the question is, Did Project ELF play a role in 
helping to minimize the Soviet threat? Perhaps. Did it do so at risk to the community? Perhaps. But does it continue to play a vital security role to this Nation? No, it doesn't. It does not have that role. 
In the 1995 rescissions bill, the Senate, as a whole, recommended the termination for Project ELF. Somehow again, though, the program survived when some conference committee members claimed to have `newly released, highly classified justifications' for the program's continuation. When I looked into these claims and was assured by the Navy and Strategic Command that no new classified justifications existed, I continued my effort to try to get rid of this program. Again, the Senate cut funding for the program in 1996 in the DOD authorization bill but somehow it was again resurrected in conference. 
I would like you to know that both congressional representatives who have ELF installations in their areas, Representatives Obey and Stupak, support getting rid of this project. Also, former commander in chief of the Strategic Command, General George Lee Butler, called for an end to the cold-war nuclear weapons practices, of which Project ELF is a harrowing reminder. 
Additionally, the Center for Defense Information called for ending the program, noting that `U.S. submarines operating under present and foreseeable worldwide military conditions can receive all necessary orders and instructions in timely fashion without need for Project ELF.' 
As I mentioned, Mr. President, the savings from terminating this Project ELF would offset increases for National Guard operations and maintenance, O&M. As we all know, the National Guard expects this year a $594 million budget shortfall for the coming year, almost a $600 million shortfall for our National Guard, and this follows fast on the heels of a $743 million shortfall for the National Guard during the current fiscal year. 
According to the National Guard, these shortfalls are, in fact, compromising the Guard's readiness levels, capabilities, force structure, and end strength. The National Guard's O&M account shortfall directly affects surface operations tempo, real property maintenance, depot maintenance, information and telecommunications management, and medical support. 
The President's 1999 budget request leaves the National Guard's O&M account a significant $450 million below what it really must be in order to meet the needs of the Guard and, therefore, the needs of our military and our country. The shortfalls have increasingly greater effect given the National Guard's increased operations burdens. This is a result of new missions and increased deployments and training requirements, including the National Guard's critical role in places like Bosnia, the Iraq situation, Haiti and Somalia. 
Just to give my colleagues some background, as of now the Army National Guard represents 34 percent of all--total Army forces, including 55 percent of combat divisions and brigades, 46 percent of the combat support, and 25 percent of combat service support. And, yet, despite these very high figures of the critical and central role of the National Guard, the National Guard just gets 9.5 percent of the Army's funding. 
In total numbers, the National Guard receives just 71 percent of its requested funding as opposed to the Active Army getting 80 percent and the Army Reserves getting 81 percent. 
It is time we moved toward giving the National Guard adequate and equal funding. While this amendment would certainly not achieve funding equity for the National Guard, it is a step in the right direction. It does increase funding for the nation's only constitutionally mandated defense force, the National Guard. 
Finally, I would like to briefly mention the public health and environmental concerns that have sometimes been associated with Project ELF. For almost two decades, we have received inconclusive data on this project's effects on Wisconsin and Michigan residents. In 1984, a U.S. district court ordered the project be shut down because the Navy paid inadequate attention to the system's possible health effects and violated the national environmental policy. Interestingly, that decision was overturned because U.S. national security at the time, Mr. President--at the time--prevailed over public health and environmental concerns. Obviously, at that time the cold war was still occurring. 
More than 40 medical studies point to a link between electromagnetic pollution and cancer and abnormalities in both animal and plant species. Metal fences near the two transmitters must be grounded to avoid serious shock from the presence of high voltages. 
Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues this article from this morning's Washington Post. An international committee, convened by the National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences undertook the study of electric and magnetic fields as a possible cause of cancer. Project ELF produces the same kind of electric and magnetic fields cited by this distinguished committee, and the committee's announcement seems to confirm some of the fears of many Wisconsinites. 
At this point, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed, also to follow my remarks in the Record.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Earlier this year, a coalition of fiscal conservatives and environmentalists targeted, among other programs, Project ELF, because it harms both the Federal budget deficit and the environment. The coalition which includes groups like the Concord Coalition, Taxpayers for Common Sense, the National Wildlife Federation and Friends of the Earth, took aim at about 70 wasteful and dangerous programs, and this was one of them. I hope we heed their suggestion and end this program. 
This amendment achieves two vital goals of many of my colleagues here. It terminates a wasteful and unnecessary cold-war era program, while providing funding increases for the National Guard. It is truly a win/win situation and I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will use a bit more of the time I am allotted. I would like to briefly respond to the distinguished chairman. He indicated, first of all, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, who is a member of the Armed Services Committee, has been a critic of the Project ELF program long prior to the time I was serving in the Senate. Surely the Senator from Michigan would not support such a termination if it truly was a threat to our entire submarine system and our national security. 
In particular, Mr. President, there were apparently, at least arguably, benefits to this program at one point. But these justifications that have just been identified no longer can be defended. I tried very hard for 5 years to find exactly what it is that is so critical that this system does, and I can't find it. Let me review briefly what the problem is with this ELF program. 
It is an unsophisticated technology which is designed to only signal to, not actually substantively communicate with, a deeply submerged Trident submarine. It is entirely ineffective in communicating anything of substance. While Project ELF may provide an additional form of communication, it is really just redundant over the communications systems we now have at this time. 
Any benefit from this is just marginal. It cannot communicate messages. It can just give phonetic-letter-spelled-out messages at the rate of 1 pulse per 5 minutes. And wartime messages, except messages to strike, presumably would require more sophisticated methods. 
We are dismantling our first-strike capability. In order to act in combat, submarines have to come to the surface anyway, Mr. President, in order to receive messages and to launch missiles. So they are at risk of detection anyway at precisely the moment that we are talking about. Even in its optimum construction, Project ELF has no nuclear survivability; it has no nuclear dependability and, thus, it really doesn't have any wartime efficacy. 
The justifications that have been given again here are the old ones. They do not fit the reality of the post-Soviet submarine era, and that is the reason why there is a justification for this amendment. It saves money, and it provides funding for our National Guard that desperately needs the help. 
This is what is sometimes so frustrating about trying to ask the Defense Department just to give up something that they don't need. I understand criticisms of proposals for across-the-board cuts that mindlessly say, `Let's just cut out a percentage of the defense budget.' That can't possibly be a reflection of the needs of our national security. But when a careful effort has been made over many years by Members of both bodies of our Congress to identify a specific program as outdated and is a cold-war relic, it seems to me it is our job in this body to say, `Wait a minute; this $12 million a year is wasted.' 
I am not even asking in this amendment that it be put into some other area of Government. I am asking that it be put into our National Guard, which I can tell you, having visited several armories in Wisconsin recently, the National Guard in Wisconsin has inventory problems. They can't get the training they need, and they don't have the personnel they need. They are, unlike Project ELF, critical to our national security. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. FEINGOLD. It is a great joy working with the distinguished Senator from Michigan, and I regret having to be on the opposite side of this amendment, especially since it is our two States that are most affected by this project--ELF. 
But this truly is a project in search of a justification. It had a purpose in the cold war. But when the Senator from Michigan lays out the purpose of the program, what isn't clearly identified is all this Project ELF does. He talks about the slower speeds and the fact that the submarines have to come up. But that is premised, somehow, on the notion that the submarines are being told something of any detail while they are submerged. They are not. Project ELF can only tell the submarine: `Come up.' It is sort of like: `ET, phone home.' That is all you get. `Come up and get your messages. Check your answering machine.' 
While the submarine is submerged, it cannot learn what the threat is, it cannot get instructions, it cannot get anything. All it gets is a message that it has to come up anyway, that it has to slow down anyway. 
For 5 years I have been searching for a justification for something that is nothing more than really a very primitive beeper system that you can't communicate back with and you can't get any real information from. The only justification for it was the fact that we had a threat from Soviet nuclear submarines. That threat is no longer there, and there is no two-way communication that comes from this. 
Again, this is one of the sad moments where a program comes into existence and somehow, because it once was supposed to have a justification under another set of facts, under another series of threats, it just keeps going because a couple of people in the military say it still might be handy. 
The problem with that is, this is real money. It is $12 million a year that could be spent on a number of things. Under my amendment, we would spend it on our true national security. This is about priorities within our national security. I believe an archaic ELF system is less important than putting $12 million a year into the National Guard, which is underfunded under this bill. The needs of the National Guard armories, the inventory, the training, are underfunded under the Department of Defense authorization bill. 
All I am trying to do here is to balance this, to say let's get rid of something that really isn't necessary, that really is primitive, that doesn't provide the sophisticated kind of communication that is claimed, and instead provide help to our hard-working men and women who are part of our National Guard and who now comprise a very significant part of what our Army does in this country. 
This is an unusual situation. Both Senators from our State and the State where this exists are saying, `Please get rid of this program.' How often do Senators from a State go to the base closure system and say please take something out of our State? I assure Members, neither Senator Kohl nor I would propose such a thing if we were not convinced after years of efforts that this program did not have a national security implication, that it was outdated, it was a waste of money, and the money was better used helping our National Guard. 
I ask our colleagues to support this amendment. 
I yield the remainder of our time.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my support for the amendment offered by my friend from Arkansas. 
I am proud to have worked with the distinguished Senator on a number of issues during the past five years and I will miss his leadership and friendship. One of the many issues on which I have had the pleasure to work with him is the Defense Department's tactical aircraft programs. 
I am a proud co-sponsor of this most sensible amendment. I find it hard to believe that anyone could oppose an amendment that makes sure the Air Force flight tests its multi-billion dollar F-22 aircraft less than half the number of hours the Air Force itself planned to fly before moving to begin production. 
Just this past Monday, the DoD's Director of Operational Test and Evaluation told Congress that the F-22 will have approximately 100 hours of flight tests by December, not the 183 the Air Force expects. And that is less than one third the number of hours that the Air Force itself said was desirable just last year. In essence, Mr. President, the Air Force wants to begin producing F-22s at a cost of about one hundred billion tax dollars after completing about 7 percent of its originally planned flight tests. Does this seem like a good idea? 
By comparison, the F-15 flew for 975 hours before a production contract award; the F-16 for 1,115 hours; and even the much-flawed Super Hornet had 779 flight test hours before a production contract was awarded. 
There is a direct correlation between flying hours and expansion of an aircraft's flight envelope. It takes flying hours to explore an aircraft's performance at all airspeeds and altitudes and in various configurations. 
Remember, Mr. President, prototype tests, ground tests, wind tunnel tests and computer simulations did not predict the Super Hornet's program-threatening wing drop problem, which took 2,500 hours of flight tests to solve. 
Mr. President, this amendment just makes common sense. We need to make sure the taxpayers are getting all they're paying for. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
I yield back to the Senator from Arkansas.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the anniversary of the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the establishment of the federal minimum wage. For sixty years, this law has provided hardworking Americans a promise--a promise that, in this country, we value the labor of all of our workers. 
Over the last several decades, we have kept that promise by periodically raising the minimum wage. We have passed legislation six times since 1955 to ensure that this vital safety net is not just symbolic, but, instead, a true standard of decency. It is time to do this again. 
Just like investors who expect a fair return for the money they put into the stock market, workers should expect a fair return for the labor they invest. In today's thriving economy, investors have gotten back more than they could have hoped for. Those making minimum wage, however, have seen a declining return on their investment. An hour of work does not give back what it used to. 
In 1997 dollars, the minimum wage of today is more than two dollars less than what it was in the late 1960s. Our parents' generation had a minimum wage equivalent to $7.33. Now our children--despite an unparalleled booming economy--are faced with a minimum wage that places them below the poverty level. 
That, Mr. President, is outrageous. People who work forty hour weeks year round, trying to provide for themselves and their families, are finding that their efforts are just not enough. 
Perhaps, most troubling of all, this low minimum wage is having a disproportionately devastating effect on working moms. Sixty-two percent of all minimum wage workers are women, many the sole heads of their households. Where do these moms turn when they can't provide for their hungry children? 
Many have been forced to seek outside assistance. Last year, a US Conference of Mayors study indicated that eighty-six percent of cities reported an increased demand for emergency food assistance. Thirty-eight percent of those people seeking food at soup kitchens and shelters were employed. This is an increase of fifteen percent since 1994. 
This new trend is alarming. In a nation as great as ours, in a time as prosperous as this one, we should guarantee the American people that, if they are willing to work, then they will be able to live off of their income; they will be able to feed their children; they will be able to afford clothing and shelter, and they will be able to live their lives with basic dignity and fair compensation. 
I call upon my colleagues to raise the minimum wage so that we can help millions of working people lift themselves up from poverty. Opponents of the minimum wage claim that we cannot afford to do this. But, for the most vulnerable in America's workforce, the truth is that we simply cannot afford not to.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in light of the fact that the managers are working out an agreement on the amendment, I am wondering if I could simply address the bill itself for just a few moments. 
Mr. President, I come to the floor today to register my opposition to the fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense Authorization Act. I have numerous concerns with the bill, especially the continued spending of billions of dollars on wasteful and unnecessary programs. 
In a time when we are cutting programs and fighting for a truly balanced budget, we cannot really afford to insulate any department of our Government from scrutiny as we seek to reduce the Federal debt. 
I think it is very ironic that programs like health care for veterans and social services were put on the chopping block to offset increased funding for our highways and transit systems but we did not have an attempt to use defense spending for transportation. It was not even considered. 
The message we are clearly sending is that roads and overpriced weapons systems are more important than the people who are actually living in this country: We will give you roads and planes, but we will have to take away your health care and programs that serve ordinary human needs. 
Mr. President, there are a number of provisions in the DOD bill that I oppose and I will continue to oppose. One is the subject of some of the discussion we have been having this afternoon. And that is the $1.9 billion `emergency' supplemental appropriations recently passed by the Congress. 
The Congress has never developed firm rules on how we should define an emergency. Everybody assumes, I guess, that we will use common sense when deciding when to grant special emergency treatment to certain expenditures. And of course common sense tells us that things like floods and tornadoes clearly are unanticipated emergencies. 
In my view, however, the mission in Bosnia is not. It is a substantial, long-term commitment. It is something the United States has, for better or worse, decided to do for quite a long term. If events there take an unexpected turn for the worse, of course, we could have some kind of emergency on our hands, but as we stand here today and debate this bill, the Bosnia 
situation is not really something you can call an emergency. 
The line items in the law--military personnel, operations and maintenance, and contingency funds--are really standard military costs that would be part of any military mission. United States troops have been on the ground in Bosnia for more than 2 years. The change in designation from IFOR to SFOR was made more than a year ago and is scheduled to continue through June of this year. Then, last December, the President announced he would forgo imposing a deadline altogether and opted instead for a policy of benchmarks whose definitions remain open to interpretation. 
Mr. President, how can Congress and the President possibly profess to the American people that the additional costs for the Bosnia mission constitute an emergency? On the contrary, it has been quite clear for a while now that the cost of this mission would rise continuously and substantially. And I would say, to me at least, that was really clear from the start. This was never going to be a temporary emergency situation. 
Ironically, congressional appropriators and our military leaders have planned for many months, Mr. President, on obtaining these funds in this emergency spending bill. So that invites my next question: What are these funds doing in the bill? I just do not think you can equate the long-anticipated needs of the operation in Bosnia with the urgent, unexpected needs of the farmers in California or homeowners in Florida who have been devastated by natural disaster. 
Another matter, Mr. President, in the bill, that concerns me is that $3.3 billion authorized for the Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet program. It is no secret that I have some questions about this program. But I am also troubled by the activities of the Pentagon and the Navy in moving the Super Hornet airplane forward. And my concerns are not addressed in the least in this bill. 
The current Hornet program has proven reliable and cost effective. Why do we want to replace the Hornet with a bloated, cost-prohibitive aircraft that offers only marginally greater benefits over the current reliable fighter? 
Third, I am concerned that the DOD authorization bill shortchanges our National Guard by at least $594 million. The National Guard is an immense source of pride throughout the country, and especially in my State of Wisconsin. As I travel across the State, I frequently have the privilege of meeting the men and women who compose the Wisconsin Guard, and I have been very impressed with the tremendous degree of professionalism and proficiency with which they complete a wide range of missions. 
They are well-trained, dedicated, professional soldiers who earn rave reviews from the Governor's office, down to the villages and municipalities who often are the principal beneficiaries in regard to assistance. 
Since I arrived in the U.S. Senate more than 5 years ago, my driving objective has been to reduce the Federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget. We have made great progress in that regard. While we continue to run a deficit while using the Social Security trust fund to mask the deficit, we have almost overcome the hangover of our 1980 spending binge. 
A large part of that success has been due to the willingness of both the Congress and the President to do more with less, to trim excessive spending wherever possible, and maintain important services but with fewer resources. And we have succeeded in almost every area of government to do this--in education, in health care, in veterans' care, in welfare benefits, and in environmental programs. We have succeeded virtually everywhere, except defense spending, where we continue to build destroyers the Navy does not ask for and we continue to build bombers the Air Force does not want. 
Balancing the budget, as you well know, is about making difficult choices. Sure, the Navy would rather have a Super Hornet, and if we were in a radically different budgetary position I could possibly support giving them 300 of those airplanes instead of the 30 they are receiving in this legislation. But can we afford 30 of these new tactical fighters when a more affordable and equally effective alternative aircraft is readily available? How that question is answered is the difference, that is the difference between fiscal excess and fiscal responsibility. 
So we have to make smart choices. A truly balanced Federal budget is almost, unbelievably, in sight for the first time in three decades. But we are not going to be able to get the balanced budget or maintain a balanced budget, let alone starting to bring down the Federal debt and protect Social Security, so long as we continue to commit to programs and force structures that are so blatantly unaffordable. We must continue to fight for further spending reductions until we achieve the most effective and cost-efficient military which serves our national security interests. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to discuss our archaic and unjust Federal Dairy Policy: it is hopelessly out-of-date, completely out-of-touch with reality and an outrageous way to treat the hard-working dairy farmers of the Upper Midwest, particularly Wisconsin. 
Federal dairy policy has been putting small dairy farms out of business at an alarming rate, Madam President. The Northeast loses 200 dairy farms per year, which is bad enough. Meanwhile, Wisconsin is losing 200 per month, which is disastrous. That's about 5 dairy farms per day! The greatest force driving Wisconsin's dairy farmers out of business and off the land is the current structure of the Federal Dairy Program. 
The Federal Dairy Program was developed back in the 1930's, when the Upper Midwest was seen as the primary producer of fluid milk. The idea was to encourage the development of local supplies of milk in other areas of the country that had not produced enough to meet local needs. It wasn't a bad idea for the 1930's, but those days are gone. 
Six decades ago, the poor condition of America's transportation infrastructure and the lack of portable refrigeration technology prevented Upper Midwest producers from shipping fresh fluid milk to other parts of the country. Providing an artificial boost to milk prices in other regions to encourage local production made sense, in the 1930's, that is. 
So, in 1937, we passed legislation authorizing higher prices outside the Upper Midwest. These artificial bumps in prices are referred to as Class I differentials. Mr. President, this system is sometimes referred to as the `Eau Claire' system. Do you know why? Believe it or not, it's called the Eau Claire system because it allows dairy farmers to receive a higher price for their milk in proportion to the distance of their farms from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. 
So the farther away you are from Eau Claire the better off you are. A dairy farmer, as any dairy farmer from Wisconsin, would tell you that a better name really for this system is the anti-Eau Claire system, because it doesn't treat farmers very well who live close to Eau Claire, Wisconsin. 
The system's entire purpose was designed to put dairy farmers in Wisconsin and its neighboring states at a disadvantage. And unfortunately it worked well--too well. Now, we look on as trucks from other regions of the country come into Wisconsin, historically America's dairyland, with milk to be processed into cheese and yogurt. The current Federal Dairy Program is now working only to shortchange the Upper Midwest, and in particular, Wisconsin dairy farmers. 
Madam President, it's time to change a system that is completely out of date and is short-changing upper Midwest dairy farmers to the brink of extinction. 
But, instead, we have further aggravated the inequities of the Federal milk marketing orders system. Despite the discrimination against dairy farmers in Wisconsin under the Eau Claire rule, the 1996 Farm Bill provided the final nail in the coffin when it authorized the formation of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. 
Madam President, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact sounds benign, but its effect has been anything but, magnifying the existing inequities of the system. It establishes a commission for six Northeastern States--Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. 
The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission is empowered to set minimum prices for fluid milk higher even than those established under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. Never mind that the Federal milk marketing order system, under the Eau Claire rule, already provided farmers in the region with minimum prices higher than those received by most other dairy farmers throughout the nation. 
The compact not only allows the six States to set artificially high prices for their producers, it allows them to block entry of lower priced milk from producers in competing States. To give them an even bigger advantage, processors in the region get a subsidy to export their higher priced milk to noncompact States. It's a windfall for Northeast dairy farmers. It's also plainly unfair and unjust to the rest of the country. 
Who can defend this system with a straight face? This compact amounts to nothing short of government-sponsored price fixing. It's outrageously unfair, and it's also bad policy: It blatantly interferes with interstate commerce and wildly distorts the marketplace by erecting artificial barriers around one specially protected region of the Nation; it arbitrarily provides preferential price treatment for farmers in the Northeast at the expense of farmers in other regions who work just as hard, who love their homes just as much and whose products are just as good or better; it irresponsibly encourages excess milk production in one region without establishing effective supply control. This practice flaunts basic economic principles and ignores the obvious risk that it will drive down milk prices for producers everywhere else in the country; you don't often hear about it but the compact imposes higher retail milk prices on the millions of consumers in the Compact region; it also imposes higher costs on every taxpayer because we all pay for nutrition programs such as food stamps and the national school lunch programs that provide milk and other dairy products. 
As a price-fixing device, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact is unprecedented in the history of this Nation. In its breadth and its disregard for economic reality, it's in a class by itself. 
Madam President, in addition to the current problems, language in the reported Agriculture Appropriations bill in the other body extends USDA's rulemaking period by six months, thereby extending the life of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact by six months. Wisconsin's producers cannot withstand another six months of these unfair pricing policies. 
Wisconsin's dairy farmers are being economically crippled by these policies. It's time to bring justice to federal dairy policy, and give Wisconsin dairy farmers a fair shot in the market place. 
In an effort to repair some of the damage that sixty years of this awful system has caused, I have worked with colleagues to bring the true nature of this system to light and offer some alternatives. 
To strike at the heart of the problem, I have introduced legislation in the Senate to kill the notorious Eau Claire system. The measure simply would forbid USDA from using Eau Claire, Wisconsin as the sole basing point when pricing milk. 
And I am cosponsoring legislation to repeal the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. I'm working hard to prevent the compact's extension and expansion, and to prevent the formation of other regional dairy compacts. Compacts of this kind are unfair and they need to be abolished along with this entire 
system which has been plaguing Wisconsin farmers for more than sixty years. 
Also, I have cosponsored the Dairy Reform Act of 1998, introduced by Senator Grams, which establishes that the minimum Class I price differential will be the same for each marketing order at $1.80/hundredweight. What could be more fair than that? Given a level playing field, I know Wisconsin farmers can compete against any farmers in the nation. 
The Dairy Reform Act ensures that the Class I differentials will no longer vary according to an arbitrary geographic measure--like the distance from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. This legislation identifies one of the most bizarre and unjustly punitive provisions in the current system, and corrects it. There is no justification to support non-uniform Class I differentials in present day policy. 
I first learned of the profound inequity of the Federal dairy program when I served in the Wisconsin State Legislature. There, I spearheaded the effort to provide state funds for a lawsuit against the United States Department of Agriculture. Challenging the system, we argued that USDA had no sound and justifiable economic basis for their milk pricing system. The states of Wisconsin and Minnesota, working together, repeated that argument relentlessly in the courts for over ten years in an effort to beat back the system. 
In November of last year, the people of Wisconsin and Minnesota won that case. Federal District Judge David Doty ruled in favor of a more equitable dairy pricing system and enjoined the Secretary of Agriculture from enforcing USDA's `arbitrary and capricious' Class I differentials. Madam President, in other words, a federal judge could find no rational justification for this archaic system and ruled the whole scheme illegal. 
Although the case is now in the appellate court, I am optimistic that Doty's ruling will be upheld. As I said, Judge Doty found the current pricing system `arbitrary and capricious.' 
Most recently, the USDA came up with a proposed rule that included two different options to replace the old system: Option 1A is virtually identical to the status quo and is totally unacceptable to the majority of Wisconsin dairy farmers. Option 1B is a modest step in the right direction and a good place to begin reform efforts. I was optimistic when Secretary Glickman announced USDA's proposed rule for milk marketing order reform and his stated preference for Option 1B. 
If there was any question of the intense, personal effect this discriminatory policy has on Wisconsin's dairy farmers, I would hope, after visiting with over 500 producers, consumer advocates, and local officials at an informal hearing in Green Bay, that USDA's doubts could be put to rest. 
At the USDA listening session in Green Bay, more than 500 people showed up, demanding a fair shake. At the sessions in New York, Georgia and Texas, a total of 240 people showed up. Wisconsin had more than double the attendance than the other locations combined. That difference in attendance didn't happen just because of Wisconsin's tradition of good citizenship. They showed up in Green Bay by the hundreds because they know they are getting a raw deal. Those Wisconsinites showed up to demand reform. They showed up to demand a better system, a chance to preserve economic viability and the opportunity to continue their way of life. 
Day after day, season after season, we are losing small farms at an alarming rate. While these operations disappear, we are seeing the emergence of larger dairy farms. The trend toward fewer but larger dairy operations is mirrored in most States throughout the Nation. The economic losses associated with the reduction in the number of small farms go well beyond the impact on the individual farm families who must wrest themselves from the land. 
The loss of these farms has hurt their rural communities, where small family-owned dairy farms are the key to economic stability. They deserve better: we need a system in which their farms are viable and their work can be fairly rewarded. 
In conclusion, I will continue to work with Wisconsin family farmers and other concerned Wisconsinites in the fight to preserve and protect our family dairy farms by restoring some semblance of fairness and economic integrity to our outdated, out-of-touch, milk pricing system. In the process, we will save an important piece of American agricultural history and a priceless part of Wisconsin's culture. 
As USDA considers Federal Milk Marketing Order reform, I urge the Department to set aside 60 years of inequality and senseless regionalism to do what is best for this nation's dairy industry. These policies are out-of-date, out-of-touch and, frankly, an outrageous way to treat Wisconsin dairy farmers. For those farmers, who are watching as their neighbors sell their livestock to cover their bills and abandon the land of their parents and grandparents, USDA's decision could mean the demise or the survival of their way of life. It is time to do the right thing on dairy pricing policy. Wisconsin farmers demand it, Wisconsin's consumers demand it, and, above all, Justice demands it.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise to talk about an effort under way in this Congress to hamstring the agency charged with enforcing the Federal election laws--the Federal Election Commission. This effort is happening very quietly under the guise of routine agency appropriations, but it has deadly serious consequences in terms of the independence of the Federal Election Commission. I think it is important to call the Senate's attention to it and give notice that I intend to do everything in my power to make sure it doesn't happen. 
Here is what is happening. The Appropriations Committee of the other body has included a provision in the funding bill for the FEC that would result in the firing of the Commission's general counsel and staff director. 
That's right, Madam President. The Congress is now going to get involved in the personnel decisions of the FEC, the agency that we have charged with overseeing us and the way we conduct our reelection campaigns. Some in the Congress want to fire two career civil servants who are simply trying to do their job to make campaign information available to the public and enforce the election laws. 
Lawrence Noble, the General Counsel, has served the agency since 1987. John Surina, the Staff Director, has been in that position since 1983. These are not political appointees. They were put in their jobs by a bipartisan majority vote of the Commission, as required by law. In fact, both of these individuals were unanimously approved by the FEC when they were appointed. They provide crucial institutional continuity, especially now that, as of last year, we have put a one-term limit on the Commissioners themselves. 
But now, unfortunately, some members of Congress apparently don't like some things that the Commission has done. And so they are trying to engineer, what I would call, a quiet coup. They want to require that these two staff positions be refilled every four years by an affirmative vote of four Commissioners. And they specify that this requirement will apply to the 
current occupants of the positions. So Mr. Noble and Mr. Surina will lose their jobs at the end of this year, unless the Commission votes to reappoint them. 
Of course, the Commission itself is in great turmoil. Only two members are serving the terms to which they were appointed. Two members are holdovers, their terms having expired in April 1995. A fifth member is also a holdover, although the President has resubmitted his name. And the sixth slot has been vacant since October 1995. So the Congress has hardly been blameless if the Commission seems at times to be at sea. And now here we are about to create two other vacancies, more turmoil and lack of direction at this crucial agency. 
Madam President, specifying by law that top staff positions in the agency must be refilled every four years is unprecedented. The Congressional Research Service has told me that there are three independent agencies--the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Federal Labor Relations Authority, and the National Labor Relations Board--where the General Counsel is actually a political appointee, nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. In each of these cases, the General Counsel has direct statutory authority. 
But in every other independent agency, including the FEC--and there are lots of agencies, Madam President--the FCC, the SEC, the CPSC, the FTC, the CFTC, and many more. In all of these agencies, the General Counsel is appointed by either the Chairman or the entire body. 
And guess how many of those General Counsels are required to be fired after four years unless they are reappointed and reconfirmed by the appointing entity. The answer is none. Not one.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, this is a whole new procedure invented, I have to assume, because some Members of Congress are, in effect, out to `get' Mr. Noble and Mr. Surina. 
Oh, and by the way, there is not a single agency where the Staff Director is a political appointee or has to be reappointed by the commissioners themselves after a set term. Not one. Frankly, Madam President, the inclusion of the Staff Director in this provision in the House Appropriations bill seems to me to be a smokescreen designed to make this provision seem even-handed. What is really going on here, I believe, is that some in the Congress are trying to send a message to Mr. Noble, the General Counsel, and through him, to the Commission. Some powerful members of Congress don't like some of the cases that Mr. Noble has recommended bringing. So they want him out. 
In recent years, the FEC has undertaken a number of controversial actions in an attempt to enforce the law that the Congress has written. Some of these cases have taken on powerful political figures or groups. The FEC pursued a highly publicized case against GOPAC, a group closely connected to the Speaker of the House. It has an ongoing action against the Christian Coalition alleging that that group illegally coordinated its activities with Republican candidates. And, of course, it has pursued cases and rulemaking proceedings under a more expansive definition of what constitutes express advocacy than some in this Congress believe is appropriate. 
All of these actions are objectionable to people on the Republican side of the aisle. But let's remember that there is a flip side. The Commission has assessed significant fines against the 1992 Clinton campaign and the Kentucky Democratic Party. It has pursued litigation against the National Organization for Women and has pending cases against the California Democratic Party concerning its use of soft money, and the advocacy group Public Citizen, alleging that it coordinated its activities with a primary opponent of the Speaker of the House. 
The bottom line, Madam President, is that the FEC is trying to do its job, even when we in Congress don't give it adequate resources to do it. And there is another crucial point about these actions. Each and every one of the cases or rulemakings I have mentioned was approved by a majority of the Commission. 
Now that is significant, Madam President, because unlike most agencies, the FEC is evenly balanced with Republican and Democratic members. It was carefully designed not to allow either party to have control. So a General Counsel can't just work with one party. In order to file a case, 
he must get at least four votes from the Commission, including at least one from each party. Now that leads to problems sometimes, because if the Commission deadlocks, a General Counsel recommendation cannot go forward. But the bottom line is that every official action of the FEC must be bipartisan. 
So what we have here, Madam President, is an effort to intimidate. The proponents of this firing want to punish the FEC's General Counsel for bringing forward recommendations to enforce the law. Even though in all of the cases I have mentioned, a bipartisan majority of the Commission has agreed with him. 
I should mention one other recommendation that Mr. Noble has made that has not received a majority vote of the Commission, and so is not going forward yet. Mr. Noble has recommended that the Commission takes steps to reduce or eliminate certain kinds of soft money contributions. And we know there are some powerful Members of this body who disagree with that idea. 
You know, it is really fascinating that some of the same people who are pushing this provision, trying to remove the current General Counsel say that we don't need to enact campaign finance reform, we just need to enforce current law. Well, you can't argue that we need to enforce current law and at the same time be trying to fire the chief law enforcement officer of the agency. That just doesn't make sense. If this provision goes through, and Mr. Noble is relieved of his duties at the end of the year, it may be months before a new General Counsel can be chosen that will get the bipartisan support that is required. So right after the 1998 elections, there will be no one to head up the crucially important enforcement functions of the FEC. 
Madam President, we cannot let that happen. We need to let the professional staff of the FEC do its job. Surely the 3 to 3 party split on the Commission is enough to make sure that the Commission doesn't go off on a partisan vendetta. Now we need to stop the partisan vendetta that this proposal represents. 
That is why I intend to offer an amendment when the FEC's appropriation bill comes to floor to make clear that the Senate does not want this House proposal to be part of the final bill. And I will urge the President to veto this bill if it is included. I certainly hope, Madam President, that those who want to see our election laws enforced will vote with me when that amendment is offered. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senator Torricelli, Senator Gorton, and others in introducing legislation to delay the effective date of the final rule promulgated by the Secretary of HHS regarding the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network. This legislation is a crucial step in ensuring that implementation of the Department of Health and Human Services' Interim Final Rule regarding does not jeopardize patients' access to life-saving human organs in regions of the country that have been providing organ transplantation services efficiently. 
Mr. President, organ donation, allocation and transplantation are extremely sensitive issues. They are issues that patients, families and health professionals agonize over because they quite literally can determine who lives and who dies. They agonize over these decisions because there are so many more people in need of organs than there are organs to transplant. 
Mr. President, I want to share with my colleagues a fact that may not be well known, and that is that, according to statistics gathered by the United Network for Organ Sharing, UNO, Wisconsin's two organ procurement organizations--or `OPOs' as they are called--are two of the most successful in the entire country with respect to the ratio of organs procured per million in the population. Those two OPOs, one at the University of Wisconsin Medical School in Madison, the other at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee, have a truly impressive track record for conducting the community education and outreach that is so important in helping people make the decision about whether or not to donate organs. Through the tremendous work of Wisconsin's OPOs and our 4 transplant centers, nearly 700 Wisconsinites received life-saving kidney, heart, liver, lung and pancreas transplants in 1997 alone. 
Mr. President, as you and many other colleagues may already know, the Secretary of Health and Human Services proposed a rule earlier this year to revamp the way the nations donated organs are allocated. 
Mr. President, the legislation my colleagues and I are introducing today would delay implementation of the Department of Health and Human Services' final rule on organ allocation pending further, more detailed examination of the impact of that rule on regional dislocation, transplantation outcome and survival rate, and waiting list time. While I have the highest regard for the intent behind the rule's issuance--the promoting of fairness--I nevertheless have serious concerns about the impact many of the proposed changes are going to have for states like Wisconsin that are served by smaller, community-based transplant centers. It is simply not clear to me that using a so-called `National list' for potential organ recipients would improve upon the current system for allocation or make the system more `fair.' In fact, what specialists in the Wisconsin transplant community have told me is that the opposite is true: that a `National list' could dramatically increase `cold ischemic time' leading to higher rates of transplant rejection, and that a `National list' would likely result in longer waiting times in areas such as Wisconsin that have operated efficiently and successfully. 
Mr. President, additionally study prior to implementation of the rule is vitally important to ensure that a federal agency doesn't take action that--while well-intentioned--inadvertently harms populations served by smaller, community-based organizations. My hope is that further study over the course of the one year delay, combined with further cooperation between HHS, professional and community-based organizations will result in a final rule whose implementation will not harm regions of the country that--because of a tremendous amount of grassroots work, patient and family education, and deep personal involvement by health care professionals--are currently well-served under the current system.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise for the second time in less than two weeks to comment on the extraordinary events taking place in Nigeria. 
Earlier this week, Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, released nine of the country's best known political prisoners. I welcome this step, with the hope that the release of these individuals demonstrates a commitment to enact true democratic reform in this troubled West African country. 
These individuals include some of Nigeria's top political, labor and human rights leaders. For the record, I will list their names here. 
General Olusegun Obassanjo (rt.), a former head of state and the only military leader to turn over power to a democratically elected civilian government and who has played a prominent role on the international stage as an advocate of peace and reconciliation. He had been sentenced following a secret trial that failed to meet international standard of due process over an alleged coup plot that has never been proven to exist. 
Frank Kokori, Secretary General of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG). He was arrested in August 1994, although charges have never been filed. 
Chris Anyanwu, Editor-in-Chief and publisher of The Sunday Magazine. 
Human rights activist Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti. 
Milton Dabibi, Secretary General of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association (PENGASSAN), who was arrested in January 1996 for leading demonstrations against the canceled 1993 elections and against government efforts to control the labor unions. 
Politician Olabiyi Durojaye. 
Former Sultan of Sokoto, Ibrahim Dasuki. 
Former state governor Bola Ige. 
Uwen Udoh, democracy campaigner. 
Mr. President, these individuals have all played an important role in Nigeria, and were all arrested under circumstances that confirm our worst fears of the overarching power of the military in Nigeria. Their release is significant. 
That said, I do not want to become overly enthusiastic about the situation in Nigeria. For despite this great gesture, hundreds of other political prisoners remain in detention--often without charge. Prominent among these remaining prisoners, is, of course Chief Moshood Abiola, presumed winner of the 1993 presidential election, who was thrown in jail on charges of treason. Whatever his role might be in any upcoming transition process, his release and some meaningful acknowledgment of his annulled mandate is key to that process. 
On top of that, numerous repressive decrees remain in force, including the infamous State Security [Detention of Persons] Decree #2, which gives the military sweeping powers of arrest and detention. The existence of such decrees would allow the military to rearrest any of the prisoners released this week at any time. 
Mr. President, I recently introduced S. 2102, The Nigerian Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act of 1998, which calls on the United States to encourage the political, economic and legal reforms necessary to ensure the rule of law and respect for human rights in Nigeria and to aggressively support a timely and effective transition to democratic, civilian government for the people of Nigeria. 
Among other policy initiatives, this bill establishes a set of benchmarks regarding the transition to democracy. These benchmarks include a call for the release of `individuals who have been imprisoned without due process or for political reasons.' 
The release this week of nine prisoners is a start. Let's hope Nigeria's new leader continues to implement policies that move the country in the right direction. 
Nigeria's people deserve no less.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the United Nations World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought, which took place on June 17, 1998. This date is important because it is the fourth anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly's adoption of the Convention to Combat Desertification in Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa. The United States has signed this treaty, but the Senate has yet to exercise its advice and consent responsibilities on this important convention. 
The World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought should serve as a reminder to this body that we should honor our constitutional responsibilities and act on this convention in a timely manner. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I have had the opportunity to see first-hand how valuable the provisions of this convention will be to the people of Africa. It is a mechanism by which the people of Africa will be assisted in preserving and protecting their land, which is a vital link in Africa's fight to become self-sufficient. 
This convention is particularly important for Africa because more than two-thirds of the land comprising that continent is desert or dry land, and almost three-quarters of the dry land used for farming is in danger of becoming unusable. The Sahelian droughts of 1971-73 and 1984-85 contributed to the deaths of thousands and spurred migration that put further stress on already taxed land around Africa. 
This Convention to Combat Desertification, which has already been ratified by 120 countries, establishes a framework to promote land and soil health in developing countries, in order to halt the kind of neglect that eventually leads to land that is unusable for farming. This convention is innovative because it requires participation from all segments of the population, from the farmers and herders who work the land, to local governments and environmental organizations, to those who affect environmental and agricultural policy at the national and regional levels. 
I hope that the Senate will act on this convention in a timely manner, and that next year's anniversary of the Convention to Combat Desertification will be marked by progress in the world's efforts to protect the land and soil that sustains life in developing countries.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wanted to make a statement on a matter of concern to me in the FY 99 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation. As my colleagues know, I have long been active in raising Senate awareness about the financial costs of moving forward with development and construction of the full-scale version of the Animas-La Plata project. I am concerned that Section 505 of the legislation before us may require the federal government to proceed with construction of the full-scale project, just at the time when the Congress is about to get additional information from the Bureau of Reclamation about alternatives to that project. 
As my colleagues will recall from the debate on an amendment I offered to the FY 98 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation on this matter, the currently authorized Animas-La Plata project is a $754 million dollar water development project planned for southwest Colorado and northwest New Mexico, of which federal taxpayers are slated to pay more than 65% of the costs. 
As described in the Committee Report on the legislation now before this body on page 80, the total federal cost associated with this project is now more than $512 million. 
Section 505 of this bill starts out sounding like a prohibition on funds for the Animas-La Plata project. It states that none of the money in this bill is to be used `to pay the salary of any officer or employee of the Department of the Interior may be used for the Animas-La Plata Project.' 
However, the bill goes on to say that none of the money may be used for the Animas-La Plata project except in two cases: `(1) activities required to comply with the applicable provisions of current law; and (2) continuation of activities pursuant to the Colorado Ute Settlement Act of 1988.' 
Mr. President, let me be clear, the applicable provisions of current law require the construction of the full project. And though Section 505 of the bill before us is similar to language added by the other body to the FY 98 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation and retained by the Conferees, it was never considered by this body. 
Subsequently, Mr. President, I do not believe, as I will discuss in greater detail, that Section 505 reflects either the position of this body or the current status of Animas-La Plata. 
I am concerned with Section 505 for two reasons. First, it is not consistent with the activities proposed to be conducted by the Administration with the $3 million in funds it requested for Animas La Plata, funds which are included in this bill. 
As I described on the floor last year, in an attempt to resolve the disputes surrounding Animas La Plata, Colorado Governor Roy Roemer and Lieutenant Governor Gail Schoettler convened a discussion process in October of 1996 to resolve issues involving the principal parties in a dialogue about the Animas project in order to reach consensus. 
The Roemer-Schoettler process produced two major alternatives for consideration, one construction alternative and one non-construction alternative. As stated in the FY 99 Budget Justification issued by the Department of the Interior for the Animas La Plata project on page 223, `appropriate implementation activities' for these alternatives `will likely depend upon further direction from Congress.' 
This body knew that. At the time members voted on the amendment I offered last year to ensure a thorough evaluation, Roemer-Schoettler was concluding and the Interior Department was about to embark on an evaluation of the Roemer-Schoettler alternatives. That evaluation has not yet been completed and given to Congress. 
In fact, Mr. President, the Interior Department's Budget Justification for FY 99 makes clear that these analyses are not yet finished. On page 226, it states that `work proposed for the Animas-La Plata project includes analysis of alternatives developed during the Roemer-Schoettler process and other subsequent activities.' It continues, `depending on actions taken subsequent to the development of alternatives through the Roemer-Schoettler process, FY 1999 work could include finishing a study of alternatives, preparing cost share agreements, water rights settlement agreements, and repayment contracts and NEPA, Clean Water Act and other environmental compliance processes.' 
Mr. President, this justification specifically says that the Interior Department is not intending to proceed with the original full-scale Animas-La Plata Project in FY 99. The Interior Department, it says, instead wants $3 million in FY 99 to finish a study of alternatives and, depending upon Congressional action and direction, it could undertake a number of activities related to the implementation of alternatives in FY 99. 
Not only does Section 505 require the Interior Department to go back to planning and evaluating the old full-scale project, it also fails to recognize the strong message that the Congress, project proponents and project opponents all recognize the full-scale project is dead. After 30 years, and now more than $70 million in appropriations to date, the project costs of full-scale Animas-La Plata are too great, and there are too many lingering substantive questions to proceed with the original design. 
The other body has twice voted to terminate funds for the full-scale Animas La Plata project. 
Last year, 42 members of this body supported my amendment to require the Interior Department to provide a report to Congress on a revised project plan for Animas-La Plata that would reduce the total cost of the program to the Federal Government, satisfy the Ute water rights claims, and ensure that no funds were expended for construction until a revised project had been authorized by Congress. 
The Senior Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell) has legislation before this body (S. 1771) to modify the Colorado Ute Water Rights Settlement of 1988 so that the Ute's claims would be satisfied by the construction of only a portion of the facilities that are proposed to be built in the full-scale project. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee and the Senate Energy Committee are expected to hold a joint hearing on that legislation next week. I have concerns about whether that legislation will actually restrict the obligation the federal government to the construction of only a portion of the original project, but I was looking forward to having that discussion in the appropriate venue. 
Mr. President, I too have legislatively supported the search for an alternative to Animas-La Plata. In fact, legislation that I introduced on March 13, 1997 cosponsored by the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback), the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg), and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) and sponsored in the other body by my colleague from Wisconsin (Mr. Petri) and the Congressman from New York (Mr. DeFazio), deauthorizes the current Animas-La Plata project and directs the Secretary of the Interior to work with the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain tribes to find an alternative to satisfy their water rights needs. 
With all this focus on an alternative, the Senate should not be requiring the Interior Department to proceed with the current project. 
So why is Section 505 in the bill, Mr. President? The legislative language seems to cast doubt on the Senate's intentions, and this Senator can only assume that we are appropriating money for the original project because there is some need to provide those who support a construction alternative with the ultimate insurance that it will be built. Should a construction alternative be infeasible, and from a policy perspective it may be so, continuing to sock money away for the original full-scale project provides a rationale for proceeding with the project. 
Mr. President, I am not certain how Congress ultimately will decide to proceed on this matter, but we are now engaged in evaluation of alternatives to the full-scale Animas project. I am certain, moreover, that it is within the jurisdiction of this body's Energy Committee to determine the benefits of an alternative Reclamation project. Additionally, it is the responsibility of this body's Indian Affairs committee to make certain that the federal government's legal responsibilities to the Ute tribes under any sort of revised agreement are met. We should let these hearings move forward without legislatively trumping any potential for implementing an alternative through Section 505. 
This Senate should not go backward and require the Interior Department to proceed with the full-scale Animas project. We have the potential, if we carry on with the activities the Interior Department proposes to conduct, to achieve significant savings and settle the Ute's claims. The Roemer-Schoettler process generated two alternatives, which the Interior Department is studying. What is clear is that these alternatives have the potential to save the taxpayers between $500-$600 million. These savings will certainly not be realized if we proceed with the full-scale Animas project as required by Section 505.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my grave concern, and that of my constituents, regarding the escalating violence in Kosovo. Fighting between Serbs and the majority ethnic-Albanian population in Kosovo has been on-going since Kosovo was declared to be part of Serbia in 1989. 
Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the safety of ethnic Albanians, many of whom have been murdered or forced to flee their homes by the ethnically-motivated attacks by the minority-Serb population. I am also concerned that this latest round of ethnic fighting in the Balkans could reignite unrest throughout the region. 
The fighting intensified in late February of this year, and has been spiraling across Kosovo ever since. During the weekend of February 28 alone, approximately 30 people were killed there. When ethnic Albanians marched in the provincial capital of Pristina to protest these killings, they were met by Serb riot police armed with water cannon, clubs, and tear gas. 
Since this latest wave of fighting began, a total of more than 200 ethnic Albanians, including women and children, have been killed, and more than 10,000 have fled into neighboring Albania. In early March, 22 members of the Jashari family were massacred on their farm in Prekaz. During the last weekend in May, at least 39 people were killed. These are but a few examples of the senseless bloodshed that has occurred in Kosovo during the last three months. 
Day after day, the world is witness to this brutal fighting through television and print media coverage of the events in Kosovo. We saw the pictures from the massacre at Prekaz. We have seen soldiers in helicopters shooting at people trying to flee across the border into Albania. These pictures have an eerie resemblance to those from Bosnia, Rwanda, and other places where ethnic fighting has occurred in this decade. 
The latest wave of fighting in Kosovo has been marked by an increase in violence and militancy. There is no question that there have been casualties on both sides of this conflict. What is troubling, however, is that very few of these casualties have been combatants fighting for their cause. Instead, the majority of the dead have been innocent civilians, many of them women and children. And most of these civilians have been killed simply because they happened to be Albanian. 
I am pleased that the United States has contributed funding to the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal to begin an investigation into the involvement of Serbian forces in the violence in Kosovo. 
I am also pleased that U.S. envoys Richard Holbrooke and Robert Gelbard, who traveled to the region last month, have been able to bring the two sides to the table to discuss their differences. 
I was pleased that the first round of talks between Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, which took place on May 15, opened a dialogue between the ethnic Albanians and the Serb government in Belgrade. 
I was also hopeful that the May 29 meeting between President Clinton and Mr. Rugova would bolster attempts to reach a diplomatic solution to this on-going crisis. 
Unfortunately, the promise of the May 15 talks has been followed by continuing violence and attacks on civilians by the Serbian police and military. Today, the United States joined the European Union in issuing a ban on all new investment in Serbia and by freezing the assets of the Milosevic government. The U.S. had delayed the implementation of these sanctions prior to the May 15 talks, but now there is little choice but to impose these sanctions. I hope that these sanctions will help to stem the violence and bring the two sides back to the table. 
The leaders on all sides of this conflict should not allow the escalating violence to derail plans for negotiations. While there remain many issues to resolve, I believe that only through continuing negotiations can a sustainable settlement be ironed out. I hope that people on all sides of this conflict are able to put aside their feelings of nationalism and ethnic pride and work together to achieve a peaceful solution to this situation before more innocent blood is shed, and before the fighting spreads into other areas of the Balkans.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to note the death of Nigeria's military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, yesterday in Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria. Although the circumstances surrounding his death remain unclear, it is my hope that his death will provide an opportunity for a new era in Nigeria. 
As the Ranking Democrat of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, I have long been concerned about the collapsing economic and political situation in Nigeria. Nigeria, with its rich history, abundant natural resources and wonderful cultural diversity, has the potential to be an important regional leader. But, sadly, it has squandered that potential and the good will of the world with repressive policies, human rights abuses and corruption, all of which proliferated during Abacha's tenure. 
Although there was no clear line of succession, Nigeria's top military leaders met into the night yesterday to select Gen. Abdulsalam Abubukar as the new head of state. We do not know much about Gen. Abubukar, but we know that he has an historic opportunity to effect real political change for the country. 
Last month, I introduced the Nigerian Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act (S. 2102). The provisions of my bill include benchmarks defining what would constitute an open political process in Nigeria. I call on Gen. Abubukar to implement as soon as possible some of these important changes, such as the repeal of the repressive decrees enacted under Abacha's rule, so that genuine reform can finally take place in Nigeria. The new leadership should demonstrate respect for the rights of all Nigerians to express their views. Most importantly, Gen. Abubukar should take advantage of this opportunity to immediately move toward free and fair elections and unconditionally release all political prisoners, including the winner of the annulled 1993 elections, Chief Moshood K.O. Abiola. 
Abacha's death should represent not just a change in leadership, but ought to result in real change for the average Nigerian. 
Finally, I believe the United States should take a clear and public stand to demonstrate its support for a clear transition to civilian rule in Nigeria. Now is the time for the United States to make unequivocally clear that the military should exercise restraint in the near and long term, begin to build bridges to the pro-democracy forces, and do everything possible to end the current political crisis and restore legitimacy to the Nigerian government. 
I urge the Administration to communicate these sentiments quickly to Nigeria's new leadership.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate National Dairy Month and the great history of the dairy industry in our nation. As many of you know, even before the inception of National Dairy Month, in 1937, Wisconsin was historically the national leader in milk and cheese production. Even today, Wisconsin leads the nation in cheese volume and variety, offering more than 300 varieties, types and styles of cheese. 
Mr. President, during June Dairy Month, we celebrate America's dairy industry and Wisconsin dairy's proud tradition and heritage of quality. It provides Wisconsin's dairy farmers a special time to reflect on their accomplishments and those of their ancestors, and to look forward to continued success in the future. 
As I mentioned, Mr. President, Wisconsin was nicknamed America's Dairyland in the 1930s, but it became a leader in the industry soon after the first dairy cow came to Wisconsin in the 1800's. This year's celebration of National Dairy Month, is especially important for the people of my home state of Wisconsin because this is also the year we are celebrating our sesquicentennial--150 years of Wisconsin statehood. Dairy history and the state's history have been intertwined from the beginning. Why, before Wisconsin was even declared a state, Ms. Anne Pickett established Wisconsin's first cheese `factory' when she combined milk from her cows with milk from her neighbor's cows and made it into cheese. 
Other Wisconsin dairy firsts include: the development of Colby cheese in 1874, the creation of brick cheese in 1875, the first dairy school in America- established in 1891 at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the first statewide dairy show in the U.S. in 1928, and the creation of the world-record holding 40,060 pound, Grade-A Cheddar cheese in 1988. And Wisconsin also can claim one of the best-tasting inventions in the history of dairy industry: the creation of the first ice cream sundae in 1881. 
Wisconsin cows produce more than 22.4 billion pounds of milk a year, nearly 90 percent is processed into cheese and other products. Wisconsin leads the nation in the production of cheese and are the top producer of many varieties including Cheddar, American, Muenster, Brick, Blue and Italian--not to mention the ONLY U.S. producer of the famous Limburger cheese variety. Also, Wisconsin buttermakers produce nearly 25 percent of America's butter supply. 
National Dairy Month is the American consumer's oldest and largest celebration of dairy products and the people who have made the industry the success it is today. During June, Wisconsinites will hold nearly 100 dairy celebrations across our state, including dairy breakfasts, ice cream socials, cooking demonstrations, festivals and other events. These events are all designed to make consumers aware of the quality, variety and great taste of Wisconsin dairy products and to honor the producers who make it all possible. 
I am proud to honor this great American tradition--proud to honor the dairy producers not only in Wisconsin, but also those across this great nation.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join in marking the ninth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, a tragic day when a still unknown number of Chinese--some say hundreds, others, thousands--died at the hands of the People's Liberation Army, and perhaps thousands more were placed in detention. 
Despite this monumental tragedy, China's leaders remain unwilling to re-examine the events of June 4, 1989. Indeed, they would like nothing more than to have Tiananmen fade from the world's memory. 
But today, the spirit of Tiananmen lives in our memory in the strongest way. We have recently welcomed to the United States two key pro-democracy leaders who were released from Chinese prisons. But as lucky as we are to have Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, and others in our midst, we are all well aware that they are not yet free; they remain in the United States because they cannot return freely to their homeland. 
Moreover, at least 158 people remain in prison for their role in the 1989 demonstrations. Certainly for these people and their families, Tiananmen remains a part of daily life. 
For those of us who are concerned about human rights in China, the very date of June 4th remains a powerful reminder that the Chinese Government has not changed. 
But despite the lack of progress, the executive branch of our government continues to pursue a policy of constructive engagement with China, a policy that will be capped off by the President's visit to Beijing at the end of the month. This upcoming summit is yet another in a long line of unwise steps that the Administration has taken with respect to China. I have generally opposed all of these steps because I do not see that progress has been achieved on human rights in China. This includes the October 1997 state visit of Chinese President Jiang Zemin. That was a mistake. We should challenge China's leaders rather than toast them. 
The failure of the United States to sponsor a resolution condemning human rights abuses in China and Tibet at the most recent meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights was also a mistake. The Administration made this decision despite the overwhelming support in the Senate of a resolution that urged the United States to `introduce and make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution' at the Commission on Human Rights. I was proud to co-sponsor that resolution. 
As we all know, for the past few years, China's leaders have aggressively lobbied against resolutions at the UN Human Rights Commission earlier and more actively than the countries that support a resolution. In 1997, China threatened Denmark, which had made a difficult and courageous decision to sponsor a resolution on human rights in China. This year, Chinese officials played a diplomatic game with various European governments, and succeeded in getting European Union foreign ministers to drop any EU co-sponsorship of a resolution. 
The complete failure of the United States and the EU to push for a resolution at the Commission was, in my mind, gravely unfortunate. The multilateral nature of the Commission makes it an appropriate forum to debate and discuss the human rights situation in China. By signing international human rights treaties, China has obliged itself to respect international human rights law. One of the basic purposes of the Commission is specifically to evaluate China's performance with respect to those commitments. The Commission's review has led to proven, concrete progress on human rights elsewhere, and the expectation has been that such scrutiny would lead to concrete progress in human rights in China, but China's rulers cynically ignore their legal and moral duty to respect the human rights of their own citizens. And they do it with impunity. 
Despite China's announcement last year that it would sign the United Nation's Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and take a few other token steps, I see no evidence of real human rights improvement on the ground in China. The fact that human rights conditions in China are growing worse, not better, demands that human rights continue to be a top priority in our China policy--but it is not a priority, and the rulers in Beijing know that. 
Nearly four years after the President's decision to de-link most-favored-nation status from human rights--a decision I have always said was a mistake--we cannot forget that the human rights situation in China and Tibet remains abysmal. Hundreds, if not thousands of Chinese and Tibetan citizens are detained or imprisoned for their political and religious beliefs. The press is subject to oppressive restrictions. And monks and nuns in Tibet are harassed for showing reverence to the Dalai Lama. 
In a well-quoted sentence, the most recent State Department human rights report notes that `the Government of China continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms, including extra-judicial killings, the use of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and sterilization, the sale of organs from executed prisoners, and tight control over the exercise of the rights of freedom of speech, press and religions.' If that shameful litany is not grounds for a tougher policy, please, somebody, tell me what is! 
Today, on the ninth anniversary of one of the most traumatic events in the modern history of China, we remember the courageous people who stood before the tanks, who gave their lives for bravely choosing to express their notions of freedom and breathed their last on the bloody paving stones of Tiananmen, and we honor those heroes who continue to take risks to struggle for real change in China and Tibet. 
It is unfortunate, then, that the President's proposed trip to Beijing, which will take place in just a few weeks, will send the wrong signal--not only to China's leaders, but also to those in China and Tibet who have worked so tirelessly to achieve the basic freedoms that we, as Americans, take for granted. In particular, in a move that almost adds insult to injury, the President has agreed to stage his arrival ceremony in Tiananmen Square itself. 
If ever a moment cried out for a gesture, Mr. President, that will be the moment. That will be the chance for our President to restore some small moral weight to our China policy. 
Mr. President, if the President of the United States feels he must go to Beijing, if he feels he must go there this month, a month when we remember and honor the heroes of Tiananmen, and if he feels he must visit the site of that horrible 1989 massacre, I hope he will take the time to visit with the families of the victims--a suggestion I made to Assistant Secretary of State Stanley Roth in a recent Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. 
Finally, it is imperative that throughout his visit to China, the President send a clear unequivocal message about the importance of human rights, of the rule of law and of democracy. The students at Tiananmen erected a goddess of democracy. Our China policy worships trade and pays short shrift to the ideal of freedom. Our policy has got to change. 
We owe as much to the victims, to the champions of democracy in China today, and to the American people.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Congress finally completed its work on a six-year bill to reauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act today. This bill has been a long time coming. I'm pleased that Wisconsin will now have a chance to address our state's vital transportation needs for the next year and plan its priorities for the next six years. This bill moves Wisconsin a long way toward achieving fairness in Federal transportation spending, and I cannot overlook this dramatic step forward. 
While the bill is not perfect and includes a number of items I would not support individually, it goes a long way toward ending Wisconsin's decades-long legacy as a donor state. Historically, Wisconsin's taxpayers have received about 78 cents for every dollar we have paid into the Highway Trust Fund. As a result, we have lost more than $625 million since 1956. Under this bill, Wisconsin will receive approximately 99 cents for every dollar it contributes to the Highway Trust Fund, beginning next year. I applaud the efforts of Wisconsin's delegation in achieving a greater measure of fairness for Wisconsin's taxpayers. On this travel weekend that many believe will be the biggest in history, the people of Wisconsin should be happy to see that their tax dollars will be used to improve Wisconsin's roads and rails. 
Finally, I urge the President to use his line-item veto authority to strike the pork-barrel spending projects inserted into the House reauthorization bill and included in this conference report. We should allow states and localities to decide on how best to address transportation needs. The Senate decided to use more than $2 billion on block grants to states instead of earmarks for particular projects. I am certain that Wisconsin, and other donor states, could have reached even greater equity had the House followed the Senate's lead.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, over the past few days, the world has watched in disbelief as Indonesia has unraveled. Barely two days ago, in response to mounting domestic and international pressure, President Suharto, Indonesia's authoritarian ruler for 32 years, announced his resignation. For the moment, power has been transferred to Suharto's longtime confidant, the former Minister of Research and Technology, Vice President, B.J. Habibie. 
Mr. President, it is too soon to tell whether this transition will satisfy the demands of the students and other Indonesians who have been protesting Suharto's rule for the past three months. To be honest, I doubt it. These students want real political reform, and I believe all of Indonesia's people deserve such reform. 
I hope Indonesia's new leadership will exercise restraint during this period of transition, and will use the present circumstances to enact policies that appropriately address the needs of all Indonesians. 
At the same time, I think these circumstances present a unique opportunity to deal with one of Indonesia's most vexing problems, and one that I have been actively engaged in since before I joined the Senate--the question of the political status of East Timor. 
Mr. President, today my colleague from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] and I are submitting a resolution encouraging a solution to the political status of East Timor. This resolution is similar to H. Con. Res. 258, introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Nita Lowey and others. 
This resolution says simply: the United States should support an internationally supervised self-determination referendum in East Timor. 
Indonesia has sustained a brutal military occupation of East Timor for more than 20 years, and thousands of East Timorese have lost their lives as a result. Human rights organizations from around the world, as well as our own State Department, continue to report substantial human rights violations by the Indonesian military--including arbitrary arrest and detention, curbs on freedom of expression and association, and the use of torture and summary killings of civilians. 
Immediately after the Indonesian occupation of East Timor in 1975, and again in 1976, the United Nations Security Council called for Indonesia to withdraw from the region and called for the recognition of East Timorese self-determination. From 1976 to 1982, the U.N. General Assembly adopted eight separate resolutions calling for the withdrawal of Indonesian armed forces from the territory. In the past few years, several nations, including the European Union and the Australian Senate, have delivered strong statements condemning the actions of the Indonesian government in East Timor and calling for a process of self-determination. 
As you know, Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, co-winner with Jose Ramos Horta of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, has long called for the self-determination of his people and reiterated his plea for a self-determination referendum immediately after receiving news of his Nobel prize. 
Even President Clinton, who has not engaged on this issue in the past, expressed interest in the idea of a United Nations-sponsored self-determination referendum in a December 1996 letter to me. 
Mr. President, as we know, although the larger political crisis in Indonesia has been brewing for sometime now, events of recent days have taken on a surreal intensity. Since the early part of this year, there had been relatively peaceful protests taking place largely in Jakarta, the capital. For the most part, these demonstrations were led by students and confined to university campuses. But while the protests were triggered in response to the economic turmoil caused by the larger financial crisis in Asia, they quickly gave voice to political dissent of a sort not seen in Indonesia for decades. As the students slowly realized they had a political voice, they began to speak out more forcefully, and the demonstrations increased--moving out to more cities and spilling off of the campuses. 
Now, the situation has become dangerous, fatal for some, as widespread riots and looting have spread across Jakarta and elsewhere. The economy is nearing a standstill and the military is beginning to show signs of stress and fracture. Reports of the dead and injured continue to grow. Hundreds of people have been arrested. 
And of course no one really knows what to expect during the unfolding political drama of Indonesia. 
This crisis clearly has affected all of Indonesia and will have serious 
implications for the country's future, but I am particularly concerned about the impact of these recent events on East Timor. 
As my colleagues well know, I have been monitoring the situation in East Timor for more than six years. What particularly worries me now, given this larger political crisis, are reports of increasing numbers of troops in some of East Timor's major cities. This is extremely destabilizing, coming on the heels of a dire humanitarian situation on that captive island because of poor access to food. 
The resolution Senator Reed and I are submitting today is important at this time because it is clear that whatever happens in Jakarta over the next weeks and months will no doubt have profound implications for political and military development in East Timor. The great irony of the latest crisis in Indonesia is that it may actually present us with an opportunity once and for all to help the people of East Timor exercise their right to self-determination. Habibie, or any other leader that succeeds him--through legitimate means or by brutal coup--will have to reevaluate Indonesia's relationship with East Timor. It is my sincere hope that any successor will recognize that Indonesia's brutal occupation of the territory is entirely unsustainable and will look to the natural solution of a self-determination referendum to help determine East Timor's political status. 
Mr. President, the East Timorese deserve the support of people of conscience all over the world, and the United States should use it world leadership position on their behalf. The United States should begin immediately to encourage the process of self-determination in both Indonesia and in East Timor. 
It is long overdue.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I introduce a sorely needed piece of foreign policy legislation, the Nigeria Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act of 1998. As the Ranking Democrat of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, I have long been concerned about the collapsing economic and political situation in Nigeria. Nigeria, with its rich history, abundant natural resources and wonderful cultural diversity, has the potential to be an important regional leader. But, sadly, it has squandered that potential and the good will of the world with repressive policies, human rights abuses and corruption. 
The legislation I am introducing today provides a clear framework for U.S. policy toward that troubled West African nation. The Nigeria Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act declares that the United States should encourage the political, economic and legal reforms necessary to ensure the rule of law and respect for human rights in Nigeria and should aggressively support a timely and effective transition to democratic, civilian government for the people of Nigeria. I am pleased to have Senators Jeffords, Leahy and Wellstone join me as cosponsors of this legislation. 
This bill draws heavily from legislation introduced in the 104th Congress by the former chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, Senator Kassebaum. I joined 21 other Senators as a proud co-sponsor of that bill. A companion measure to my bill was introduced earlier this week in the House by the distinguished chair of the House International Relations Committee, Mr. Gilman of New York, and a distinguished member of that Committee and of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Payne of New Jersey. I commend both of my House colleagues for their strong leadership on this important issue and I appreciate the opportunity to work with them toward passage of this legislation and the broader goal of a freer Nigeria. 
Mr. President, the Nigeria Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act provides by law for many of the sanctions that the United States has had in place against Nigeria for a number of years. It includes a ban on most foreign direct assistance, a ban on the sale of military goods and military assistance to Nigeria, and a ban on visas for top Nigerian officials. It would allow the President to lift any of these sanctions if he is able to certify to the Congress that specific conditions, which I will call `benchmarks,' regarding the transition to democracy have taken place in Nigeria. These benchmarks include free and fair democratic elections, the release of political prisoners, freedom of the press, the establishment of a functioning independent electoral commission, access for international human rights monitors and the repeal of the many repressive decrees the Abacha regime has pressed upon the Nigerian people. 
This legislation also provides for $37 million in development assistance over three years to support democracy and governance programs and the activities of the U.S. Information Agency, and mandates a larger presence for the U.S. Agency for International Development. I want to emphasize that this bill authorizes no new money. All of these funds would come out of existing USAID and USIA appropriations. At the same time, the bill prohibits any U.S. resources from being used to support an electoral process in Nigeria until it is clear that any planned election will be free and legitimate. 
Importantly, my bill requires the President to impose additional sanctions at the beginning of 1999 if he cannot certify that a free and fair election has taken place by the end of 1998. These new sanctions, will include a ban on Nigerian participation in major international sporting events, an expansion of visa restrictions on Nigerian officials and the submission of a report that lists the senior officials that fall under such restrictions. 
Finally, the bill requires the Secretary of State to submit a report on corruption in Nigeria, including the evidence of corruption by government officials in Nigeria and the impact of corruption on the delivery of government services in Nigeria, on U.s. business interests in Nigeria, and on Nigeria's foreign policy. It would also require that the Secretary's report include information on the impact on U.S. citizens of advance fee fraud and other fraudulent business schemes originating in Nigeria. 
The intent of this legislation is two-fold. First, it will send an unequivocal message to the ruling military junta in Nigeria that it's continued disregard for democracy, human rights and the institutions of civil society in Nigeria is simply unacceptable. Second, the bill is a call to action to the Clinton Administration which has yet to articulate a coherent policy on Nigeria that reflects the brutal political realities there. 
Nigeria has suffered under military rule for most of its nearly 40 years as an independent nation. By virtue of its size, geographic location, and resource base, 
it is economically and strategically important both in regional and international terms. Nigeria is critical to American interests. But Nigeria's future is being squandered by the military government of General Sani Abacha. Abacha presides over a Nigeria stunted by rampant corruption, economic mismanagement and the brutal subjugation of its people. 
The abiding calamity in Nigeria occurs in the context of economic and political collapse. Nigeria has the potential to be the economic powerhouse on the African continent, a key regional political leader, and an important American trading partner, but it is none of these things. Despite its wealth, economic activity in Nigeria continues to stagnate. Even oil revenues are not what they might be, but they remain the only reliable source of economic growth, with the United States purchasing an estimated 41 percent of the output. 
Corruption and criminal activity in this military-controlled economic and political system have become common, including reports of drug trafficking and consumer fraud schemes that have originated in Nigeria and reached into the United States, including my home state of Wisconsin. 
After the military annulled the 1993 election of Moshood Abiola as Nigeria's president--through what was considered by many observers to be a free and fair election--Chief Abiola was thrown into prison, where he remains, as far as we know, on the pretext of awaiting trial. Reliable information about his situation and condition is difficult to obtain. Chief Abiola's wife, Kudirat, was detained by authorities last year and was later found murdered by the side of a road under circumstances that suggest the military may have been responsible. 
On October 1, 1995, General Abacha announced a so-called `transition' program whose goal was the return of an elected civilian government in Nigeria by October 1998. But virtually none of the institutions essential to a free and fair election--an independent electoral commission, an open registration process, or open procedures for the participation of independent political parties, for example--has been put into place in Nigeria. Repression continues; political prisoners remain in jail; the press remains muzzled; and the fruits of Nigeria's abundant natural resources remain in the hands of Abacha's supporters and cronies. 
Even this flawed transition process--which in its best days moved at a snail's pace--has now been completely destroyed by the recent announcement that the fifth of the five officially sanctioned parties has endorsed Gen. Abacha as their candidate. Now, what was to have been a competitive presidential election has become a circus referendum on Abacha himself. The general will allow an election so long as his name is the only one on the ballot. This is little more than a sorry joke on the premise of democracy! 
Any criticism of this so-called transition process is punishable by five years in a Nigerian prison. Reports from many international human rights organizations and our own State Department document years of similar brutality. Nigerian human rights activists and government critics are commonly whisked away to secret trials before military courts and imprisoned; independent media outlets are silenced; workers' rights to organize are restricted; and the infamous State Security [Detention of Persons] Decree #2, giving the military sweeping powers of arrest and detention, remains in force. 
Perhaps the most horrific example of repression by the Abacha government was the execution of human rights and environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others in November 1995 on trumped-up charges. Since that barbaric spectacle, it appears the Abacha government has been working even harder to tighten its grip on the country, wasting no opportunity to subjugate the people of Nigeria. 
Late last year, retired Major General Musa Yar'Adua, a former Nigerian vice president and a prominent opponent of General Abacha, died in state custody under circumstances that remain shrouded in mystery. General Yar'Adua was one of 40 people arrested in 1995 during a government sweep and sentenced to 25 years in prison for an alleged coup plot widely believed to have been a pretext to silence government critics. Just a few weeks ago, we received the disturbing news that five Nigerians had been sentenced to death by a military tribunal amid other unproven accusations of coup-plotting. 
The Clinton Administration response to these events has been an earnest muddle at best, and rudderless at worst. I welcome recent efforts to complete the policy review process; in fact, I have been pushing for its completion for quite some time, because I feel the perceived `lack' of a policy with respect to Nigeria, for the past two years or so, has been dangerous. 
But, unfortunately, the long-awaited and oft-postponed principals' meeting on this issue, which finally took place in April, has not yielded any firm recommendations to the President. I have long urged the Administration to take the toughest stance possible in support of democracy in Nigeria, including a clear unequivocal statement that an electoral victory for Abacha would be totally illegitimate and unacceptable. The regime in Nigeria must know that anything less than a transparent transition to civilian rule will be met with severe consequences, including new sanctions as is mandated in this bill. 
So I was particularly disappointed to hear the President remark during his recent trip to Africa that General Abacha would be considered acceptable by the United States if he chose to run in the upcoming election as a civilian. My shock at that remark was tempered somewhat by the efforts of numerous administration officials who struggled to clarify the President's remarks. They insist that the U.S. objective is to support a viable transition to civilian rule in Nigeria, but my worst fears about that ominous remark by the President have now come true. Abacha and his cronies seem to believe that the United States would consider an Abacha victory in the upcoming elections to be a viable, sustainable outcome. Why else would the plan once touted as the basis for a democratic competitive presidential election be downgraded into a rigged referendum on Abacha himself? As planned now, the referendum will be one in which Abacha cannot lose and the people of Nigeria cannot win. 
Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today represents an effort to demonstrate our horror at the continued repression in Nigeria, to encourage the ruling regime to take meaningful steps at reform, to support those Nigerians who have worked tirelessly and fearlessly for democracy and civilian rule and to move our own government toward a Nigeria policy that vigorously reflects the best American values. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I hope that we will be able to consider it soon in the Committee on Foreign Relations.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the National SAGE Act. This legislation would authorize a limited number of innovative demonstration grant programs to assist states in their efforts to reduce public school class size and improve learning in the earliest grades. 
Mr. President, my own state of Wisconsin has been a leader in the effort to reduce class size in public schools. This legislation is modeled after Wisconsin's successful pilot program, the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education of SAGE program. I am proud that my bill bears the same name as that groundbreaking program. 
SAGE is a very appropriate acronym for this legislation, for a sage is a teacher who imparts knowledge and wisdom through direct engagement with his or her students. By providing grants to states trying to reduce class size and implement educational reforms, the National SAGE Act would give students and teachers more opportunities to interact directly. The result will be better teacher morale, better student performance and a happier, more successful school. 
Mr. President, I have heard about the need for smaller classes from parents, teachers and school administrators around Wisconsin--including my mother-in-law, who has been a 1st grade teacher for more than 20 years in Waunakee. They all tell me by reducing class size students receive more attention from teachers, and it stands to reason that more attention will translate into more learning. 
When asked to evaluate the Wisconsin SAGE program, eight-year teaching veteran Shelia Briggs, of Glendale Elementary School in Madison, Wisconsin said, `SAGE is just phenomenal. I have kindergarteners who are writing paragraphs. In addition, behavior is a huge benefit of SAGE. With too many little bodies, you will have difficulties. Things are so much more manageable.' Additionally, second grade teacher Amy Kane says, `I have taught second grade for nine years and never had this high a percentage of readers. Their writing skills are much higher, and they are able to behave better. I make contact with parents now that I could never make with 34 students.' 
Wisconsin's SAGE program has again demonstrated empirically what we know instinctively: students in smaller classes get more attention from teachers, and teachers with fewer students will have more time and energy to devote to each child. 
In addition to vital input from these Wisconsin educators, other studies confirm that small class size promotes effective teaching and learning. The leading scientific studies of the impact of small class size, Tennessee's STAR study and its follow up, the Lasting Benefit Study, found that students in small classes in the early years earned significantly higher scores on basic skill tests in all four years and in all types of schools. Follow-up studies have shown that these achievement gains were sustained in later years even if students are placed in larger classes. While I certainly recognize that teacher quality, high expectations an parental involvement are important factors in quality education, the significance of small class size should not be underestimated and cannot be ignored. 
Mr. President, Wisconsin is not the only state fighting to reduce class size and implement educational reforms in its public schools. Several states have made small class size a priority, including California, Tennessee, Indiana and Nevada to name a few. My legislation, the National SAGE Act, authorizes $75 million over a period of five years to fund a limited number of demonstration grants to state that create innovative programs to reduce public school class size and improve educational performance, as Wisconsin has done. The Secretary of Education would choose the states to receive funding based on several criteria, including the state's need to reduce class size, the ability of a state education agency to furnish 50 percent of the funds and the degree to which parents, teachers, school administrators and local teacher organizations are consulted in designing the program. The funding for the National SAGE Act would be fully offset by cuts in a wasteful federal program that subsidizes research and development for a huge aircraft manufacturer. That's classic corporate welfare and by eliminating it, we can fund this important SAGE program and still reduce federal spending by more than $1.7 billion over a five year period. 
The National SAGE Act also includes a comprehensive research and evaluation component to document the benefit of smaller class size in the earliest grades, and support efforts to reduce class size in schools all over America. 
Mr. President, I want to take a moment to say how pleased I am that the Clinton Administration has been pushing the issue of class size to the forefront of the education debate. In January I wrote to the President requesting that he make reducing class size a priority in his FY 99 education budget. I was pleased that the President's budget includes an incentive to help schools provide small classes in the early grades. 
While I support the intent of the President's class size proposal, it is not funded. I was uncomfortable with the President's original proposal to fund a small class size initiative with money from a tobacco settlement that did not yet exist. I am hopeful that Congress will soon pass tobacco legislation, Mr. President, but it is best that we not tie class size legislation to something as controversial and decisive as the tobacco bill. 
My fear is that the end of the 105th session will come and Congress will go home having done nothing to assist States trying to reduce class size. My bill approaches this issue more directly, without the baggage of the tobacco bill and without expanding the deficit. 
I have been very active on the class size issue over the last year because again--I believe that there is a great national purpose of helping our children to learn by doing all we can to reduce class sizes for children in the earliest grades. While I embrace that national purpose, I do not seek a national mandate for smaller classes. That is not a proper federal goal. Instead, I support smaller classes as a national goal, to be achieved by the local school boards. I think we all can agree that there are no magic remedies to the problems in our public schools and no instant fix to improve learning. However, I believe that targeting federal funds matched on a 50-50 basis by state funding, to assist school districts moving toward smaller class size, is an effective use of federal dollars. 
At its core, Mr. President, the small class size issue is really about protecting pubic education. The promising achievements of state efforts in education reform merit strong federal support. We have an obligation to strengthen public schools, because they are the principal institution for educating American children. 
Public schools are all-inclusive; they accept all students, regardless of income, race, religion or ethnicity. In introducing the National SAGE Act today, I want to reiterate my strong commitment to quality public education. I am proud of the education I received from Wisconsin's public schools; proud to have graduated from them, and proud that my children attend them. I am committed to helping our public schools improve and adapt and respond to the increased burdens placed on them. I feel strongly that the federal government has a limited--but important role to play in public education. 
Mr. President, the Washington Post recently wrote an article about the growing number of families in the Washington area deciding to educate their children at home, rather than participate in the public school system. Mr. President, this trend is not happening in Washington alone, but around the nation. 
The Post article states that one of their biggest complaints for families opting out of the public schools is large class size. Parents understand the importance of a low teacher to child ratio in the classroom. They understand the critical difference additional teacher attention can make for their child's educational achievement. 
The parent's highlighted in the Post article, Mr. President, are fed up with public school classes made up of twenty-five to thirty students or more, fed up with the lack of individual attention their children are receiving in the classroom; and finally, Mr. President, parents are fed up with the discipline problems created by too many children and too few adults in one classroom. 
While I support the choices of families who send their children to public schools or home school their children, the growing trend to move public resources away from the public schools, where more than 90% of our nation's children are educated, is disturbing. Instead of abandoning public education with tax breaks for private schools or spending time and energy designing a Constitutionally flawed voucher program, Congress should be working to ensure that we target federal dollars to meet the needs of local school districts. Those of us who believe a high quality public education system is essential to the productivity of our nation should be very alarmed by this growing effort to move resources away from our public schools. 
Mr. President, the federal government has a responsibility during the 105th Congress to take a positive step toward helping school districts reduce class size as part of an overall effort to improve education and ensure that our children have the best chance to excel and reach their full potential. I look forward to continued debate on this issue and hope that my colleagues will consider the National SAGE Act as a reasonable, fiscally responsible proposal to assist states in their efforts to reduce public school class size and improve learning in the earliest grades.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment, which is actually a bill I have worked on for some time, the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act, S. 63, a measure cosponsored by Senators Kennedy, Leahy, and Torricelli. 
What this legislation does is address the rapidly growing and troubling practice of employers conditioning employment or professional advancement upon their employees' willingness to submit claims of discrimination or harassment to arbitration, mandatory arbitration, rather than still having the right to pursue their claims in the courts. In other words, in too many cases employers are forcing their employees to ex ante agree to submit their civil rights claims to mandatory binding arbitration irrespective of what other remedies may exist under the laws of this Nation. 
So to address this growing trend of mandatory binding arbitration, this measure, the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act, amends seven civil rights statutes to guarantee that a civil rights plaintiff can still seek the protection of the U.S. courts. The measure ensures that an employer cannot use his or her superior bargaining power to coerce her or his employees to, in effect, capitulate to an agreement which diminishes their civil rights protection. 
To be specific, this legislation affects civil rights claims brought under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans With Disabilities Act, section 1977 of the revised statutes, the Equal Pay Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, and the Federal Arbitration Act. 
In the context of the Federal Arbitration Act, the protections in this legislation are extended to claims of unlawful discrimination arising under State or local law, and other Federal laws that prohibit job discrimination. 
Madam President, I want to be clear, because it is important that we promote voluntary arbitration in this country, that this is in no way intended to hinder or discourage or bar the use of arbitration on conciliation or mediation or any other form of alternative dispute resolution short of litigation resolving those claims. I think it is tremendous that we try to encourage people to voluntarily avoid litigation. 
I have long been a strong proponent of voluntary forms of alternative dispute resolution. The key, however, is that, in those cases that I can support alternative dispute resolution, it is truly voluntary. That is not what we are talking about here. What is happening here is that these agreements to go to arbitration are mandatory, they are imposed upon working men and women, and they are required prior to employment or prior to a promotion. 
Mandatory binding arbitration allows employers to tell all current and prospective employees, in effect, if you want to work for us, you will have to check your rights as a working American citizen at the door. Indeed, these requirements have been referred to recently as front-door contracts; that is, employers require that employees surrender certain rights right up front in order to get in the front door. Working men and women all across the country are faced with a very dubious choice, then, of either accepting these mandatory limitations of their right to redress in the face of discrimination or harassment, or being placed at risk of losing an employment opportunity or professional advancement. 
As a nation that values work and deplores discrimination, I don't think we can allow this situation to continue. The way I like to describe it is, what this expects a person to do is to sign an agreement that they will not go to court even before they feel the sting of discrimination. They have to sign this deal before they even sit down to their desk and do their first work for an employer. 
So, in conclusion, allow me to stress that this practice of mandatory binding arbitration should be stopped now. If people believe they are being discriminated against or sexually harassed, they should continue to retain all avenues of redress provided for by the laws of this Nation. This amendment will help restore integrity and balance in relations between hard-working employees and their employers. But I think more important, this amendment will ensure that the civil rights laws this Congress passes will continue to protect all Americans. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New York who, I think, has given a very sympathetic listen to what we are trying to accomplish here. This issue, in fact, emanates in large part originally from his State and from some of the practices in his State that are now becoming nationwide. 
I think he has shown here, in his comments, already a keen understanding of what is involved here. Even though this issue has not been presented formally to his committee, he clearly understands that what is being requested of some of these individuals is simply unreasonable in light of American traditions of protection from discrimination and sexual harassment. 
So, even though I think this bill is a very appropriate vehicle to offer this amendment, I am grateful the chairman of the Banking Committee has agreed to hold a hearing in which he will be personally involved, in which I will have the opportunity to testify, prior to the end of July, on this bill. 
I look forward to being able to participate in helping to select some of the witnesses. I agree with the Senator very strongly that there are people on both sides, as well as those in the middle such as the SEC, who are seriously looking at this. This would be a useful hearing to move this issue along. I happen to be a member of the Judiciary Committee as well, so I certainly regard this as an appropriate forum as well. But I think this committee, in light of the fact these agreements started in securities firms, is a place where a hearing would be appropriate. 
I also understand the Senator does not expect in any way I would be prevented from offering this to other bills at any point. 
But, in light of all that and his assurances--which have always been extremely secure whenever I have dealt with him in the past, for the last 5 1/2 years--in light of all that, I look forward to the hearing, I look forward to working with him. I hope that he can support this legislation after he has had a chance to review it. 
Given all that, at this point, Madam President, I withdraw the amendment.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, during the last few days, both in Israel and around the world, Jews and millions of others have been celebrating the 50th anniversary of the birth of Israel. A celebration of Israel is a celebration of democracy, prosperity, faith and the fulfillment of the dream of a Jewish homeland. 
It was on May 14, 1948, that David Ben-Gurion announced Israel's birth to the world. Fifty years later, Israel is a mature state--a survivor of wars, assassinations and painful regional conflicts. And Israel has not only survived, it has prospered and thrived. 
It has bloomed in the desert, taking root against seemingly impossible odds. 
But it does not surprise us, for we know that overcoming the insurmountable is the story of the Jewish people. Examples of Israel's achievements abound: it is a world leader in developing agricultural techniques for arid climates, and in harnessing the power of solar energy. 
Ben-Gurion believed that Israel could lead the world to a better future by marrying the ethical teachings of the ancients with the discoveries of modern science. `It is only by the integration of the two,' he wrote, `that the blessings of both can flourish.' 
Israel ranks among the most advanced economies in the world, and is a vigorous democracy in a region of largely authoritarian regimes. Voter turnout for Israel's 1996 elections were about 80 percent, a high turnout by any standard, and one that surpasses and challenges the United States, which had just 49 percent turnout that same year. And Israel has successfully resettled Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Republics and across the globe, including absorbing 680,000 immigrants during a three year period. The culture of Israel is equally vibrant, as Israelis have drawn on their dramatic personal and national histories to create invaluable contributions to the arts. 
At 50, Israel has character, strength and dignity. Of course, like anyone who reaches 50, Israel is also experiencing something of a mid-life crisis. 
As Israelis take stock of their achievements at this important moment in their history, they find problems yet to be solved and many goals yet to be reached. Israel has not yet made peace with all of her neighbors, and difficult decisions about how to achieve peace, or whether to continue to, at this point, seek peace at all, are causing painful rifts in Israeli society. 
Personally, I look at Israel from many perspectives--as an American, as a Jew, as a United States Senator and as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
As an American, I see Israel as a staunch ally and friend. As a Jew, I see a spiritual homeland, a place where all Jews have a claim, a right to belong. Israel is an oasis of faith for Jews in every corner of the world. As a United States Senator and member of the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee, I take a deep interest in Israel and the Middle East peace process. 
I first visited Israel when I was 19 years old. My father and mother took me as a way to educate me about the importance of Israel, and the trip had an enormously powerful impact on me. I returned two more times, in 1976 and 1977, while I was a student at Oxford University. 
My strongest memory of that last trip was our visit to the Western Wall, when I brushed up against a soldier carrying a machine gun under his jacket. It was then that I felt for the first time, through the cold steel of a weapon, what it was like to exist in a society where the threat of violence was a constant. At the time, I hoped upon my next return to Israel that there would be peace in the region--never realizing that we would find ourselves in the stalemate we are in today so many years later. For these 21 years since then, I was unable to return to Israel except for one time and one time only--and then only for 10 hours--for the sad occasion of Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in November 1995. 
I went as a very young man and returned much changed--I had become a Senator, a husband and a father--but was still awed by the powerful presence of faith and hope, violence and conflict that still characterize the Jewish state today. 
In between these visits, I had the opportunity to study the evolving relationship between Israel and the United States for a paper I did for a history course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. To research this paper, I read all the comments of Members of Congress in the Congressional Record concerning Israel for the years 1948, 1956, 1967 and 1973, and analyzed how those comments reflected a changing definition of U.S. interests in the region from the birth of Israel, through the Suez Crisis, the Six Day War and the Yom Kippur War. 
In 1948, most of the talk was about the need for a homeland for the Jewish people, especially after the Holocaust. In 1956, that talk shifted to describing Israel as a blooming democracy; a small outpost of democratic values in the midst of a non-democratic region. In 1967, Israel was the non-aggressive dove who triumphed in a hostile environment. By 1973, my predecessors had shifted to speaking of Israel in a very positive geopolitical and national security terms. 
Today, I add my own remarks about Israel to the long chronicle of the American-Israeli relationship in the Congressional Record to those of my predecessors who came to speak in times of crisis and triumph for Israel.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we take up this important anti-slamming bill, which of course deals with consumer problems with telephone service, I am pleased that the Senate has agreed to this amendment to provide a practical solution to the all too common problem of interference with residential home electronic equipment caused by unlawful use of citizens band [CB] radios. I want to thank the Chairman of the Committee, Senator McCain, and the ranking member, Senator Hollings, for agreeing to include this amendment in the slamming bill. 
The problem of CB radio interference can be extremely distressing for residents who cannot have a telephone conversation, watch television, or listen to the radio without being interrupted by a neighbor's illegal use of a CB radio. Unfortunately, under the current law, those residents have little recourse. The amendment I offered today will provide those residents with a practical solution to this problem. 
Up until recently, the FCC has enforced its rules outlining what equipment may or may not be used for CB radio transmissions, how long transmissions may be broadcast, what channels may be used, as well as many other technical requirements. FCC also investigated complaints that a CB radio enthusiast's transmissions interfered with a neighbor's use of home electronic and telephone equipment. FCC receives thousands of such complaints annually. 
For the past 3 years, I have worked with constituents who have been bothered by persistent interference of nearby CB radio transmissions in some cases caused by unlawful use of radio equipment. In each case, the constituents have sought my help in securing an FCC investigation of the complaint. And in each case, the FCC indicated that due to a lack of resources, the Commission no longer investigates radio frequency interference complaints. Instead of investigation and enforcement, the FCC is able to provide only self-help information which the consumer may use to limit the interference on their own. 
I suppose this situation is understandable given the rising number of complaints for things like slamming. The resources of the FCC are limited, and there is only so much they can do to address complaints of radio interference. 
Nonetheless, this problem is extremely annoying and frustrating to those who experience it. In many cases, residents implement the self-help measures recommended by FCC such as installing filtering devices to prevent the unwanted interference, working with their telephone company, or attempting to work with the neighbor they believe is causing the interference. In many cases these self-help measures are effective. 
However, in some cases filters and other technical solutions fail to solve the problem because the interference is caused by unlawful use of CB radio equipment such as unauthorized linear amplifiers. 
Municipal residents, after being denied investigative or enforcement assistance from the FCC, frequently contact their city or town government and ask them to police the interference. However, the Communications Act of 1934 provides exclusive authority to the Federal Government for the regulation of radio, preempting municipal ordinances or State laws to regulate radio frequency interference caused by unlawful use of CB radio equipment. This has created an interesting dilemma for municipal governments. They can neither pass their own ordinances to control CB radio interference, nor can they rely on the agency with exclusive jurisdiction over interference to enforce the very Federal law which preempts them. 
Let me give an example of the kind of frustrations people have experienced in attempting to deal with these problems. Shannon Ladwig, a resident of Beloit, WI has been fighting to end CB interference with her home electronic equipment that has been plaguing her family for over a year. Shannon worked within the existing system, asking for an FCC investigation, installing filtering equipment on her telephone, attempting to work with the neighbor causing the interference, and so on. Nothing has been effective. 
Here are some of the annoyances Shannon has experienced. Her answering machine picks up calls for which there is no audible ring, and at times records ghost messages. Often, she cannot get a dial tone when she or her family members wish to place an outgoing call. During telephone conversations, the content of the nearby CB transmission can frequently be heard and on occasion, her phone conversations are inexplicably cut off. Ms. Ladwig's TV transmits audio from the CB transmission rather than the television program her family is watching. Shannon never knows if the TV program she taped with her VCR will actually record the intended program or whether it will contain profanity from a nearby CB radio conversation. 
Shannon did everything she could to solve the problem and a year later she still feels like a prisoner in her home, unable to escape the broadcasting whims of a CB operator using illegal equipment with impunity. Shannon even went to her city council to demand action. The Beloit City Council responded by passing an ordinance allowing local law enforcement to enforce FCC regulations--an ordinance the council knows is preempted by Federal law. Last year, the Beloit City Council passed a resolution supporting legislation I introduced, S. 608, on which my amendment is modeled, which will allow at least part of that ordinance to stand. 
The problems experienced by Beloit residents are by no means isolated incidents. I have received very similar complaints from at least 10 other Wisconsin communities in the last several years in which whole neighborhoods are experiencing persistent radio frequency interference. Since I have begun working on this issue, my staff has also been contacted by a number of other congressional offices who are also looking for a solution to the problem of radio frequency interference in their States or districts caused by unlawful CB use. The city of Grand Rapids, MI, in particular, has contacted me about this legislation because they face a persistent 
interference problem very similar to that in Beloit. In all, FCC receives more than 30,000 radio frequency interference complaints annually--most of which are caused by CB radios. Unfortunately, FCC no longer has the staff, resources, or the field capability to investigate these complaints and localities are blocked from exercising any jurisdiction to provide relief to their residents. 
My amendment attempts to resolve this Catch-22, by allowing States and localities to enforce existing FCC regulations regarding authorized CB equipment and frequencies while maintaining exclusive Federal jurisdiction over the regulation of radio services. It is a commonsense solution to a very frustrating and real problem which cannot be addressed under existing law. Residents should not be held hostage to a Federal law which purports to protect them but which cannot be enforced. 
Now this amendment is by no means a panacea for the problem of radio frequency interference. It is intended only to help localities solve the most egregious and persistent problems of interference--those caused by unauthorized use of CB radio equipment and frequencies. In cases where interference is caused by the legal and licensed operation of any radio service, residents will need to resolve the interference using FCC self-help measures that I mentioned earlier. 
In many cases, interference can result from inadequate home electronic equipment immunity from radio frequency interference. Those problems can only be resolved by installing filtering equipment and by improving the manufacturing standards of home telecommunications equipment. 
The electronic equipment manufacturing industry, represented by the Telecommunications Industry Association and the Electronics Industry Association, working with the Federal Communications Commission, has adopted voluntary standards to improve the immunity of telephones from interference. Those standards were adopted by the American National Standards Institute last year. Manufacturers of electronic equipment should be encouraged to adopt these new ANSI standards. Consumers have a right to expect that the telephones they purchase will operate as expected without excessive levels of interference from legal radio transmissions. Of course, Mr. President, these standards assume legal operation of radio equipment and cannot protect residents from interference from illegal operation of CB equipment. 
This amendment also does not address interference caused by other radio services, such as commercial stations or amateur stations. Mr. President, last year, I introduced S. 2025, a bill with intent similar to that of the amendment I am offering today. The American Radio Relay League [ARRL], an organization representing amateur radio operators, frequently referred to as `ham' operators, raised a number of concerns about that legislation. ARRL was concerned that while the bill was intended to cover only illegal use of CB equipment, FCC-licensed amateur radio operators might inadvertently be targeted and prosecuted by local law enforcement. ARRL also expressed concern that local law enforcement might not have the technical abilities to distinguish between ham stations and CB stations and might not be able to determine what CB equipment was FCC-authorized and what equipment is illegal. 
I have worked with the ARRL and amateur operators from Wisconsin to address these concerns. As a result of those discussions, this amendment incorporates a number of provisions suggested by the league. First, the amendment makes clear that the limited enforcement authority provided to localities in no way diminishes or affects FCC's exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of radio. Second, the amendment clarifies that possession of an FCC license to operate a radio service for the operation at issue, such as an amateur station, is a complete protection against any local law enforcement action authorized by this amendment. Amateur radio enthusiasts are not only individually licensed by FCC, unlike CB operators, but they also self-regulate. The ARRL is very involved in resolving interference concerns both among their own members and between ham operators and residents experiencing problems. 
Third, the amendment also provides for an FCC appeal process by any radio operator who is adversely affected by a local law enforcement action under this amendment. FCC will make determinations as to whether the locality acted properly within the limited jurisdiction this legislation provides. The FCC will have the power to reverse the action of the locality if local law enforcement acted improperly. And fourth, my legislation requires FCC to provide States and localities with technical guidance on how to determine whether a CB operator is acting within the law. 
Again, Mr. President, my amendment is narrowly targeted to resolve persistent interference with home electronic equipment caused by illegal CB operation. Under my amendment, localities cannot establish their own regulations on CB use. They may only enforce existing FCC regulations on authorized CB equipment and frequencies. This amendment will not resolve all interference problems and it is not intended to do so. Some interference problems need to continue to be addressed by the FCC, the telecommunications manufacturing industry, and radio service operators. This amendment merely provides localities with the tools they need to protect their residents while preserving FCC's exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over the regulation of radio services. 
I am very pleased that this amendment has been accepted, and I hope it will become law along with the anti-slamming bill.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise to speak in support of the anti-slamming bill, S. 1618. I want to commend Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and the rest of the Commerce Committee for bringing this bill to the floor, and I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill. 
Slamming is an important and widespread consumer problem, and it is high time that the Congress takes action to stop it. Slamming, as most people now know, is a practice carried out by some telecommunications companies to switch a consumer's long distance or local exchange carrier without the consumer's knowledge or consent. Only a few years ago this practice, while persistent and frustrating for some consumers, appeared limited in scope. However, in more recent years this type of consumer fraud appears to have grown into a common profit-making scheme of some telecommunications companies carried out at the consumer's expense. 
The rise in slamming complaints has been absolutely astonishing. The Federal Communications Commission reports that the 11,000 slamming complaints they received in 1995 represented a sixfold increase in the number of complaints received in 1993. By 1996, slamming complaints rose by an additional 42 percent over 1995, with the FCC receiving more than 16,000 complaints. And in 1997, the FCC received 44,000 complaints from consumers, nearly triple the 1996 total. 
But these numbers only begin to tell the story. In Wisconsin, slamming is the number one telecommunications complaint, and telecommunications is the single largest category of consumer complaints that the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection received last year. That agency reports that slamming complaints were up 400 percent in 1997. The National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates estimates that as many as one million consumers each year have their long distance carrier or local provider switched without consent. 
In September of 1997, the National Consumers League polled telecommunications consumers in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Chicago, Illinois, and Detroit/Grand Rapids, Michigan. The poll showed that of the 1500 individuals surveyed, three out of 10 reported that they, or someone they know, had been slammed. In Milwaukee, of those who said they had experience with slamming, 41% said their own telephone carrier had been changed without their consent. Even more disturbing, the survey provided evidence that slammers appear to be targeting consumers who have high long distance bills, raising privacy concerns regarding billing information. 
Mr. President, this is consumer fraud of monstrous proportions. It causes extra cost and inconvenience to consumers, and it also distorts telecommunications markets and discourages legitimate competitive practices. The prevalence of slamming and the lack of any strong disincentives against it rewards companies that use this fraudulent practice and penalizes those that seek new customers through legitimate and honest means. 
The 1996 Telecommunications Act recognized the slamming problem and broadened the scope of FCC's regulatory authority over slamming to cover all telecommunications carriers rather than just long distance service providers. The Act also provided that a carrier that violates the FCC's verification requirements is liable to the customer's original carrier for all charges paid by the customer after he or she had been slammed. 
The FCC now has rules prohibiting slamming and requires companies to verify the customer's authorization of any switch in carriers, but these rules obviously haven't done the trick. For one thing, the penalties for slamming just aren't tough enough. While the FCC has taken enforcement action against a number of telecommunications companies, the tremendous profit opportunities from slamming overwhelm the threat of FCC enforcement. 
The Consumer Anti-Slamming Act should be an effective antidote to this problem. It establishes minimum verification requirements for submitting changes in local or long distance telephone service. The requirements apply when service is first requested as well. The bill also bans so-called `negative option' marketing--this is where a company sends you a letter that says your service will be switched unless you send back a reply card to say no. With all the junk mail that people now receive, this is a particularly reprehensible business practice, and I am pleased that this bill outlaws it. 
The bill also addresses the problem that many people do not even know that when they have been slammed by requiring the new telecommunications company to notify a consumer within 15 days of a change in service. The notification must indicate the name of the person who requested the change and inform the consumer that he or she may request further information about when and how the change was authorized. It must also contain information about how to pursue a complaint if the customer believes he or she has been slammed. 
Penalties are also significantly increased in this bill. The FCC may award damages of $500 or the actual damages incurred, whichever is greater, directly to the consumer. And the FCC can fine carriers who violate the anti-slamming regulations $40,000 for a first offence and $150,000 for additional offences. These significant penalties should eliminate the economic incentives to engage in these illegal practices. 
Mr. President, the information age has now arrived. Technological advances hold out great promise for making our daily lives easier and more enjoyable. Competition is the driving force in bringing those advances to the consumer at ever more affordable prices. Allowing consumers to choose between competing long distance and local service providers should improve service and lower prices. But when irresponsible or even criminal elements seek to take advantage of unsuspecting consumers through activities like slamming, forceful regulation is necessary. 
The unethical and illegal practices of companies who seek to victimize consumers to enhance their own profits must not be tolerated. Protecting consumers from those who engage in these practices is one of my most important responsibilities as a United States Senator. I believe that this bill gives the FCC the tools it needs to crack down on the slamming problem once and for all. I am proud to vote for it.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, the Senate passed the conference agreement on S. 1150, the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998. I am pleased that this important legislation, containing several amendments I authored, has seen its way to the Senate floor for proper and overdue consideration and passage. 
Mr. President, the agricultural provisions of this bill are important for all farmers but I am especially proud of the provisions targeted to support our endangered small farmers. 
Mr. President, this country is facing a national farming crisis. Day after day, season after season, we are losing small farms at an alarming rate. In 1980, there were 45,000 dairy farms in Wisconsin. In 1997, there are only 24,000 dairy farms. That is a loss of more than 3 dairy farms a day-everyday for 17 years. And it does not begin to measure the human cost to families driven from the land. As small farms disappear, we are witnessing the emergence of larger agricultural operations. This trend toward fewer but larger dairy operations is mirrored in most States throughout the Nation. 
Mr. President, the economic losses associated with the reduction in the number of small farms go well beyond the impact on the individual farm families who must wrench themselves from the land. The reduction in farm numbers has hurt their neighbors as well and deprived the merchants on the main streets of their towns of many lifelong customers. For many of the rural communities of Wisconsin, small family-owned farms are the key component of the community. They provide economic and sound stability. They are good people and we need a system in which their farms are viable and their work can be fairly rewarded. 
Many feel that basic research is a necessary and underutilized tool that can help to save this dying breed of farmers. There have been plenty of Federal investments in agricultural research, past and present, focusing almost solely on the needs of larger scale agricultural producers-neglecting the specific research needs of small producers. This research bias has hamstrung small farmers, depriving them of the tools they need to adapt to changes in farming and the marketplace and accelerating the trend toward increased concentration. 
To address this concern, I worked with the conference committee to include a provision which authorizes a coordinated program of research, extension, and education to improve the viability of small- and medium-size dairy and livestock operations. Among the research projects the Secretary is authorized to conduct are: Research, development, and on-farm education, low-cost production facilities, management systems and genetics appropriate for these small and medium operations, research and extension on management intensive grazing systems which reduce feed costs and improve farm profitability, research and extension on integrated crop and livestock systems that strengthen the competitive position of small- and medium-size operations, economic analyses and feasibility studies to identify new marketing opportunities for small- and medium-size producers, technology assessment that compares the technological resources of large specialized producers with the technological needs of small- and medium-size dairy and livestock operations, and research to identify the specific research and education needs of these small operations. 
The provision allows the Secretary to carry out this new program using existing USDA funds, facilities and technical expertise. Dairy and livestock producers should not be forced to become larger in order to remain competitive. Bigger is not necessarily better. And in fact, M. President, expansion is often counterproductive for small operations, requiring them to take on even greater debt. Farmers need more help in determining other methods of maintaining long-term profitability. For example, small dairy farmers may find adoption of management-intensive grazing systems, combined with a diversified cropping operation a profitable alternative to expansion. But there has been far too little federally funded research devoted to alternative livestock production systems. Small producers need more Federal research and extension activity devoted to the development of these alternatives. This amendment is a good first step in establishing the Federal research commitment to help develop and promote production and marketing systems that specifically address the needs of small producers. 
Using research dollars to help maintain the economic viability of small- and medium-size dairy and livestock operations has benefits beyond those gained by farmers and the communities in which they reside. Keeping a large number of small operations in production can provide environmental benefits as well. As livestock operations expand their herd size without a corresponding increase in cropping acreage, manure storage and management practices become more costly and more burdensome for the operator and raise additional regulatory concerns associated with runoff and water quality among State and Federal regulators. Research that helps dairy and livestock operators remain competitive and profitable without dramatic expansion will help minimize these concerns. 
Mr. President, also incorporated into the bill is language requiring the Secretary to fund research on the competitiveness and viability of small- and medium-size farms under the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems--a new research program authorized by S. 1150 and funded at a total of $600 million for fiscal years 1999 through 2002. With the inclusion of my amendment, the Secretary is directed to make grants for research projects addressing the viability of small- and medium-size farming operations with funding made available under the Initiative in fiscal years 1999-2002. This amendment ensures that the research needs of small dairy, livestock, and cropping operations will be addressed under the substantial new funding provided for agricultural research in this bill. 
Finally, Mr. President, the conference committee also accepted important language regarding precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is a system of farming that uses very site-specific information on soil nutrient needs and presence of plant pests, often gathered using advanced technologies such as global positioning systems, high performance image processing, and software systems to determine the specific fertilizer, pesticide and other input needs of a farmer's cropland. This technology may have the benefit of lowering farm production costs and increase profitability by helping the producer reduce agricultural inputs by applying them only where needed. In addition, reducing agricultural inputs may minimize the impact of crop production on wildlife and the environment. While precision agriculture, generally defined, encompasses a broad range of techniques from high-technology satellite imaging systems to manual soil sampling, it is most frequently discussed in terms of the use of capital intensive advanced technologies. 
Precision agriculture may result in production efficiencies and improved profitability for some farms, yet many in agriculture are concerned that, because of the capital intensive nature of precision agriculture systems, this new technology will not be applicable or accessible to small or highly diversified farms. It is unclear whether precision agriculture services, even if provided by input suppliers, will be available at affordable rates to small farms. Furthermore, some observers are concerned that private firms may find that marketing efforts directed at small farms are not lucrative enough and thus may avoid efforts to apply the technology to small operations. 
In addition to concerns about the applicability and accessibility of precision agriculture to small farms, many are concerned that precision agriculture may not be the most appropriate production system for small farms given the costs of acquiring new technology or contracting for additional services. There may be other production systems, such as integrated whole farm crop, livestock, and resource management systems, that allow small farmers to reduce input costs, improve profitability, and minimize environmental impacts of agricultural production that are more appropriate for smaller operations. 
To address this concern, accepted language allows USDA to fund studies evaluating whether precision agriculture technologies are applicable or accessible to small- and medium-sized farms. The amendment also allows USDA to conduct research on methods to improve the applicability of precision agriculture to these operations. It is critical that USDA's research investment in this new technology not exclude the needs of small farmers. If it does, this new research program could ultimately affect the structure of agriculture, potentially providing disproportionate advantages to large scale farming operations, accelerating the trend to fewer and larger farms. My amendment will allow USDA to conduct research on low cost precision agriculture systems that do not require significant financial investments by farmers and that may be more appropriate to small or highly diversified farming operations. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the chairman, Mr. Lugar, and the ranking member, Mr. Harkin, of the Agriculture Committee and their staff in addressing the important research needs of small- and medium-size farms by maintaining these amendments during conference committee consideration of this bill. 
These amendments will ensure that research money is directed at the interests of the small farmer providing the tools to make these operations viable to survive the riggers of farming in the next century.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as we approach so-called Tax Freedom Day, I rise to offer some comments about the IRS Reform measure before us, and to address some more general issues on the state of our tax code. 
Mr. President, let me begin by especially commending the senior Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Kerrey, for his efforts to bring IRS reform before the body. His long involvement in this issue, and his unflagging efforts to bring these reforms before us deserve our highest praise. 
This bill is very much the product of Senator Kerrey's work, and American taxpayers are fortunate to have his gifted advocacy. 
Mr. President, there are many significant reforms included in the bill before us, but one that I was especially interested to see included mirrors legislation I was pleased to join in introducing with the senior Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy) . 
Our measure would extend the protections of the Equal Access to Justice Act to taxpayers who have had actions brought against them by the IRS. 
Mr. President, for those who are not familiar with this important Act, it was established in response to the dilemma individuals and small businesses face when the government brings an unjustified action against them that may be relatively expensive to contest. 
Even though they may feel very strongly that they are right and they did nothing wrong, they feel they cannot pay the costs associated with it. 
Too often, an individual or a small business may feel forced to forgo contesting the government's action, feeling that any potential fine or forfeiture would be less expensive than the cost of fighting the government in court. 
Mr. President, I saw this long before I entered the political world as an attorney representing small business people who faced this frustration and feeling that they really couldn't fight the Government in these cases because of the problems with fines, and especially attorneys' fees. 
Under the Equal Access to Justice Act, those individuals and small businesses are entitled to recover their court costs if they are successful in fighting the government action. 
Mr. President, as a member of the Wisconsin State Senate, I worked to establish an Equal Access to Justice law for Wisconsin, and since coming to this body, I have offered measures to further strengthen the Federal law in this regard. 
This bill, the IRS bill, is a golden opportunity for us to improve this law by including in large part the provisions of the bill Senator Leahy and I introduced that would make the IRS have to play by these rules as well. 
I also want to thank the managers of the bill for accepting the amendment my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, and I offered regarding the equal employment opportunity problems that were brought to our attention by IRS employees in Wisconsin. 
This matter came to the attention of the Finance Committee at a recent hearing, and I very much hope the action we are taking in this legislation will help resolve those problems. 
Mr. President, the IRS reform bill before us is by and large a good response to many of the problems with our current tax collection system. 
The tax collection system is a vitally important issue, and it certainly contributes to the larger issue surrounding the Tax Code itself. Of course, the problems with the Tax Code are likely to be much thornier to address, and as we approach what has been called Tax Freedom Day, I want to offer a few comments on the challenges we face in taking the next step beyond this bill in reforming the Tax Code itself. 
We have all heard about this Tax Freedom Day. There is some dispute about when it really is, but it is supposed to be the day by which we have worked enough to pay our taxes for the year. The Tax Foundation maintains that the date is May 10. Other organizations question that and point to other dates. One says Tax Freedom Day is really April 22. Looking just at the Federal personal income tax, some say Tax Freedom Day for the typical taxpayer is really January 20. So it may be interesting to examine all of these estimates and compare the differences in the way we calculate Tax Freedom Day. But without trying to argue which day is the right day, I think we can at least agree there probably is not anyone who, if told their own tax freedom day was this Sunday, wouldn't prefer that it was Saturday instead. No one likes to pay taxes and everyone would like to pay less than they do now. For most people this would be a key part of tax reform, and I think they are right. 
Although we may not be voting on a significant overhaul of the Tax Code this year, I really hope that serious debate of various tax reform proposals can begin. This was something that was identified as one of the very top four or five priorities after the 1994 election, to have a debate about tax reform. But we have never had that debate over the past 4 years. The work that has gone into the IRS reform bill, and especially the leadership of Senator Kerrey, shows how much can be done if this body actually works toward reform. And I think the same would be true if we really dedicated ourselves to tax reform legislation. 
While we may not be voting on tax reform this year, we are certainly likely to be taking actions, including apparently passing tax bills, that will have a direct bearing on tax reform when it does finally come before us. 
With this in mind as we take actions that are likely to have this downstream effect on tax reform, I hope we keep various principles in mind. We should promote equity and fairness; we should resist complexity; and we should insist on fiscal responsibility. 
An aspect of the current Tax Code that really strains each of these principles, and which contributes to our having a later Tax Freedom Day for most of us, is, in fact, the huge number of special interest provisions that appear throughout the Tax Code. It is riddled with them. These provisions, often called tax expenditures, have been enacted over the years to help specific groups of taxpayers but they have come at a cost. They come at a cost of lost revenue, and that ends up being a burden that other taxpayers are left to bear through higher taxes. 
While some tax expenditures are justified, many are not. And they can combine to produce significant tax avoidance by some of the biggest and most profitable financial interests in the world. 
One example related to me recently concerned one of our largest automakers, a firm that is obviously one of the largest and most successful corporations in our Nation's history. This enormous corporation reportedly had billions in U.S. profits for 
1995 and 1996. But they didn't pay one penny of Federal income tax. In fact, they actually got refunds totaling over $1 billion. In a case like this, for a company like this, Tax Freedom Day isn't in May or April or March or even January 1. It must be last December because they were getting a refund. That is a real freedom from taxation. 
This kind of special treatment is, unfortunately, all too common, and while Tax Freedom Day may not be in the previous tax year for all of these interests as in the example I gave, it is certainly the case that while many of us have to work until the flowers are blooming to pay our taxes for the year, many special interests get their tax freedom at least by Groundhog Day. Thousands and thousands of interests have been able to slip special provisions into the Tax Code over the years, increasing the tax burden for the rest of us and further complicating the Tax Code. 
I am sorry to say that in the past few years Congress has not stopped this trend. It has not slowed this trend. Congress has continued down this path. On an almost annual basis, Congress passes more and more of these special provisions. And these special provisions not only add to the Tax Code's complexity while shifting a greater tax burden on the rest of us, they actually also undermine our ability to get to that genuine tax reform that all of us are talking about. Again, sorry to say, although I believe it is correct, last year's so-called tax cut bill was a prime example of this sort of abuse. 
First and foremost, it was premature. It was not fiscally responsible. Despite all of our recent good economic news and the windfalls to the Government's bottom line, according to the most recent CBO estimate, we are still nearly $100 billion short of a truly balanced budget. We have not balanced our books, unless you are somehow willing to again and again, as has been done for far too many years, use the Social Security trust fund balances to, in effect, mask the currently existing deficit. The real budget is still in deficit, and last year's tax cut bill has made it harder to finish our most important task, and that is to actually balance the Federal budget. 
Making matters worse, the cost of that tax bill was heavily back loaded, putting even more pressure on our budget just when the baby boomers begin to retire. That tax bill, of course, added even more layers of complexity to a Tax Code that was already thick with it, and that complexity was not only to the entire code, it reached down to the level of the individual taxpayer. Anyone who had to fill out some of the tax forms that were changed because of the 1997 tax bill knows just how much more complex taxes became because of last year's legislation. 
Mr. President, I use last year's tax bill as an example only because I want to make the point that these problems not only are reason to fault that specific legislation, they also, again, undermine our ability to get anywhere near genuine tax reform. Tax reform inevitably creates winners and losers. But we have a better chance of enacting reform if at the time of doing the reform we can increase the number of winners and decrease the number of losers by cutting taxes at the same time that you enact reform. Do not do the complex and all the things that mess it up first and then expect the resources to be available when we have to do tax reform. We have to link the effort to simplify the Tax Code and give some people tax relief. 
Simply put, if you could lower taxes while you reformed the code, you sure would have a better chance of enacting real reform. Unfortunately, what last year's tax bill did was commit hundreds of billions of dollars that could have gone to help us achieve true tax reform. It also, unfortunately, created several new classes of winners under the current system, groups that will benefit from the specific provisions in the bill. Why do I say `unfortunately'? Because these winners, and these winners were only a very few among us--there were far more losers than winners--these few winners now have a bigger stake in the current tax system and they will now be less likely to want to give up their gains or will again require greater tax cuts to allow us to move to a new system. We keep creating our own inertia against reform by giving out more of these tax break goodies. 
And, as the history of our Tax Code has shown, special tax provisions lead to even more special tax provisions. 
So, as we approach what I hope is a real effort to achieve significant tax reform, and as we consider those tax bills that will work their way to us prior to that larger debate, I hope we will, again, keep three principles in mind: We should use our Tax Code to promote equity and fairness, we should resist complexity in the Tax Code, and we should insist on fiscal responsibility when we are taking actions with respect to the Tax Code. Adhering to these three principles will not only result in better tax bills, it will also pave the way for truly significant tax reform, tax reform that will move Tax Freedom Day back for all American families. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote in favor of the Craig amendment that would require specific congressional authorization for the deployment of troops to Bosnia. 
However, I would like to make clear that I am supporting this amendment for reasons that I think differ slightly from the intentions of its author, the distinguished Senator from Idaho. 
As my colleagues in this Chamber know well, I have always had serious questions about U.S. involvement in this mission. I was the only Democrat to vote against the deployment of U.S. troops back in 1995, in large part because I did not believe the United States would be able to complete the mission in the time projected and for the price tag that was originally estimated. 
Now--more than two years later--I think I have been proven right, and I take no pleasure in it. 
But, regardless of my objections to the mission, I have always felt it is vitally important that when large-scale deployment of U.S. troops is involved, it is necessary to have specific congressional authorization for it. And I have tried on several occasions to move the Congress to enact such authorization. In that light, I view the Craig amendment as another such attempt. 
Unlike Senator Craig, however, I support the expansion of NATO and do not feel this amendment is inconsistent with that support. 
Unlike Senator Craig, I am not necessarily opposed to the involvement of NATO in peacekeeping missions. 
There may be times in the future when it would be appropriate for NATO to become involved in peacekeeping missions when conflicts threaten the security of NATO members. 
But I do agree with Senator Craig that if and when these situations arise, if the deployment of U.S. troops is proposed, it will be necessary to get specific Congressional authorization for such deployment. 
It is for this reason that I support Senator Craig's amendment.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 1982, the Dairy Reform Act of 1998, introduced by my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Rod Grams. The Federal Dairy Program was developed in the 1930's, when the Upper Midwest was seen as the primary reserve for additional supplies of milk. The idea was to encourage the development of local supplies of fluid milk in areas of the country that had not produced enough to meet local needs. Six decades ago, the poor condition of the American transportation infrastructure and the lack of portable refrigeration technology prevented Upper Midwest producers from shipping fresh fluid milk to other parts of the country. Therefore, the only way to ensure consumers a fresh local supply of fluid milk was to provide dairy farmers in those distant regions with a boost in milk price large enough to encourage local production--that higher price referred to as the Class I differential. Mr. President, the system worked well--too well. Wisconsin is no longer this country's largest milk producer. This program has outlived its necessity and is now working only to shortchange the Upper Midwest, and in particular, Wisconsin dairy farmers. 
The Dairy Reform Act of 1998 is very simple. It establishes that the minimum Class I price differential will be the same, $1.80/hundredweight, for each marketing order. As many of you know, the price for fluid milk increases at a rate of approximately 21 cents per 100 miles from Eau Claire, WI. Fluid milk prices, as a result, are nearly $3 higher in Florida than in Wisconsin, more than $2 higher in New England, and more than $1 higher in Texas. This bill ensures that the Class I differentials will no longer vary according to an arbitrary geographic measure--like the distance from Eau Claire Wisconsin. No longer will the system penalize producers in the Upper Midwest with an archaic program that outlived its purpose years ago. This legislation identifies one of the most unfair and unjustly punitive provisions in the current system, and corrects it. There is no substantive, equitable justification to support non-uniform Class I differentials in present day policy. 
USDA's Federal Milk Marketing Order reform proposal is currently being considered. It is long past the time to set aside regional bickering and address the problems in both options presented under the proposed rule. The Dairy Reform Act of 1998 will not adversely affect the modest reform of Option 1B as offered by Secretary Glickman. It will take Option 1B a step further and lead the dairy industry into a more market oriented program. Also producers will still be able to receive payment for transportation costs and over-order premiums. This measure would finally bring fairness to an unfair system. With this bill we will send a clear message to USDA and to Congress that Upper-Midwest dairy farmers will never stop fighting this patently unfair federal milk marketing order system. After over 60 years of struggling under this burden of inequality, Wisconsin's dairy industry deserves more; it deserves a fair price.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for Senate ratification of the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty on accession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. I have been privileged to participate in the historic debate on the enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a member of the Committee on Foreign Relations. Since last October, the committee has held 8 hearings on this issue and heard testimony from 37 witnesses with a variety of opinions on NATO enlargement. 
I will take this opportunity to thank the chairman of the committee, the Senator from North Carolina, and the committee's ranking member, Senator Biden, for the balanced manner in which these hearings were conducted and for their support for expeditious consideration of this important matter. 
As we all know, Mr. President, NATO has been the most important factor in maintaining peace in Europe since the devastation of World War II. As we prepare to mark the alliance's 50th anniversary next year, it is appropriate to look back on its successes and look forward to see what role NATO will play in the next 50 years. The world will be a much different place in 1999 than it was in 1949 when this alliance was formed as a buffer against Soviet aggression and as a means of protection for nations whose people had just emerged from one of the costliest wars, in both human and financial terms, in our history. 
But to fully understand and appreciate what the security of NATO represents to the people of Eastern Europe, we must first remember what they have endured in the years since we celebrated V-E Day. At the same time the people of Western Europe were working to found an alliance that would ensure security and were fighting to rebuild their countries and the economies after the fall of the Third Reich, a new threat was emerging on the other side of the continent. 
The Soviet Union, which had been our ally against Hitler, was about to become our foe in a cold war that would last almost a half century and result in the sacrifice of lives, traditions, and religious liberty throughout Eastern Europe. The people of Eastern Europe barely had time to recover from the devastation of a world war when they were faced with Soviet tanks. Foreign subjugation was, of course, nothing new for the people of Eastern and Central Europe. 
For centuries, Mr. President, this part of the world had been a battleground where people and territory seemed little more than spoils in a seemingly endless series of bloody fights. Bit by bit, the Soviet Union redrew Europe's map until it swallowed up the entire eastern and central region. Under the reign of the Communist Party, people lived in fear that they would be accused of being disloyal to the party. Religion was outlawed, and the myriad beautiful places of worship in the Soviet Union were left vacant; many were destroyed. 
In spite of the treatment they were forced to endure at the hands of the Soviet regime, the people of Eastern Europe never lost their will to be free, as demonstrated by events such as the Prague Spring and the Solidarity movement. By the mid-1980s, the Soviet Union was beginning to crumble and the people of Eastern Europe yearned to satisfy their hunger for democracy and freedom. Beginning in 1989, the people of Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia peacefully ousted their Communist governments and replaced them with democracy. 
It was, in the words of Vaclav Havel, a `velvet revolution.' 
Because of modern technology, the world community has had a front-row seat for the transformation of Eastern Europe. We literally watched the Berlin Wall fall and marveled at cranes dismantling statues of Lenin and laying low the hammer and sickle. 
Today, nearly a half a century after World War II, the Iron Curtain is gone and the Soviet regime is no more. The changing face of Europe is marked by newly-independent countries eagerly embracing democracy for the first time in more than two generations. But the people of these former Soviet satellite countries still live in the shadow of the history of Soviet domination. These nations and their people seek to rejoin the West, and seek a means to ensure that they will never again fall victim to a Soviet-style regime. 
The lingering memory of Soviet domination was evident at the Winter 1998 Olympic Games, where a player on the Czech Republic's hockey team wore the number 68 to mark the February 25, 1968, invasion of his country by the Soviet Union. When the Czech Republic's hockey team beat the Russian team for the gold medal, many Czechs felt that the victory represented more than athletic excellence. It also symbolized their country's freedom from the Soviet domination of the past. 
Now, there is a new, democratic Russia, and the nations of Eastern Europe, which have become our friends and trading partners, are caught, both literally and figuratively, between this new Russia and the West. This is a critical time for the newly-independent states of Eastern Europe to establish themselves as countries in their own right, finally free of the yoke of Soviet domination. 
It is only natural that these Eastern European countries would seek to join NATO, an alliance which shines as a beacon of democracy and security on the European continent. The proposed enlargement of this alliance represents a crossroads in American foreign policy, and, indeed, in the fragile balance of power in Europe. Some opposed to enlarging this alliance have said that it would create a new series of dividing lines in Europe, between NATO, Russia, and those countries which are caught in the middle--neither members of NATO nor under the sphere of Russian influence. Others have argued that all countries meeting the criteria for membership in NATO should be allowed to join. Opponents fear that this would lead to a different dividing line --one between Russia and the rest of Europe. 
Many of my constituents, and indeed many people around the world, have a special interest in the debate over NATO enlargement due to their ethnic heritage or their memories of the iron fist of Soviet rule in Eastern Europe. I share their commitment to a Europe which will never again fall victim to such oppression. 
The proposed enlargement embodied in the protocols currently before this body leads to many questions: How many countries? How many rounds of enlargement? What about Russia? What about those that may be left out? 
It is my view that the newly-independent countries in Europe should not be forever caught between Russia and the West. It is also my strong view that the United States must proceed carefully so that we do not damage our relationship with a democratic Russia. Unfortunately, parts of the debate over NATO enlargement have taken on an `us versus them' quality. We must not forget that the Russian Federation is not the Soviet Union, and that we should encourage democracy wherever it takes root. Instead of the `us versus them' of the Cold War era, this debate should be about the new landscape of Europe. We 
must not make Russia feel as if it is being ganged up on by the West. We must encourage democracy there as we do elsewhere on the globe, and we must encourage the newly-independent states to take control of their own futures. 
That is why the Administration helped to successfully negotiate the NATO-Russia Founding Act. And that is why the language in the resolution of ratification currently before this body encourages the continuation of a constructive relationship between NATO and Russia. 
I support the fundamental goals of NATO enlargement, and believe it is in America's national interest to pursue this first round, as it has. However, I do have some concerns, that I know are shared by many other Members of Congress, about the commitment--financial and otherwise--the United States will undertake as it pursues enlargement of the alliance. 
On that point, Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment on one of my concerns about this debate: the disparity among the various estimates on the financial commitment the United States would be undertaking if NATO enlargement were to proceed. There have been at least three major studies conducted on this subject, each of which has taken a different approach with respect to the basis for their estimates. While I understand that it is impossible to account for all of the different variables that will be included in this endeavor, each study assumes a different set of costs, and thus reaches very different cost projections for the U.S. share of this undertaking--any- where from $2 billion to $7 billion. 
I am pleased that I was able to get clarification on this issue through the hearings we held in the Foreign Relations Committee, and I am pleased that the members of the Committee devoted so much time to this important aspect of NATO enlargement. The Committee based its evaluation of the estimated cost of NATO enlargement on the following four assumptions that can be found in the Department of Defense and NATO studies: 
First, because there is no immediate threat to NATO, the alliance will continue to operate in the current strategic environment for the foreseeable future. 
Second, NATO will not station substantial forces on the territories of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
Third--and this is a key point for me--NATO's standard burdensharing rules will apply to the costs of enlargement. 
Fourth, the modernization of the United States military is considered to be a strictly American project that will not be funded through the NATO common budget, and, thus, NATO enlargement will not require the United States to undertake any new force modernization initiatives beyond those already planned. 
Mr. President, I believe that these four assumptions are at the heart of the debate over the cost of NATO enlargement. While, in my view, the enlargement of the alliance is in the best interest of the United States, I remain committed to ensuring that the federal government achieves--and maintains--a balanced federal budget. The Committee's careful analysis of the costs involved in NATO enlargement addressed many of my concerns in this regard. I agree with the language included in the Committee Report which states that the Committee `stresses the importance of all current and future allies to meet their commitments to the common defense. Anything less will result in a hollow strategic commitment.' At the same time, I will look carefully at any of the amendments before us that seek to control the costs to the U.S. taxpayer of this enlargement. 
Because of the necessity of all NATO members to meet their commitments to the common defense, I asked Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, at a February 24, 1998, Foreign Relations Committee hearing, if Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic would be prepared to take on these commitments. She told me that `We are confident that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will take on the financial commitment involved in NATO membership. Indeed, to prepare for this commitment, all three have increased their defense budgets to fund necessary defense reforms, and to bring them in line with the standard outlays of NATO Allies. . . . Moreover, the cost of defense would undoubtedly be higher if these countries did not join NATO.' 
In addition, I have been assured by both Secretary Albright and Secretary of Defense William Cohen that the United States share of NATO enlargement costs will not exceed $7 billion over ten years. They have insisted that the wide range of cost estimates can be attributed to the use of varying data and the fact that the original estimates assumed the admission of four new countries into the alliance. I respect the views of the Department of Defense and the General Accounting Office in explaining the differential, and will continue to monitor revised cost estimates as they become available. 
The many cost estimates involved in this first round of NATO enlargement also lead me to wonder if we will have a clearer picture of the cost of future rounds, or if we will be faced with the same financial uncertainties that loom before us today. This is an issue the Senate will be looking at closely as the Alliance develops its policies regarding future enlargement. This is also the subject of at least one amendment to the resolution of ratification currently before this body. 
I also have concerns about the impact of new U.S. commitments to NATO on America's general military readiness, especially at a time when so many of our forces are deployed around the world in Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, Korea, and other posts. I asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Hugh Shelton, about this concern when he testified before the Committee on Foreign Relations. He said, `I see nothing in the NATO enlargement concept that will detract from our overall readiness. To the contrary, the additional troops, military equipment and capabilities that the three new countries bring to the Alliance can only reduce the demands on current members.' 
I am encouraged by his answer, and I am also encouraged by the willingness of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace. All three countries were original members of this program, and all have provided troops and equipment for NATO missions. In my view, the willingness of these three countries to participate in NATO efforts will only strengthen the alliance. 
As I stated earlier, I share the Administration's basic views on the merits of enlarging this alliance. The people of Eastern Europe must never again be subjected to the conditions they were forced to endure under Soviet rule. They see NATO membership as a means to ensure their future safety. My concern is about the extent of the commitment the United States will be making, and the uncertainty regarding the price tag that American taxpayers will be asked to pay in this time of fiscal restraint and personal sacrifice. But voting in favor of NATO enlargement should not be considered a blank check for military or other spending in the region. Should the Senate ratify the protocols we are considering today, I and my colleagues in both the House and the Senate will continue to monitor the new U.S. commitments to NATO--financial and otherwise--through the regular congressional budget and appropriations process. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution of ratification. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senators Collins, Chafee, Jeffords, Leahy, Reid and others in introducing the Home Health Medical Equity Act of 1998. I especially want to compliment the Senator from Maine, who has taken the lead on this issue. It is a matter of enormous concern in her State and also in mine. I think it is worth taking a moment just to acknowledge how useful the Senate Aging Committee is, to be able to highlight an issue like this. I wonder whether this issue would have gotten the attention it deserves had it not been for that forum, where we were able to have an excellent hearing and hear from Senators all over the country whose States are very negatively affected by the rules that were put into place. I congratulate the Senator from Maine for taking the initiative out of that hearing to introduce legislation. 
This legislation is a crucial step in ensuring that the Medicare Home Health Care program's Interim Payment System does not penalize regions of the country that have been providing home health services efficiently. 
Mr. President, I have been working to promote the availability of home care and other long-term care options for my entire public life because I believe strongly in the importance of enabling people to stay in their own homes. For seniors who are homebound and have skilled nursing needs, having access to home health services through the Medicare program is the difference between staying in their own home and being moved into a nursing facility. Home care offers feelings of security, dignity and hope. Where there is a choice, we should do our best to allow patients to choose home health care. 
Mr. President, I recognize that there are situations when one's ability to conduct the activities of daily living are so limited, and the medical needs are so great, that the patient would be better served, in some cases, in a skilled nursing facility. I also want to recognize that my State of Wisconsin has a very, very good network of caring and high-quality nursing homes. Without a doubt, there is a need for these services. But, Mr. President, as I travel throughout Wisconsin's 72 counties every year, what seniors tell me again and again is that, to the extent possible, and as long as it is medically appropriate for them to do so, they would like to remain in their own homes. I think seniors need and deserve that choice. 
Mr. President, seniors clearly prefer to remain in their own homes rather than be moved to a nursing home. Their medical needs can often be met through home health services. Despite these facts, the implementation of the Medicare Home Health Interim Payment System as passed in last year's budget could create serious access problems for seniors in States like Wisconsin and Maine when they seek the home health benefit. The cuts to the Medicare Home Health program imposed by the Interim Payment System are so severe that home health agencies will have no choice but to reduce dramatically the amount of services provided. Some home care agencies may get out of the home care business altogether. But, Mr. President, the real impact of the Interim Payment System will not be simply to reduce payments to home care providers and force some out of business, what it will really do and what really concerns me is it will drastically reduce the options that homebound seniors now have today with respect to whether they will remain in their home in the community or whether they will be forced into a nursing home situation that is not necessarily the best place for them. 
As of right now, Mr. President, the Interim Payment System for Medicare home health care is a system that pays agencies the lowest of the following three measures: (1) actual costs; (2) a per visit limit of 105% of the national median; or (3) a per beneficiary annual limit, derived from a blend of 75% an agency's costs and 25% regional costs. Now, these measures are pretty technical and I will not go into any more of the specifics about them. But suffice it to say that the net effect of the Interim Payment System will be to penalize severely agencies who have been operating efficiently all these years. Since the Interim Payment System will pay the agency the lowest of the three 
measures that I mentioned, agencies in areas where costs have been kept lower will be disproportionately and unfairly affected. 
Mr. President, according to the Health Care Financing Administration, just in Wisconsin alone, there are currently 181 home health care agencies that participate in Medicare. Of these, two-thirds of them are operated as nonprofit entities. These nonprofit home health care providers are often county health departments and visiting nurse organizations; these are not entities out to make a fast buck on the backs of homebound seniors. According to administrators of Valley Visiting Nurse Association in Neenah, WI, the average, per patient Medicare home care cost in Wisconsin is $2,586, compared to $5,000 in other parts of the country. Let me repeat that, the statistics, because it is really quite striking. The average, per patient Medicare home care cost in Wisconsin is only $2,586, compared to often over $5,000 or more in other places in the country. These nonprofit providers in Wisconsin are already as lean as they can be. I am fairly convinced they don't have any `fat' to cut from their programs. The Visiting Nurse Association Home Health of Wausau showed me some figures demonstrating that, over the past 5 years, their services have averaged 30 percent below limits imposed by the Health Care Financing Administration, with 36 percent fewer visits per beneficiary than the national average. 
Mr. President, the effect of the deep reductions imposed by the Interim Payment System will be, quite simply, a devastating blow to these types of agencies, and, in turn, will seriously impact the availability of home health care services to many people in Wisconsin. This devastating blow is dealt not because Wisconsin has been providing too many services too expensively. It is just to the contrary. States like Wisconsin and others are being penalized more precisely because they have always operated efficiently. Moreover, on a national level, with a reduced per-patient limit, home health agencies have a disincentive to take more seriously ill patients onto their rolls. 
Mr. President, the legislation my colleagues and I introduce today will change the Interim Payment System to bring about greater payment equity for Medicare home health providers in different parts of the country. The bill, as the Senator from Maine outlined, would create a new formula for the per-patient limit that reflects a higher percentage of national data rather than relying solely on regional and local data. The change in payment calculation would enable high-efficiency, low-cost home health agencies to continue providing services efficiently and cost-effectively. But, Mr. President, the most important impact of the Medicare Home Health Equity Act will be to make sure that seniors who are homebound and have skilled nursing needs will retain for as long as possible the right to decide to stay in their own homes. 
Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the State Department authorization conference report debated on Friday and to be voted on tomorrow. Unfortunately, I was unable to participate in the debate on Friday, and I appreciate the chance to take the time now to express my views on this legislation. 
I would like to express my extreme regret and disappointment that the debate over the important issues of the long-overdue payment of our arrears to the United Nations and the reorganization of the U.S. Department of State has once again become a sideshow to an exercise by some Members of Congress regarding the issue of reproductive choice. I find it astounding that these members insist on holding our international commitments hostage to a desire to score political points on a domestic issue. 
We should be on the floor talking about the important foreign policy priorities that were articulated during the Senate debate on S. 903. Instead, we are spending the majority of our debate time on this measure talking about one narrow issue that shouldn't even be in here in the first place! 
As we all know, a minority of our colleagues in the other body successfully inserted language in this conference report that would impose severe restrictions on U.S. assistance to foreign non-governmental organizations engaged in family planning activities. These restrictions were inserted without consultation with the Democratic conferees. They were not consulted because they surely would have objected to these provisions. The restrictions fall into two basic categories. 
First, the conference report would mandate that no U.S. population assistance may be given to any foreign non-governmental organization unless that organization certifies that it will not use its own funds to perform abortions during the period in which it receives U.S. funds. If the President chooses to waive this restriction, which I am sure President Clinton would do, funding for family planning-related activities would then be capped at $356 million. 
The second category of restriction would prohibit funding for organizations that lobby to change abortion laws in their own countries. 
Mr. President, the authors of these restrictions see this version, that is, the provisions as written in this conference report, as a compromise of earlier iterations of restrictions on family planning. But--let us be very clear here--not only is this not a compromise, but the language is actually more restrictive than what we have seen before. 
First of all, unlike the so-called `Mexico City' language, which has been considered each year as a rider to appropriations bills, the restrictions in this conference report would become permanent statutory changes. That is a rather disturbing concept. 
Second, the waiver provision included for the President would result in a greater decrease in funding for family planning than we have seen in earlier versions. Many observers believe that the $356 million cap amounts to a decrease of $29 million, a cut that would come solely out of USAID's family planning account. But, the language in this conference report would also apply to `all funds for programs and activities designed to control fertility or to reduce or delay childbirths or pregnancies, irrespective of the heading under which such funds are made available.' What this means is that the cap would also apply to certain birth-spacing related programs that currently fall under other USAID accounts, and in fact, would represent a larger total decrease than is immediately evident--about $44 million. That represents an 11 percent decrease in funding for these programs, which, Mr. President, I think we all would agree is rather substantial. 
Third, the definition of `lobbying' that is used in the second restriction is disturbingly broad in that it would ban all sorts of public statements or the participation of individuals at public meetings. It is so bad that many of us call it `the global gag rule.' 
Finally, the President would have no waiver authority over this gag rule provision. 
Let me turn for a moment to the substance of these provisions. 
While proponents of the Mexico City language say they do not want U.S. dollars to pay for abortions overseas, the adoption of the restrictions in this conference report would actually increase the number of unintended pregnancies worldwide, and, correspondingly, the number of abortions and deaths of mothers and children due to high-risk pregnancies. 
The funding at issue here has nothing to do with performing abortions and everything to do with preventing them. It is about family planning, and about a woman's right to know about all options that are legally available to her. It is about helping non-governmental organizations educate women around the world about family planning and other health care issues. 
I firmly oppose all of these restrictions and will oppose this conference report because of them for several reasons, which I will discuss in turn. 
First, U.S. assistance for family planning initiatives abroad is a sound investment that pays dividends including healthy women and children. According to the Johns Hopkins Population Information Program, approximately 120 million women in developing countries who need family planning services do not have access to them. Family planning services educate women about contraception, pre-natal care, birth spacing, the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, and other important, life-saving issues. These programs have proven to be enormously effective--not only in improving the health of hundreds of thousands of women and children, but also in reducing the pressures that rapid population growth places on food and water, housing and education, and the environment in developing countries. 
Second, this language reinstates--and expands--the Mexico City policy that prevents U.S. population assistance from being disbursed to non-governmental organizations that use other funds to engage in abortion-related activities. This restriction does not prevent abortions, Mr. President, it increases their likelihood by cutting off funds to reputable family planning organizations which happen also to use their own money for abortion-related activities. 
Finally, this language contains a troubling restriction on the freedom of speech of those working for family planning programs which receive U.S. funding. By linking funding for much-needed family planning assistance to the stifling of freedom of speech, the language runs counter to the very principles upon which our own nation was founded. We cherish our right to freedom of speech in this country, and the promotion of democracy and respect for basic freedoms around the globe represent an important aspect of our foreign policy. 
The language in this conference report is an assault on free speech, one of the most fundamental human rights. In this country, citizens are encouraged to speak their minds and participate in the political process. In fact, the First Amendment states that `Congress shall make no law * * * abridging the freedom of speech * * * or the right of the people * * * to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.' 
If the language in this conference report were adopted, it would mean U.S. citizens who have this constitutionally-guaranteed right would be forcing people in other countries to give up similar rights if they wish to keep receiving U.S. funding for family planning programs. The only way I can interpret this, Mr. President, is as an attempt by some Members of Congress to control the free speech of people in foreign countries relating to one particular issue about which they may not agree: abortion. 
In essence, this language tells foreign non-governmental organizations which seek family planning assistance that they will get it if, and only if, they comply with a restrictive set of rules for how they may use their own money. It is a thinly veiled threat to pull much-needed funding if the word `abortion' is uttered to any woman seeking counseling at any foreign family planning agency that receives U.S. funds. This language violates the spirit of the Constitution which we have all sworn to uphold. 
I would like to talk about two family planning programs that would be jeopardized if this conference report were to become law. 
The humanitarian organization CARE is working with a local non-governmental organization that promotes dialogue within local communities and at a national level regarding important issues facing Bolivian women, such as violence against women, sexual harassment and lack of appropriate medical services. One of the most critical issues for discussion is the alarmingly high rate of maternal mortality in Bolivia--the highest in Latin America. According to the World Health Organization, a women in Bolivia has a 1 in 27 chance of dying from a pregnancy-related cause. This compares to women in the U.S., who have a 1 in 3,500 chance of dying from such circumstances. CARE's Bolivian partner works to educate women and men about the importance of family planning and the dangers of illegal abortion and how it contributes to Bolivia's appalling rate of maternal mortality. 
Under the language in the conference report, U.S. funding for this Bolivian organization would be at risk because the organization makes `public statements' about women's health issues that may be construed as lobbying for abortion rights. This is a capable, effective organization that is addressing real needs within Bolivia. 
My second example relates to South Africa. As Ranking Member on the African Affairs Subcommittee, I have had the opportunity to learn much about the success of family planning programs in Africa and, indeed, of U.S. assistance to such programs in Africa. 
We all watched with awe and amazement as South Africans of all races participated in the first multiparty elections in that country in 1994. We were further inspired by the country's adoption of its first permanent, post-apartheid constitution which was signed into law on December 10, 1996, by President Nelson Mandela, one of the greatest heros of our time. The Government of South Africa continues to consider various proposed amendments to the constitution on outstanding issues, and is also working on the implementation of many of its provisions. Not surprisingly, the Government is consulting widely with a variety of groups and interested parties from around the country. 
Why, you may ask, am I talking about the South African constitution and South African legislation during a debate over family planning assistance? 
Because, the language of this conference report would actually put limitations on the ability of South Africans to participate in the democratic process in their country. 
The Government has asked Dr. Helen Rees, president of the Planned Parenthood Association of South Africa, to become an advisor to the National Department of Health and a member of the country's Medical Advisory Board to assist the Government in its implementation of a law enacted in 1996 concerning access to safe abortion during the first twelve weeks of pregnancy. Prior to this law's enactment, Dr. Rees had also helped in its drafting. 
Had this conference report been law at the time of Dr. Rees' participation in the drafting of that law, the Planned Parenthood Association of South Africa would have lost its U.S. family planning assistance, even though her activities related to the drafting process were conducted without U.S. funds. 
In other words, the Association might have been forced to suffer simply because the South African government chose to invest in Dr. Rees' expertise. Dr. Rees would have been forced to choose between allowing her organization to receive much-needed U.S. assistance or to become an active participant in the political process of her country. This is a totally unfair choice, and one that we, members of the U.S. Congress, should not be forcing foreign citizens to make. In fact, it contradicts what the Congress worked so actively for over the last several decades, and that is the freedom of all South Africans to be able to participate in their own political process. 
I want to make my last point very clear, Mr. President. The language contained in this conference report would be unconstitutional if this were a piece of domestic legislation because it violates the First Amendment. 
I repeat, this language would be unconstitutional if this were domestic legislation. 
Mr. President, the United States has a long history of promoting democracy and basic freedoms around the world. This global gag rule runs counter to that tradition. If adopted, this language would not encourage free speech--it would squelch it. 
None of these restrictions belong in this legislation in the first place, but now that they are there, I encourage all of my colleague, who all profess to support free speech and our constitutionally-guaranteed liberties, to defeat this conference report.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of the ethnic Armenians who died at the hands of the Ottoman Empire from 1915-1923. Last week, we marked the 83rd anniversary of the beginning of a systematic, officially-sanctioned genocide that would eventually claim 1.5 million lives and force more than 250,000 to flee their homeland. As a result, there are fewer than 80,000 Armenians remaining in present-day Turkey. 
I have spoken about these events every year of my term, on or near this date, in order to remind the Senate--and to remind the American people--of the sacrifice of these 1.5 million people who were murdered simply because of their ethnicity. In a country where we cherish the ethnic diversity of our citizens and welcome legal immigrants from around the globe, we sometimes forget about the ethnic strife that existed--and continues to exist--all over the world. 
Unfortunately, ethnic conflict has led to genocide all too often, as we have seen during this decade in Bosnia, Rwanda, and elsewhere. More recently, there has been a resurgence of ethnic fighting in Kosovo, where the minority Serb population seeks to control the majority Albanian population. 
Mr. President, human rights violations have become all too commonplace in the modern world. Beatings, rapes, murders, and `disappearances' have become routine weapons of war in battles where the perpetrators are rarely brought to justice. It is my strong view that the United States must continue to lead the fight for global human rights. 
The recent death of Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot--who died before he could be tried for the murders of millions of Cambodians--reinforces the urgency of bringing those responsible for genocide to justice. I applaud the efforts of the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal which is currently working to prosecute those responsible for the atrocities committed in Rwanda and the Former Yugoslavia. 
As we honor the memory of the 1.5 million Armenians whose annihilation began 83 years ago, we must also remember the countless other victims of `ethnic cleansing' around the globe, and recommit ourselves to the effort to punish those responsible for these unspeakable crimes.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr, President, I rise today to commend the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) for introducing S. Con. Res. 90, which acknowledges the historic Northern Ireland peace agreement, and congratulates the individuals who made the agreement possible. 
Just today, in my home state of Wisconsin, leaders representing all sides of the Northern Ireland peace process gathered in Milwaukee for a National Symposium on Prospects for Peace in Northern Ireland, sponsored by the George F. Kennan Forum on International Affairs. Mr. President, this conference was planned long before the historic peace agreement was announced. I am pleased that the attendees were able to come to Milwaukee with a viable agreement already on the table. The speakers at today's conference, who were involved in the negotiations of the peace agreement, discussed both the agreement itself and prospects for a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. 
In light of this resolution, I want to repeat some of my remarks for the peace symposium. 
The recent agreement reached by the parties to the conflict in Northern Ireland offers real hope for an end to three decades of violence in that troubled land. This historic step is the product of a new commitment to peace by parties on all sides of this longstanding conflict. 
It is proper that this resolution commends President Clinton for making the search for an end to the conflict in Northern Ireland a top foreign policy priority. My former colleague, Senator George Mitchell, deserves special recognition from this body for his leadership in helping move the parties to an agreement. Above all, we commend the leaders from all sides of this conflict, many of whom worked tirelessly on this agreement, and had the will to put ancient hatreds aside and make peace their priority. 
Now the success of the agreement rests in the hands of the people of Northern Ireland, who continue to review the details and, eventually, will have the opportunity to express themselves democratically through a referendum. Let us hope that all the parties will be able to commit to this process and that none will turn to the sectarian violence of the past. It is now the duty of all who seek peace to resist the efforts of those who may seek to undermine the accords through violence. 
As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I believe this agreement signals new hope for longstanding conflicts around in the world. Just a few years ago, many saw the conflicts in South Africa and Northern Ireland as intractable, but today one has been peacefully resolved and the other has made tremendous progress, as we recognize with this resolution. 
So, Mr. President, I am happy to support this resolution with hope for the future, and commend the brave leaders who have taken a risk for peace in Northern Ireland.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in late February the Senate considered campaign finance reform on the floor of the Senate for the second time in this Congress. Once again, we did not resolve the issue. Although a clear majority of this body now supports the McCain-Feingold bill, a determined minority once again prevented it from being adopted. 
Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today to try to put our debate in some perspective. This is a particularly good time to revisit the issue because of what has been happening just in the past few days in the other body, in the House of Representatives. In fact, the latest development on the other side of the Capitol has made it very clear that the defenders of the current system are on the run, and campaign finance reform is very much alive. 
Last fall, the Speaker of the House promised an open debate on campaign finance reform by the end of March. The other body, of course, is supposed to be the place where the majority can work its will. There is no filibuster rule in the House of Representatives--in effect, no requirement that you have to get a three-fifths majority to pass legislation, as has long been the case in the Senate. 
At the end of March, when a bipartisan majority began to clearly coalesce behind the McCain-Feingold bill, or the Shays-Meehan bill as it is called in the other body, the House leadership and other opponents of reform began looking for a way out. The House leadership decided to bring up campaign finance reform under suspension of the rules. That is a procedure that is usually used to allow noncontroversial bills to pass quickly. It was used here for a very different purpose. It allows very limited debate and no amendments, and it requires a two-thirds vote for passage. 
So the leadership of the other body brought up its own campaign finance bill under the suspension procedure that would guarantee, in effect, the defeat of its own bill. In the end, this bill of the leadership of the House got only 74 votes, and 337 Members of the House voted no. 
Let's think about that. The major campaign finance bill offered by the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction received only 74 votes in the House of Representatives. The Democrats in the House were not even allowed to offer a substitute, which is customary in the other body. And here is the kicker. The main bipartisan reform bill which, by all accounts, actually had majority support in the House, did not even get a vote. The leadership of the House did everything in its power to make sure that the McCain-Feingold bill would not pass, and they succeeded, but only temporarily. 
Supporters of reform in the House were understandably outraged. Just as the opponents of reform in this body relied on a filibuster and on parliamentary tactics such as filling the amendment tree to prevent a bipartisan majority from passing McCain-Feingold, opponents of reform in the House, the body that is supposed to reflect the will of majority, in effect rigged the procedure to make sure that reformers did not even get a vote on their bill. 
Tactics of this kind can work for a while, but they cannot work forever. The American people are tired of tricks and tactics. They are tired of a partisan minority stopping the bipartisan majority from enacting reform. And now there are clear signs that public outrage over these kinds of tactics is having an effect. In the other body, reformers gathered 205 signatures on a discharge petition that would require the other body to consider campaign finance reform under a fair and open procedure. They needed just 13 more Members of the House to sign the discharge petition to force the issue to the House floor despite the opposition of the leadership. This would have been almost unprecedented. 
It is clear that Members of the Congress are feeling the heat. Five Members agreed to sign the petition over the recess after they heard from their constituents how important it is to have a real vote on reform in the House this year, and four more announced in the last 2 days they will sign the petition. 
Mr. President, what we found out today is that the leadership in the House reconsidered its hard line position because a meltdown was occurring. I was informed just a little bit earlier that there has been an announcement that the leadership of the other body will now bring campaign finance reform back to the House floor by May 15, and this time there at least supposedly is going to be an open rule and a bipartisan bill will get a vote. 
This is very good news, and I congratulate the bipartisan reformers in the House for their persistence and effectiveness. They have shown that the will of the people can prevail if only we in the Congress have the courage to fight for it. If the House passes a bipartisan bill in the next few weeks, fortunately, the 
spotlight will come back here again. 
The distinguished majority leader of our body was asked on Monday, what will he do if the House passes McCain-Feingold? His answer? `Nothing.' And everyone laughed. I don't think they are laughing today, because the reformers in the House have succeeded in their effort to force a fair vote. We will see if the American people will stand for this kind of obstructionism if a bill comes back from the House. I do not think they will. I think the Senate will have to deal with this issue again this year and soon. 
So I can say to the American people today as I have before, this fight is not over. The opponents of reform may be winning these parliamentary battles, but they are losing the legislative war. The American people know that our current system must be changed. A majority of this Senate, and now of the House, knows that our current system must be changed. Sooner or later, we will prevail. I am absolutely certain of that. 
I have spent a great deal of time reviewing the debate on campaign finance reform from both this past February and last fall. As most people who watched the debate know, there was a lot of argument on this floor about whether the first amendment to the Constitution would be violated by the provisions of our bill in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment dealing with so-called issue advocacy by outside groups. I think these arguments based on the Constitution were grossly exaggerated and they will be shown to be inaccurate over time in the context of the actual state of constitutional law. 
But there were a lot of other things said about our bill, a lot of other justifications offered for killing reform, and today I want to concentrate on what I call the three worst excuses for voting against the bipartisan McCain-Feingold bill. These arguments simply do not hold water. And since we will be back sooner or later--and I suspect sooner--to discuss these matters, let me say a bit about them today. 
Here is the first poor excuse for voting against our bill. We heard time and time again, both last fall and last February, that we do not need changes in the law, we just have to enforce the current law. Now, that gave the opponents the opportunity to excoriate the Clinton administration for its fundraising excesses in 1996 and to try to dodge responsibility as Senators to try to clean up the system. 
But I have a number of responses. First, we have to remember that the McCain-Feingold bill actually had a whole lot of provisions that were designed to specifically deal with the alleged lawbreaking of the last election. Our bill makes it perfectly clear that fundraising for Federal campaigns cannot take place on Federal property. In other words, no more `no controlling legal authority,' no more debate about whether dialing for dollars from your office is OK if you are asking for soft money rather than hard money. Under our bill, you cannot use your office, which is paid for by the taxpayers to raise money. Period. 
In the McCain-Feingold bill, we also ban all foreign money from U.S. elections first by banning all soft money contributions to political parties. The legislation would prohibit any source, foreign or domestic, from contributing these unlimited and unregulated amounts of money to the national political party. But our bill also makes clear that foreign nationals are prohibited from making any sort of campaign expenditure--coordinated with a candidate or party or an independent expenditure--in connection with any Federal, State, or local election. 
So while we will not put people in jail with this legislation or force prosecution of lawbreakers, we can make absolutely sure that the loopholes, or alleged loopholes, in the law that those accused of wrongdoing have fallen back on will, in fact, be permanently closed. 
But beyond that, we reject the notion that the scandals we saw in 1996 were just due to lawbreaking. They were due to problems with the law itself. The biggest scandal stems not from what is illegal today but from what is perfectly legal--soft money. 
Let me put it this way. Why was the White House charging $100,000 a night for a night in the Lincoln bedroom? Why did coffee with the President or dinners with key leaders of the Congress cost people some $50,000? Because it is legal to contribute $50,000 or $100,000 or even more to a political party in this country. Unless we change that law, the ever-increasing demand for money will lead our party leaders to stretch the bounds of propriety. We have to take responsibility. We have to do our part as lawmakers. 
What about the huge amounts of money spent by groups on so-called issue ads that looked just like campaign ads but fell just outside the boundaries of the Federal election law? That is not a problem with illegal activities. It is a problem with the law, and we need to address it. 
Mr. President, poor excuse No. 2 for opposing bipartisan reform. I heard a lot of people who oppose McCain-Feingold say that what we really need to do to solve the campaign finance issue is to have full and instantaneous disclosure of contributions and spending. My first response to that argument is that McCain-Feingold includes the most extensive disclosure provisions of any campaign finance legislation introduced in the Senate in this Congress. But not a single Senator who argued against this bill and said that disclosure is what we really need would even acknowledge the important disclosure provisions in our bill. 
What does it do? We require all candidates to file their disclosure reports electronically and require the FEC to post this information on the Internet within 24 hours of its receipt. 
We prohibit campaigns from depositing campaign contributions of over $200 into their treasuries until all required disclosure information has been collected. We step up the reporting of independent expenditures in the closing days of the campaign. We even lower the reporting threshold for campaign contributions from $200 to $50, and we require political advertisements to carry a tag line identifying who is responsible for the content of the advertising. 
These provisions are very important and they are helpful and they do a great job, but they are not enough in themselves to restore the public's faith in our system and in us. We already know that $262 million in soft money was contributed to the national political parties in 1996. We already know that Philip Morris gave over $3 million in soft money in the 1996 cycle, and that RJR Nabisco, Joseph Seagram & Sons, Atlantic Richfield, and AT&T all gave over $1 million. Federal Express gave almost a million. 
It is still a scandal that the tobacco companies did contribute millions of dollars to our political parties while the Congress is considering extraordinarily important legislation that will decide the fate of that industry and of the children that its product kills, even if those contributions are disclosed. It is interesting that some of the same Senators who proclaim the miracle benefits of disclosure are unwilling to bring under the Federal election laws the activities of secretive groups funded by wealthy donors that run ads attacking candidates in the last weeks of the campaign. 
So disclosure is not the answer. It is an answer, but it is not the answer. 
How can we really expect a lot of hard-working Americans, many of whom do not even have a computer, to spend their free time examining FEC reports to make sure that we are not under the influence of special interest contributions? Who are we kidding with this idea that full disclosure alone will solve all our problems? Most people do not know who the richest people in America are and who they work for. Most people do not know what legislative agenda is pursued by the PACs that fund our campaigns. Most people will not be able to recognize a potentially corrupting contribution from just some name on a report. 
So we still need reasonable limits on contributions. We still need a ban on soft money. We still need to outlaw fundraising on Federal property. We still need to address the phony issue ads of unknown origin that attack candidates in the last day of a campaign and simply avoid the Federal election laws. Disclosure is a great thing and I am proud that our bill includes some tough new provisions, but disclosure alone is not the answer. 
One very interesting thing about our debate last fall was that very few of the opponents of our bill ever wanted to discuss the central feature of our bill--a ban on soft money. I do not blame the opponents of our bill for not wanting to discuss it. Soft 
money is an embarrassment to the American political system. It should shame the defenders of the status quo. Soft money was at the very heart of the scandals of 1996. But a few hearty souls have ventured out onto the floor to defend soft money. I want to take my remaining time to address their arguments. They have given the absolute worst excuse for opposing our bill--that the soft money ban is either unconstitutional or a bad idea. 
Soft money is the mother of all loopholes. It is the most ingenious money laundering scheme in American history. Corporations and labor unions are prohibited from giving money directly to candidates. It has been that way for most of the century. Instead, what they do is they give the money to the candidate's party. That means, instead of having to use a PAC, the corporation can reach into its shareholders' moneys and a union can reach into its members' dues. 
The sky is truly the limit for these contributions. You can give $5,000, you can give $50,000, you can give $500,000. There is no reason under this loophole why you could not give the party $5 million by yourself. There are no limits on soft money--none at all. 
This laundering scheme allows the parties to dump tens of millions of unregulated dollars into congressional elections and into Presidential elections. Just last fall the Republican Party ran an unprecedented issue ad campaign in the special congressional election for the seat vacated by former Representative Susan Molinari of New York. The party reportedly spent $800,000 on ads attacking the Democratic candidate for that office. Much of that money was soft money, money that is supposed to be illegal in Federal elections. 
In the 1996 cycle, the two political parties raised and spent over $262 million in soft money. That is $262 million that was raised and spent completely outside of the scope of Federal election law. 
The trend with respect to soft money is frightening. In 1992, the two parties raised and spent a combined $86 million in soft money. In just 4 years, that has gone from $86 million to $262 million. It tripled in just 4 years. And this year, even with the scandals and the very sharp attention to the issue, the money machine just keeps churning away. The FEC just announced that the parties raised $74 million in 1997, the most money ever raised in an off-election year, and more than twice as much as they raised in 1993, the year after the 1992 Presidential election. 
Those are just the overall amounts of soft money, and the numbers are truly staggering. But what is most troubling about the soft money system is the shameless solicitation of these multi-hundred-thousand dollar contributions from corporations, labor unions, and wealthy individuals. 
Both political parties are offering big contributors special access to high-ranking Government officials in exchange for a $100,000, $250,000, or a $500,000 contribution. Maybe you get to sit at the head table with the President. Maybe you get to have a special meeting with a congressional committee chairman. Maybe you get to participate in a trade mission to a foreign land. 
But let's not pretend that someone is making a $500,000 contribution purely in the interest of good government and good democracy. Just this past year Philip Morris, facing the growing challenge of lawsuits around the country and possible congressional action on tobacco legislation, gave another $450,000 to the Republican Party and $60,000 to the Democrats. What is that all about? I think we know what it is all about. 
Remember Roger Tamraz, one of the most colorful characters to appear before Senator Thompson's investigation last year? When asked if he felt he got his money's worth for his $300,000 contribution, Tamraz told the Government Affairs Committee that next time he would give $600,000. When asked if one of the reasons he made the contribution was to get special access, Tamraz responded by saying it wasn't one of the reasons, it was the only reason. 
Mr. President, there is massive public support for a ban on soft money. Three former Presidents, over 200 former Members of Congress, countless editorial boards across the country, and even many people in the business community want to end this disgrace. Therefore, I am not surprised that virtually no one who is opposed to our legislation has stepped forward to offer a defense of this shameful system. 
How can anyone defend a system that rewards the Roger Tamraz's of the world? How can anyone defend the $500,000 contributions flowing into Federal elections and the auctioning off of special access to high-ranking Government officials? 
What do the few supporters of this corrupt and corrupting system say? Well, a number of Senators complained that banning soft money would `federalize all elections.' One even argued that the Supreme Court in Buckley had actually permitted the use of soft money by the political parties, and somehow enhanced its legitimacy in the Colorado case. 
Actually, the Colorado case concerned hard money expenditures made by the parties, supposedly independent of its candidates. The Court did mention soft money, but assumed that it may not be used to influence Federal elections. The whole reason we need to ban soft money is that it is abundantly clear that it is being used to influence Federal elections. That is why 126 legal scholars wrote us to say that it would clearly be constitutional to ban soft money. 
As for federalizing all elections, that argument is like the one made by a Senator who is worried that banning soft money will hurt State parties. He complained that State parties will have to use hard money for voter registration and things like bumper stickers and buttons. The soft money provision in McCain-Feingold does allow the State parties to continue to raise money from corporations and unions if their States allow it, but not for Federal election activities. They can use soft money for voter registration up to 4 months before a Federal election. 
They can use soft money, non-Federal money to support State candidates. They just can't use it to run these ads that mention Federal candidates. 
That is not `federalizing all elections.' That is just making sure that money that would be illegal, if given to candidates, cannot be used to benefit their elections by doing an end run around the Federal election laws. What use is prohibiting the national parties from raising and spending this illegal money if it can simply be diverted to State parties to turn around and do exactly the same thing with it? 
Mr. President, there were a few opponents of McCain-Feingold who had the candor last fall to admit that, of course, Congress can constitutionally ban soft money. The Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, and the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, both fine lawyers, indicated that that was their position. But they argued that we shouldn't do it because it would hurt the political parties and create an `imbalance' in the system. They fear that without soft money, parties would be ineffective, and the most irresponsible ads, the ones run by independent groups, would be encouraged. 
That is a pretty interesting argument. These Senators appear unwilling to address the evasion of the election laws by outside organizations, unwilling even to try to craft a provision dealing with the phony issue ads and let the Supreme Court finally address the issue advocacy versus express advocacy problem by letting the Court know what the Congress thinks the law should be and then, because they don't like these unaccountable ads, which they themselves refuse to do anything about, they want to leave open the biggest and most objectionable loophole of all in our Federal election law today--soft money. 
Our great political parties and, indeed, our political system are soiled by this soft money system. We ought to be racing to get rid of it. We ought to be trying to clean up our reputation. We ought to try to redeem ourselves in the eyes of the American people. 
Are we really going to take the position, as we head into the 1998 elections, that our political parties, with their rich and important histories in this country, cannot thrive, cannot survive, without soft money? Are the parties so divorced from what real people want that they have to rely for their financial support on huge contributions from corporations and wealthy individuals who seek special access to pursue their own special interests? 
I, Mr. President, am one who believes that the parties can survive without soft money. They did it up until the late 1980s. Remember, the law permits the parties to raise up to $20,000 per year in hard money from each contributor. But the parties have gotten lazy. They don't like having to raise money piece by piece, $20,000 by $20,000, voter by voter. They would rather hold dinners at big Washington hotels, send out invitations to lobbyists promising special access and then just sit back and collect a few big soft money checks. They are addicted to these huge sums of money and the nasty attack ads they can buy if the party lawyers are clever enough in how they spend the money. 
That is right, Mr. President, I don't think our political parties are worth supporting anymore if they don't have anything to offer except fancy fundraisers for corporate lobbyists. If they can no longer appeal to the people of this country to fund their legitimate activity, maybe their time has come and gone. That is why protecting the political parties' ability to raise soft money is the very worst excuse for opposing the McCain-Feingold bill. It simply admits that our political system has utterly failed; that our parties are bankrupt morally and intellectually, even if they have full bank accounts; that our representative democracy has become a corporation democracy, where the amount of power you have depends on how much money you have. 
I refuse to accept the judgment that we are doomed to have this kind of campaign finance system in America, the greatest democracy on Earth. That is why I am still fighting for campaign finance reform in this Congress. If the opportunity presents itself, if it looks like more of my colleagues are ready to reject the excuses--and I suspect there will be more--I will be ready to bring the McCain-Feingold bill, or any portion of it, before this Senate again. 
I think the American people should know where this Senate stands on the issue of soft money. I think the people who sent us here deserve to know whether we think it is right that our elections are dominated by this unlimited, unregulated money or not. Because we know that they don't think it is right, the time has come to act. 
Most of the pundits say we lost in February, but I think we won a battle. We won because we showed that a bipartisan majority of the Senate wants reform, and a bipartisan majority of the Senate will stick together and fight for reform. The battle for reform on both sides of Capitol Hill is proceeding, and it will go forward until the American people win the war and get their Government back. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce `The Gaylord Nelson Apostle Islands Stewardship Act of 1998.' I am very pleased that my senior colleague from Wisconsin joins me as an original author of the bill, and also that my colleague in the other body, Congressman Obey is joining me in introducing the companion legislation as he represents the area of Wisconsin where the Apostle Islands are located. 
Mr. President, on this Earth Day, the 29th Earth Day, 
I have chosen to name this legislation in recognition of the accomplishments of Earth Day's founder, a former member of this body and former Governor of my state, Gaylord Nelson. Many outside Wisconsin may not know that, in addition to founding Earth Day, Senator Nelson was also the primary sponsor of the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore Act. That Act, which passed in 1970--the same year Earth Day was founded, protects one of Northern Wisconsin's most beautiful areas, and it is a place where every year my family and I spend our favorite vacation. 
Though Senator Nelson has received many awards, I know that among his proudest accomplishments are those bills he crafted which have produced real and lasting change in preserving America's lands, such as the Apostle Islands. 
The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore includes 21 forested islands and 12 miles of pristine shoreline which are among the Great Lakes' most spectacular scenery. Centuries of wave action, freezing, and thawing have sculpted the shorelines and nature has carved intricate caves into the sandstone which forms the islands. Delicate arches, vaulted chambers, and hidden passageways honeycomb cliffs on the north shore of Devil's Island, Swallow Point on Sand Island, and northeast of Cornucopia on the mainland. The Apostle Islands National Lakeshore includes more lighthouses than any other coastline of similar size in the United States, and is home to diverse wildlife including: black bear, bald eagles and deer. It is an important recreational area as well. Its campgrounds and acres of forest, make the Apostles a favorite destination for hikers, sailors, kayakers, and bikers. The Lakeshore also includes the underwater lakebed as well, and scuba divers register with the National Park Service to view the area's underwater resources. 
I also know that Senator Nelson, if he were still a member of this body, would have been wholeheartedly pursuing the full implementation of the ecological vision that Wisconsinites and all Americans share for the Lakeshore. Unfortunately, as do many of the lands managed by the National Park Service, the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore finds itself, now 28 years later, with both some significant financial and legal resource needs. If we are to be true stewards of America's public lands, we need to be willing to make necessary financial investments and management improvements when they are warranted. Thus, I am introducing this legislation in an attempt to resolve the unfinished business that remains at the Lakeshore, as well as to renew our Nation's commitment to this beautiful place. 
Mr. President, the legislation has three major sections. First, it directs the Park Service to conduct a wilderness suitability study of the Lakeshore as required by the Wilderness Act. The legislation authorizes $200,000 for that purpose. 
This study mandate is needed to ensure that we have the appropriate level of management at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. The Wilderness Act and the National Park Service policies require the Park Service to conduct an evaluation of the lands it manages for possible inclusion in the National Wilderness system. Such a study would result in a recommendation to Congress about whether any of the federally-owned lands currently within the Lakeshore still retain the characteristics that would make them suitable to be legally designated as wilderness. The Congress would then have an opportunity to review such information. If Congress found that such information indicated that some of the federal lands within the Lakeshore were in need of legal wilderness status, Congress would have to subsequently pass legislation to confer such status. 
We need this study, Mr. President because, though 28 years have passed, we are not certain whether we are under- or over-managing the Lakeshore. During the General Management Planning Process for the Lakeshore, which was completed nearly a decade ago in 1989, the need for a formal wilderness study was identified. Although a wilderness study has been identified as a high priority by the Lakeshore, it has never been funded. 
Since 1989, most of the Lakeshore, roughly 80 percent of the acreage, is being managed by the Park Service as if it were federally designated wilderness. As a protective measure, all lands which might be suitable for wilderness designation were zoned to protect any wilderness characteristics they may have pending completion of the study. However, we may be managing lands as wilderness in the Lakeshore that might, due to use patterns, no longer be suitable for wilderness designation. Correspondingly, some land area may have become more ecologically sensitive and may need additional legal protection. 
Second, this legislation also directs the Park Service to protect the historic Raspberry Island and Outer Island lighthouses. The bill authorizes $3.9 million for bluff stabilization and other necessary actions. There are six lighthouses in the Apostle Island National Lakeshore--Sand Island, Devil's Island, Raspberry Island, Outer Island, Long Island and Michigan Island. 
Engineering studies completed for the National Park Service have determined that several of these lighthouses are in danger of structural damage due to the continued erosion of the red clay banks upon which they were built. The situations at Outer Island and Raspberry Island, the two which this legislation addresses, were determined to be in the most jeopardy. 
The Raspberry Island situation is most critical. The Raspberry Island lighthouse was completed in 1863 to mark the west channel through the Apostle Islands. The original light was a rectangular frame structure surmounted by a square tower that held a lens 40 feet above the ground. 
A fog signal building was added to Raspberry Island in 1902. The red brick structure housed a ten-inch steam whistle and a hoisting engine for a tramway. The need for additional personnel at the station led to a redesign of the lighthouse building in 1906-07. The structure was converted to a duplex, housing the keeper and his family in the east half, with the two assistant keepers sharing the west half. A 23-kilowatt, diesel-driven electric generator was installed at the station in 1928. The light was automated in 1947 and then moved to a metal tower in front of the fog signal building in 1952. 
Raspberry Island light is now the most frequently visited of Apostle Islands National Lakeshore's lighthouses. Recent erosion is threatening the access tram and the fog signal building. 
The Outer Island light station was built in 1874 on a red clay bluff 40 feet above Lake Superior. The lighthouse tower stands 90 feet high and the watchroom is encircled by an outside walkway and topped by the lantern. 
Historic architects have indicated to the Park Service that Outer Island lighthouse may already be suffering some structural damage due to its location on the bluff and the situation would be much worse if Lake Superior were exceedingly high. 
Engineers believe that preservation of these structures requires protection of the bluff beneath the lighthouses, stabilization of the banks, and dewatering of the area immediately shoreward of the bluffs. Although the projects have in the past been included within the Park Service-wide construction priorities, they have never been funded. 
Finally, this legislation adds language to the act which created the Lakeshore allowing the Park Service to enter into cooperative agreements with state, tribal, local governments, universities or other non-profit entities to enlist their assistance in managing the Lakeshore. Some parks have specific language in the act which created the park allowing them to enter into such agreements. Parks have used them for activities such as research, historic preservation, and emergency services. Apostle Islands currently does not have this authority, which this legislation adds. 
Other National Park lands and lands which are managed by the Park Service, such as the Lakeshore, have such authority. Adding such authority to the Lakeshore will be a way to make Lakeshore management resources go farther. The Park Service has the opportunity to carry out joint projects with other partners which could contribute to the management of the Lakeshore including: state, local, and tribal governments, universities, and non-profit groups. Such endeavors would have both scientific management and fiscal benefits. In the past, the Lakeshore has had to pass over opportunities because the specific authority has been absent. 
In his 1969 book on the environment, entitled America's Last Chance, Senator Nelson issued a political challenge: `I have come to the conclusion that the number one domestic problem facing this country is the threatened destruction of our natural resources and the disaster which would confront mankind should such destruction occur. There is a real question as to whether the nation, which has spent some two hundred years developing an intricate system of local, State and Federal Government to deal with the public's problems, will be bold, imaginative and flexible enough to meet this supreme test.' 
Though, fortunately, the Apostle Islands are not, because of former Senator Nelson's efforts, `threatened with destruction,' I believe that Senator Nelson meant two things by his challenge. Not only did he mean that government must act immediately and decisively to protect resources in crisis, but he also meant that government must be responsible and flexible enough to remain committed to the protection of the areas we wisely seek to preserve under our laws. 
Thus, Mr. President, on this Earth Day I am proud to introduce this legislation as a renewal of the federal government's commitment to the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the historic visit that is just ending today. 
I speak of the visit of President Clinton to Africa which began on March 22. As the Ranking Member of the Africa Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I know Africa's vital importance to the United States, and I applaud the President's effort to highlight Africa with this timely trip. 
President Clinton is the first sitting U.S. president since President Jimmy Carter to take such an extensive voyage in Africa, and he will the be the first sitting U.S. president ever to visit each of the individual countries on his itinerary. 
We can not underestimate the significance of this. 
Mr. President, millions of Americans trace their roots to Africa. Thousands of Americans have served in Africa in non-governmental organizations, church groups, or the Peace Corps, including many graduates of the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Our African heritage is prominent and pervasive in the art, music, and literature of American culture. More and more American tourists are journeying to see the natural wonders of the Serengeti, the Ghanaian Cape Coast or Victoria Falls. 
Although these ties bind every American to Africa, many of them in a very passionate and personal way, I am concerned that there is so little knowledge about Africa in this country, and so little interest. That is why the President's trip is so important. 
Many of the 48 distinct nations of Africa are now experiencing what some have called an `African Renaissance.' By whatever name, there can be no doubt that Africa is a continent much changed since the years immediately following the independence period. 
In some nations on that great continent, we see conflicts, coups and corruption. In others, we see the triumph of democracy and of the creative human spirit. In the past few years, too many of Africa's peoples have faced atrocities that rank among the worst of this century. At the same time, healthy changes have swept across much of the continent, and there is more reason for optimism about Africa's future than at any time in recent memory. 
First, there has been substantial political progress. In 1989, only five African nations could be described as `democratic.' Today, there are at least twenty. Where there used to be one-party states or military regimes, we now have governments that have developed new constitutions, held multiparty elections, and taken great strides toward reforming key institutions. Parliaments in countries like Ghana and Namibia are beginning to exercise a meaningful check on executive power. Local and national elections are being conducted freely and fairly in many countries. Journalists are more boldly exercising new press freedoms. 
The institutions that nourish true democracy are beginning to take root in the African soil. 
Second, many of the long-standing, violent conflicts that have ravaged the land and the peoples of Africa are coming to a close. Uganda, which suffered terribly throughout the 1980s, is now one of the most stable countries on the continent. The protracted war in the Horn of Africa ended with the peaceful secession of Eritrea, an important new actor on the African stage. The seeds of lasting peace have been planted in Liberia and Angola. And the promise of peace dangles before the peoples of Northern Mali and the Western Sahara. 
Third, many African nations have surged forward in human and social development. The scourge of AIDS continues to take its toll, but infant mortality rates have dropped significantly. Population growth has slowed to a more manageable rate. The drag of illiteracy still slows economic development, but more African children go to school now than at any other time since independence. 
African women, too, are playing a more active role in the future of their continent. In Botswana, an organization called `Stand Up Women' is working to expand the influence of women on national laws and policy. In South Africa, Ghana and elsewhere, female entrepreneurs are starting and managing their own businesses. Throughout Africa, more and more women are becoming involved in political life. Many have been elected to fledgling parliaments. 
Finally, Africa's economies are growing at impressive rates, with an estimated 4.5 percent GDP increase in 1997, according to the World Bank. In Senegal and Uganda, growth has topped 5 percent. 
Hope abides in Africa. And hope abides among those of us who see that a thriving Africa is good for America. 
Still, many African nations are plagued by authoritarian regimes that deny their citizens basic human rights. The economic and political potential of some nations are being squandered by ruling military juntas. In these few hold-out regimes, corruption, economic mismanagement and violent suppression of dissent are the norm. This is certainly true in Nigeria, a nation of great natural and human potential, which cannot be realized under the current regime. 
In Sudan, a decades-old war has killed hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians. Sudanese children are often forced into conscription, and many of them know the barrel of a gun better than the inside of a classroom. 
Other obstacles to development abound. Some of the poorest, most desolate places on earth are located in Africa. Life expectancy and adult literacy are the world's lowest, while population growth and the incidence of HIV/AIDS are the highest. Basic services that we as Americans take for granted--from clean drinking water and health care, to school books and paved roads--remain out of reach for millions of Africans. 
The combination of welcome progress and daunting problems in Africa present enormous challenges for U.S. policy. Some observers look at Africa and say, `This is a basket case!,' and see few redeeming features. These cynical voices--the so-called `Afro-pessimists'--believe America should disengage from the world and particularly from Africa; that the poverty and despair of others is not our problem, that the potential of Africa presents no opportunity. 
But as the history of this century has shown time and again, the problems of the world community, do, in fact, become ours. 
As the world becomes smaller and more inter-dependent, new dangers--terrorism, international crime, narcotics, and infectious disease, all of which are increasingly prevalent in Africa--will not stop at the border. Sudanese involvement is alleged in the World Trade Center bombing. In Wisconsin, hundreds of my constituents have received fraudulent scam letters from Nigeria. For a few days in 1995, we all worried about the threat of the Ebola virus which had recently appeared in the former Zaire. 
Mr. President, we cannot ignore these threats. 
Though mindful of the grim realities of Africa, the United States must encourage the positive developments that are already taking place there. We must embrace and encourage those changes, and not just because we are a generous people. Africa is a growing U.S. trading partner. U.S. exports to Sub-Saharan Africa increased 14 percent during 1996; that's twice as fast as the growth rate of total U.S. exports worldwide. Few people realize that the United States currently exports more to sub-Saharan Africa than to all of the former Soviet republics combined. More and more forward-thinking American companies have their eye on the vibrant potential markets in Africa. 
By going to Africa, President Clinton recognizes Africa's importance to the U.S. and demonstrates his steadfast commitment to America's crucial role in supporting Africa's burgeoning democracies, aiding economic growth, maintaining recent peace agreements, and preventing future conflicts. 
The President's trip is both symbol and substantive statement. There have been moving moments with genocide survivors in Rwanda and with South African President Nelson Mandela, with school children in Uganda and with Peace Corps volunteers in Ghana. 
Each of the countries on President Clinton's itinerary represents some facet of Africa's accomplishments. Each is an important U.S. partner. 
The President has also announced several new policy initiatives, including an important education program and a welcome push for the Senate to ratify the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification, a treaty currently pending before this body. President Clinton has expressed his commitment to maintaining existing programs, including the Africa Crisis Response Initiative, a U.S.-led effort to help African militaries gain the capacity to participate in peacekeeping operations. I have supported this initiative here on the Senate floor. 
As part of his itinerary, the President scheduled three highly significant roundtable meetings. The first, a meeting with young South African leaders outside Johannesburg, served to highlight the promise of the new generation in Africa--young people who were born well after the independence period, and who are anxious to seize new opportunities. 
The second, a meeting with African environmentalists, helped give focus to some of the environmental challenges on the continent. 
The third, a meeting with human rights and democracy activists at his last stop in Senegal, served to highlight America's commitment to human rights and democracy in Africa and the need to sustain that commitment. 
Above all, this trip presented a perfect opportunity for the United States to make clear its stated policy of support for human rights and good governance in Africa. Before he departed, I wrote to the President and asked him to consider a few ways in which he might demonstrate his commitment to these principles. 
Recognizing the unique challenges posed by the recent history of the troubled Great Lakes region, I asked that the President make clear the United States' unwavering support for democracy in the region. For example, I urged him to articulate clear criteria for the Democratic Republic of the Congo to gain U.S. assistance, including lifting existing bans on opposition political activity and ceasing harassment of lawful components of civil society. I also urged extreme caution in any attempt by the administration to seek security assistance for the Rwandan military, which has been responsible for widespread killing of civilians. Without strong statements by the administration against these practices, the U.S. risks sending the wrong signal about our priorities and our values. 
I also told the President of my hope that this trip would help strengthen the President's resolve with respect to our Nigeria policy, particularly in light of the continuing 
deterioration of the human rights situation in Nigeria. I have long been concerned about the perceived lack of a policy in Nigeria. That is why I urged the President to take the strongest position possible in support of democracy in that country. I told him I appreciated the remarks delivered recently by Assistant Secretary Susan Rice before the Senate Subcommittee on Africa that made clear that the United States would not accept the election of a military candidate in Nigeria's upcoming elections. This was a very important statement, and one that I had hoped would mark the beginning of a more coherent, resolute Nigeria policy for the United States. 
That hope was all but extinguished when I heard the President remark last Friday that Nigeria's current military ruler, General Sani Abacha, would be considered acceptable by the United States if he chose to run in the country's upcoming election as a civilian. Other administration officials later tried to clarify the President's remarks by noting that the U.S. objective is to support a viable transition to civilian rule. They also noted, correctly, that the so-called `transition' process currently underway in Nigeria appears structured expressly to keep Gen. Abacha in power. In effect, they acknowledged the contradiction between our Nigeria policy and the political realities there. 
Virtually none of the institutions that would allow for a free and fair election--an independent electoral commission, an open registration process, or open procedures for the participation of independent political parties, for example--have been put into place. Repression continues unabated: political prisoners remain in prison, the press remains heavily constrained, and the fruits of Nigeria's abundant natural resources remain in the hands of Abacha's supporters. 
Unfortunately, I fear the President's remarks may have done real damage already, by indicating to Gen. Abacha and his cronies that if Abacha were to take off his military uniform, throw on civilian clothes, and win an election, it would be OK with the United States. I fear the United States has explicitly agreed to accept a wolf in sheep's clothing! 
Well, lest anyone get the wrong idea, let me say that I believe, and I hope most of my colleagues believe, an electoral victory for Abacha would hardly represent a transition to democracy. It would be totally unacceptable. I hope that President Clinton will clarify the policy of the United States with respect to Nigeria soon. It is high time the policy review that began nearly two years ago is completed, so we do not have this alarming confusion. 
Nigeria must know that anything less than a transparent transition to civilian rule will be met with severe policy consequences. 
Finally, I emphasized to the President that the United States should make support for Africa's organizations of civil society a higher priority. These groups do courageous work to promote human rights standards and to monitor their governments' compliance. Accordingly, U.S. officials must speak out publicly when these courageous people are abused by their governments. I have urged the President to take the opportunity to highlight the vital work being performed by a broad range of civil society organizations, including those facing government repression. 
Mr. President, I was concerned last December when some news reports following Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's trip to Africa included statements by U.S. officials that it would be unfair to hold certain African governments to `Western' standards of personal and political freedom. Not only does this contradict stated U.S. policy, it is a condescending, unnecessary and dangerous concession to make to African governments that flout human rights. 
A clear message on democracy and human rights is especially important as the U.S. works with African nations to strengthen their economies. Economic growth is crucial to any nation's success, but the U.S. must ensure that as it helps to foster economic development, it also fosters political and personal freedoms. Not only does the U.S. have a moral obligation to promote human rights, Africa's post-colonial history shows us that African nations with long-term democratic rule are also the nations with the best long-term economic performances. Freedom fosters prosperity. 
The respect a government shows for human rights can tell us whether that regime will respect its neighbors, its trading partners, and the world community at large. A government that does not respect the rights of its people cannot be trusted to honor a trade agreement or a treaty, much less the rule of law in general. This is as true for Nigeria as it is for China. 
The common thread running through our Africa policy must be the U.S. commitment to democracy and human rights. Without this commitment, true peace cannot take root and economic growth will ultimately falter. Now more than ever we must make clear our commitment to democracy and human rights, both to governments working toward these goals, and, more importantly, to those repressive regimes that are not. 
Mr. President, I welcome the energy the Clinton administration has devoted to Africa and to U.S. policy there. I look forward to working with the President in the future to capitalize on the momentum that will certainly be created by this most historic trip.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President I am very pleased to join with my friend, the Senator from Arkansas, and my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, in offering an amendment that enables States to comply with the IDEA Program Act. 
Mr. President, I promised to hold a town meeting or listening session in each of Wisconsin's 62 counties each year of my first term as a Senator. At these meetings I very frequently hear from both parents and school officials talking about the merits of the IDEA program. They struggle to meet the high costs of disabled education and need additional Federal funding for the program. Of course, this amendment, as good as it is, will by no means meet all of these needs. However, it will finally provide some deserved relief for this deserving constituency. 
The funds our amendment provides for the IDEA program are derived, as the Senator from Arkansas has indicated, from the elimination of the percentage depletion allowances tax deduction for companies mining on U.S. public lands. What this does is simply close an outdated subsidy that contributes to environmental degradation. We can assist States providing for our Nation's disabled youth by using some of these funds that are going for tax loopholes. 
Mining companies have a special percentage depletion tax deduction that they can take which other companies can't receive. Under percentage depletion, the deduction for recovery of a company's investment is a fixed percentage of `gross income'; namely, sales revenue from the sale of the mineral. This percentage is specifically defined in the Tax Code, and under this method total deductions may exceed the capital that the company actually invested. 
The rates for percentage depletion are quite significant. Section 613 of the U.S. Tax Code contains depletion allowances for more than 70 metals and minerals at rates ranging from 10 to 22 percent. 
In today's budget climate, we are faced with the question of who should bear the costs of exploration, development and production of natural resources. The question is, should it be all taxpayers or the users and producers of the resource? 
Given that we face significant constraints in funding other budget priorities such as the IDEA program, these subsidies are really nothing more than a tax expenditure that shifts a greater tax burden to other taxpayers to pay for the IDEA program to compensate for the special tax breaks provided to the mining industry. 
I am delighted to join with the other Senators in this very appropriate shifting of our priorities. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I offer this amendment to establish a narrowly focused, deficit-neutral reserve fund to help people with disabilities become employed and remain independent. While it does not specify a specific proposal, I want it to be clear that we have crafted this reserve fund with a very specific measure in mind, and that is the bipartisan Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1998, S. 1858, which was developed under the leadership of the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords. 
We truly offer people with disabilities a chance to leave the disability rolls and become self-sufficient taxpayers. If just 1 percent of the 7.5 million Americans with disabilities become successfully employed, it is estimated it will save, in cash assistance alone, over $3.5 billion. So I urge the body to support this narrowly targeted, capped, deficit-neutral reserve fund.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina for yielding and, more importantly, for taking the lead on this amendment. There is no more important amendment in this whole budget resolution than the Hollings amendment. This goes to the heart of the matter. 
Madam President, I am pleased to join my good friend, the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings), in offering this amendment to close a loophole in the rules protecting the Social Security Trust Fund balances. 
Let me note it gives me particular pleasure in cosponsoring this amendment with Senator Hollings; both in this body and in the Budget Committee, he has been a consistent voice for fiscal prudence. 
There is a fundamental difference between the way many in Congress approach the budget, and the way I approach it. 
That difference is Social Security. 
Since the time Lyndon Johnson lived in the White House, Presidents of both parties and Congresses controlled by both parties have included the Social Security Trust Fund balances in their budget calculations. 
The result is a false picture of our country's fiscal health, and, just like a false medical report that covers up a serious illness, it can lead to major problems in the future. 
This false budget picture has been used so often it has become almost a matter of `budget convention,' and it has so impressed itself into the vocabulary of the budget that we now hear the word `surplus' when there is no surplus. 
We hear people talking about a budget `surplus' in Congress, in news stories, and in the letters we receive from constituents. 
But there is no surplus; there is a deficit that is still being hidden, and Social Security is the curtain used to hide it. 
We need look no further than the budget resolution itself. 
On page 5 of S. Con. Res. 86, the deficit levels are listed for Fiscal Years 1998 through 2003. 
For Fiscal Year 1998, the deficit is $95 billion. 
The deficit rises to over $120 billion in Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001 before returning to levels below $100 billion, reaching $92 billion in Fiscal Year 2003. 
With surpluses like these, who needs deficits? 
Despite these continuing deficits, many in this body want to act as if we have a surplus--free money to hand out in the form of new spending or new tax cuts. 
The notion of a so-called unified budget, which began as a political convenience to mask the deficit almost 30 years ago, has now become the budget reality for many. 
This must stop. 
`Surplus' is supposed to mean something extra, like a bonus. 
It means, all the bills are paid and there is money left over. 
One dictionary defines `surplus' as: `something more than or in excess of what is needed or required.' 
The so-called unified budget surplus is not `more than or in excess of what is needed or required.' 
Those funds are needed; they are needed to pay future Social Security benefits. 
They were raised by the Social Security system, specifically in anticipation of commitments to future Social Security beneficiaries. 
When Congress makes budget obligations today based on those Social Security funds--whether in the form of tax cuts or spending increases--we are committing to a path of fiscal policy that jeopardizes future Social Security benefits. 
The amendment Senator Hollings and I are offering is designed to shore up protections surrounding Social Security, and end talk of budget surpluses that are not really there. 
Our amendment does so by closing a loophole in the supermajority protections we give to Social Security. 
It establishes a point of order against any measure that would allow Congress to change the off-budget status of Social Security, directly or indirectly, without a supermajority vote. 
Under most circumstances, our rules require a supermajority vote to change the budget treatment of Social Security. 
But while supermajority points of order usually protect the Social Security Trust Fund balances, in certain circumstances those points of order are subject to amendment or repeal by only a simple majority vote. 
While legislation to amend budget rules and laws generally is subject to a supermajority point of order, under Section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, this point of order does not apply to legislation or a budget resolution that has been reported or discharged from the Senate Budget Committee, or to any amendments to such legislation. 
Our amendment eliminates this loophole in the supermajority protections we have established for Social Security. 
We must play it straight with the American people, and we must give them an honest balanced budget. 
This means Congress must stop pretending there is a surplus, and start acknowledging we still have a way to go before our budget is truly in balance. 
I very much hope our colleagues will support this sensible protection for Social Security, and will join us in making it harder to change our budget rules in a way which would allow Social Security Trust Fund balances to be used to pay for spending increases or tax cuts. 
Madam President, let me reiterate, the fact is, we do not have a surplus. All this talk about a surplus is not accurate, and the American people know it. We have made tremendous progress. I am glad that much of it was done in 1993. Some of it was done last year. But the fact is, we have a long way to go. 
What the Senator from South Carolina is doing is just trying to make this body face up to the reality by creating a little higher standard, a 60-vote rule rather than a majority-vote rule to continue this practice. This practice should not be continued at all. There should not be any 60 votes or 70 votes or 80 votes to use Social Security to try to pretend there is a real balanced budget. At least under the Hollings amendment, the standard would be tougher. It would require 60 votes. You couldn't sanitize the process by running it through the Budget Committee. 
This is to me the most fundamental issue here, because we are, in effect, telling the American people something that just is not true. We have done well. The economy has stayed very solid throughout this, but to pretend that there is extra money, to pretend that we can do spending or big tax cuts at this time is not straightforward. This, of course, is not just with regard to our senior citizens. 
The Social Security fund is in good shape for a number of years to come but it has more to do with the baby boomers and the young people in their twenties and thirties and those in high school and even younger. 
I have had the experience of having high school kids ask me at high school forums not just about the issues one expects high school students to ask about, but whether or not Social Security will be there when they get to that age. That is an unusual question for a high school student, but they know they are potentially being taken for a ride. 
Many of them are working. They are getting a check from, let's say, McDonald's, and they notice something is being taken out of their checks. `What is it being taken out for?' 
`Well, for Social Security.' 
Then they find out it might not be there for them. 
What the Senator from South Carolina is saying is the Congress should stop borrowing from Social Security to try to make this look better. This is a very, very important amendment for truth in budgeting. 
I thank the Senator from South Carolina and yield back any time.  
Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Washington. I speak in strong favor of her amendment. The resolution offers a deficit-neutral reserve fund for class size improvement. Specifically, it states that if funds become available, budget levels may be adjusted for legislation to improve, or in effect lower, class size for students, especially in the earliest grades. 
I thank the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, for being the leader on this issue of class size for public schools. She and I share the same commitment to public education and believe strongly that the Federal Government has a limited but very important role in supporting public education. 
Today's resolution, Mr. President, is very important because it demonstrates a commitment by the U.S. Senate to dedicate available Federal funds to reduce class size in the earliest grades. 
Parents, teachers and school administrators are increasingly aware of the very positive impact smaller class size can have on student achievement. It is about time that the Senate goes on record in support of smaller classes for our public school children in the earliest grades. 
The positive impact of smaller classes came to my attention in my State of Wisconsin, and that is because Wisconsin, as is often the case in public education, has been a leader on this issue. In 1995, the Wisconsin State Legislature created the successful pilot program called the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education program, known as the SAGE program. 
Wisconsin's SAGE program has demonstrated again and again what we really know instinctively: Students in smaller classes benefit from more attention from teachers, and teachers with fewer students will have more time and energy to devote to their jobs.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will send an amendment to the desk with regard to Bosnia, but let me take this opportunity to thank the Senator from Texas once again for her leadership on this issue. I have enjoyed working with her on the issue. I think the only thing that is regrettable is, we still have to be working on it so many years later, after we identified the problem in the misrepresentations that have been demonstrated in this Bosnia mission. 
I am hearing more and more concern back in my State of Wisconsin about the unlimited nature of this engagement. It troubles me a good deal that my constituents feel they were told that this was going to be a 1-year mission, that it was only going to cost $2 billion, and if this didn't work out we would be out of there. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Mr. President, I hope that either on this bill or in the bills that come later this year we have an opportunity to get some clarity and some time line and some absolute definition to this operation, because the American people are just saying, `Why? Why is it that we are bearing this entire burden, or such a huge percentage of this burden, when it seems that the European countries could do so much more to provide for the needs of this area?' 
I will say a word or two about an amendment I intend to offer later. The amendment is a little unusual and requires a little explanation. What my amendment would do is strike the `emergency' designation from each of the line items in this supplemental appropriations bill that provide funds to support U.S. peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, but it would leave such designation intact for funds to support our additional military needs in the southwest Asia area, which, as we know, refers to the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf. 
I will offer this amendment for two reasons. First and foremost, I have always had serious questions about our involvement in the Bosnia mission. I was the only Democrat to vote against the deployment of U.S. troops back in 1995, in large part because I did not believe that the United States would be able to complete its mission there within the time and within the financial constraints that have been identified. I am sorry to say that I have been proven right. I take absolutely no pleasure in this. It has been very expensive and very dangerous. 
U.S. forces have now been in Bosnia for more than 2 years--much longer than the original 1-year mandate--and I don't think anyone has a good idea about how much longer we will be there. More significantly perhaps, the cost of our involvement hasn't been $2 billion, it has actually been quadrupled from that figure; it has been $8 billion. And now Congress is being asked to fork over another half a billion, with no end in sight. 
There is a second reason for this amendment, and that is that the legislation before the Senate today, S. 1768, is an emergency appropriations bill. The President has submitted a supplemental appropriations request, and we are debating this bill today precisely because we have been faced with some unforeseen emergencies. There have been floods in California, tornadoes in Florida, a typhoon in Guam, and ice storms in many areas of the Northeast. The showdown with Saddam Hussein took on new and frightening intensity in the past 6 months, and the United States came very close to carrying out airstrikes on a scale that was at least somewhat reminiscent of Desert Storm. We have all faced the unforeseen consequences of the so-called ubiquitous El Nino effect which has had bizarre and sometimes tragic influences on our weather patterns nationwide. 
The Congress has never developed firm rules on how we should define an `emergency.' Everybody assumes that we will use common sense when deciding when to grant special emergency treatment to certain expenditures. And common sense tells us that floods and tornados clearly are emergencies. 
In my view, however, the mission in Bosnia, is not. It is a substantial, long-term commitment. It is something the United States has, for better or worse, decided to do for the long-term. If events there take an unexpected turn for the worse, it may become an emergency. But as we stand here and debate this spending bill, it is not an emergency. 
Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines the word `emergency' as follows: `an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting state that calls for immediate action.' 
This definition clearly does not apply to the Bosnia mission. The Bosnia mission is an emergency only in the strange language of appropriations bills. The Bosnia `emergency' is a legislative fiction. 
The line items in this bill--military personnel, operations and maintenance, and contingency funds--are standard military costs that would be part of any military mission. U.S. troops have been on the ground in Bosnia for more than two years. The change in designation from IFOR [eye-fore] to SFOR [ess-fore] was made more than a year ago and is scheduled to continue through June of this year. Then, last December, the President announced that he would forego imposing a deadline altogether, and opt instead for a policy of benchmarks whose definitions remain open to interpretation. 
How can Congress and the President possibly profess to the American people that the additional costs for the Bosnia mission constitute an emergency? On the contrary, it has been clear for quite a while now that the cost of this mission would again rise substantially. Some would say it has been clear from the start. 
Ironically, Congressional appropriators and our military leaders have planned for many months on obtaining these funds in this emergency spending bill. 
So that invites my next question: What are these funds doing in this bill? I just do not think that you can equate the long anticipated needs of the operation in Bosnia with the urgent, unexpected needs of the farmers in California or homeowners in Florida who have been devastated by natural disaster. 
Despite my long-standing opposition to the mission in Bosnia, I believe the Congress should take up and debate the additional appropriations needed to advance the administration's goals in that war-torn region, but not on an `emergency' bill. In the proper context of an ordinary appropriation, subject to ordinary budget rules, I will state my own reservations about this mission and will listen carefully to my colleagues who have supported this mission. Then we can decide whether to spend this money and where to get it without increasing the deficit. 
This supplemental appropriation, which represents so many dire and urgent needs, is not the appropriate legislative vehicle for Bosnia spending. 
Now, I considered offering an amendment that would have stricken all of the funds designated for the Bosnia mission based on this same rationale. I am not doing that today, because I recognize there is little support in the Senate for such an abrupt funding cut-off. My amendment is neutral as to the merits of the mission in Bosnia. It simply requires us to fund it in a responsible manner. 
This bill should be limited to the true emergencies represented by the bulk of the remaining $2 billion and should not include the non-emergency that is the Bosnia mission. But as important as that technical change may be, this amendment has some real substantive teeth. By changing the designation in this way, Congress will be mandating that funds used to support the Bosnia operation fall under the same budgetary scrutiny and discipline that other spending does. If this amendment is adopted, and the Senate decides the Bosnia appropriations do not merit the special treatment an emergency designation confers, the Bosnia-related appropriations would be subject to the same budget discipline we impose on all other non-emergencies. Congress would have to cut enough spending to offset the cost of this new Bosnia money. If that did not happen, OMB would trigger an across-the-board sequester--in effect doing the work for us. 
The mission in Bosnia does not represent an emergency that legitimately calls for us to depart from these, established, vital budget rules so casually. We must separate the Bosnia money from the true emergencies funded in the rest of this bill. 
I urge my colleagues to think carefully about my amendment, because this speaks to our commitment to truly balance the budget. Any Senator can support this amendment, and then consider funding for Bosnia operations in a more fiscally responsible way, without stepping away from any existing commitment to the troops and the mission in Bosnia. 
I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am glad to have a brief opportunity to further explain why I have offered this amendment concerning Bosnia. I believe there will be an opportunity to vote on this, perhaps in the context of a motion to table, very soon, perhaps as soon as 1:30, so I would like to offer just a couple of remarks about why I have offered this amendment. 
What the amendment would do is remove the emergency designation from the Bosnia money that is in this bill. There are various pots of money in this bill, but I am only talking here about the Bosnia money concerning the operation in the Bosnia theater. If the Senate determines that these funds are not an emergency--if I am able to prevail in this amendment--then they would be treated like any other kind of spending, any other kind of regular spending. In other words, under this scenario, if the administration wants to have these expenditures, they would have to follow the regular procedure. 
That is, the administration and the Members of Congress would have to find an offset from within the budget caps for these defense expenditures. Otherwise, these defense expenditures would be sequestered. 
The reason I am offering this is that the emergency designation as drafted in this bill for the Bosnia funding is really just a way around spending caps. In my mind, it is a ruse. It is just a budget fiction. It means we are ignoring our own budget caps. 
My personal preference would be that we had not put ourselves in the first place in the position of having our troops in Bosnia this way. I opposed the deploying of our troops to Bosnia and still do. Since we have and we are in the situation that we are in, I think at a bare minimum with regard to the continuing of the Bosnia mission, we have to exercise some budget discipline here. Why wouldn't the budget rules apply to this Bosnia situation? 
What my amendment does is help us exercise that discipline. It strikes the emergency designation for the Bosnia money, again for the simple reason that the Bosnia operation is certainly a very important operation but it is not an emergency. It is very hard to argue that the ongoing, ever-lengthening mission in Bosnia is an emergency. Yet we are faced with this emergency designation as a way to bootstrap this funding into this bill which is supposed to be about emergencies. 
This amendment does not set an end date by which our troops should leave Bosnia, although I do want to see us do that. I hope it would be no later than June 30 of this year. This amendment does not call for our troop withdrawal at this time, although I very much would like to see that happen. All it does is simply force the administration to be straightforward and force the supporters of the administration's policies to be straightforward and to face the reality of the fiscal demands of this mission. 
What has happened here is an operation that we were told would only cost $2 billion has already cost the American people $8 billion, and now we are asked to put another half a billion into this, and somehow people are arguing that it is on the basis of an emergency situation. That is simply not credible. This speaks both to the problem of the Bosnia mission and the problem we have with budgeting in general in this country. People are appalled that emergency bills are used as windows of opportunity to achieve other agendas. I am the first to admit that there have been more gross violations than this one, but this is a lot of money, and the American people are beginning to wake up to the fact that we have spent 8 billion American dollars in the Bosnia situation. 
At a bare minimum, what we try to do in this amendment is say, `Let's find out how we are going to pay for this. Let's have the budget rules apply. Let's have the administration and the Congress say exactly how they will pay for this,' instead of, in effect, deficit spending that is being used to fund the Bosnia mission. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his courtesy, and I want to speak for just a minute in response to the chairman's remarks. I appreciate the remarks. I understand the difficult situation he is in. 
But what I can't understand is why we let the administration and others who have represented to us certain limits with regard to the Bosnia operation put us in this position. The leadership of this body said this would cost $2 billion, and that is it, and we would be there for 1 year, and that is it. Now it has cost $8 billion and another $ 1/2 billion. Yet they don't provide us with a way to prepay for it. They don't tell us how to offset it. But what they are, in effect, asking us to do--forcing us to do--is to take this out of Social Security. It is deficit spending. It is deficit spending. Sometimes we have to do it, as the chairman has pointed out, in true emergencies. Some of what is in this bill I can't deny involves true emergencies, such as tornadoes and floods. But why should we let this administration put us in the position of having to deficit spend to add onto what is already a quadruple of the $2 billion we were promised this would cost? 
So, Mr. President, all we are trying to do is have a little truth in budgeting here, remove the emergency designation, and have an honest accounting of how this should be paid for. 
But I sure want to recognize the chairman's challenge in this area. It is very difficult. In effect, he and others are being forced to have to do this in a situation that isn't appropriate. The administration and others should have identified an offset. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend from Arizona, Mr. McCain, in offering this amendment to strike a number of extraneous provisions from the emergency supplemental appropriations bill. 
These provisions are only the most recent example of the abuse of our emergency appropriations process. 
In general, the rules require that new spending, whether through direct spending, tax expenditures, or discretionary programs, be offset with spending cuts or revenue increases. 
However, the rules provide for exceptions in the event of true emergencies. 
The deliberate review through the federal budget process, weighing one priority against another, may not permit a timely response to an international crisis, a natural disaster, or some other emergency. 
We do not ask that earthquake victims find a funding source before we send them aid, though that should not, even in dire circumstances, be read to imply we must not find ways to pay for emergencies, rather than simply add their costs to the deficit. 
But, Mr. President, the emergency exception to our budget rules, designed to expedite a response to an urgent need, has become a loophole, abused by those trying to circumvent the scrutiny of the budget process, in particular, by adding non-emergency matters to emergency legislation that is receiving special, accelerated consideration. 
One former Member of the other body, who was especially skilled at advancing spending items, was quoted as saying, `I never saw a disaster that wasn't an opportunity.' 
That, in a nutshell, is still the unfortunate attitude of a few. 
Mr. President, there is a long history of adding non-emergency special interest items to emergency supplemental measures. 
Just last year, a number of items were included in the disaster relief bill that had absolutely nothing to do with the need for emergency relief: an additional $35 million available for new grants under the Advanced Technology Program; a $5 million earmark for study of water allocation issues in Alabama, Florida, 
and Georgia; $15 million for research on environmental factors affecting breast cancer; $650,000 for the National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education; $16 million for continued development of Automated Targeting System for the Customs Service; a $12.3 million set-aside for construction of a parking garage at a VA medical center in Cleveland; and, a $500,000 earmark for a parking garage in Ashland, Kentucky. 
Mr. President, we even used the emergency relief bill to give the Secretary of the Senate $5 million for the development of a Legislative Information System. 
In the 103rd Congress, when the appropriations bill to provide relief for the Los Angeles earthquake was introduced, it initially did four things: provided $7.8 billion for the Los Angeles quake, $1.2 billion for the Department of Defense peacekeeping operations; $436 million for Midwest flood relief, and $315 million more for the 1989 California earthquake. 
But, Mr. President, by the time the Los Angeles earthquake bill became law, it also provided: $1.4 million to fight potato fungus; $2.3 million for FDA pay raises; $14.4 million for the National Park Service; $12.4 million for the Bureau of Indian Affairs; $10 million for a new Amtrak station in New York; $40 million for the space shuttle; $20 million for a fingerprint lab; $500,000 for United States Trade Representative travel office; and $5.2 million for the Bureau of Public Debt. 
Mr. President, we now come to this year's model, and not much has changed. 
The Senator from Arizona's amendment seeks to eliminate a number of extraneous provisions in the current emergency supplemental appropriations bill, including: $7.5 million to begin repair and rehabilitation of the Capitol Dome; $4 million for development and demonstration of dielectric wall accelerator technology for remote explosive detonation, radiography, and fusion applications; and, $2 million for payments to counties to replace funds expected from timber road construction projects. 
Mr. President, some of these projects may well be worthy. 
In fact, the last provision I mentioned, providing $2 million in payments to counties to replace funds expected from timber road construction projects, is something I believe may have great merit. 
But, Mr. President, just because a provision may be worthwhile does not justify using an emergency appropriations bill to skirt normal budget scrutiny. 
Mr. President, though non-emergency matters attached to emergency bills are still subject to the spending caps established in the concurrent budget resolution, as long as total spending remains under those caps, these unrelated spending matters are not required to be offset with spending cuts. 
Some might suggest that new spending is less a problem on emergency supplemental appropriations when it is offset with spending cuts. 
But, Mr. President, in such instances, we miss an opportunity to use those rescissions to reduce the deficit, having instead to use them just to stay even. 
Moreover, by using emergency appropriations bills as a vehicle, these extraneous proposals avoid the normal scrutiny through which legislative proposals must go to justify Federal spending. 
Mr. President, those who add unrelated provisions to disaster relief measures are engaging in a game of chicken--daring the body to oppose the emergency relief that may be desperately needed. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this reckless approach, and support the McCain amendment to strip out the unrequested provisions added to this emergency supplemental appropriations measure.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to tell a story that perhaps will intrigue and may be worthy of Tom Clancy's best novel. The story has a little bit of deception and what might be called good old-fashioned Government coverup. Maybe if we could get Alec Baldwin and Sharon Stone, we might even have a halfway decent movie to boot. But the unfortunate aspect of this story is that it is true and that the American people are the ones who I think are getting duped. 
Mr. President, the Navy's F/A-18 E/F `Super Hornet' program is foundering and the Defense Department is doing everything in its power to keep it afloat. Last April I requested a review of this program by the General Accounting Office. Just this week the GAO finished its work on this report. The report itself raises numerous questions regarding the aircraft and also the Navy's judgment in developing, producing, and testing the aircraft. Perhaps even more telling, though, is the Navy aircraft's testing team's efforts to keep this wasteful and unnecessary program alive. 
The new GAO report makes the following recommendations: 
First, that the Department of Defense and the Navy adopt a more cautious approach as they make funding decisions and prepare for the operational testing of the Super Hornet; 
No. 2, that the Department of Defense direct the Secretary of Navy not to approve contracting of additional F/A-18E/F aircraft beyond the first 12 for the first low-rate production phase until the Navy demonstrates through flight testing that these deficiencies that we are talking about are corrected; and, 
No. 3, that the Navy not begin operational testing and evaluation of these planes until the corrections are 
incorporated into the aircraft used for operational testing and evaluation. 
These GAO recommendations seem reasonable. Even DOD has agreed in part with the first two recommendations. But DOD resists agreeing to anything that could delay the development process. They are so adamant in ramming this program through that they decided to cut out valuable data-gathering requirements so they could still maintain their test schedule. As our first chart shows, the new report quotes the Navy's Program Risk Advisory Board, which states that the current F/A-18C is actually better than the E/F in some performance areas, including some acceleration and maneuvering. What that means is the current plane, the one the Navy says we have to switch from, from the current plan for the Super Hornet, actually may do better in some of these areas than the plane that would come in the future. 
The report also states that the Navy will likely exceed the $4.88 billion development cost cap on this program. This report falls on the heels of another GAO report on this subject in late 1996 which concluded that the only marginal improvements of the F/A-18E/F are far outweighed by the much higher cost of the E and F planes as compared to the C/D planes. The revelation in these reports force us, the President, and the buyers of this aircraft to cast a wary eye on the Super Hornet program. 
Let me back up for a minute to put this recent series of recommendations by the GAO into context. The Super Hornet, the F/A-18E/F, is just one of three costly new fighter programs that the Department of Defense has on the drawing board right now. In addition to the Super Hornet, there is the Air Force's F-22, and also the Joint Strike Fighter. 
The Joint Strike Fighter is intended to perform virtually every type of fighter aircraft mission in today's force structure. The Joint Strike Fighter is expected to be a stealthy strike aircraft built on a single production line with a high degree of commonality of parts and cost. The Navy plans to procure 300 JSF's, with a projected initial operational capability beginning around the year 2007. Demonstration studies indicate that the JSF--this is as compared to the Super Hornet--will have superior or comparable capabilities in all Navy tactical mission aircraft areas, especially range and survivability, at far less cost than the Super Hornet or any other existing or planned carrier-based tactical aircraft. 
The Navy's JSF variant is expected to have longer ranges than the Super Hornet to attack high-value targets without having to use external tanks. Unlike the Super Hornet, which would carry all of its weapons externally, the Navy's Joint Strike Fighter will carry internally at least four weapons for both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. That, of course, would maximize its stealthiness. 
Finally, the JSF would not require jamming support from the EA-6B Prowler aircraft as does the Super Hornet in carrying out its mission in the face of integrated air defense systems, and, while the Joint Strike Fighter is expected to have superior operational capabilities as compared to the Super Hornet, it is expected that it can be developed and procured at far less cost than the Super Hornet. However, there are few who look at this whole picture of how much we are talking about for all three of these new planes and who can honestly say we can afford all three tactical fighter programs. 
This chart that we have up now shows the total estimated 
cost for all three of these planes--the F-22, the Super Hornet, and the JSF. That total figure is an astonishing $397 billion. 
That is enough to pay for the fiscal year 1998 appropriations for the Department of Defense plus Veterans Affairs plus Housing and Urban Development plus Treasury plus Energy plus Military Construction and the Legislative Branch Appropriations thrown in as well. With the money we would spend on these three tactical fighter programs, we could pay for all of those things and we would still have $1 billion change back in your pocket, as they might say at McDonald's. 
The GAO, the CBO, the National Defense Panel, and many others agree that the likelihood that all three of these plane programs can be fully funded with the planned number of aircraft buys is virtually nil. 
Interestingly, the Marine Corps has decided not to purchase any of the Super Hornets. The Marine Corps has decided that the E/Fs are too expensive and that the Super Hornets--the F/A-18Cs and Ds, the planes currently flown by marine aviators--are up to their mission. They know, and say, that the C/D is adequate for what they have to do now and so they have wisely opted to wait--not have the current C/D, then go to the Super Hornet, and then go to the Joint Strike Fighters. What the Marines are apparently saying is they will wait for that Joint Strike Fighter instead of putting us to the enormous expense of moving up to the Super Hornet. Given our fiscal constraints, we cannot afford to finance three separate fighter planes that accumulate to the final costs that these three programs involve. Over the next few minutes, I will just cite a few of the many reasons that we really ought to put an end to the Super Hornet E/F program. 
The Navy and the planes' manufacturer, Boeing, base their argument for the need to develop and procure the Super Hornet on existing or projected operational deficiencies of the C/D plane in five different areas: strike range, carrier recovery payload, survivability, avionics growth space, and payload capacity. 
The Navy and Boeing like to call these five points the `five pillars' of the Super Hornet program. But the new GAO report and my own review of the program show that these five pillars of the Super Hornet are actually weak and crumbling. GAO identifies problems with E/F in each of these five key areas, and the responses that the Navy has to each of these concerns are actually at odds with their own arguments in favor of the E/F program. 
In the report, GAO identifies problems that could diminish the effectiveness of the plane's survivability improvements, problems that could degrade engine performance and service life, and dangerous weapons separation problems that do require additional testing. As recently as July 1997, the Navy's Program Risk Advisory Board stated that `operational testing may determine that the aircraft is not operationally effective or suitable.' 
In December, the board reversed its position and then said the following, that the E/F is potentially operationally effective and suitable, but also reiterated that it did have quality concerns with certain systems that are supposed to make the E/F Super Hornet superior to the current C/D. 
Mr. President, these are not the words of a glowing review for any program, but they are downright awful for an aircraft program some estimate will cost over $106 billion. We should not gamble with our pilots' lives. We should not gamble with more than $100 billion of taxpayers' money. These stakes are too high. 
Also, in the new report GAO asserts that the E/F doesn't accelerate or maneuver as well as the current C/D plane. DOD agrees with this point but says that this is an acceptable tradeoff for an E/F that is more capable in other respects. I wonder if the pilot flying the E/F would agree with that kind of a tradeoff. 
It gets better--or, really, worse. The publication `Inside the Pentagon' reported in its February 19 issue that the Navy will not hold the Super Hornet to strict performance specifications in three areas. It published a copy of a memo written by Rear Adm. Dennis McGinn, the Navy's officer in charge of air warfare programs, that ordered the Super Hornet would not be strictly held to performance specifications in turning, climbing and maneuvering. 
Everyone can agree that these are important performance criteria for a state-of-the-art fighter and attack plane. 
It turns out that the memo was sent to the E/F test team after, Mr. President, after the team concluded that the E/F was, in some cases, not as proficient in turning or accelerating as the current C/D version of the plane. 
Keep in mind that the C models used in these comparisons were not even the most advanced examples of the current C models. In its new report, the GAO said that the Navy board's program officials came to `the realization that the F/A-18 E/F may not be as capable in a number of operational performance areas as the most recently procured C model aircraft that are equipped with an enhanced performance engine.' 
The Navy's own test team has now stated that the new plane does not perform as well as the reliable version currently used in key performance areas. The Navy now is somehow apparently saying that these performance criteria are suddenly not important. This strikes me as a little shameful. 
In its 1996 report, the GAO reached a number of conclusions. It found that the E/F Super Hornet offers only marginal--marginal--improvements over the C/D and that these are greatly outweighed by the far greater cost of the new plane, the E/F. It found that the current plane, the C/D, can be modified to meet every capacity that this new E/F is intended to fulfill. Let me just say it another way. A modified C/D would meet the performance specifications that the E/F was built to meet. 
The GAO found and put a figure on this that was very troubling to me at the time and still is. They said that the Defense Department could save $17 billion by purchasing more of the current improved C/D planes instead of creating this entirely new plane that isn't clearly better than the C/D, a difference of 17 billion-taxpayer-dollars. The report also addressed other purported improvements of the Super Hornet over the C/D. 
The GAO concluded that the reported operational deficiencies of the C/D that the Navy cited to justify the Super Hornet either have not materialized as projected or that such deficiencies can be corrected with nonstructural changes to the current C/D and additional upgrades to further improve its capability. In effect, the GAO has rebutted all of the Navy's claims about what disadvantages the current C/D plane supposedly has. 
So, we have a plane that doesn't really do the things the Navy said it would do and, in some respects, it does not perform as well as the current older version, but we are supposed to pay double for these new planes anyway. Caveat emptor, indeed. 
Mr. President, I now would like to address an additional newer problem that has come out, and that is the issue known as the wing-drop problem. 
In its new review, the GAO reports a wing-drop problem that threatens this entire E/F program. This issue has garnered the most publicity recently and presents a major problem for the Navy. I want to reiterate, because I devoted most of my talk discussing all the problems that existed with this plane before this wing-drop problem came up, but this is a very serious problem indeed. 
Wing drop causes the aircraft to rock back and forth when it is flying at the altitude and speed at which air-to-air combat maneuvers are expected to occur. Obviously, this is not 
a good situation for a fighter pilot. 
GAO reports that the Navy and Boeing think wing drop is unacceptable and presents the program's most challenging technical problem. 
DOD claims to have a variety of promising solutions that will mitigate the wing-drop problem, but it is very interesting to note what the Defense Department does not say. They are not saying that they will have a complete fix to the wing-drop problem. Additionally, these potential solutions will negatively affect the already very marginal benefits of the Super Hornet over the C/D. 
The Navy's solutions affect the plane's speed, maneuverability and stealthiness, and I think these tradeoffs are clearly unacceptable, given the Navy's position so adamantly adhered to that somehow this E/F is better than the C/D. It will be interesting to observe how DOD handles this situation given its past performance. 
This chart shows the progression of the wing-drop problem from the flight test team to the Secretary of Defense. 
On March 4, 1996, the Navy's test team first discovered the E/F's wing-drop problem. 
In November of that year, the Navy classified the wing drop a priority problem. 
On February 5, 1997, the test team noted wing drop in an official deficiency report. 
On March 12, the Navy reported that wing drop `adversely impacts the minimum acceptable operational performance requirement.' 
Two weeks later, Secretary Cohen approved the recommendation of Paul Kaminski, the Navy's chief procurement officer, to go ahead and purchase the first dozen production versions of the E/F for a figure of $1.9 billion. 
Kaminski's decision followed a meeting with the Navy's test team in which this wing-drop problem apparently wasn't even mentioned. 
On November 20, almost a year and a half after this wing-drop problem was first discovered, John Douglas, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition, then informed Navy Secretary John Dalton of the wing-drop problem. This program-threatening wing-drop problem seems to have been kept, Mr. President, from the top Defense Department staff, including the Secretary, until after the decision was made to initially procure the first 12 aircraft. 
If this sort of manipulation of the process is really taking place, it is obviously totally unacceptable. I have asked a full account of the discovery and progression of the wing-drop problem from the Secretary of Defense. In light of these allegations, I also urge the Department of Defense to fully consider the panel's findings and halt the purchase of any additional Super Hornet aircraft scheduled for this month until this wing-drop problem is fully understood and corrected. To do otherwise would compromise the safety of our Navy's pilots and the integrity of the Department of Defense. 
Having mentioned a number of issues, including this very serious wing-drop problem, I want to briefly conclude my remarks by reemphasizing the exorbitant cost of this new Super Hornet aircraft. 
The Navy initially plans to procure 62 aircraft in three separate procurement lots. Secretary Cohen is delaying procurement of the second round of 20 aircraft pending 
identification of a solution to this wing-drop problem. The final aircraft buy is scheduled for late 1998 or early 1999. 
DOD claims that failure to provide full funding for the second round of planes would result in a production break and then would involve considerable additional costs. The total cost, though, of these planes is already $15 billion more than estimates that were given just 2 years ago--$15 billion more from just 2 years ago. How much worse can this get? 
The original cost estimates were based on unrealistically large projections of the number of aircraft to be purchased, low inflation assumptions for later years, and the Navy's failure to factor in the effect of its decision to buy more of the higher cost F models of the Super Hornets. 
GAO estimates that the Navy could save almost $17 billion if the Navy were to simply procure the F/A-18 C/Ds rather than the E/Fs. This savings alone could have easily paid for the fiscal year 1998 Transportation or Interior appropriations in their entirety. 
I know that some of my colleagues will say that by halting production of the Super Hornet and instead relying on the current C/D, we will somehow be mortgaging the future of our naval aviation fleet, but GAO clearly states that this is not the case. 
Given the program-threatening design problems and its enormous cost and marginal improvement in operational capabilities that the Super Hornet would provide, it seems that this new airplane is just not justified. Operational deficiencies in the current C/D aircraft either have not materialized or they could be corrected with nonstructural changes to the plane. The question is whether the current C/D can serve that function as it has demonstrated or whether we should proceed with an expensive new plane for a very marginal level of improvement. 
The $17 billion difference in projected costs does not seem to provide a significant return on our investment. The Super Hornet is, in effect, a solution in need of a problem. The Super Hornet program should be ended. The Defense Department and the Navy should also remain above board with the taxpayers when problems arise during the development of a new aircraft. 
As a result, proceeding with the Super Hornet program is not the most cost-effective approach to modernizing the Navy's tactical aircraft fleet. In the short term, it has been made very clear the Navy can continue to procure F/A-18 C/D aircraft while upgrading it to further improve its operational capabilities. For the long term, the Navy can look forward to the next generation of strike fighters, the joint strike fighter, which will provide more operational capability at far less cost than this Super Hornet that they want to go through with right now. 
The most efficient and fiscally appropriate bridge is an upgraded C/D. The question is whether we can afford a $17 billion hit that can't be justified. 
We should discontinue the E/F program before the American taxpayers are asked to shell out additional tens of billions of dollars for an unnecessary and flawed program. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the Senate to exercise its role to advise and consent on international treaties and take up consideration of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, which the President submitted to this body in 1996. 
The purpose of the Convention is to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought on arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid land. The Convention addresses the fundamental causes of famine and food insecurity in Africa by encouraging partnerships between governments, local communities, nongovernmental organizations and aid donors. 
As Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I feel it is especially important that the Senate exercise its advice and consent on this Convention. It is a mechanism by which the people of Africa will be assisted in preserving and protecting their land, which is a vital link in Africa's fight to become self-sufficient. As Americans, we understand the importance of land and what land can bring us: food, a place to live, and, perhaps most importantly, a place to call home. Whatever their political differences, the people of Africa can agree that protecting the land from drought and erosion is a priority. 
The consideration of this Convention will also refocus the Senate's attention on the plight of the African people. Unlike the other environmental conventions on which the Senate has focused attention in recent years, the Convention on Climate Change and Biological Diversity, the Convention on Desertification does not establish a new financial `mechanism' to administer funds for convention-related projects and activities. Instead, it emphasizes the need to mobilize substantial funding from existing sources and to rationalize and strengthen their management. 
In light of the President's visit to Africa, which began today, it is especially important that the Senate be actively engaged regarding Africa. This Convention is a perfect opportunity for the Senate to go on record in support of programs that are both vital to the African continent and consistent with United States foreign, economic, and environmental policy. 
I hope that the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and the full Senate, will consider this Convention in the near future.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss my vote against the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, also known as ISTEA. 
As we all know, the ISTEA bill is vital to the transportation needs of each state in the nation. Not only does the bill affect highway construction, but it supports mass transit, highway safety, and many other important programs. 
The original ISTEA bill of 1991 was a landmark in transportation policy. In Wisconsin, it was a blighted landmark. That bill continued Wisconsin's historical standing as a state that contributed more in Federal gas taxes than it received in return. Unfortunately, this bill continues this sorry legacy. 
With this bill, certain states continue and make out like bandits when we allocate transportation money. Other states continue to be denied a fair share. Wisconsin is one of the states getting an unfair shake. 
The senior Senator from Wisconsin and I worked hard to improve this bill and get Wisconsin a fair share of Federal transportation money. We were successful in getting almost $130 million per year more than we received last year. That is certainly a great win for Wisconsin, but we must do more. 
While greatly increasing the total dollars coming to Wisconsin, this bill actually decreases Wisconsin's share of Federal transportation money. We get a smaller piece of a bigger pie. That is unacceptable. As the House works on its bill, and the Senate and House work to reach a compromise, I will continue to work vigorously to get Wisconsin a fair shake. 
Mr. President, there are other objectionable provisions in this bill as well. This bill creates more Federal mandates. I want to speak briefly to the amendment offered, and passed, by Senators Lautenberg and DeWine. 
I commend their desire to reduce the incidence of drunk driving and the tragedies it breeds. I disagree, however, with their methods. Establishing national blood alcohol content standards and blackmailing states into complying is simply not the method by which the Federal government should work. Wisconsin and the other states can make those decisions for themselves. 
I agree that drunk driving must be eliminated and we must do everything in our power to increase highway safety. As a father of four, I shudder at the thought of any of my children being behind the wheel or a passenger in a car sharing the road with a drunk driver. I believe the Wisconsin Department of Transportation and the state and local police should be given full authority to get these thoughtless people off the roads. Let me repeat, the state and local authorities should get these drivers off the road, not the Federal government. 
Mr. President, under the proposed sanctions in this amendment, Wisconsin would have to give up almost $14 million in the year 2001 if it does not pass this Federally mandated law. In later years, Wisconsin would lose $29 million. 
This blood alcohol content issue raises the fundamental question of the Federal government's appropriate role in policy areas traditionally reserved to the states. The relationship between the Federal government and the States has required a delicate balance since the founding of this nation. The practical and legal consequences of the Constitutional division of state and Federal powers continue to fuel debate. Having served in the state legislature for ten years, I know quite well the frustrations of state officials at the sometimes incomprehensible Federal bureaucracy. This much-debated relationship is frequently at issue in the discussion of Federal requirements on seatbelts, helmets, speed limits, and, now drunk driving. 
Mr. President, I have opposed certain legislation mandating Federal transportation standards for the States, such as requiring a uniform national speed limit or drinking age, or the mandatory use of seatbelts and motorcycle helmets. I feel most strongly about that principle when States are, in effect, `blackmailed' with the threat of losing Federal transportation dollars if they don't bow to the Federal will. I believe this sort of decision-making is generally best made at the state and local level and therefore, oppose Federal legislation mandating a national blood alcohol standard. It is unfortunate that this important bill continues to compromise our Federal system with the BAC amendment and the ban on open containers. 
Mr. President, there are numerous positive elements to the bill. The transit program is supported like never before. Safety programs are given the assistance they deserve. We take a small ax to some pork-barrel projects, known as demonstration projects. These projects disadvantage many states, including Wisconsin, because the projects are funded not on merit, but on which state is represented at the bargaining table. As a donor state that has historically done poorly with demonstration projects, this is a much-needed boost. 
It is my hope that the House corrects many of the inequities and problems not addressed in our bill. I will continue to work for a fair national transportation policy that delivers back to Wisconsin taxpayers more than 90 cents on the dollar. I look forward to working with our state's delegation to get that fair shake and I hope to support the conference report that comes back to the Senate.

Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield such time as I require. 
I rise today in strong support of S. Res. 187, a resolution introduced by the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Minnesota. I am grateful for their leadership on this and feel they have done a real service by bringing this issue forward to the floor with regard to human rights in China. 
The resolution states that it is a sense of the Senate that the United States initiate active lobbying at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights for a resolution condemning human rights abuses in China. It calls specifically for the United States to introduce and make all efforts necessary to pass a resolution on China and Tibet at the upcoming 54th session of the Commission, which is due to begin very soon in Geneva. 
It is a nonbinding resolution, but it makes a simple, clear statement of principle: The Senate believes that there should be a China resolution in Geneva, period. 
As we all know, for the past few years, China's leaders have aggressively lobbied against such efforts earlier and more actively than the countries that support a resolution. Last year, they actually threatened the country of Denmark, which had made a difficult decision to sponsor a resolution. This year, Chinese officials have deftly played a diplomatic game with various European governments and basically succeeded in getting the European Union Foreign Ministers to drop, at least temporarily, any European cosponsorship of a resolution. 
In the past, China's vigorous efforts have resulted in a `no action' motion at the Commission. With events proceeding the way they are now, I fear we will have the same result again at the upcoming meeting. 
This would be unfortunate because it is essential to have a resolution on China under the auspices of the Commission on Human Rights. The multilateral nature of the Commission makes it a very appropriate forum to debate and discuss the human rights situation in China. By adopting international human rights treaties, China has made a commitment to international human rights law, and one of the basic purposes of the Commission is to specifically evaluate China's performance with respect to these commitments. The Commission's review has led to proven and concrete progress on human rights in other countries, and the expectation is that such scrutiny would lead to progress in human rights in China. 
Mr. President, here is where I don't understand the argument of the junior Senator from Minnesota. He is suggesting you can only go forward if you list all the countries in the world that have human rights violations. That doesn't make any sense with regard to the way we have to do business in this body. Sometimes we have to identify a particular country--whether it be Russia or Nigeria or Indonesia--and say in this particular instance there is a problem. To be required to make a statement about all countries in the world where there is a problem at one time, reduces what we are doing to a meaningless exercise and a general statement. 
Some observers want to question the viability of the human rights resolution at this time. Despite China's announcement last year that it would sign the U.N. Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, I don't see real evidence of real human rights improvements in China. That human rights conditions in China are growing worse, not better, indicates that human rights continue to demand top priority. 
Nearly 4 years after the President's decision, which I regretted, to delink most-favored-nation status from human rights, we cannot forget that human rights in China and Tibet remain abysmal. Hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals are detained or imprisoned for their political and religious beliefs. Monks in Tibet are harassed for showing reverence to the Dalai Lama. And the press is subject to tight restrictions. The most recent State Department human rights report notes that `the Government of China continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses in violation of internationally accepted norms, including extrajudicial killings, the use of torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, forced abortion and sterilization, the sale of organs from executed prisoners, and tight control over the exercise of the rights of freedom of speech, press, and religion.' 
Mr. President, the situation is just as bad in Tibet. 
I am going to make sure my remarks are brief so the Senator from Minnesota can speak some more. 
Let me just say last month the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, John Shattuck, testified, `We did not see major changes. We have not characterized China as having demonstrated major changes.' 
Mr. President, these reports are indeed troubling. The United States has a moral responsibility to take the lead in sponsoring and pushing for a resolution at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. I was delighted yesterday with such an overwhelming vote under the leadership of Senator Wellstone from Minnesota and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a 16-1 bipartisan vote, that indicated there is a strong bipartisan consensus in the Foreign Relations Committee--and I predict on the floor--that we must send a message to China and 
that this is the appropriate forum in time to do it. 
I strongly commend my friends, the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Florida, for their leadership on this terribly important issue. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, recently the senior Senator from Wisconsin and I introduced a resolution congratulating the State of Wisconsin on the 150th anniversary of its statehood. We will celebrate that great occasion on May 29. The sesquicentennial of Wisconsin's statehood is both a time to reflect on the distinguished history of the State and a time to look ahead to the promise of the next 150 years. 
Mr. President, every year that I have been a Member of this body, I have traveled to each of Wisconsin's 72 counties to hold what I call `listening sessions.' These meetings allow me to learn more about what my constituents think about what is going on in Washington, and they also afford me the opportunity to continue to learn more about the unique character of the people of my home State and its history and traditions. 
In honor of this historic anniversary, Mr. President, I have asked children from each of Wisconsin's 72 counties to construct a cloth panel which features a person, place, or event of historical significance for the county in which they live. These panels will be combined to form a quilt to commemorate this milestone. I have already been presented with some of these panels during my trips through the State this year, and I am pleased by the interest that the children have taken in learning about the history of their counties and of the whole State of Wisconsin. 
Mr. President, as I travel through Wisconsin I am struck by the amount of history that is present in every corner of the State. From the city of Green Bay, the first permanent European settlement in the State of Wisconsin, which was founded by Charles de Langlade in 1764, to Menominee County, the State's newest county, which was established in 1961, there are a myriad of larger cities and small towns, villages and Native American communities which, together, form the foundation of the State of Wisconsin. It is this sense of community that binds Wisconsin's more than 4.8 million people. 
I am also struck by the commitment of the people of Wisconsin to the State's motto, `Forward.' While there is no question that the residents of Wisconsin cherish the State's rich history, they never stop looking forward to find ways to build on that solid foundation to ensure that Wisconsin continues to grow and prosper well into the next century and beyond. 
This forward-looking thinking, rooted in the State's progressive tradition, is evident in many areas, including education. America's first kindergarten was founded in 1856 by Margarethe Meyer Schurz, a German immigrant who settled in Watertown in Jefferson County. More than 140 years later, Wisconsin is still working to ensure that its children get the best possible start in education through the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education program, the SAGE program. One aspect of this program seeks to reduce class size in kindergarten through grade three to 15 students per class. This forward-thinking approach to educating our children I think is a model that I hope will be expanded to the rest of the country. 
Mr. President, Wisconsin has also been a pioneer in the area of higher education. The University of Wisconsin was the first in the United States to offer correspondence courses. This effort opened up the world of higher education to people all over the State--and all over the country. Under the leadership of one of our presidents of our university, President Charles R. Van Hise, the university began its long tradition of working with elected officials at all levels of the State and Federal Government. 
Another area in which the people of Wisconsin continue to look forward is in their commitment to serving their fellow Wisconsinites, and their fellow Americans. Wisconsinites have served the United States in all levels of Government from Congress, to the President's Cabinet, to the Supreme Court; they have explored the unknown as astronauts and have represented their State and their country as ambassadors. I am, of course, very honored to follow in the tradition of such Wisconsinites as Robert M. LaFollette, Sr., William Proxmire and Gaylord Nelson as a Member of this body. While there is no doubt that Wisconsin's representatives to the U.S. Congress have not always agreed on matters of policy, we do all share a very strong commitment to the people of our State. 
The progressive tradition of politicians such as Robert M. LaFollette is embodied in Charles R. McCarthy's work called `The Wisconsin Idea,' which was published in 1912. This book espoused the benefits of returning Government to the people through such reforms as a direct primary system and the popular referendum. `The Wisconsin Idea' also touched on Government regulation and promoted benefits such as workers' compensation for job-related injuries. In that vein, Wisconsin passed the first unemployment compensation law in the country in 1932. 
Wisconsin's progressive tradition was evident when on June 10, 1919, it earned its place in suffrage history by becoming the first to deliver to our Nation's capital its ratification of the 19th amendment to the Constitution which granted women the right to vote in this country. 
The struggle by women in Wisconsin for full participation in Government is only a piece of the history of my State, which is so well renowned for reform. Many know of Wisconsin's reputation for progressivism; but few are aware of the belief of Crystal Eastman, a Wisconsin suffragist who wrote in 1912, `The last thing a man becomes progressive about is the activities of his own wife.' Even fewer are aware of the significant role of Wisconsin women in bringing about this Federal amendment, a quest that took more than 70 years, in light of the public cynicism about the benefits of women's suffrage that actually existed during the early part of this century. 
Mr. President, Carrie Chapman Catt, a native of Ripon, WI, was the last president of the National American Women Suffrage Association, and the founder and first president of the National League of Women Voters. Her influence on the direction and success of the suffrage movement and her legacy in grassroots organizing is undeniable, as is the role of many other Wisconsin women in this area. 
Mr. President, like every State, Wisconsin has been home to many memorable people. It is hard to pick which ones to mention, but among them are the great architect Frank Lloyd Wright, World War II heroes Mitchell Red Cloud and Richard Bong, author Thornton Wilder, escape artist Harry Houdini, and artist Georgia O'Keeffe, just to name a few. 
One person in particular who exemplified the determination and commitment to the greater good shared by the people of Wisconsin was Asaph Whittlesey, one of the founders of the city of Ashland which is in northern Wisconsin. In January 1860, Whittlesey was chosen to represent his region in the Wisconsin legislature, which was located very much to the south of Ashland in Madison. Even though it was the middle of winter, Mr. Whittlesey was determined to get to Madison, so he walked--on snowshoes--to the nearest train station in the town of Sparta, a mere 240 miles from where he was in Ashland. His determination to do the job for which he was selected is indicative of the spirit of the people of Wisconsin. 
Another such person was Bernard Cigrand, a teacher at Stony Hill School in Waubeka, who led the first recognized observance of Flag Day on June 14, 1885. Cigrand worked diligently for 31 years for the establishment of a national Flag Day observance, which was proclaimed by President Woodrow Wilson on June 14, 1916. 
Mr. President, Wisconsin is a patchwork of races and ethnicities and is home to 11 Federally recognized tribal governments. The influence of the immigrants who have come to Wisconsin and the Native Americans who have lived in Wisconsin for many years is evident in the names of our cities and towns, lakes and rivers, and counties and parks. 
Wisconsin has played an integral role in American agriculture. As is proudly proclaimed on our license plates, Wisconsin is `America's Dairyland.' According to the United States Department of Agriculture, in 1996, Wisconsin's 1.45 million milk cows produced 22.4 billion pounds of milk, 2.10 billion pounds of cheese, 295 million pounds of butter, 31.8 million pounds of yogurt, and 21.3 million gallons of ice cream and lowfat ice cream. 
The state's first cheese factory was built in the town of Ladoga, in Fond du Lac County, by Chester Hazen in 1864. Other dairy firsts that took place in Wisconsin include the first ice cream sundae, which was invented by Two Rivers resident Edward Berner in 1881, and the first simple test for determining the butterfat content of milk, which was developed by Stephen Babcock in 1890. The United States' first Secretary of Agriculture was former Wisconsin Congressman and Governor Jeremiah Rusk. 
In addition to its dairy industry, Wisconsin is also a top producer of cranberries. 
The State of Wisconsin is blessed with many unique geographical features and has been home to many noted conservationists, among them John Muir and Aldo Leopold. 
The passenger pigeon, which, in 1871, numbered over 136 million in the central part of the state, became extinct in Wisconsin in 1899 when the last one was shot. Wisconsin resident John Muir, founder of the Sierra Club, wrote of the passenger pigeon, `of all God's feathered people that sailed the Wisconsin sky, no other bird served us so wonderful.' A monument to this bird is located in Wyalusing State Park in Grant County. 
Portage resident Aldo Leopold, author of the seminal environmental work `A Sand County Almanac,' wrote, `the oldest task in human history [is] to live on a piece of land without spoiling it.' 
Some of the `unspoiled' pieces of land in Wisconsin include the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, the Nicolet and Chequamegon National Forests, and the 40,000-acre Necedah National Wildlife Refuge, which is home to almost 200 species of birds, including sandhill cranes, bald and golden eagles, and wild turkeys. 
Roche a Cri State Park, located in Adams and Juneau Counties, includes examples of rocks carved by the erosion of water and wind, including Castle Rock, Mill Bluff, and Friendship Mound. 
Over the past 150 years, Wisconsin has also amassed an impressive list of inventions and industrial and business credits. In my own hometown of Janesville, George Parker was granted a patent for his fountain pen in 1889. The first typewriter was patented by Christopher Latham Sholes in Milwaukee in 1868. The first snowmobile was invented in the town of Sayner and Kleenex was invented in Neenah. The Ringling Brothers Circus began in Baraboo in 1884. 
Many Wisconsin companies are household names: Lands' End, Oshkosh B'Gosh, the Kohler Company, Oscar Meyer, Johnson Controls, Harley Davidson, S.C. Johnson Wax, Miller Brewing Company, Snap-On Tools, and many more. 
In addition to its success in business, the state has enjoyed success in sports. Names like Vince Lombardi and Erik and Beth Heiden evoke memories of championships won and Olympic glory. The Badgers, Packers, Brewers and Bucks, and many other professional and amateur teams throughout the state, are examples of the determination and dedication, teamwork and sacrifice that are representative of the competitive spirit of Wisconsin. 
Mr. President, as is evident in these examples, Wisconsinites have greatly contributed to the history and prosperity of the United States over the last 150 years. I am proud to be a Wisconsinite, and I am honored to represent the people of Wisconsin in the United States Senate. I congratulate the people of Wisconsin on this historic anniversary, invite them to reflect on the state's distinguished past, and encourage them to remain committed to our state motto by looking `Forward' to the next 150 years. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this weekend, on Sunday, March 8, 1998, the world community will celebrate International Women's Day. This day is a time to mark the achievements and progress of women around the world, but also to consider the long road we still have to travel to reach equality and respect for the basic human rights for all women. 
Many women and men will mark this day by reflecting on how far women have come in many societies and by continuing to work toward true equality for women all across the globe. The United States has a lot to be proud of in this regard. Women make significant contributions at every level of our society, including in this distinguished body. 
Unfortunately, a large number of women will not even know of this day, which is meant to be a celebration of their achievements and accomplishments. On International Women's Day, many women will continue to be subjugated by their husbands or their governments, and many will be unaware of the basic human rights to which they are entitled as members of the world community. In cities and towns all over the world--including in the United States--International Women's Day will be just another day in the long struggle for women to achieve equal pay for equal work, full political and religious rights, access to adequate health care and child care, and the right to control their own destinies. It is troubling that, while women make up approximately 51 percent of the world's population, many of them have little or no civil or political rights. 
As Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on African Affairs of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I have had no opportunity to learn much about the status of women on that continent. The conditions into which women are born in Africa vary from country to country and impact greatly on their chances for a successful, happy life. According to the United Nations, baby girls born between 1995 and 2000 in the West African country of Sierra Leone can expect to live approximately 39 years, the lowest for women born on that continent. In this small, war-torn nation, the infant mortality rate is 169 per 1,000 live births, the highest in Africa. 
By contrast, the United Nations says, baby girls born in the United States during the same period, 1995-2000, can expect to live 80 years, more than twice as long as baby girls born in Sierra Leone. The infant mortality rate in this country is seven per 1,000 live births--162 less than that of Sierra Leone. The vast majority of baby girls born in the United States have a bright future ahead of them; their counterparts in Sierra Leone face instability and the constant threat of war. A baby girl born today in Wisconsin will share approximately 39 of her birthdays with a baby girl born today in Sierra Leone--sadly, it is unlikely that the baby girl in Sierra Leone will reach her 40th birthday. 
In another war-torn African nation, Angola, the conditions are not much better. The thousands of unmarked landmines that riddle that country have contributed to the low 48-year life expectancy of Angolan women. According to the United Nations, women make up 46 percent of the nation's workforce, and 73 percent of women 15 and over contribute to the nation's economy. These women are indicative of those all over the African continent--and indeed all over the world. They literally carry the economy on their backs by producing handmade products and carrying them to markets, or single-handedly transporting bundles of wood or vessels of water for their families. 
But, fortunately, not all of the women in Africa or the rest of the world experience such bleak circumstances. For example, women around the world have made great strides in business with the help of microcredit programs. These programs extend loans, often less than $100, to women who need assistance starting or expanding a small business. The benefits of these loans, which are almost always repaid, far exceed their monetary worth. Domestic and international microcredit programs have enabled thousands of women to find the confidence necessary to become self-sufficient and to support their families without government assistance--often for the first time. 
In a 1997 speech commemorating International Women's Day, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said, `Advancing the status of women is not only a moral imperative; it is being actively integrated into the foreign policy of the United States. It is our mission. It is the right thing to do, and, frankly, it is the smart thing to do.' I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. I am pleased that the United States is taking an active role in the worldwide promotion of the rights of women. These efforts include working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to establish guidelines to protect female refugees from sexual and physical assault and exploitation. The United States is also working to ensure that the War Crimes Tribunals for Rwanda and the Former Yugoslavia will vigorously prosecute rape as a war crime. Too often, women have been the forgotten casualties of war. I am pleased that the United States government is working to ensure that female refugees are protected and that those who would use rape as a tactic of war are punished. 
So, Mr. President, as the world prepares to celebrate International Women's Day, we should honor the achievements of women around the world, but we should not forget those who have little to celebrate.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution regarding smaller classes in our public schools. 
This resolution expresses the Senate's strong sense that experiments in reducing class size in the earliest grades demonstrate a proven educational benefit. Accordingly, the Senate should assist States in their efforts to reduce class size and assess the benefits of such reductions. 
Mr. President, yesterday I visited the Parkview Elementary School in Cudahy, a community near Milwaukee, where I had the chance to read Dr. Seuss' classic children's story, `Green Eggs and Ham,' to a group of 15 first-grade students. It was exciting to watch their faces come alive with curiosity as they listened. 
Parkview Elementary is a special school because it is one of 30 Wisconsin schools in 21 school districts that are participating in the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education program, or the SAGE program. It is a very popular pilot program and, according to an independent evaluation being conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's, Center for Urban Initiatives and Research, it's been very effective at reducing the size of elementary school classes. SAGE is a very appropriate acronym, for a sage is a teacher who imparts knowledge and wisdom through direct interaction with his or her students, and the SAGE program in Wisconsin is trying to give students and teachers more opportunities to interact directly, which improves learning. 
SAGE is a pilot program created by the Wisconsin legislature in 1995. The specific objective of the program is to improve student achievement through four reform strategies: (1) reducing student/teacher ratios to a maximum of 15-to-1, which was the size of the first-grade class I visited yesterday; (2) increasing cooperation between schools and their surrounding communities; (3) implementing a rigorous academic curriculum stressing achievement; and, finally, (4) improving staff development and evaluation. A modest amount of state aid is available to schools who adopt the SAGE program, which currently covers kindergarten through the second grade, and which is scheduled to be expanded to cover third grade in the near future. 
SAGE has proven to be very popular with parents, teachers, school administrators and students. Reports from Wisconsin educators indicate improvements in classroom environment and academic performance in schools participating in this program. A December 1997 study found that first-graders participating in SAGE scored higher on standardized tests than other students in comparison schools. The SAGE program has demonstrated again what we know instinctively: students in smaller classes benefit from more attention from teachers, and teachers with fewer pupils will have more time and energy to devote to their jobs. Class size has been proven to be one of the crucial factors in the quality of a child's education, along with teacher quality and parental involvement. 
The SAGE program and this resolution will reinforce what should be good, common sense. If you have smaller classes, children get more attention from teachers, and it stands to reason that more attention will translate into more learning. 
Mr. President, I think the Wisconsin experience with this kind of common-sense educational reform is instructive. 
That is why, last fall, I included an amendment to the Labor and Health and Human Services Departments' 1998 appropriation bill requiring the Department of Education to study the costs and benefits of reducing class size in the earliest grades. My amendment also required the Department to prepare cost estimates of growing enrollments and to follow-up with policy recommendations. In addition, I wrote earlier this year to President Clinton in January requesting that he make reducing class size a priority in his FY 99 education budget. I was pleased that the President's FY 99 budget includes an initiative to help schools provide small classes with qualified teachers in the early grades. Mr. President, in an effort to spread the message of the successful SAGE pilot program, I recently invited Education Secretary Richard Riley to come to Wisconsin for a tour of several SAGE schools. 
And, finally, most recently, I have written to the chairman and ranking member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee requesting that the committee hold a hearing to examine the options available to schools as they plan for smaller class size with higher anticipated student enrollment looming. 
A recent Department of Education report states that this year's elementary and secondary student enrollment will soon be at record levels. School districts are going to need to adapt to these increases while many of them rightly will be investing as much as they can in the creation of smaller classes for early elementary students. 
Addressing the problem of increasing enrollment and the desire to reduce class size presents a great challenge to our communities, our States and our Nation. As I say that, I want to be very clear that I believe that the American public school system is rooted in the vision of Thomas Jefferson. He saw a future where every child in the Nation could look forward to a thorough public education, comparable in quality but under local control. I want it to be clear that when I speak about small class size as a national goal, it is in the context of local control. So I do not support a national mandate for smaller class size. 
I believe that any distribution formula for the funds should give credit to and not penalize those States, such as Wisconsin, which have gotten ahead of this and have invested some resources. 
I also believe very firmly that any national funding in this area has to be paid for. It cannot be done on the basis of deficit spending or, in effect, borrowing from Social Security. 
But with those qualifications, I reiterate that there is a great national purpose in trying to reduce class sizes for children. Therefore, the Federal Government has a limited but important role in ensuring that the Nation makes the proper investments in students today so that it can meet the challenges of the 21st century. 
Mr. President, we should take the necessary steps now to help school districts reduce class size as part of an overall effort to improve education and ensure that our children have the best chance to excel and reach their full potential.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we are reaching another stage in the campaign finance reform debate today. I certainly sympathize with the Senator from Oklahoma when he is concerned about some ways in which his bill has been characterized. I have had the experience here on the floor this week of having the McCain-Feingold bill compared, first, to a human rights violation and, also, as very similar to the Alien and Sedition Acts. 
So, clearly, sometimes the rhetoric gets a little carried away. But what is really going on here today in the U.S. Senate just has to make the American people shake their heads. How can they look at this and not wonder what is going on? They can see a clear bipartisan majority in favor of campaign finance reform; and the bipartisan majority isn't for the majority leader's antilabor bill. 
The majority support that has been demonstrated over and over again this week is for the McCain-Feingold bill. I think people in Wisconsin, in particular, have to be shaking their heads, because the one thing I have learned in 15 years of representing the people of Wisconsin is that they really dislike partisanship. 
They understand the need for a two-party system. They like the two-party system. They understand the fact that you talk as Republicans and Democrats at election time, because you have to have parties and you have to have an election, but they really, really do not like it when you keep talking and acting like the whole issue is Republican versus Democrat after the election. What they want is for us to work together. What they like best is when we can come together as Republicans and Democrats in bipartisan coalitions. 
Mr. President, as I have gone to every county in Wisconsin every year I've been in the Senate and have held town meetings, and when I just mention the fact that I am working with a Republican, the Senator from Arizona, before they even know what the topic is, people applaud, because they crave bipartisan cooperation in this country. 
Mr. President, the American people are shaking their heads because they know this is a very unusual bipartisan coalition. The Senators involved in this issue know the details of the bill in a way that maybe many Americans do not know. So they did not just applaud when they heard the title; they have looked at it very carefully and they have considered it and shown this week that the majority of the U.S. Senate wants this change in our campaign finance laws, and they want it now. 
So, Mr. President, what we have is a bipartisan majority and a partisan minority. We have Republicans and Democrats together, at least 52 of them, in favor of the bill and a smaller group from one party opposing the bill. Mr. President, we have a bipartisan agreement on the merits of the bill, and we have a partisan desire to kill it. 
Mr. President, we have a bipartisan majority of the Senate that understands that this issue obviously isn't just about union dues. This is the most absurd proposition. The entire range of things we have seen about the campaigns--the soft money, the coffees, the foreign contributions, the labor unions, the independent groups, the corporations--the majority of this body knows all of these things are part of the big money problem. The partisan minority says the whole problem is unions, and not even unions, just how they obtain their dues. 
The fact is, the bill that the majority leader brought forth is nothing but a poison pill. Now, maybe that was not his intent. You know, if you give somebody a poison pill by accident, it still kills them. So, I am not suggesting this was the intent. It is the fact. If that provision becomes the heart of this bill, it kills the bill. I am happy to say it is almost irrelevant, because a majority of this body has made it clear this week that it does not support having that be a part of the McCain-Feingold bill. That is one thing we achieved this week. 
So, Mr. President, what we have here today is a bipartisan desire, a passion for reform and for change, and a partisan insistence that we do absolutely nothing, that we do nothing. 
Now, one argument that has been made, Mr. President, is that, even though there are obviously some Republicans in support of the bill, it really isn't a bipartisan bill, that somehow, because of the nature of the Republican cosponsors, it isn't a bipartisan bill. This has been said over and over again. 
It was said when they said we only had two Republicans; then they said it when we only had three Republicans; and then they said it when we only had four Republicans--it is not really a bipartisan bill. Now, with seven Republicans and all the Democrats in unanimity, they still say this is really not a bipartisan bill. 
Well, who are these Republicans? Are they renegades? Are they coconspirators with the Democratic Party? Are they secret allies of organized labor? Who are these seven Republicans? 
Well, one, the lead author, is the chairman of the Commerce Committee, somebody who is often mentioned as a Presidential candidate. Another is the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, who is also mentioned as a Presidential candidate. There is a Senator from Pennsylvania from the majority party who supports this, a distinguished member of the Judiciary Committee and a former chairman of the Intelligence Committee who supports this bill. 
There is the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, one of the most distinguished Members of this body. He has indicated, by his votes this week, that he supports change. The chairman of the Labor Committee supports this bill. And, finally, two individuals who are not yet chairmen but who are the two Senators from the leading reform State in this Nation, the State of Maine, Senator Collins and Senator Snowe, Republicans, but people who care about this country enough to join together with the Democrats to try to pass campaign finance reform. 
So let me just return to the first name--John McCain. John McCain's name on this bill alone obviously makes it a bipartisan bill. But, more importantly, the senior Senator from Arizona knows that, even though this obviously must cause him partisan heartburn, he always does what is best for this country. So, he has taken enormous heat on this issue. 
This is surely a bipartisan effort and a strong one. Mr. President, what we have shown this week is that we have a working majority, not just on paper, but a group that will vote together as a block for reform. We won vote after vote this week. The 
majority leader of the U.S. Senate tried to table our bill once, twice, and three times, and he lost every time. 
How often does the majority leader of the U.S. Senate lose with 55 Members in his caucus? I do not think we have had this few Democrats in decades in this body. How does the majority leader not win on any of those votes unless there is a clear bipartisan majority in favor of change? So my point, Mr. President, is we are winning and the opposition is losing. To be sure, it is a long, hard road. The senior Senator from Arizona has warned me about that time and again. 
But we will look for every opportunity today on these votes, tomorrow, next week, and all the rest of this session, to get the additional support that we need to pass this bill. Because in the end Mr. President, can Members of the Senate go back home and tell the voters, `We had a terrible problem in Washington. There was corruption. There was wrongdoing. There was the terrible abuse of big money. And we decided to do absolutely nothing about it'? That is what the partisan minority has decided is the end of the story. 
Well, when people vote next year, they will not be shaking their heads; they will be casting their ballots. And they will now know who thought it is time to return the power to the people back home and who decided to leave it all here in Washington with the Washington gatekeepers. That is what is at stake today. And that is what is at stake on these cloture votes. 
So, Mr. President, with that, I will yield--could I ask how much time remains for myself?

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Maine. 
Let me first say that it was an interesting comment by the Senator from Kentucky that those of us trying to pass campaign finance reform don't like Buckley v. Valeo. I don't have strong feelings on liking or not liking Supreme Court cases. I just consider them the law of the land. 
In this case, instead of taking the route that some people would like me and others to take of supporting a constitutional amendment to achieve campaign finance reform, something I vigorously opposed, I have instead, working with Senator McCain and others, chosen to find a way to pass a bill that is within the Court's rulings and holdings in Buckley v. Valeo. 
So I happen to think that is the controlling law. And the suggestion that somehow we don't consider that to be a valid case is simply wrong. Our efforts for 3 years have consistently been to craft a bill that the United States Supreme Court would say is constitutional in every respect. In fact, the Senator from Kentucky, after years of trying to suggest that the voluntary spending limits and the soft money ban are unconstitutional, now is only focusing on suggesting that a redefinition of phony issue ads is somehow unconstitutional. I think that is not at all an established proposition. I might add, I think our efforts here on this bill, with the help of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, are getting stronger. Every day we are getting a little stronger on this bill, and it is a good feeling. 
So it is my pleasure to rise today to speak in support of the amendment that the distinguished Senators from Maine and Vermont have offered. It reminds me of the tremendous help that the Presiding Officer, the other Senator from Maine, gave us when she had some ideas about how we could improve our bill. This is how you get a good bill. People with good ideas come together and gradually it gets improved, you gain support, until the point where it becomes obvious not only that a majority of the body supports the bill, which we have already achieved, but obviously it is in the interests of the people of this country that we simply get on with the business of the country and pass it. So I am a cosponsor of that amendment that has been offered, along with Senators Levin and Lieberman on our side of the aisle and Senators McCain, Thompson, Collins and Chafee on the Republican side. 
When the debate on campaign finance reform reached a stalemate last fall, Senators Snowe and Jeffords indicated they did intend to continue through the winter months looking for a solution to the deadlock. Those were not idle words. They were true to their word. 
The Snowe-Jeffords amendment that has taken shape over the past 2 weeks is a sincere effort to address the two primary sticking points that have caused our efforts to be delayed: alleged first amendment concerns with the provisions of our bill dealing with issue advocacy and express advocacy, and the use of corporate and union treasury money for what amount to campaign attack advertisements in the closing days of the campaign. 
Let me talk for a moment how the Snowe-Jeffords amendment navigates the difficult political and constitutional shoals that face us in this debate. 
The first thing the amendment does is more clearly define a category of communications in the law. We call them electioneering communications. These electioneering communications are communications that meet three tests: First, they are made through the broadcast media, radio and television, including satellite and 
cable. Second, they refer to a clearly identified official candidate--in other words, they show the face or speak the name of the candidate. And third, they appear within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary in which that candidate is running. 
The Snowe-Jeffords amendment provides that for-profit corporations and labor unions cannot make electioneering communications using their treasury funds. If they want to run TV ads mentioning candidates close to the election, they must use voluntary contributions to their political action committees. We firmly believe that this approach will withstand constitutional scrutiny because corporations and unions have for a very long time been barred from spending money directly on Federal elections. 
The Senator from Kentucky suggested we lack case law for these propositions, but the Supreme Court upheld the ban on corporate spending in the Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce case. Mr. President, it is noted that a Michigan regulation that prohibited corporations from making independent expenditures from treasury funds prevented `corruption in the public arena: the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public's support for the corporation's political ideas.' According to the Court, the Michigan regulation `ensured that the expenditures reflect actual public support for the political ideas espoused by the corporations.' 
We are merely saying through this amendment that actual public support, shown by voluntary contributions to a PAC, must be present when corporations and unions want to run ads mentioning candidates near in time to an election. 
The Snowe-Jeffords amendment goes on to permit spending on these kinds of ads by nonprofit corporations, if they are registered as 501(c)(4) advocacy groups, and other unincorporated groups and individuals. The rules about corporations and unions do not apply in the same way to these groups, but the amendment, but it makes one requirement. It requires disclosure of the groups' large donors whose funds are used to place the ads once the total spending of the group on the electioneering communications reaches $10,000. It only applies if the total spending over a total amount of $10,000. 
A few things should be noted about the disclosure requirement that entities other than unions and for-profit corporations are subject to if they engage in these kinds of electioneering communications. The disclosure required here is not burdensome; it simply requires a group placing an ad to report the spending to the FEC within 24 hours, and to provide the name of the group, or of any other group that exercises control over its activities, and of the custodian of records of the group, and finally of the amount of each disbursement and the person to whom the money was paid. 
Second, this disclosure requirement is triggered by the spending of $10,000 or more on these kinds of ads. If a small group that spends only a few thousand on radio spots wants to do that, and they stay under $10,000, they will never have to report a thing. There is no new requirement there. 
Third, the disclosure of contributors required is really quite limited. It does not require all contributors of all amounts to be disclosed. Only large donors who contribute more than $500 must be identified, and they have to be identified only by name and address. And a group that received donations from a wide variety of purposes, including some corporate or labor or treasury money, can set up a separate bank account to which only individuals can contribute, pay for the ads out of that account, and then they only have to disclose only the large donors whose money is put in that account. So any individual who doesn't want to be disclosed can easily ask that the group not spend his or her money on that kind of activity. 
The net result will be that the public will learn through this amendment who the people are who are giving large contributions to 
groups to try to influence elections. If a group is merely a shell for a few wealthy donors, as we suspect that many of the groups who ran the nastiest ads in 1996 were, then we will know who these big money supporters are and we will be in a lot better position to assess their real agenda. On the other hand, if an established group with a large membership of small contributors under $500 wishes to engage in this kind of activity, it doesn't have to disclose any of its contributors under this amendment because it can pay for the ads freely from small donor money routed to the special bank account for individual donors. 
Mr. President, I believe these disclosure provisions will pass constitutional muster. But the Senator from Kentucky and also the Senator from Washington earlier in the debate today have argued that even these reasonable disclosure requirements somehow violate the Constitution, and they cite the case of NAACP v. Alabama from 1958. That is a very important case in the history of our country and the history of the first amendment, and one with which I fully agree, but the conclusion that the Senator from Kentucky draws from it with respect to the Snowe-Jeffords amendment is simply wrong. 
At the height of the civil rights struggle, the State of Alabama obtained a judicial order for the NAACP to produce its membership lists, and fined it $100,000 for failing to comply. The NAACP challenged that order and argued that the first amendment rights of its members to freely associate to advance their common beliefs would be violated by the forced disclosure of their membership lists. They pointed out many instances where the revealing of the identities of its members exposed them to economic reprisals, loss of unemployment, and even threats of physical coercion. The Court held that the State had not demonstrated a sufficient interest in obtaining these lists that would justify the deterrent effect on the members of the NAACP exercising their rights of association. 
Now, Mr. President, everyone in this body should know that the Snowe amendment is totally different from what the State of Alabama tried to do in the NAACP case. The Snowe amendment doesn't ask for any membership lists. The Senator from Washington stood up and read quotes about how the NAACP case doesn't allow a requirement that a group disclose its membership list, but the Snowe amendment doesn't do anything of the kind. It is a simple red herring with regard to what we are asking in the Snowe amendment. All the Snowe amendment does is ask for is the very limited disclosure of the names and addresses of large contributors to a specific bank account used for the single purpose of paying for certain kinds of electioneering communications. 
So, Mr. President, contrary to the claim that this is somehow like the NAACP case, most membership groups won't have to disclose anything if they receive sufficient small donations to cover their expenditures on these types of communications. And even if contributors want to give more, they don't have to be identified, as long as their money is not used for the kinds of ads that would be subject to this kind of disclosure. 
Finally, the disclosure requirement can be avoided altogether by crafting an ad that does not specifically refer to a candidate during the short window of time right before an election. This is nothing like asking the NAACP or the NRA or anyone else to divulge their complete membership lists. This is a false analogy. 
Mr. President, the Supreme Court has shown much more willingness to uphold disclosure requirements in connection with election spending than the Senator from Kentucky has been willing to recognize so far in this debate. In Citizens Against Rent Control v. the City of Berkeley, a 1981 case, for example, the Court struck down a limit on contributions to committees formed to support or oppose ballot a measure. But the court, Mr. President, noted specifically:  
The integrity of the political system will be adequately protected if contributors are identified in a public filing revealing the amounts contributed; if it is thought wise, legislation can outlaw anonymous contributions. 
Mr. President, it is worth noting that the opinion in that case was by Chief Justice Warren Burger and the vote was 8-1. The only dissenter, Justice White, thought the limits themselves on contributions should be upheld. So with regard to this issue, it was essentially unanimous. 
In U.S. v. Harriss, the Court upheld disclosure requirements for lobbyists, despite the alleged chilling effect that those requirements might have on the right to petition the Government. Of course, the Buckley Court itself, which the Senator from Kentucky frequently refers to, upheld disclosure requirements for groups who make independent expenditures. 
Now, of course, the Court will have to analyze the Snowe amendment when it gets there and the type of communications that trigger it and determine if they pass constitutional muster. I will not proclaim that there is no argument to be made at all that this provision is unconstitutional. Of course there is, and I am sure groups like the National Right to Life Committee will make it. But to say that there is no chance that this provision will be upheld, as the Senator from Kentucky has said, is just not right. There is ample and substantial constitutional justification and precedent for this provision. 
As the Brennan Center for Justice wrote in its letter analyzing the Snowe-Jeffords amendment:  
Disclosure rules do not restrict speech significantly. Disclosure rules do not limit the information that is conveyed to the electorate. To the contrary, they increase the flow of information. For that reason, the Supreme Court has made clear that rules requiring disclosure are subject to less exacting constitutional strictures than direct prohibitions on spending . . .. There is no constitutional bar to expanding the disclosure rules to provide accurate information to voters about the sponsors of ads indisputably designed to influence their votes. 
Mr. President, it is also important to note that the Snowe-Jeffords amendment contains provisions designed to prevent the laundering of corporate and union money through nonprofits. Groups that wish to engage in this particular kind of advocacy must ensure that only the contributions of individual donors are used for the expenditures. 
Because the prohibition in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment is limited to unions and corporations spending money from their treasuries on these kinds of ads, many of the concerns that opponents of McCain-Feingold voiced about the effect of the bill on speech by citizens groups are eliminated. Keep that in mind. One of the things people claimed was the real problem of McCain-Feingold--there has been sort of a shifting bottom line of what the real problem is--but that portion has been modified in Snowe-Jeffords. 
Senators who oppose this amendment must be willing to stand on two positions now that I think are both unsupportable. First, Mr. President, those who still oppose McCain-Feingold, if it is amended by Snowe-Jeffords, must defend the rights of unions and corporations using treasury money--not citizens groups like the National Right to Life Committee or the Christian Coalition or the Sierra Club--to run essentially campaign advertisements that dodge the Federal election laws by not using the magic words `vote for' or `vote against' or to finance those ads through other groups. So that is the conclusion: Corporations and unions, apparently, should just be allowed to do this freely, despite the almost unanimous complaints by Members of the Senate with regard to this question. 
Secondly, those who are still holding out, even though they represent a minority of the Senate, in terms of supporting McCain-Feingold as it will be amended, argue that the public is not entitled to know, in the case of advocacy groups that run these ads close to an election, what the identities of these people are. They say that they should not be known to those who are about to 
vote. Many opponents of McCain-Feingold have trumpeted the virtues of full disclosure and say that is what we need--disclosure; not McCain-Feingold. I have, at times, doubted how serious they were about disclosure because they would never acknowledge the important advances our bill provides with regard to disclosure. 
Now, when we vote on the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, we will see how sincere the opponents of this bill are about the importance of disclosure, because the Snowe-Jeffords amendment requires nothing more of advocacy groups than full disclosure. In fact, it requires a lot less because the groups only have to make these disclosures if they run these ads close to an election and if they spend more than $10,000 on those electioneering communications. 
Mr. President, our agreement on the Snowe-Jeffords amendment means that a clear majority of this Senate supports bipartisan campaign finance reform. Further, we will vote as a block to defeat any `poison pill' offered by opponents. This agreement puts the onus of killing reform, if that is what happens, back where it belongs--on those who would put a partisan attack on unions over the greater good of abolishing soft money. 
I urge my other colleagues on the Republican side to join this effort and recognize, as Senators Snowe and Jeffords have done, along with Senators Thompson, Collins, Specter, and the original author, Senator McCain, before them, and that a strong majority of the American people understands, that the McCain-Feingold bill is a balanced, reasonable, and fair step toward reform and that we can achieve that reform if we put our heads together and work out our differences. 
Once again, Senator McCain and I are more than willing to talk to anyone who sincerely wants reform or to talk about changes to our bill that will bring us closer to the 60 votes we need to get past the filibuster that opponents have promised. The fruitful negotiations that have produced the Snowe-Jeffords amendment have shown that we are serious about passing McCain-Feingold this year. 
Mr. President, with that renewed invitation, I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend, the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings) in offering the Social Security Trust Fund Protection Act of 1998, legislation extending our current PAYGO budget rules, and clarifying that Congress may not use so-called budget surpluses to pay for tax cuts or new spending when those surpluses are really Social Security Trust Fund balances. 
Mr. President, it gives me particular pleasure to join with Senator Hollings in offering this bill. Both in this body and in the Budget Committee, he has been a consistent voice for fiscal prudence in this body. 
Mr. President, fiscal prudence is popular in theory, but often less attractive in practice. Senator Hollings has taken tough positions, even when those positions may not have been politically attractive. That is the true measure of commitment to honest and prudent budgeting, and I am proud to join him in this effort today. I am also pleased to be introducing a measure which is similar in many respects to a measure introduced in the other body by Congressman Minge, who has an outstanding record of working in a bipartisan manner to bring fiscal discipline to the budget. 
The Minge bill, too, seeks to prevent the irresponsible use of Social Security Trust Fund balances, and I very much look forward to working with the Congressman to advance these proposed budget rules. 
Mr. President, we are entering a budget era of transition. For decades, Congress and the White House ran up huge deficits, producing a mounting national debt. For the past few years, we have worked to bring down those deficits. Those efforts have paid off, in large part, and we are now about to consider something Congress has not seen in 30 years--a unified budget submitted by the President that actually reaches balance. 
Mr. President, if we can work together to pass a balanced unified budget this year that will be a notable accomplishment, and it deserves to be highlighted. But, Mr. President, even if we do pass a balanced unified budget this year, that is not the end of our work. Balancing the unified budget isn't a touchdown. It's more like first and ten at mid-field. It's not a bad place to be, but we still have a way to go. 
But, Mr. President, some act as if the goal posts are really on the 50; that all we have to do is balance the unified budget and we've scored a touchdown. They want to declare victory once the unified budget is in balance, and use any projected unified budget surpluses for increased spending or tax cuts. Just last week, a member of this body was reported to have complained about needing to find offsets for tax cuts. The implied intention of that member was to support a large tax cut without also cutting enough spending to fully pay for the tax cut. Instead, the unspoken intention of this member was to rely on a projected surplus in the unified budget as an offset. 
Mr. President, that would be a grave mistake. As the President cautioned us during his State of the Union address, we should not touch the unified budget surplus. In fact, that admonition may have been just as important as the achievement of proposing the first balanced unified budget in 30 years. 
Mr. President, while I strongly agree with the President's comments, I approach this matter from a different perspective. There are many of us who do not view the unified budget as the appropriate measure of our Nation's budget. 
In particular, I want to acknowledge my fellow Budget Committee colleagues, Senators Hollings and Conrad, for their consistent warnings to the body on this very issue. 
Mr. President, as I have noted before, the unified budget is not the budget which should guide our policy decisions. The projected surpluses in the unified budget are not real. In fact, far from surpluses, what we really have are continuing on-budget deficits, masked by Social Security revenues. The distinction is absolutely fundamental. As I have noted before, the very word `surplus' connotes some extra amount or bonus. One dictionary defines `surplus' as: `something more than or in excess of what is needed or required.' 
Mr. President, the projected unified budget surplus is not `more than or in excess of what is needed or required.' Those funds are needed. They were raised by the Social Security system, specifically in anticipation of commitments to future Social Security beneficiaries. Mr. President, let me just note that the problem of using Social Security trust fund balances to mask the real budget deficit is not a partisan issue. 
Both political parties have used this accounting gimmick--here in Congress and in the White House. But it must stop, and this legislation can help us stop it. 
Mr. President, budget rules cannot by themselves reduce the deficit, but they can protect what has been achieved and guard against abuse. The PAYGO rule governing entitlements and taxes, along with the discretionary spending caps, have kept Congress disciplined and on track. The bill we are introducing today ensures the PAYGO rule continues to require new 
entitlement spending or tax cuts are fully paid for. 
Our bill clarifies current PAYGO procedures to remove any doubt that tax cuts or increased spending must continue to be offset. It extends the PAYGO rule, which currently covers legislation enacted through 2002, until we are no longer using Social Security to mask the deficit. Under our bill, Congress could not use a so-called surplus until it is real, namely when the budget runs a surplus without using Social Security Trust Funds. 
Mr. President, earlier I said we are in a budget era of transition. With some hard work this year, we can leave the years of unified budget deficits behind us. And with some more work, we can move toward real budget balances without using Social Security revenues. Mr. President, that must be our highest priority. 
If Congress does not begin to rid itself of its addiction to Social Security trust fund balances, we will put the benefits of future retirees at serious risk. Fortunately, Mr. President, we are within reach of the goal of balancing the budget without using the Social Security trust funds. If we stay the course, and continue the tough, sometimes unpopular work of reducing the deficit, we can give this Nation an honest budget, one that is truly balanced. And the time to act is now.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I want to offer my heartiest congratulations to the athletes who represented our nation and the State of Wisconsin so admirably at the recently-completed 18th Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan. 
Millions of people throughout the world thrilled to the sights and sounds of athletes, several of whom overcame great personal hardship, pushing themselves to go faster, farther or higher at Nagano. We witnessed the full panoply of the human spirit in the arena of athletic competition; we were reminded of all the hard work and sacrifice demanded of those who would become Olympians; and many of us drew inspiration from what we saw. 
Mr. President, Wisconsin sent 29 men and women to the Games in Nagano. They competed in speedskating, hockey, curling and even snow sculpting. Some brought home medals, and all of them brought back indelible memories of competing on the world stage with the world's best athletes. 
Best known among them is probably Chris Witty, of West Allis, who holds the world's record for the 1,000 meter speedskate and who added to her growing cache of honors with a silver medal in the 1,000 meter speedskating event and a bronze medal in the 1,500 meter event. 
Another Wisconsinite, Karyn Bye, of River Falls, played forward on the historic gold-medal-winning women's hockey team and who, draped in the Stars and Stripes after she and her teammates triumphed, showed us what pure joy looks like. 
Mr. President, athletes and athletics get a lot of attention in our society, sometimes for unpleasant reasons, but I believe there is something inherently good about people testing themselves, pushing themselves, working individually and together to do their best. That is the spirit that motivated these Olympians, and to them we offer our congratulations for their efforts, our thanks for their inspiration, and our best wishes for their future endeavors. No matter where they go from here, I hope they always remember their experiences in Nagano, and I hope they retain their capacity to push themselves as far as they can, and to encourage others to do the same.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, conversations today have been including the notion that the American people don't care about campaign finance reform, and occasionally people do ask why is it important to reform our system of financing campaigns. I think it is pretty clear that people do care about this issue. Just talk to them about it. Trying to get it to show up on a poll is one thing, but if you talk to them, you will find a different story. 
That is particularly true when Americans are told the facts or learn the facts about our current system that it actually affects average Americans who may not even care a great deal about being involved in the political process. 
I heard today on the floor a number of opponents of our bill assert this issue has no impact on the average citizen. Although I recognize many Americans do not think this issue is the No. 1 issue in America, Americans do care about this issue because it does affect their daily lives in real ways. 
Why should Americans care about campaign finance reform? One very good reason to care is that as consumers, they are affected. We all pay for the current system of campaign financing through higher prices, higher prices in the pharmacy, in the supermarket, on our cable bills, when we fill our cars with gas and in many other ways.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Also, Money magazine published an article in December making much the same point, with additional examples of how consumers have been hurt by decisions made by this Congress under the influence of campaign donations from affected industries. 
Our decisions on everything from the airline tax to sugar subsidies to securities laws reform to electricity deregulation are potentially compromised by the money chase. Anyone who cares about public confidence in this institution should be concerned about these examples of industries and individuals with a great economic stake in our deliberations being able to and actually, in fact, making large and strategically focused campaign contributions.

<TEXT>
Mr. FEINGOLD. In a moment, I will yield to the senior Senator from Arizona. But before I do, let me make clear what we are tabling here today if we table the McCain-Feingold amendment. 
The other side would have us believe it is one narrow aspect 
of a bill that has to do with certain aspects of express advocacy and independent advocacy. Surely, that is part of the bill. But what they don't talk about very much is what else would be tabled. It would involve the tabling of a complete ban on soft money. It would be wiping out the opportunity for this Congress to have a ban on soft money. What that means is they are also tabling a concept that has been endorsed by over 100 former Members of Congress who signed a letter to ban soft money. 
It is also a denial and tabling of an effort to ban soft money that has been endorsed by people like former Presidents George Bush and Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. In addition, if this tabling motion prevails, you will be wiping out provisions that actually lower the provisions that require candidates to report contributions of $50 and over, not just the ones of $200 and over. It would be wiping out provisions that double the penalties for the knowing and willful violations of Federal elections law and tabling the provisions that require full electronic disclosure of campaign contributions to the FEC. 
You will be wiping out provisions that require the Federal Elections Commission to make those campaign finance records available on the Internet within 24 hours. You will be wiping out provisions that would stop the practice of Members of Congress using their franking privileges, their mass mailing franking privileges in an election year. Our bill would ban that. 
The tabling motion would wipe out the provisions that require a candidate to clearly identify himself or herself on one of these negative ads. 
So the fact is this bill has many important provisions. A tabling motion denies the chance to do all of these things. What the opposition has chosen to focus on is merely a few aspects, which I think we are right about, but they completely ignore the many important items of enforcement and disclosure and the banning of soft money the McCain-Feingold bill would achieve. 
How much time remains?

Mr. FEINGOLD. In a moment I will yield to the Senator from Minnesota who I very much want to hear from on this issue. 
Just a very brief comment with regard to the comments of the Senator from Kentucky. The language of the McCain-Feingold bill on issue advocacy was not an issue in the Wisconsin case. In fact, in that Wisconsin case the judge specifically suggested our provision on issue advocacy may be a model of what might pass constitutional muster. 
The Senator made a lot of general comments on Buckley v. Valeo, but the one thing he didn't do is relate Buckley v. Valeo to our bill. Our bill was specifically crafted to be constitutional under Buckley v. Valeo. We have a letter from 126 constitutional scholars who say that our bill is in fact constitutional, especially with respect to the ban on soft money. It is 126 constitutional scholars against the mere constant repetition of the claim that our bill is unconstitutional. We have the weight of legal authorities on this issue on our side. Of course, it is our intention and belief that this would pass constitutional muster. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I and the senior Senator from Arizona, the senior Senator from Tennessee, and the Presiding Officer, and many of the rest of us have been looking forward to this moment for a number of months--the return of campaign finance reform to the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
This is an important occasion because, when we left the issue last fall, we clearly were in somewhat of a stalemate. Some people wanted more than anything else to say that is it, the campaign finance reform debate of the 105th Congress is over and done with and we will not see it again. They wanted to call a halt to this debate and let us go to the 1998 elections changing absolutely nothing about the current system. 
But others, including myself, thought that our consideration last fall of this issue had not been sufficient, that the American people deserved more from this Senate than parliamentary tricks and poison pills, that campaign finance reform is essential to the future of our democracy, and that we cannot afford to once again sweep this problem under the rug. 
The sweeping has already begun anew. And it is vigorous sweeping. It is coming in the form, not this time of a poison pill amendment, but a poison pill bill. The underlying bill to which we will have the McCain-Feingold bill attached as an amendment is the same thing as the poison pill amendment. The majority leader made no pretense in this regard. It is simply the antiunion poison pill bill, as if that is the only issue that is involved in the question of campaign finance reform. 
The idea that the entirety of campaign finance reform can be summarized in just the question of what happens to union dues is completely untenable. It is an untenable notion to any American that the whole problem with the campaign finance reform system is related only to labor unions. 
Surely, that is part of the problem. But what about corporations? What about groups spending incredible amounts of money on ads that are not really issue ads at all; they are just phony campaign ads? What about multimillionaires buying Senate seats? What about all of these things? 
I do not think anyone in America really believes that this whole topic is summarized and encapsulated in the mere question of what happens with union dues. It is also incorrect to suggest that the McCain-Feingold bill does not address that issue. It does in fact codify, put into statute, what the U.S. Supreme Court has said ought to be done and what is the law with regard to union dues, and it does so by codifying what is actually said in the so-called Beck decision. 
So, Madam President, for all these months, after all this discussion of this issue for well over a year, all that the majority leader's bill does is say: We have to address this problem of union dues. I do not think anyone in America believes that. 
We just learned a few hours ago, Madam President, that that was going to be the entire contents of the leader's bill. Over 4 months after we agreed that he would lay down the first bill in the debate and after an entire year of scandals and revelations and accusations and investigations, the entire bill that is before us at the moment consists of one narrow provision--one provision--the so-called Paycheck Protection Act. All this time the Republican leadership has not been able to come up with even one thing about this current campaign finance system that it wants to change other than that--not one--as if nothing else has occurred in the country that might trouble Americans a little bit about how much big money is awash in their system in Washington, DC. 
The leader's bill does not even mention disclosure. It says nothing about fundraising on Federal property. It does not say a word about foreign money. It lets the soft money system off the hook entirely. 
I guess, from the point of view of the majority leader, all is well in the campaign finance world except for that one question: What about those union dues? Of course, we in effect knew this was his position anyway. The majority leader calls our current system of unlimited contributions in the political parties by corporations and unions and wealthy individuals `the American way.' 
Frankly, Madam President, although I am not surprised at the proposal, I am disappointed. Although all the pundits have been saying for the past few months that the Republican opponents of McCain-Feingold were just going to try to bring about the same deadlock that we had before, I guess I hoped, without reason, that we might have a real debate here about two different bills, about two different visions, about two different real, comprehensive ideas about how our campaign financing system should work. 
McCain-Feingold has been out there now for over 2 years. It has been analyzed and criticized and, of course, vilified in many ways, but at least it is out there. The so-called Snowe-Jeffords amendment has even been out there for the past week in draft form. Already some groups are attacking it. At least they have something to attack. At least the senior Senator from Arizona and I put our bill out there for people to review and consider. And at least Senators Snowe and Jeffords are trying to reach a compromise and are willing to let people have a look at what they are proposing. 
But, again, the leadership here has given us nothing new to look at all. Instead, all we get is merciless criticism of President Clinton's campaign fundraising for the last year and yet not a hint of a suggestion about how we could have changed that system that both Presidential campaigns abused. In fact, the very things that the leader was just describing as troubling about the President's campaign, in most cases, I think almost everyone would have to concede was legal. The raising of huge amounts of soft money is entirely legal. The leader's bill does not even mention the problem, as if nothing happened in 1996. Apparently the goal is, once again, just to tie this body in knots, not with a poison pill amendment, but now with a poison pill bill, the goal of which is to attack only one player in the system, the labor unions. 
Madam President, I did note that one commentator this morning said that campaign finance reform is going to go down again in a prearranged standoff. I remember being told at the beginning of last year the bill would never come up, it was dead on arrival, it would never see the light of day, and certainly that it would never come back this year. But this notion of a prearranged standoff is something that I cannot accept from our point of view. 
Well, there is no prearrangement on our side. We are ready to fight for reform, because that is what the American people want us to do. I think we have some reason to hope that we will have the votes to defeat the majority leader's attack on unions if he does in fact bring that up again for an up-or-down vote. 
The majority leader is not going to be able to rely on his poison pill bill to defeat campaign finance reform this time. I hope that gives the American people some hope that we can finally achieve meaningful reform this year. 
Madam President, a lot has happened in the world and in the country since we last debated this issue last October. Current events and breaking news are always unpredictable and sometimes distract us from the very important task we have at hand. 
I want to agree with the leader that there are many other issues that require our earnest attention this year. But my first message today with regard to our priorities is that the allegations here in Washington with regard to certain personal issues and issues involving the White House are serious and they have to be taken seriously. But let us not let one potential scandal become an excuse to ignore an obvious and clear scandal. That clear and proven scandal is the record of the 1996 elections and the virtual destruction of the post-Watergate campaign finance reform. 
Today, Madam President, we are in grave danger of letting that happen. 
Campaign finance reform is a difficult enough topic to get people interested in, anyway. It can be very arcane and this other alleged scandal which has piqued the public's interest could distract the public and the Senate and end up becoming one of the biggest gifts to the money-driven status quo that has ever occurred. 
We have to recommit ourselves to the issue of cleaning up the political money system. That is why we are here today. I think there are two questions we have to answer. First, how is the American political system supposed to work? Whom is it supposed to serve? How one answers both of those questions depends on one's vision of American democracy. One vision, the one I share and I bet most of us share, that this is supposed to be a representative democracy. Our Government, our political process, and a good part of our common social and cultural heritage are all based on the premise that we are all to be treated equally under the law. It says so on the facade of the U.S. Supreme Court Building, `Equal Justice Under Law.' It is implied in our Nation's motto, e pluribus unum, `out of many, one.' It is clearly the driving principle behind our Constitution and behind this basic concept which has been summarized in the notion of one person, one vote, and the foundation of our whole electoral system. 
Madam President, that vision of America and our democracy, a representative democracy, assumes that every American by his or her birthright has an equal role to play in this system. But there is another vision and that is a vision that does away with this notion of equality, `one person, one vote,' and replaces it with a system that I have come to see and refer to as `corporate democracy.' 
Now, what do I mean by that? I want to return again to a story from my younger days, as I mentioned before, because I think it illustrates the difference between representative democracy in one person, one vote, and the notion of a corporate democracy, which is what I think we are becoming. When I was 13, a relative of mine gave me one share of stock in our great Janesville, WI, company, the Parker Pen Company. My relative wanted me to learn something about how our economy worked, and more specifically about how the stock market worked. I think that share was worth about $13. My father told me in addition to owning a stock and getting the massive dividends that $13 share of stock would produce, I also owned a small piece of the company, and therefore, I was entitled to a vote at the company's stockholder meeting. 
Now, already at age 13 I was interested in the political process and I sort of equated the idea of a shareholders meeting with voting at an election, so at that age I could hardly wait to get to the shareholders meeting and cast my ballot. I asked my father a follow-up question, `When is the stockholders' meeting? When do I get to cast my vote?' He laughed, and said `I better tell you something, the number of votes you get depends on how many shares you have. It is not one person, one vote. It is how many bucks you have invested in the company.' He said, `You don't have the same vote and the same power as everyone else because it is a corporation. It is properly based--because it is a corporation--on how much money you are able to put into the corporation.' He said, `You can go to the stockholders meeting, Russ, but your vote won't count for very much.' 
Needless to say, that dampened my excitement a little bit, but it helped me understand how a corporation works. The people with the largest stake in the business get the most say in how the business operates. That is how it should be. That is how it should be in a corporation. That is the basis of our system. 
But that is not, Madam President, the way our democracy should work. We are all supposed to have the same opportunity in the democratic process. Now, some of us may have a larger interest in a particular policy or piece of legislation, but we are all supposed to be vested with an equal share of power in the process by which we appoint people to set policy and to vote on legislation. 
Madam President, the current campaign finance system is fueling the transformation of our representative democracy into a corporate democracy, creating a political system that allots power in direct relation to the amount of money an individual or an interest group can contribute. 
Let's not completely ignore those hearings that were held earlier last year by the senior Senator and chairman from Tennessee. Remember the testimony of Roger Tamraz who said not only that he had given $300,000 in soft money legally--remember the words of the majority leader, `the problem is only what is illegal'--$300,000, legally to go to a coffee at the White House, but that next time he would do better. He would get into some serious money and contribute, instead, $600,000. He said he felt after his earlier experience that he needed to pay that kind of money to participate, to get access, and in his own words, `to level the playing field' with his competitors. He felt he needed to pay $600,000 so he could have equal share 
in the political process. 
There is a question here of what that means not only for our political system but what does it mean for our free enterprise system? One of the great ironies for me in serving on both the Judiciary Committee where we work for the most part on domestic laws and then working on the Foreign Relations Committee is that we have an opportunity to look at the issue of international bribery. 
Under American law, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, American business men and women are not allowed, under penalty of law and fines and imprisonment, to give bribes under that law to foreign companies and to foreign countries. But here in America, with a soft money system that is perfectly legal, these same business men and women have become the fall guys of the American political system who are called up and asked to give outrageous sums of soft money so they can enter a particular room to apparently be on a `level playing field' with others who have been pushed to do the same. 
Madam President, there has got to be a different vision, a different vision than paying for nights in the Lincoln Bedroom or to have coffee with the President or going down to Florida to have lunch with a distinguished leader of the majority party for $50,000 and having him stand up and look out at the crowd and say this is the `American way.' 
In case anyone thinks that the motive of the people who give these kinds of soft money contributions is simply public spirited or perhaps that we could regard them as a bunch of people who are trying to buy influence that are constantly being swindled because they are getting nothing for it, you can rest assured that these contributions one way or another do affect public policy. 
There have been a number of embarrassing examples. One is the case of the Federal Express Corporation. Another antiunion express carrier provision was inserted in the aviation bill. That provision, Madam President, had been defeated at every turn, at every opportunity, in every committee, on every floor vote, when it had been attempted, in Congress. This provision was supposed to make it more difficult for the employees of the Federal Express Company to organize their union, and the Federal Express Corporation makes no denial about this. In the waning days of the session, the Federal Express Corporation gave each party $100,000 in soft money, and the provision almost within a few hours found its way magically into a conference committee report. After this was jammed through the Congress, the very impressive CEO of FedEx--who I give credit to for his ingenuity in creating FedEx--came to see me and said, `You people in Washington set this game up this way and I will play it and I will play it hard as long as that is the way it is set up.' I can't fault him for that. That is the way the system is set up. 
Madam President, I think you know, as they say, the rest of the story. We had a UPS strike, and while that strike went on, while the unionized company was in a very difficult position and difficult negotiations, the FedEx Corporation obtained a 10 to 15 percent share of the business that used to go to UPS. That is a very good return for only $200,000 of soft money. 
The 1996 Telecommunications Act covered a huge field from cable to cellular service to long distance. There was massive lobbying involved. It was the biggest overhaul of our communications law since 1934, and a Center for Responsive Politics analysis showed that cable companies, local telephone companies, and long distance companies gave more than $12 million in soft money and PAC contributions just during the 1996 election cycle. 
When the bill finally passed in February 1996, all these corporate concerns supported it while consumer groups opposed it. There was very, very little in the way of consumer protections in that bill. Today, cable rates continue to go up, and merger mania has hit all parts of the telecommunications industry. We have yet to see any of those proconsumer effects of competition that the corporate donors who so strongly supported the bill had promised us at the time. 
One more example, the B-2 bomber. Apparently, the Department of Defense doesn't really want the B-2 bomber anymore. There are questions about its effectiveness, including the possibility that it may not work very well when it gets wet. Yet the Congress added this past year $331 million in this year's bill to keep it going. 
Northrup Grumman made $877,000 in PAC contributions and soft money contributions during that 1996 election. Its PAC gave $84,500 to House Members from January 1 to May 31, 1997. 
There are other examples. There are many examples, but these are examples I have had a chance to witness in the last couple of years and they concern me. Lobbyists and other representatives have gotten the messages that some members expect contributions from lobbyists if they want to be heard. Some rely on the stick, saying `put up or shut up.' Others hold out a carrot, such as those who would write a letter to people inviting them, if they contribute a certain amount of money, to sort of a club atmosphere where they have been promised the 
rewards of `leadership, friendship, effectiveness and exclusivity' in return for a contribution. 
In other words, our democracy has become a huge bazaar for very powerful traders. It is bizarre to watch it played out in the middle of our country's great symbol of democracy. Some of us are willing to fight for reform as long as it takes. Some say this is nothing more than a couple of Senators pretending to be like Sisyphus, pushing a rock up a hill. 
But many issues take time. Tax reform has to be done over and over again to make it work. The post-Watergate reforms were difficult to get through but the fact is they worked pretty well for quite a few years. It has been 24 years since Watergate. Thomas Jefferson said there should be a revolution in America every 20 years. That is not such a terrible statement on our system if we have to fix our campaign finance laws every 20 years or less. 
Madam President, this is the third year in a row we have made this effort and we will keep fighting for this until we give the American people a campaign finance system that does not turn them away from participating, it doesn't turn them off on participating in our great democracy. 
I can't really talk about this issue without paying tribute to my senior partner in this effort, the senior Senator from Arizona, who is really the courageous one here. I am the one who is in the minority. It takes a lot more courage to buck this system for a member of the majority. He initiated our relationship for working together on many reform issues and I am grateful to him for having allowed me the chance to work with him on this issue. 
When we got to the point of campaign finance reform after having successfully passed the gift ban and a number of other efforts, it became pretty clear this would be the hardest of all, changing this addiction to money in this town would be the hardest of all. So our bill has gone through several transformations due to political necessity, but it remains a strong and unique bipartisan compromise. It is not the Feingold bill. I tried the Feingold bill and got no cosponsors. That is a good bill, but it involves public financing, and there isn't majority support for that approach. 
This was an exercise, instead, in seeing if people of different philosophies could come together and put together the first bipartisan effort of its kind in 11 years. McCain-Feingold in the form presented as an amendment at the next procedural point has several key components. It simply bans these unregulated soft money contributions, these huge contributions that are primarily funneled to the political parties. This is the piece President Clinton focused on correctly and rightly in his State of the Union Address. He said if you vote for McCain-Feingold you are voting against soft money; if you don't, you are supporting the current system. 
In our bill, we have the beginning of mechanisms to try to encourage people to voluntarily limit how much they spend, at least of their own personal wealth, in the base bill. We also require much greater and more immediate disclosure of campaign contributions, electronic filing, daily filing of campaign contributions, and a prohibition on accepting contributions from people who have not disclosed their profession. 
We heard a lot of opponents of our bill in the last debate talk about the need for prompt and complete disclosure. Madam President, that is exactly what we have in our bill, the strongest disclosure provisions to date. We also strengthen the FEC's enforcement powers, and we clarify and strengthen the ban on raising money on Federal property and on foreign contributions to elections. Now the current McCain-Feingold bill doesn't do everything that I would like to do on campaign finance reform. 
I don't think it even does everything that the senior Senator from Arizona wants to do. And so if we do have the opportunity as the debate goes on, we will offer the McCain-Feingold challenger amendment. 
Our amendment would ask Senate candidates to voluntarily limit their overall spending by getting most of their campaign contributions from their own home State, limiting their PAC fundraising and restricting their spending from their own personal wealth. In return, they would receive the benefit of reduced-cost television time. So we hope to get to that point, and we are optimistic. 
We expected fierce opposition to our bill in the past, and we got it. We knew from experience that many Members of the Senate are comfortable with the current campaign finance system and they don't want to change it. 
We tried this in 1996 before people really got a good, clean look at this system, and we didn't get terribly far. When we failed to break a filibuster in 1996, the Senator from Arizona turned to me and said, `This thing is going to take a scandal.' I said, `John, you're too pessimistic, we'll get it through.' Well, he was right and I was wrong. 
But we got a scandal. In 1997, we moved this issue much further. After the hearings conducted by the senior Senator from Tennessee and the revelation of many of the things that went on, we got 53 votes on the floor of the Senate; but we still faced a filibuster and a series of arguments that, in my view, can't withstand scrutiny. 
I see that the Senator from Tennessee has entered the Chamber as well, and the Senator from Kentucky has risen to speak. At this point I will yield the floor and I will complete my remarks at another point.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer some initial comments on the President's proposed budget for fiscal year 1999. As with any budget, there will be occasion to discuss and debate the many individual provisions it contains. I have already heard some legitimate concerns voiced about some of the provisions from both sides of the aisle, and I very much look forward to working with my colleagues on the Budget Committee to fashion what I hope will be the second consecutive bipartisan budget agreement. 
Despite the many issues surrounding individual provisions, though, we have to acknowledge what a historic moment this is. The President's budget is historic. For the first time in 30 years, a President has submitted a unified budget that actually balances. That is an achievement worth noting and noting again. While many of us believe we have a way to go before we can talk about having a genuine balance, it is fitting to pause for a moment to acknowledge the tremendous progress that has been made. 
The President's proposal also marks the end of one budget era and, I think, really the beginning of a transition period that may require changing some of our budget rules, and I will have more to say on that subject in the coming weeks. It is also worth remembering how far we have come and how we reached this important benchmark. First and foremost was the 1993 deficit reduction package. That was one of the toughest votes I think many of us have ever taken in this legislative body. It wasn't pleasant and it wasn't supposed to be pleasant. As we have found, there just is no painless solution to the deficit, and we had to take a different kind of step. In fact, Mr. President, it was the very toughness of that 1993 package that told me it was worth supporting. Let me also say that last year's bipartisan budget agreement also contributed to the effort. I repeat my admiration for the work done by the chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and also the ranking member, the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, who worked so hard to make that agreement possible. 
Mr. President, I wish that agreement had gone further. As I have noted on other occasions, I really wish we had refrained from enacting that fiscally irresponsible tax package last year. If we had, the unified budget would have actually reach balance earlier. Nevertheless, both of those efforts helped bring us to where we are today and all concerned deserve praise. 
Mr. President, in addition to the notable accomplishment of submitting a balanced unified budget, the President also cautioned Congress not to spend the unified budget surplus that is projected, but instead to use those funds to protect Social Security. I think this is one of the better statements we have had in a long time with regard to not only fiscal responsibility, but also our responsibility to future generations that hope to obtain the benefits of the Social Security for which they have already been paying. 
The President's admonition in this regard may have been just as important as his achievement in proposing a balanced unified budget. The President is absolutely right in urging that any unified budget surpluses not be spent. But while I strongly agree with his sentiment, I approach this issue from a little different perspective. Again, there are many of us who do not view the unified budget as the appropriate measure of our Nation's budget. In particular, I want to acknowledge two of my colleagues on the Budget Committee, the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings and the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, for their consistent warnings on this issue of how we calculate and determine and speak about what is really a balanced budget. 
Mr. President, the unified budget is not the budget which should guide our policy decisions. The projected surpluses in the unified budget are not real. In fact, far from surpluses, what we really have are continuing on-budget deficits masked, in part, by Social Security revenues. Now, this distinction is absolutely critical. The very word `surplus' connotes that there is some extra amount of money or bonus around. One definition of the word surplus is, `something more than, or in excess of, what is needed or required.' 
Mr. President, the projected unified budget is not more than or in excess of what is needed or required. Those funds are required. Those funds are spoken for. In this regard, I take just slight exception to the President's characterization that we should use the surplus to protect Social Security. Some could infer from his comments that the President has chosen, from various alternatives, the best or most prudent option for using surplus funds. I am afraid people will look at it that way and, certainly, from the perspective of the unified budget, it is arguably the best and most prudent option, if we really had surpluses. But, Mr. President, those of us who see the unified budget as merely an accounting convenience do not believe this is an alternative or an option. To repeat, Mr. President, those revenues are already spoken for. They were raised by Social Security for future use. 
Mr. President, we have various trust funds in our budget, but Social Security is unlike most other trust funds, and it is unlike the others in this respect: It is by law `off budget.' 
It was taken off budget for this very reason; namely, the decision by Congress to forward fund Social Security by raising additional revenues in the near term to ensure the long-term solvency of the program. 
Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to choose their use of the word `surplus' very carefully. The problem with the use of the word, or the overuse of the word, is that it encourages a way of thinking which may jeopardize not only the work that we have accomplished over the past 5 years but also the additional work that must be done to put our Nation on a firm financial footing. 
The use of this term improperly encourages the kind of `business as usual' policies that promise immediate gratification while putting off tough budget-cutting decisions until later. 
Mr. President, it is kind of like buying an expensive Valentine's Day gift for your sweetheart and then charging it to her credit card. 
That is not the way to do business. That is hardly an honest approach to budgeting either. 
Mr. President, the challenge before us now is to move quickly toward eliminating the on-budget deficit, balancing the budget without using Social Security trust funds, and in so doing to begin the very important process of bringing down and paying down our national debt. 
Mr. President, we have to play it straight with the American people. We need to give them an honest balanced budget. 
I very much hope this body will act to put us on that path this year, and I very much look forward to working with other members of the Budget Committee to ensure that we really do reach an honest balanced budget. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator Leahy, the distinguished Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in introducing a bill today that gives American taxpayers greater ability to recover attorneys fees and other costs against the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for unjustified civil actions and administrative proceedings under the Equal Access To Justice Act (EAJA). 
Clearly, there is a need for such legislation in light of recent hearing testimony that average taxpayers have lost thousands of dollars in actual damages defending themselves against unjustified IRS actions. As the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service reported, current Internal Revenue Code provisions do not provide adequate relief for unjust IRS actions, much less enable many taxpayers to obtain review of IRS actions at all. I am pleased to join the Senator from Vermont in this effort to help level the playing field and help the American taxpayer recover when the IRS acts improperly. 
Like other citizens who seek review of, or defend against, unjustified governmental action by federal agencies, taxpayers who successfully defend against the IRS should be able to recover attorneys fees and other costs against when the situation warrants such an award. By providing such relief to taxpayers under the EAJA, not only does this bill help individuals recover the cost of their defense, but also helps deter future abusive actions by the IRS. The Equal Access to Justice Act has helped American citizens and small businesses recover against other federal agencies and this bill makes the IRS accountable under EAJA, just like the rest of the federal government. 
My interest in the Equal Access To Justice Act predates my election to this body, dating back to my tenure as a State Senator where I worked on the Wisconsin version of EAJA. In addition to working on the Wisconsin EAJA, I have introduced in a previous Congress, and will do so again today, separate legislation to update and streamline the existing federal EAJA--to make the process of recovery less cumbersome and to help ensure that people are made whole when the government cannot defend their actions. 
The federal EAJA was originally enacted in 1980 and made permanent in 1985. The Act was intended to make taking on the federal government in court less intimidating and I was specifically aimed at helping average citizens and small businesses that prevail against unjustified governmental actions. In my view, EAJA is an effective and valuable check on the virtually limitless power of the federal government. 
One would assume that the typical American taxpayer is protected by the EAJA. However, this is not the case as the Act exempts all civil actions and administrative proceedings in connection with the IRS from its protections. In addition, court decisions have consistently interpreted the tax code as providing the only relief for taxpayers treated unjustly. The current system is inadequate and this legislation will help to change that untenable situation. 
I want to commend my friend and colleague from Vermont for his leadership on this important issue. The legislation we are introducing today is only one step in reforming the Internal Revenue Service and making that agency more accountable to the American people. However, it is an important and essential step in that process. The American people should not have to squander their hard earned money defending against unjustified actions by federal agencies--including the IRS. I look forward to working with Senator Leahy and the other concerned Members of this body as this legislation moves forward.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Equal Access to Justice Reform Amendments of 1998. This legislation contains necessary improvements to existing law, the Equal Access to Justice Act, which will streamline and improve the current process of awarding attorney's fees to private parties who prevail in litigation against the government of the United States. I am introducing this legislation for the second consecutive Congress because I believe the reforms embodied in this legislation are important steps in reducing the government generated burden under which many individuals and small businesses currently operate. 
Over the past few years, certainly since the elections of 1994, many Members of the Senate have taken to the floor and spoken about the importance of `getting government off the backs of the American people.' We often hear about the need to reform government in very fundamental ways that effect people all across this nation. I agree and the legislation I propose here today deals directly with some aspects of the concerns we have heard in this chamber, by assisting everyday Americans who face legal battles with the federal government and prevail. 
At the outset, it is important to understand what the Equal Access to Justice Act is, and why it exists. The premise is very simple, EAJA places individuals and small businesses who face the United States Government in litigation, on equal footing by establishing guidelines for the award of attorney's fees when the individual or small business prevails. Quite simply, EAJA acknowledges that the resources available to the federal government in a legal dispute far outweigh those available to everyday Americans. This disparity is resolved by requiring the government, in certain instances, to pay the attorney's fees of successful private parties. By giving successful parties the right to seek attorney's fees from the United States, EAJA seeks to prevent small business owners from having to risk their companies in order to seek justice. 
My interest in this issue predates my election to the Senate and arises from my experience both as a private attorney and a Member of the Senate in my home state of Wisconsin. While in private practice, I became aware of how the ability to recoup attorney's fees is often the initial inquiry which must be made when deciding whether or not to seek redress in the courts. The significance of this factor should not be underestimated. Upon entering the State Senate, I authored legislation modeled on the federal law. Today, section 814.246 of the Wisconsin statutes contains provisions similar to the federal EAJA statute. 
It seemed to me then, as it does now, that we should do what we can to help ease the burdens on parties who need to have their claims reviewed and decided by impartial decision makers. To this end, I have reviewed the existing federal statutes with an eye toward improving them and making them work better. I believe that my legislation does just that. The bill I am introducing today, does a number of things to make EAJA more effective for individuals and small business men and women all across this country. 
One provision of my original bill that I introduced previously, raising the hourly attorneys fee cap to $125 from $75, has already been enacted as part of the Small Business Fair Treatment Act signed into law during the 104th Congress. While I am pleased that significant change was adopted, my legislation goes further by eliminating the existing `special factors' language which allowed the fee cap to be increased in certain circumstances. I believe the $125 level is consistent with the going rate and obviates the need for `special factor' language which often serves to slow the recovery process. Further, my legislation explicitly establishes a formula for calculating cost-of-living adjustments for awards and eliminates the often time consuming evaluation that was previously required in the absence of a specific standard. Both of these changes, coupled with the fee increase will work to make EAJA more efficient and effective for Americans. 
Another significant factor of my legislation is the elimination of the language which allows the government to escape paying attorneys' fees even if it loses a suit but can provide a substantial justification for its action. I believe that if an individual or small business battles the federal government in an adversarial proceeding and prevails, the government should pay the fees incurred. Imagine the scenario of a person who spends countless time and money dueling with the government and prevails, only to find out that they must now undergo the additional step of litigating the justification of the underlying governmental action. For the government, with its vast resources, this additional step poses no difficulty, but for the citizen it may simply not be financially feasible. A 1992 study prepared by University of Virginia Professor Harold Krent on behalf of the Administrative Conference of the United States found that only a small percentage of EAJA awards were denied because of the substantial justification defense and that while it is impossible to determine the exact cost of litigating the issue of justification, it is his opinion, based upon review of cases in 1989 and 1990, that while the substantial justification defense may save some money awards, it was not enough to justify the cost of the additional litigation. In short, eliminating this often burdensome second step is a cost effective step which will streamline recovery under EAJA. 
The final point in regard to streamlining and improving EAJA is language designed to encourage settlement and avoid costly and protracted litigation. Under the bill, the government is provided the ability to make an offer of settlement up to 10 days prior to a hearing on a fees claim. If the government's offer is rejected and the prevailing party seeking recovery ultimately wins a smaller award, that party is not entitled to attorneys' fees and costs they incurred after the date of government's offer. Again, this will speed the process and thereby reduce the time and expense of the litigation. 
We all know that the American small business owner has a difficult road to make ends meet and that unnecessary or overly burdensome government regulation can be a formidable obstacle to doing business. It can be the difference between success or failure. The Equal Access to Justice Act was conceived and implemented to help overcome the formidable power of the federal government. In this regard it has helped many Americans do just that. The legislation I am offering today will make EAJA more effective for more Americans while at the same time deterring the government from acting in an indefensible and unwarranted manner.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the U.S. Senate took action today to confirm Lynn Adelman to the Federal District Court. Lynn's entire career, both in the State legislature and his private legal practice, has been marked by his dedication to serving the people of our State and makes him particularly well suited for a position on the federal bench. I have no doubt that he will continue his career of public service in this new capacity and will be an excellent jurist for the people of Wisconsin. 
President Clinton choose Lynn Adelman's name from the three forwarded to him by the nominations committee that Senator Kohl and I established to review potential nominees for Wisconsin's federal bench. I am pleased that the full Senate, having had an opportunity to review Lynn Adelman's record and to hear from him directly when he testified before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, has reached the same conclusion that Senator Kohl, President Clinton, Governor Thompson, people all across Wisconsin and I have reached. That being that Lynn Adelman will be an exemplary federal judge. 
Lynn Adelman was born in Milwaukee and is a graduate of Princeton University and Columbia Law School. He graduated cum laude from both of these excellent institutions. After a brief period working in New York, Lynn returned his native Wisconsin and began what to this day has been a career of dedicated public service to the people of our State. Lynn worked in private practice in Wisconsin beginning in 1972 and continues to do so today. 
In 1977, Lynn was elected to the Wisconsin State Senate for the 28th District. In the twenty years that he has represented the 28th District, he has been a leading voice in the Wisconsin Legislature. I had the distinct honor of serving with Lynn for ten years while I was a Wisconsin State Senator and worked with him on the Judiciary Committee, which he has chaired on two occasions. 
Lynn Adelman's legislative record and commitment to the people of his district and the State of Wisconsin has earned him bi-partisan praise. In fact, Republican Governor Tommy Thompson, writing in support of this nominee, characterized Lynn Adelman as `. . .thoughtful, fair and open-minded. . .' The Governor has also noted how he and Lynn have worked hand in hand to ensure the passage of important legislation ranging from anti-crime and anti-drug legislation to welfare reform. This bi-partisan praise is a significant statement about the character and ability of Lynn Adelman. 
At the same time he has served in the Wisconsin Legislature, Lynn Adelman has continued his practice as a successfully attorney. He has appeared in both criminal and civil cases, before both State and Federal courts. Lynn's considerable legal skills also resulted in him arguing before the United States Supreme Court in 1993. 
There can be little doubt that Lynn Adelman's career makes him well suited to serve on the federal judiciary. His knowledge of the law is undeniable. He has a unique perspective on our legal system, born of his service in the legislature and as a practicing attorney, He understands the fundamental principle of separation of powers and has the temperament necessary to treat everyone who comes before him with the respect and dignity they deserve. In short, he has all the tools necessary to serve the people of Wisconsin with distinction. I am pleased the Senate has chosen to confirm him today.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to express my disappointment that--due to compromises made during negotiations over three separate conference reports, the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill for FY 1998, the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill for FY 1998, and the State Department Authorization Act for FY 1998-99--conferees were forced to trade away authorization and appropriations that would have cleared existing U.S. debt to the United Nations. As the Senate adjourns for the holiday recess, only a fraction of the $900 million in arrears payments that was originally proposed by the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations on which I serve was included in the CJS appropriations bill. 
Mr. President, what this means is that we will still be in substantial debt to the United Nations. 
Mr. President, the United Nations is not a perfect organization. I certainly have some real concerns about the size and extent of the UN bureaucracy, for example. Just as with any organization this big, we must be on guard against possible mismanagement or abuse, and certainly the U.N. system has had its share of both. 
But at the same time, I think that U.S. participation in the United Nations--with all the benefits and costs that membership implies--is an indispensable tool in this country's foreign policy bag. When it operates effectively, the United Nations provides a framework to serve U.S. interests at the same time that it achieves economies of scale. 
Just this week, Mr. President, the United States is working within the U.N. structure to assert a united front against the flagrant abuses of international law exercised by Iraq in recent weeks. Mr. President, if nothing else, the crisis in Iraq aptly demonstrates the value of the United Nations to our country. 
I would make a similar point about the role the United Nations plays in peacekeeping operations. U.N. forces have participated in more than 40 peacekeeping operations around the world since 1948. Members of this body may have disagreements over whether or not each and every one of those was necessary, but when you look at places where the U.N. has been instrumental in maintaining cease-fires or providing humanitarian relief, it is clear that the United States can achieve its national interest goals at a lower cost to U.S. taxpayers than would be possible if the United States tried to do it alone. 
Mr. President, during the listening sessions that I conduct in the 72 counties in the state of Wisconsin, I hear sympathetic words from my constituents about the need for the involvement of the international community in times of crisis. But they also express hesitation about sending their sons and daughters to fight in far-away conflicts. 
The United Nations provides a mechanism through which the United States can contribute to international security without having to send our own troops every time there is a problem.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to offer my congratulations to congregation B'nai Abraham, located in Beloit, WI, as its members mark 90 years of service to the Jewish community in southern Wisconsin. 
Mr. President, B'nai Abraham was founded on November 7, 1907, by a group of people who were collecting funds to help a destitute man. It was a highly appropriate beginning to a congregation dedicated to providing comfort, inspiration, solace, guidance, and support. Since then, the members of congregation B'nai Abraham have nurtured a strong sense of community responsibility, and the congregation has embraced the role of the synagogue, as with any house of religious faith, as a shelter and a center for renewal of the spirit. 
But faith, like the body that carries it, only grows stronger with exercise, and by that I mean its application in our daily lives. The values I learned in my community, including diligence, compassion a sense of justice and feeling of responsibility to my community, have been cornerstones of my career in public service, and I have tried to apply those values in my work, including my efforts on bipartisan congressional reform, my support of Israel and the Middle East peace process, and my commitment to civil rights. 
As with so many other Americans, the people who founded B'nai Abraham came from a culture whose members sought these shores to escape oppression, and they relied on one another for support even as the whole new world of challenge and opportunity spread itself out before them. 
Mr. President, I grew up among the members of that community, and I counted on my congregation to provide the grounding in values and traditions every young person needs as he or she is growing up, as well as a sense of spiritual and cultural refreshment. It is particularly important for people of faith who find themselves in the minority to have a place to worship and to pass along their values and traditions to their children. 
B'nai Abraham places a very strong emphasis on education, and congregations like B'nai Abraham also serve to represent their members to others and promote the awareness of Jewish heritage in our communities. 
In that way, B'nai Abraham's members not only educate their neighbors but also show how people of diverse backgrounds still share experiences, histories and concerns, which can be a powerful encouragement to the continued efforts of so many Americans to promote understanding, tolerance, and cooperation. 
Mr. President, I am a member of many communities America, the State of Wisconsin and the town of Middleton, but without this community of faith that has done so much to guide and support me, I would be a poorer man. 
So, Mr. President, let me offer my warmest congratulations to congregation B'nai Abraham, and may its members enjoy good health and good fortune as they prepare to celebrate 100 years.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to offer some thoughts on the proposed fast-track legislation. 
A number of other Members have made some excellent points on this subject, in large part reflecting my own views. 
This is especially true of the comments made by the senior Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], and I want to commend him for his constancy on this critical issue of preserving the constitutional role of Congress in matters of trade. 
He has rightly framed this issue, not as a question of favoring or opposing free or fair trade, but as a question of what role Congress plays in trade agreements. 
Mr. President, the fast-track proposal we are considering, and its predecessors, are quite recent inventions. 
Prior to the Tokyo round of the GATT, there was no fast-track mechanism. 
In fact, of the hundreds and hundreds of trade agreements our Nation has negotiated and entered into, only five have used the fast-track procedures. 
Mr. President, this should dispose of the argument that fast track is necessary for us to negotiate trade agreements. 
Fast track has been the exception, not the rule, with regard to trade negotiations. 
I understand this Administration has negotiated and implemented over 200 trade agreements without fast track. 
What were some of those agreements? 
Well, Mr. President, they included: the market access agreement with Argentina for textiles and clothing; the market access agreement with Australia for textiles and clothing; the agreement on bilateral trade relations with Belarus; the market access agreement with Brazil for textiles and clothing; an agreement concerning intellectual property rights with Bulgaria; an agreement between the United States of America and the Kingdom of Cambodia on trade relations and intellectual property rights protection; the agreement on salmon and herring with Canada; the agreement on ultra-high temperature milk with Canada; the agreement on trade in softwood lumber with Canada; the agreement on intellectual property rights protection with Ecuador; a memorandum of understanding on trade in bananas with Costa Rica; several agreements with the European Union; an agreement on intellectual property rights protection with India; several dozen agreements with Japan; several dozen agreements with Korea; and many, many more agreements with dozens of other countries. 
And not only bilateral agreements, Mr. President, but also multilateral agreements such as the complex Multilateral Agreement on Investment, the Information Technology Agreement, and the Telecomm Agreement--these last two having been both negotiated and implemented without fast-track procedures. 
Indeed, Mr. President, the phrase `fast-track negotiating authority' is a misnomer. 
The President already has the authority to negotiate and implement trade agreements. 
That broad authority was most recently extended indefinitely to the President as part of the 1994 GATT Uruguay round implementing legislation. 
That authority, called `Proclamation Authority,' has its roots in the Reciprocal Trade Act of 1934, which allowed a President to `enter into foreign trade agreements * * * and to proclaim such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions * * * as are required or appropriate to carry out any foreign trade agreement.' 
Mr. President, while the ability to negotiate and enter into international agreements are inherently part of the President's constitutional powers, the Constitution grants exclusive authority to Congress `to regulate Commerce with foreign nations.' 
Congress has sole constitutional authority over setting tariff levels and making or changing federal law. 
With the 1934 act, though, Congress delegated some of its authority to the President when the number and frequency of trade negotiations began increasing. 
It is under this `Proclamation Authority' that President Clinton has negotiated and entered into over 200 trade agreements. 
And he is free to continue that work. 
He did not need fast track to negotiate those agreements, and he does not need it to negotiate additional agreements. 
At a recent meeting on this very issue, one of the participants suggested that everyone ought to pay a one dollar fine every time they used the phrase `fast-track negotiating authority,' because it was so fundamentally misleading. 
Mr. President, the Senate might consider adopting such a rule, and if we did adopt a $1 fine for using the phrase `fast-track negotiating authority,' we might balance the budget ahead of schedule, maybe even begin to pay down the debt. 
Until we do adopt such a rule, Mr. President, we will just have to be alert to the misuse of that phrase, and correct those who employ it. 
Mr. President, those who support fast track constantly make the argument that if you want free trade, you have to enact fast track. 
They equate fast track with free trade. 
The reason is obvious. 
The arguments for free trade are powerful. 
Indeed, I agree with those arguments. 
We as a nation are better off in a world with freer trade than we are without it. 
But the underlying premise, that we need fast track to achieve free and fair trade, is absolutely false. 
Mr. President, I have referred to the hundreds of trade agreements negotiated by this Administration without fast-track procedures. 
That is evidence enough. 
But let me also argue that not only is fast track not necessary for free trade, it may actually undermine it. 
Mr. President, one of the greatest defects of the recently enacted NAFTA and GATT agreements was the perception that those agreements picked winners and losers. 
I believe strongly that those perceptions are based on reality, that some industries were huge winners in those agreements, while other industries were effectively written off. 
Mr. President, Wisconsin had more than its share of those industries that were written off, and at the top of that list, at the very top was the dairy farmer. 
There is no doubt in my mind that other industries were given a higher priority than our dairy farmers, and the results of those agreements underscore that feeling. 
Under the GATT, the European Union is allowed to export 20 times the amount of dairy products under subsidy that the United States is allowed to export. 
Mr. President, not only did we formally provide the EU this significant advantage in that agreement with respect to dairy, apparently the EU is not even complying with those incredibly generous limitations. 
The lower priority industries do not end with dairy, and while our more populous cities--Milwaukee, Madison, Green Bay--experienced serious job the fallout from the winners and losers approach extended to many smaller communities. 
Even if we only use the extremely conservative statistics collected by the Department of Labor--statistics which many argue grossly understate actual job loss--smaller communities all over Wisconsin have been the victim of this winners and losers approach to trade agreements. 
These include places such as: 
DeForest, with 40 lost jobs; Elkhorn, with 50 lost jobs; Hawkins, with 443 lost jobs; Mauston, with 48 lost jobs; Merrill, with 84 lost jobs; Montello, with 25 lost jobs; Peshtigo, with 69 lost jobs; and Platteville, with 576 lost jobs. 
Mr. President, to trade negotiators whose focus was on advancing the prospects of those industries they predetermined to be winners, the losses experienced elsewhere apparently were unfortunate but acceptable. 
For the communities I mentioned, Mr. President, those losses were real--real workers with real families to support. 
Mr. President, the fast-track procedures under which GATT and NAFTA were negotiated and implemented invites this kind of polarization at the negotiating table. 
And it is this kind of economic disparity produced by these trade agreements--the picking of winners and losers--that undermines broad public support for pursuing free trade agreements. 
Mr. President, free trade ought to benefit all sectors of the economy. 
Without fast-track procedures, our negotiators will know their work product will undergo rigorous congressional scrutiny. 
And they will know that it will be much more difficult to enact a trade agreement that disproportionately benefits some while disadvantaging others. 
Mr. President, it is this kind of trade agreement--one which benefits the entire economy--that will enhance the cause of free trade. 
Mr. President, fast track also encourages another disturbing trend in trade agreements, namely advancing the short-term interests of multinational corporations over those of the average worker and consumer. 
The increasing globalization of the economy confronts us every day. 
Few can doubt the enormous power multinational corporations wield in trade agreements, from the negotiating table itself to the closed-door bargaining that will go on before the implementing legislation is sent to Congress. 
Fast track procedures make it all the easier for those interests to advance an agreement that may include provisions which conflict with the interests of our Nation. 
With opposition to the entire agreement the only alternative left to Congress, and with the considerable weight of the multinational corporate interests behind any proposal, it is likely that Congress will swallow even a deeply flawed agreement. 
Mr. President, what does that do for the public support necessary for free trade? 
It severely undermines it, Mr. President, and puts future trade agreements that can enhance our economy at risk. 
Fast-track also undermines the cause of free trade in another important way, Mr. President. 
The proposal we are considering partitions off a number of issues that are vital to achieving a sustainable trade agreement, including currency stability, human rights, and worker and environmental protections. 
None of these issues is brought under fast-track procedures. 
Mr. President, we have only to look to recent Mexican history, their political turmoil and fiscal roller coaster culminating in the peso crisis, to understand the importance of these other issues to the long-term success of any trade agreement. 
Even NAFTA's most ardent supporters will concede these events severely undermined any benefits to our economy that were hoped for under that agreement. 
Mr. President, one might have thought those events would have been a lesson on which we could draw. 
Instead, the fast-track proposal actually backslides in this area. 
And for what reason, Mr. President? 
What possible reason can there be to specifically exclude these areas from fast-track procedures? 
Some might suggest the reason is that while our national long-term interests could be well served by including these issues in a trade agreement to ensure a rising quality of living with our trading partners, such issues might conflict with the short-term goals of some multinational interests that look only at next year's bottom line. 
Others might argue the reason stems from the desire of some interests to pursue a race to the bottom in worker and environmental protection, and in basic human rights. 
Such interests can use the leverage of international trade to change those fundamental standards they have been unable to change directly. 
Mr. President, there is certainly no argument that specifically excluding these issues from fast-track procedures will enhance our ability to negotiate. 
Human rights, working conditions, environmental protections --these are all great strengths of this Nation. 
Preventing our trade negotiators from drawing on these great national strengths limits our flexibility at the table. 
There is no reason to tie our negotiators hands in these areas. 
In this important regard, the fast-track proposal we are considering is a barrier to a sustainable free trade agreement. 
Mr. President, let me turn to another provision in the current fast-track proposal. 
It may surprise some to know that while specific issues closely related to the long-term success and sustainability of any trade agreement are excluded, the provisions which offset the costs of any trade agreement--provisions which have absolutely no connection to the trade agreement or the willingness of our partners to negotiate with us--those funding provisions are covered by fast-track procedures. 
What does this mean, Mr. President? 
It means that Congress cannot amend, it cannot even strike, provisions which are attached to implementing legislation to offset the costs of the trade agreement. 
It means that the most unjustified funding mechanism attached to trade implementing legislation under fast track will remain unscathed. 
Mr. President, let me stress these funding provisions are not part of the trade agreement itself. 
Our trading partners do not get a say in how we offset the cost of a trade agreement. 
One might ask, if our trading partners have no say in the offset provisions, why are those provisions included under fast-track procedures. 
An excellent question, Mr. President. 
Many of us will recall the GATT implementing measure which included some controversial funding provisions, including a change in the actuarial standards of the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. and what many viewed as a sweetheart deal for certain media giants that gave them preferential treatment with respect to FCC licenses. 
Neither of those offsets had anything to do with the underlying trade agreement. 
Both certainly deserved more scrutiny than they received under the constraints of fast-track procedures. 
Whatever justification there may be for providing special procedures for trade agreements, procedures which supporters argue are necessary to attract our trading partners to the table, there is no such justification for shielding the funding provisions from thorough congressional scrutiny and review. 
Mr. President, we are talking about possible tax increases here. 
Though not required, as I understand it, among the offsets that comply with our budget rules are tax increases. 
To put it gently, it is ironic that many who would amend our Constitution to require a supermajority vote before any taxes could be increased are now prepared to support a fast-track bill that sweeps away even the most modest review of possible tax increases. 
Evidently, as long as it is done in the name of free trade, even the most outrageous inconsistency is permitted. 
Mr. President, let me reiterate that many of us who support free and fair trade find nothing inconsistent with that support and insisting that Congress be a full partner in approving agreements. 
Indeed, as Senator Byrd has noted, support for fast-track procedures reveals a lack of confidence in the ability of our negotiators to craft a sound agreement, or a lack of confidence in the ability of Congress to weigh regional and sectoral interests against the national interest, or may simply be a desire by the administration to avoid the hard work necessary to convince Congress to support the agreements it negotiates. 
Mr. President, I can think of no better insurance policy for a sound trade agreement than the prospect of a thorough Congressional review, complete with the ability to amend that agreement. 
Not only would the threat of possible Congressional modification spur our negotiators to produce the best product possible, that potential for Congressional intervention could serve as an effective club in the hands of our negotiators when bargaining with our trading partners. 
Mr. President, with hundreds of trade agreements negotiated and implemented without fast track, the refrain we hear again and again, that we need to enact fast track in order to negotiate trade agreements, is off key. 
We do not need fast track to negotiate trade agreements. 
As I have argued today, in several important ways, fast-track invites bad trade agreements. 
It produces agreements that pick winners and losers instead of advancing all sectors of the economy together. 
It produces agreements designed to respond to the short-term interests of multinational corporations instead of fostering long-term sustainable economic growth. 
It produces agreements that encourage a race-to-the-bottom in critical areas of human rights, and worker and environmental protection, instead of improving those standards around the World. 
It protects the completely unrelated funding provisions in trade implementing legislation, and as such invites enormous abuse. 
Mr. President, fast track is bad for free trade. 
We don't need it, and we shouldn't enact it. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this legislation, and in doing so, voting for free and fair trade.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I want to commemorate the anniversary of the tragic deaths of nine Nigerian activists. Two years ago this week, Mr. Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni leaders were brutally executed by the regime of Gen. Sani Abacha. 
Ken Saro-Wiwa was a renowned playwright and author, who also happened to be the president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, or MOSOP. He and several other colleagues were arrested shortly after four rival Ogoni leaders were killed by a mob in May 1994. They were detained without charge for a year, until May 19, 1995. Then, after trials that are widely believed to have been unfair and politically motivated, Saro-Wiwa and eight others--Barinem Kiobel, Saturday Doobee, Paul Levura, Nordu Eawo, Felix Nuate, Daniel Gbokoo, John Kpuinen and Baribor Bera--were convicted of complicity in the 1994 murders, and sentenced to death by a civil disturbances special tribunal run by the military. 
Mr. President, when the death sentences of these individuals were first made public, I and many other members of Congress asked General Abacha to have mercy and exercise his prerogative of executive clemency. We wrote to President Clinton and made calls to the Nigerian representatives to the United Nations and Washington. But, alas, our efforts were to no avail. The nine men were hanged on November 10, 1995. 
Now, Mr. President, 19 other Ogoni activists remain in prison in Nigeria on the same trumped up charges and could face a similar fate. According to reports from several human rights organizations, the Ogoni 19 have been severely beaten and tortured, and many are suffering from ill health. They reportedly are kept in insanitary prison conditions, are denied food and medical treatment, and rarely, if at all, are granted access to outside visitors, including their lawyers. This lack of contact has stalled attempts to have the detainees released on bail or brought to trial before ordinary, civilian courts. The situation is so dire that, in August, the detainees went on a hunger strike for 10 days to protest the continuing obstructions to their release or trial. The authorities reportedly have had no response. 
Alas, the deplorable condition of these Ogoni activists is not unique in Nigeria. Hundreds of individuals remain in detention centers or prisons for seemingly political motivations. The flawed judicial process that led to the 1995 death sentences is still in place and threatens the lives of these political prisoners. Numerous Nigerian laws allow for arbitrary detention for reasons ranging from `personal pique by a senior official to `national security,' according to information provided to me by the State Department. 
With a population of more than 100 million people and vast natural resources, Nigeria has the potential to be one of the most important players on the African stage. But the military junta led by General Abacha is squandering the country's future by rampant corruption, severe economic mismanagement, and brutal policies that threaten basic freedoms. Moreover, the so-called transition program bears little hope of ensuring a transition to a fairly elected civilian government. 
As we remember the lives of the Ogoni 9, let us not forget those Nigerians whose struggle for basic freedoms continues even now. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring this solemn occasion.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about the current financial crisis in Indonesia and the decision of the United States and the international financial community to provide bailout assistance. 
As you know, Mr. President, the International Monetary Fund announced on October 31 that it was putting together a $23 billion aid package for Jakarta. This money will allow Indonesia to defend its currency, which has depreciated severely in the last few months. The IMF, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the Indonesian government will together provide this $23 billion in financing. 
In addition to the IMF package, several countries, including the United States, are offering `second-line' loan guarantees that Indonesia can use if needed. The Administration has guaranteed a $3 billion loan to Indonesia as part of the Treasury Department's exchange stabilization fund. This fund is the same one used to loan $20 billion to Mexico during the peso crisis of 1994 and 1995. 
Mr. President, I understand that the Administration hopes the $23 billion IMF financing will be enough for Indonesia to overcome the present crisis and that Jakarta will not need to draw on the $3 billion `second-line' loan from the United States. Nevertheless, American taxpayer money is being put on the line both through the direct loan guarantee and indirectly through the US contributions to the IMF, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. 
While there is clearly a need to help avoid a financial collapse in Indonesia that could spill over into other areas of Asia and even to the United States, the US taxpayer has a right to know what kind of government they are helping to support. 
Mr. President, many of Indonesia's present economic problems are the result of rampant corruption and nepotism in the country. Indonesia is ruled by a single man, President Suharto, and his relatives and friends traditionally enjoy many business perks. Using their connections, this group has engaged in highly risky and speculative business deals that have exacerbated the present financial crisis. The Financial Times reports that of the 16 insolvent banks that Indonesia has been forced to close since last week, three are owned by Suharto's children, relatives, or close business associates. The link between the financial crisis and Indonesia's present political system, where power rests in the hands of Suharto's inner circle, is inescapable. 
The IMF has placed tough economic conditions on the $23 billion. To qualify for this funding, Indonesia must enact serious financial reforms, dismantle monopolies, and liberalize its trading regime. The IMF has also asked for greater transparency in Indonesia's business and financial markets. But I believe that the IMF and the United States should use the opportunity of this bailout to make all assistance conditional on Indonesia undertaking specific and verifiable measures to ensure that a newly structured system in Indonesia will be free from corruption and graft. 
In addition, I strongly feel that Indonesia's need for financial support gives the world community leverage to ask for long-needed political reforms. So long as Indonesia is run by a corrupt elite, its economy will never reach its full potential. The present authoritarian system has bred political instability that will ultimately limit Indonesia's economic potential. I read with alarm about the many riots and hundreds of deaths that occurred in Indonesia during the May elections. This is the result of a system that works largely for the benefit of President Suharto and his family. 
Finally, I am concerned about the role of the military in Indonesia, which has sustained a brutal occupation of East Timor for more than 20 years. Press reports indicate that Indonesia maintains more than 20,000 armed troops in East Timor. Just because President Suharto's government has boosted the economy in recent years does not mean it has the right to murder and torture Indonesians and East Timorese. Economic success does not excuse you from answering to your own citizens. 
Political tension in Indonesia will only subside after President Suharto initiates real democratic change and, for example, allows all parties to compete equally in the political process. Indonesian authorities try to argue that greater democracy will lead to instability which in turn will impede economic development. But, Mr. President, clearly the problem in Indonesia is not too much democracy, but too little. 
Mr. President, I urge the administration to use the influence it has in the IMF and the other international financial institutions to insure that this $23 billion package contains demands for real anti-corruption and political reform measures. At the very least, such conditions must be placed on the $3 billion direct loan the US has offered. 
These issues--of transparency, of human rights, and of good governance--are too important for the United States to ignore as we bail Indonesia out of this mess.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to respond to my friends, the Senators from Vermont, Mr. Leahy and Mr. Jeffords, who just spoke with regard to a recent decision by the Federal District Court of Minnesota. It also gives me an opportunity to not only present a different perspective on that ruling, but to also hail the ruling, which is the first ray of hope that the dairy farmers in the upper Midwest, and in particular the farmers in my home State of Wisconsin, have had for a very, very long time. 
I think the judge in this case ruled correctly. In the Minnesota Milk Producers versus Dan Glickman, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Federal Judge David Doty finally said what Wisconsin dairy farmers have long known is the case, and that is that the current Federal milk marketing order system is outdated and is, in fact, illegal, given the realities of our national dairy market today. This system was set up some 60 years ago, because at that time it was not always possible for consumers in other parts of the country, particularly the South and the Southeast, to get fresh milk because of inadequate refrigeration and transportation technology. So this system was set up on the basis of how far a farmer lived from Eau Claire, WI--the supposed reserve supply of milk in the United States. In other words, the closer a farmer lived to Eau Claire, WI, the less he got as an add-on for his class I fluid milk. The system worked, and it certainly provided the needed fresh milk for virtually every marketing order in the country east of the Rocky Mountains. 
Times have changed. During the past 60 years these areas, such as the Northeastern, Southwestern and Southcentral regions of the United States, are now able to produce enough milk to provide for their fluid milk needs and then some. Yet there is still a gross discrepancy between what a dairy farmer gets, let's say in Texas or Vermont, for his or her class I milk, and what a farmer in Wisconsin gets for the same type of milk. For example, farmers in Wisconsin may receive $1.20 per hundredweight in addition to the base price for milk, but in other regions more distant from Wisconsin, dairy farmers might receive $2 or $3 or even $4 more than Wisconsin farmers. 
These are very serious disparities and these differentials have led to an extremely unfair situation to the dairy farmers in the upper Midwest. The decision by the district court this week finally says, `Enough is enough.' It takes note, in effect, of the fact that in the last 17 years, Wisconsin alone has gone from having 45,000 dairy farms to less than 25,000. We have lost over 1,000 dairy farms per year each year. And when upper Midwest dairy farmers talk about all of the problems facing their industry, the complaint that arises most often is the unfairness of the Federal milk marketing order system. 
In contrast to what the two Senators from Vermont were saying--one of them actually indicated there had to be these disparities in order for milk to be supplied to consumers--the fact is, current market conditions and existing technologies no longer necessitate a system that prices milk based on distance from Eau Claire. In fact, in recent years, when our dairy farmers have tried to sell their milk in Chicago, have been beaten out of that market by milk from southcentral and southwestern producers. How can that be if these regions can't produce enough milk for their own needs in that area? Obviously, they can meet their needs and still afford to export milk to other regions because they are receiving a higher class I milk price. And the result is that this system subsidizes the farmers in the Southeast, Northeastern, and regions of the United States and provides them an unfair advantage and competitive advantage over our farmers in the upper Midwest. It has had a lot to do, in my view and the view of almost every farmer in Wisconsin, with the loss of so many of our dairy farms in our State. 
It is ironic, at a time when the Federal Government, including Congress with the passage of the 1996 farm bill, has made it a policy to reduce Government pricing interference in agricultural 
markets, that it is still interfering in a very serious and detrimental way with a free and open national dairy market. This decision by the judge in the U.S. District Court of Minnesota--a Federal court--is an excellent decision. It is a decision that finally tells it like it is--and that is that there is no legitimate basis for these discriminatory class I price differentials which provide one farmer in the Northeastern part of the United States and another farmer in Texas far more for the same type of milk than the hard-working farmers in Wisconsin or Minnesota. 
Mr. President, we in Wisconsin and the upper Midwest praise this court ruling. We believe it is an important, proper and very overdue decision. It gives us some hope that the remaining farmers in our State, in the upper Midwest, will be allowed to survive without the interference of an outdated and unfair system--in fact, as now indicated by the court, a system that is unlawful, given the changes in the dairy market and given the changes in the times. 
Mr. President, this court decision was, at long last, the right one and I look forward to the positive consequences that can flow from it. 
I yield the floor.  
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I intend to oppose H.R. 1119, the Department of Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998, and would like to take a few moments to explain my disagreement with this authorization bill. 
Mr. President, there are a multitude of reasons for opposing this legislation. First and foremost is the $268.2 billion in overall funding this bill provides for our Armed Forces, an amount that is not only substantially higher than the amount we authorized last year, but $2.6 billion more than the Pentagon itself has requested. 
Additionally, this legislation continues the funding of a host of highly questionable and outright unaffordable programs. For example, the bill includes $331 million--$157 million more than the Pentagon requested--for the B-2 bomber, a program that scores of budgetary and military experts, not to mention numerous Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, have concluded does not serve our national security interests and does not merit any additional funds. 
The legislation includes $2.4 billion for 20 new F/A-18 E/F SuperHornet tactical fighters for the Navy. My colleagues may recall that the General Accounting Office and other experts have made repeated, convincing recommendations that we shelve this program in favor of the more affordable F/A-18 C/D, the Navy's current top-of-the-line tactical fighter capable of providing nearly all of the benefits of the E/F version but at a savings of billions of dollars to the taxpayer. 
These are just two examples, Mr. President, of billions of dollars that are being needlessly spent in this bill for programs that have encountered enormous criticism and steadfast opposition from across the political spectrum. Despite these questions and opposition, the gravy train continues to chug along unabated from the Congress to the Pentagon. 
For many years Congress has failed to sufficiently control the flow of deficit dollars to the Defense Department, clinging to a conviction that having a less expensive military structure will consequently leave us with a less effective military structure. That is an absurd correlation, Mr. President. There is no question that if we invest our defense dollars wisely we can have a leaner military without compromising either efficiency or effectiveness. 
Since I arrived in the U.S. Senate almost five years ago, my driving objective has been to reduce the Federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget. We have had enormous success in that regard, passing hallmark legislation in 1993 that drove down the deficit to a point where we could pass further legislation in 1997 that will finally allow us to reach a balanced Federal budget in a few short years. 
A large part of that success has been due to the willingness of both the Congress and the President to do more with less, to trim excessive spending wherever possible and maintain important services but with fewer resources. We have succeeded almost everywhere in government--education, health care, veterans' care, welfare benefits, environmental programs--everywhere except defense spending where we continue to build destroyers the Navy does not ask for and continue to build bombers the Air Force does not want. 
Balancing the budget is about making difficult choices, Mr. President. Sure the Navy would like to have the F/A-18 E/F fighter, and if we were in a radically different budgetary position I might support giving them 200 of those airplanes instead of the 20 they are receiving in this legislation. But can we afford 20 of these new tactical fighters, when a more affordable and equally effective alternative aircraft is readily available? How that question is answered, Mr. President, is the difference between fiscal excess and fiscal responsibility. 
We have to make smart choices Mr. President. A balanced Federal budget is in sight for the first time in three decades. But we are not going to be able to maintain a balanced budget, let alone start bringing down the Federal debt, so long as we continue to commit to programs and force structures that are so blatantly unaffordable. 
In this context, I would like to discuss the role of the National Guard in our force structure and how the Guard will be affected by this conference report. 
Mr. President, the National Guard is a source of immense pride in my State of Wisconsin. As I travel across the State, I often have the privilege of meeting the men and women who compose the Wisconsin Guard and have been impressed with the tremendous degree of professionalism and proficiency with which they complete a wide range of missions. 
These are well-trained, dedicated, professional soldiers who earn rave reviews from the Governor's office down to the villages and municipalities who are often the principal beneficiaries of the Guard's assistance. 
The mission list of the Wisconsin Guard is impressive: Just last spring, the 115th Fighter Wing based in Madison and comprised of Fighting Falcon F-16's, participated in Operation Northern Watch, enforcing the no-fly zone the United Nations imposed over northern Iraq. In addition, 181 Wisconsinites attached to the 128th Air Refueling Wing stationed at Mitchell Field in Milwaukee recently returned from Turkey where they too participated in Operation Northern Watch, providing air refueling support to the fighters enforcing the no-fly zone. 
As much as some perceive the Guard as mere weekend warriors, we must remember that these individuals are performing missions both domestically and abroad that pose as great a risk to their lives as any active duty personnel. 
But what makes the National Guard so unique is the traditional role they have played in our democratic system dating back to our Nation's infancy. In Wisconsin, we can trace the history of the Guard to 1837, when Governor Henry Dodge appointed a new commander of the Green Bay Rangers Volunteer Company, enlisting the men of that unit to serve the Territory of Wisconsin. 
Today, over 10,000 men and women serve in the Wisconsin Guard, generating more than $125 million in annual Federal income. The Wisconsin Army National Guard has 96 units located in 67 communities throughout the State, while the Air Guard has four units in Madison, Milwaukee, and Volk Field. 
The National Guard has traditionally served both a Federal and a State mission, providing ready, trained units to the active Army and Air Force in time of war or national emergency, and assisting State authorities in protecting life and property and preserving peace, order, and public safety. 
Unfortunately, the legislation before us includes provisions that are troubling to those who support a meaningful role for the National Guard in our Nation's defense. These provisions were recently brought to my attention by Maj. Gen. James G. Blaney, adjutant general of the Wisconsin National Guard, who raised concerns not only about the impact these changes would have on the readiness of the Guard, but also about how such changes undermine the traditional and constitutional roles the Guard has always been intended to fill. 
First, the legislation includes a reduction in the Army National Guard's end strength by 5,000 troop slots. This reduction reflects a compromise agreement that was reached with the active Army, which also agreed to reduce its end strength by 5,000 soldiers in the upcoming fiscal year. However, though this legislation includes the reduction for the National Guard, it does not include the reduction for the active army--a reduction that was also recommended by the Quadrennial Defense Review. 
Second, the legislation before us establishes a new mobilization category that would allow the President, under the Presidential Selective Reserve Call-Up Authority, to mobilize up to 30,000 Individual Ready Reserve [IRR] troops before mobilizing the National Guard for contingency operations. Mr. President, the IRR is composed of inactive military members who are awaiting their final discharge. Although current law permits the President to call on these troops only after he has called on the Guard, the DOD Authorization Conference Report would elevate this new category of IRR forces to a higher position than that of the Guard. 
That is a senseless exercise, Mr. President. The members of the National Guard are continually training for such deployments, and yet this legislation proposes to call up 30,000 inactive, nontraining troops before the Guard is mobilized. 
It is little wonder that the National Guard perceives these changes as a direct assault on the traditional role of the Guard in our Armed Forces. But what is even more troubling is how contrary these proposed changes are to the constitutional role that the Guard and the State militias are designed to fulfill. 
Article I, section 8 of the U.S. Constitution provides Congress with the power to `raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years'. 
I find that extraordinary, Mr. President. Why did the Founding Fathers prohibit Congress from appropriating funds for a standing army beyond 2 years? Not surprisingly, Americans of the late 18th century were highly suspicious of standing armies. They had witnessed firsthand the power and intrusiveness of such an army and how it could be used by a monarch or a central government to suppress the rights and sovereignties of the people. 
The Framers of the Constitution wisely decided that if there was going to be a standing army in a free democracy, it would only be through the ongoing approval and purse strings of the representative branch of government. 
Article I, section 8 continues, granting Congress the power:  
To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions [and] provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. 
In short, Mr. President, the Framers not only held a standing army suspect, they recognized the importance of defining a role for a citizen militia to be maintained, led and trained not by the central government, but by the States. Interestingly, although the Constitution makes no mention of what capacity a standing army is designed to serve, it does specifically hold the militias responsible for executing our laws, suppressing insurrections, and repelling foreign invasions. 
This leaves little doubt that the Founding Fathers were substantially more trusting of the State militias, and were far more willing to assign responsibilities for the defense of the Nation to these militias than they were any standing army. 
Of course, Article I of the Constitution is not the only component of the Constitution that is relevant to today's National Guard. The second amendment to the Constitution provides: 
A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed. 
Whatever advocates and opponents of gun control construe these words to mean in 1997, the aim of the first part of the second amendment is evident: Our Founders were making a penetrating statement that a strong militia was imperative to the security of a free State. 
What the Framers of the Constitution recognized over 200 years ago with respect to the vital importance of the militias remains true today. That is certainly not to suggest that there is no purpose or merit in maintaining a standing army. On the contrary, we have learned in this century that a free and democratic society cannot sustain itself without self-protection, and Republicans and Democrats alike can agree that we should have--and do have--the strongest and best-trained active duty force structure in the world. 
But to simultaneously and needlessly diminish the strength and role of the National Guard is, I believe, to tarnish many of the underpinnings of our great democracy. 
Today's men and women of the National Guard represent what our Founders envisioned in terms of a citizen militia. Members of the Guard are sprinkled throughout our communities. They are teachers, firefighters, doctors, nurses, business owners, police officers, farmers, and yes, even Members of Congress. 
And just like our active duty personnel, the men and women of the National Guard can be called upon on a moment's notice to be placed in harm's way. From the Civil War to the Persian Gulf, the State militias and the National Guard have consistently played a central role in protecting our Nation's security, both at home and abroad. 
But the Guard does much more as well. They participate in youth programs, such as the highly successful, low-cost Badger Challenge program in Wisconsin where the Guard takes at-risk kids and helps them obtain their GED's while teaching them discipline and respect for themselves and others. 
The Guard supports medical outreach programs. They are involved in counterdrug efforts, working with the Department of Justice and local law enforcement agencies through aerial observations, ground surveillance, and cargo inspections. 
All of this is accomplished, Mr. President, in a highly cost-effective manner. A comparison of the costs of active duty personnel and Guard personnel demonstrates the sharp differences in costs. According to one study, on average, it costs $73,000 per year to train and equip an active duty soldier. The cost of training and equipping one National Guard soldier--$17,000, almost one-fifth the cost. 
Projected on a larger scale, an estimate recently prepared for the National Defense Panel found that the Government could save roughly $1 billion per year for every active division whose responsibilities it shifts to the eight divisions of the National Guard. Another analysis finds that a Guard unit can cost anywhere from 25 to 80 percent less to maintain than an active duty unit. 
In other words, Mr. President, with little sizable military threat to the United States today, we can shift many of the warfighting responsibilities--not to mention responsibilities for peacekeeping and humanitarian operations--from the active forces to the National Guard at a substantial savings to the taxpayer while losing little in skills, readiness, and training. 
There are a host of missions today that the National Guard can fulfill and should fulfill, providing a less expensive but highly effective complement to our active forces. 
As we reassess what our strategic blueprint for our future Armed Forces should look like, and as we begin the process of conducting a comprehensive review of our inventories and projected needs, it is my hope that the there will be renewed focus on the advantages of a properly funded, well-maintained National Guard. 
Such a focus presents us an opportunity not only to ensure that we have a highly efficient and cost-effective military, but that we are also adhering to some of the most fundamental constitutional principles established by our Founding Fathers.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my colleague, the senior Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] as an original co-sponsor of the Federal Energy Bank Act. 
The idea of the Federal Government leading by example in the area of energy efficiency has made sense to me for a long time, so much so, in fact, that in campaigning for the Senate in 1992, I included energy efficiency in my campaign platform. I proposed an 82-point plan to reduce the deficit, a series of specific spending reductions and revenue changes which, if enacted in sum total, would have eliminated the deficit. 
Among those items, as I was a candidate for office after the passage of the 1992 Energy Policy Act and after the United States' signing of the Framework Convention on Climate Change in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was one to encourage the Federal Government to implement a comprehensive energy savings program for the Federal Government through energy efficiency investments. 
After all, I believe that if Wisconsin consumers and business have been converted to the wisdom of compact fluorescent light bulbs, efficient heating and cooling systems, weatherization, and energy saving computers, among the wide range of potential efficiency improvements, that the Federal Government promoting those actions should also make the same investments to the taxpayers' benefit. 
Section 152 of the Energy Policy Act mandated that Federal agencies use all cost-effective measures that could be implemented with less than a 10-year payback to reduce energy consumption in their facilities by 20 percent by the year 2000 compared to 1985 consumption levels. 
On March 8, 1994, President Clinton signed Executive Order 12902. This order was an even more aggressive mandate to improve energy efficiency in Federal buildings nationwide by requiring agencies to use cost-effective measures to reduce energy use by fiscal year 2005 by 30 percent compared with the agency's 1985 energy use. 
After taking office, I have learned that among the most significant constraints to implementing more energy efficient practices in the Federal Government is the lack of sufficient funds to invest in energy efficient equipment. 
Section 162 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 directed the Secretary of Energy to conduct a detailed study of options for financing energy and water conservation measures in Federal facilities as required under the act and by subsequent Executive orders. On June 3, 1997, the Secretary of Energy, Mr. PenaAE6 released that study. It documents a need for a $5.7 billion financial investment between 1996 and 2005 to meet the Energy Policy Act and Executive order goals, a value which could vary from a low of $4.4 billion to a high of $7.1 billion given variability in both energy and water investment requirements. 
The best estimate, according to the same study of the total Federal funding available to spend on energy and water efficiency improvements from various sources, including direct agency appropriations, energy savings performance contracts, and utility demand-side management programs, and appropriations to the Federal energy efficiency fund, to the Federal Government to meet those needs over the same time period is $3.7 billion. Thus, under DOE's best estimate, at the Federal level we face a potential shortfall of funds necessary to achieve our Federal energy and water conservation objectives of $2 billion. 
In order to address this shortfall, I am pleased joining as a cosponsor of this legislation to create a Federal energy revolving fund or `energy bank.' 
Some in this body may be concerned that the existence of the current Federal energy efficiency fund alleviates the need for additional Federal conservation investment. The problem with the current fund, which operates as a grant program for agencies to make efficiency improvements, is that it does not contribute to the replenishment of capital resources because it does not have to be paid back and is therefore dependent upon appropriations. 
Under the legislation, I join in co-sponsoring with my colleague from Wisconsin today, Federal agencies will be required, in fiscal years 1998-2000, to deposit an amount equal to 5 percent of their total utility payments in the proceeding fiscal year to capitalize the fund. After 2000, the Secretary of Energy will determine an amount necessary to ensure that the fund meets its obligations. 
Agencies will then be able to get a loan from the fund to finance efficiency projects, which they will be responsible for repaying with interest. The projects must use off-the-shelf technologies and must be cost effective. 
The best part of this approach is that the technologies are required to have a 3-year pay back period, and, therefore, this legislation achieves some modest savings for the taxpayer. CBO scores this measure as saving $3 million over 5 years. 
In addition to savings for the taxpayer, I am also pleased to assist the Federal Government in advancing what I believe to be an important part of our overall strategy to combat greenhouse gas emissions. As many in the body are aware, President Clinton announced his plan for meeting the challenge of global climate change on October 22, 1997, in preparation for negotiating meetings in Bonn, Germany on a new protocol to the Climate Convention. Among the items the President cited was the need to do more in the area of federal energy management. Aggressive energy management can reduce carbon emissions from the activities of the Federal Government, which, the President indicated, has the Nation's largest energy bill at almost $8 billion per year. The President specifically stated that there is a need to improve federal procurement of energy efficient technologies, and this measure is a positive, proactive measure to ensure that federal agencies specifically set aside funds to achieve this goal. The senior Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] and I look forward to working with the administration to advance this legislation as a piece of the country's overall greenhouse gas reductions strategy. 
In conclusion, I look forward to working with my senior Senator on this issue. I believe that this is a unique opportunity for Senate colleagues to support legislation that is both fiscally responsible and environmentally sound.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my friend and colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, in introducing the Wisconsin Federal Judgeship Act of 1997. I want to commend my colleague for his leadership and dedication on this very important matter. 
Mr. President, the legislation being introduced will address a serious problem currently confronting the citizens of the eastern district of Wisconsin. At present, the eastern district of Wisconsin consists of four district court judges and two appellate judges, all of which sit in Milwaukee. However, the eastern district of Wisconsin is an expansive area which extends from Wisconsin's southern border with Illinois all the way to the north and the Great Lakes. Approximately one-third of the population of the eastern district of Wisconsin lives and works in the northern part of the district. While Milwaukee is centrally located for the majority of residents who reside in south-eastern Wisconsin, the same cannot be said for the residents of my State which live in the northern portion of the district. 
The Wisconsin Judgeship Act addresses this problem by placing a fifth district court judgeship in Green Bay which is centrally located in the northern portion of Wisconsin's eastern district. The simple fact of the matter is that at present access to the justice system is burdensome and expensive for the residents and for law enforcement of northeastern Wisconsin. In some instances, the travel time incurred by victims, witnesses, and law enforcement is as much as 3 or 4 hours each way, often longer depending upon the weather. In some cases, the cost, both in time and in scarce resources, may simply mean that legitimate cases are not being heard. Another troubling facet of this situation is that northeastern Wisconsin is home to the Menominee Indian Reservation. Because the Federal Government retains significant jurisdictional responsibility for cases arising on the reservation, the requirement that the cases be adjudicated in Milwaukee is particularly problematic in these cases. Based on these facts Mr. President, it is little wonder that this legislation has the strong support of law enforcement, both from police and prosecutors, from all across the eastern district of Wisconsin. 
By placing a Federal judge in Green Bay, not only will the residents of the growing Fox River Valley have easier access to the court, but so too will those residents of my State which live in the north. Mr. President, I have long believed that access to the administration of justice is among the most important and fundamental rights that we as Americans retain. Ensuring access to the courthouse is one of the primary responsibilities that the Federal Government has to its citizens. As members of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Senator Kohl and I see firsthand how important the timely administration of justice is to our Democratic Government. The inability to receive one's day in court because of geographic distance, as appears to be happening to some in my State, is unacceptable. This legislation will address that inequity and I look forward to working with Senator Kohl and other members of the Judiciary Committee and the Senate as this legislation moves forward.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Administration on a policy change announced today. 
Last night President Clinton signed an executive order imposing comprehensive sanctions on the Government of the Sudan. Specifically, the United States has put into place new, unilateral sanctions that will prevent the Government of the Sudan from reaping financial and material gain from trade and investment initiatives by the United States. 
As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said earlier today, this policy change is designed to send a strong signal to the Sudanese Government that it has failed to address the concerns expressed in no uncertain terms and on several occasions by the Clinton Administration. In particular, the Sudan continues to engage in practices that we Americans find unconscionable, including: providing sanctuary for individuals and groups known to have engaged in terrorist activity; encouraging and supporting regional insur-gencies; continuing a violent civil war that has cost the lives of thousands of civilians; and engaging in abominable human rights abuses. 
Mr. President, these are the four main issues that continue to plague U.S.-Sudan relations. Let me take each of them in turn. 
First, terrorism. Terrorism is clearly one of the most vexing threats to our national security today. Terrorist groups, by seeking to destabilize or overthrow governments, serve to erode international stability. By its very nature, terrorism goes against everything we understand to be part of the `international system,' challenging us with methods we do not necessarily comprehend. People--often, innocent bystanders--die as a result of such terrorism. Buildings are destroyed. And everyone's sense of personal safety is shattered. 
According to the State Department's most recent Patterns of Global Terrorism report, Sudan `continued to serve as a refuge, nexus, and training hub in 1995 for a number of international terrorist organizations,' which likely include some of the most notorious groups in the world such as Hamas, Abu Nidal and Hezbollah, among others. In addition, the government continues to harbor individuals known to have committed terrorist acts. For example, it is widely believed that Osama Bin Laden, who was once described by the State Department as `one of the most significant financial sponsors of Islamic extremist activities in the world,' enjoyed refuge in the Sudan in the early 1990's. 
Second, Sudan's support of insurgency movements in many of its neighboring countries poses a significant threat to regional stability. In Eritrea, it supports the Eritrean Islamic Jihad, and in Uganda, it supports both the Lord's Resistance Army and the West Bank Nile Front. Sudanese government officals have been known to smuggle weapons into Tunisia. 
Third, Sudan continues to promote a brutal civil war against the largely Christian and animist people of Southern Sudan. Sadly, during its 41 years of independence, Sudan has only seen about 11 years of peace. This seemingly endless conflict has taken the lives of more than 1.5 million people and resulted in well over 2 million displaced persons or refugees. Perhaps the saddest consequence of the war is that there are thousands of teenagers who do not remember a peaceful period, and who know better the barrel of a gun than the inside of a classroom. 
The international community has done the best that it can with this situation; there are approximately 40 national and international humanitarian organizations providing millions of dollars annually in food aid and development assistance. For its part, the United States government has provided more than $600 million in food assistance and non-food disaster assistance since the mid-1980's. 
The United Nations' Operation Lifeline Sudan [OLS], which maintains a unique agreement with parties to the conflict, has been instrumental in allowing humanitarian access to displaced persons in the southern Sudan. I commend the humanitarian organizations operating in the region who daily face not only enormous technical and logistical challenges in serving the Sudanese population, but also the all-too-frequent threat of another offensive nearby. 
Fourth, the Sudanese government has a deplorable record in the area of human rights. According to the most recent State Department human rights report, the Khartoum government maintains not only regular police and army units, but also internal and external security organs, a militia unit, and a parallel police called the Popular Police, whose mission includes enforcing proper social behavior. In 1996, according to the report, government forces were responsible for extrajudicial killings, disappearance, forced labor, slavery, and forced conscription of children. Basic freedoms--of assembly, of association, of privacy--are routinely restricted by the government. Worse, imposition of Islamic law on non-Muslims is far too common. An April 1997 U.N. Human Rights Commission resolution identified pages of similar abuses. 
Mr. President, this is not a regime that should be included in the community of nations. 
In response to Sudan's actions in these areas, particularly with respect to terrorism, the U.S. government has imposed a series of sanctions on the current Sudanese regime over the past several years, including suspending its assistance program and denying senior Sudanese government officials entry into the United States. 
In part at my urging, the Administration officially designated Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism by placing it on the so-called `terrorism list' in 1993. Inclusion on the terrorism list, according to Section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act (P.L.96-72), automatically puts statutory restrictions on the bilateral relationship including prohibitions on foreign, agricultural, military and export-import assistance, as well as licensing restrictions for dual use items and mandated U.S. opposition to loans from international financial institutions. 
In addition, the United States has supported several resolutions by the United Nations Security Council, including three demands that Sudan extradite three suspects wanted in connection with the failed 1995 assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. After Sudan failed to comply with these resolutions, the Council later adopted measures calling on member states to adopt travel restrictions and to ban flights by Sudanese-government controlled aircraft. 
But, as important as these measures have been, Sudan has apparently refused to get the message that its actions are simply unacceptable. 
Sudan has the potential to be one of the most important countries in Africa. It is the largest country on the continent and has a population of 29 million people. With cultural and geographic ties to both Arab North Africa and black sub-Saharan Africa, the Sudan has the potential to play a significant role in East Africa and the Gulf region. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, Sudan continues to squander that potential by engaging in or supporting outrageous acts of violence and terrorism. 
So, Mr. President, I welcome the President's decision to take a tougher line with respect to Sudan.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I am, of course, very pleased that this agreement has been reached. 
I want to join in the gratitude toward the majority leader. Any majority leader has a hard job on almost any issue. But this is about as tough as it gets. And I know this has been a very, very difficult period of negotiation. 
I thank my leader, Senator Daschle. Without his persistence and willingness to take on a tough job in our conference I don't think this would have been possible either. 
I want to join with Senator McCain in expressing my admiration for the Senator from Kentucky as well, an extremely worthy adversary. I can honestly say it is enjoyable to debate this issue with him. It will be especially enjoyable to be debating specific amendments as we get into this next year. 
But overall, what this represents is what Senator McCain of Arizona and I have said from the beginning--that this can't possibly be done in the end on a partisan basis. The answers have to be bipartisan. This agreement reflects that realization. 
I want to join with Senator McCain in his statement about the desire to negotiate, the desire to put together something that the American people feel would make a real difference in this area. 
My last comment, Mr. President, it certainly would have been my preference to have a bill pass this year. I said, many times it is very difficult to get this done in an election year, and that would be the conventional wisdom if we are in the middle of campaigns to try to legislate on that. But I think maybe this next 
year might be an exception. With this system continuing to display itself, perhaps next March will be the ideal time to take a look at this system as it is unfolding in another election and ask ourselves if this is really the best we could do in this country in terms of electing our officials. 
So, again I thank all of the Senators involved in these difficult negotiations. This appears to be a fair outcome, and we will have a continuation of this important debate next year. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Agriculture appropriations bill, H.R. 2160, which the Senate has approved today contains a provision, section 732, requiring the director of the Office of Management and Budget to conduct a comprehensive economic evaluation of the direct and indirect economic impacts of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact on consumers within the six-state compact region and on producers outside of the region. The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] and I offered this amendment with Senators Kohl, Levin, Abraham, and Wellstone during Senate consideration of the bill, because, to date, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the short and long-term impacts of the Compact from this perspective. 
Wisconsin farmers, and many farmers throughout the nation, are extremely concerned that the artificially high milk prices under the Northeast Dairy Compact will place nonCompact farmers at an unfair competitive disadvantage. Compact producers, who on July 1 of this year began receiving a Class I price of $16.94, have been insulated from the market prices which farmers throughout the country have faced in 1997. 
Wisconsin farmers are concerned about surplus production the inflated Compact price is likely to generate about the impact of potential milk surpluses on national milk prices. Furthermore, there is concern that this Compact, while ostensibly affecting only Class I milk, will result in surplus Class I milk being processed into cheese, butter and other products which are sold nationally. If the supply of manufactured dairy products rises due to increased manufacturing in the Northeast, national markets for manufactured products will be negatively affected and milk prices to producers may fall nationally. In addition, if milk production rises in the Compact region due to artificial production incentives, excess milk may be shipped out of the Compact region to fill cheese vats elsewhere, further depressing cheese and milk prices. So these secondary effects of the Compact must be examined. 
Section 732 of this bill is very specific. It directs OMB to carefully examine changes and projected changes in levels of milk production, the number of cows, the number of dairy farms and milk utilization in the Compact region due to the Compact. OMB must compare changes in those factors resulting from the Compact to levels of production, cow numbers, dairy farms, milk utilization and disposition of milk that would have occurred in the absence of the Compact. It is extremely important that OMB compare Compact effects not with national averages, but rather with production, cow numbers, and other effects that would have occurred had Compact producers been subject to the market conditions facing dairy farmers nationally. 
Section 732 also directs OMB to look at a number of economic indicators, such as changes in disposition of milk produced in the Compact region and changes in utilization of Compact milk, that will aid them in determining the impacts of the Compact on farmers outside of the Northeast. 
There is also substantial concern about the consumer impacts of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact which taxes 14 million Northeast consumers to benefit just over 4000 dairy farmers in the six states. It is not surprising that consumer prices for fluid milk have risen since the Compact price has been in effect. The Compact raises Class I prices specifically because demand for Class I milk is less responsive to price than other dairy products and more revenue can be extracted from the consumer's pocket. OMB must examine the effects of milk price increases on consumers and, in particular, on low-income 
consumers. 
The study must also examine the impacts of the Compact on USDA's vital nutrition programs that provide milk and dairy products to low-income women, children, infants and the elderly. OMB is directed by section 732 to study the impact of the Compact on both actual and projected changes in program participation, on the value of benefits offered under these programs and on the financial status of the institutions offering the programs. Will the purchasing power of food stamps fall because of the higher milk prices? Will schools offering school lunch and breakfast suffer from an effective lower per meal reimbursement rate? Will participation in the WIC program offered by the six northeastern states fall due to increased milk prices? Is the reimbursement scheme established by the Compact Commission adequate to compensate WIC for increased milk costs? These questions should be answered by OMB's analysis. 
Finally, OMB must evaluate the impact of adding additional states to the Northeast Dairy Compact on all of the factors mentioned above. The Northeast Dairy Compact allows Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and any additional states contiguous to participating states, to join the Compact and benefit from inflated Class I milk prices. If that happens, a much larger volume of milk, perhaps over 20 percent of national production, will be priced under the Compact and a much larger number of farmers will have artificial incentives to increase milk production. Congress must have information about the potential economic impact of adding more states to the Compact on farmers in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Idaho, California, New Mexico and other major milk producing states. Furthermore, consumer impacts will be magnified if additional states are added and we need to be able to quantify that impact. 
Mr. President, the amendment which Senator Grams and I offered, which was adopted by the Senate and included in the final bill by the Conference Committee, lays out very clear direction for OMB on the issues they should evaluate regarding the Northeast Interstate Diary Compact. 
However, the Senator from Vermont [Senator Leahy] made a statement shortly after this provision was adopted as part of the Senate FY 1998 Agricultural Appropriations Bill that implied that OMB should study issues much broader than stipulated by section 732. The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] was not a cosponsor of the amendment adopted in the Senate and he is incorrect with respect to the issues the bill directs OMB to evaluate. There was no agreement between the authors of section 732 of this bill and the Senator from Vermont, or any other Senators, that any of the items he mentioned in floor statements subsequent to the passage of the amendment were to be included in the study. OMB should look at the requirements of section 732 and at the statements made by the amendment authors in setting the parameters of this study and the intent of Congress. 
As a principal coauthor of the provision requiring OMB to study the impact of the Northeast Dairy Compact, I want to make clear what the Agriculture Appropriations Bill requires and what it does not require of OMB's evaluation. 
The study does not require that OMB conduct a comprehensive evaluation of retail, wholesale, and processor milk pricing in New England and OMB should not include such a broad analysis in their study. The authors of the study provision did not intend for OMB to examine farm-retail asymmetry issues. OMB's study should not address whether those in the marketing chain should be passing on all or a portion of the increase in farm level milk costs to consumers. This study should provide an objective analysis of the direct 
impacts of the Northeast Compact on the wholesale and retail cost of fluid milk not a subjective review of how Compact associated price increases compare to price increases or decreases resulting from market conditions in the past. 
OMB should not evaluate broader issues of what the appropriate profit margin for those in the marketing chain could or should be or what level of price increase is justifiable or appropriate. That is a question far exceeding the scope of this study. OMB should not look at regional variations in pricing as they have little relevance to the impact of price increases in New England. OMB should not examine all the factors that affect the price of milk. The amendment offered by Senator Grams, myself and others directs OMB to examine only the impact of the Compact on consumer prices, not the price of feeds, transportation costs or other factors. In the absence of the Compact, those factors would not have changed, and have no bearing on this study. The only change in the status quo is the Compact milk price increase and that is what the study directs OMB to evaluate. The study requirement in this bill merely requires the OMB to report on what impact the inflated Compact Class I price has had on wholesale and retail prices and on consumers generally. 
OMB cannot and should not, based on the directive of the study provision in this bill, compare increases in retail milk prices to consumers resulting from the Compact to benefits they might receive by using coupons, shopping at discount stores, or other methods consumers use to reduce overall food bills. Consumers should not have to utilize coupons or other methods to reduce food costs in order to offset milk price increases caused by the Compact as the Senator from Vermont has suggested. 
OMB should not compare the impact of the Compact on USDA nutrition programs to the impact of the recently passed welfare reform bill on these same programs. Welfare reform is being implemented differently by each state. It would divert OMB resources to undertake a comprehensive review of the impact of welfare reform on each of these programs in each of the Compact states relative to the overall impact of the Compact on consumers. That issue is well beyond the scope of this study. 
OMB should focus their evaluation on the impact of increased Compact milk prices on the purchasing power of USDA's nutrition programs, the number of recipients served, and the institutions offering the programs in terms of increased costs or financial burdens. 
Lastly, OMB should not evaluate the supposed direct and indirect `positive benefits' the Compact may bring to farmers, land use patterns and tourism in participating Northeastern states. There is no mention of this in the study provision in this bill and OMB should not evaluate these issues. Presumably, the Secretary of Agriculture and policy makers in the Northeast have already examined these factors and duplicating such efforts will be a waste of taxpayer dollars. 
Section 732 of FY 1998 Agriculture appropriations bill requiring OMB to study the impact of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact on Compact-consumers and on non-Compact dairy farmers and manufacturers is very specific. OMB should stick to the directives of this Section and provide Congress with an objective and unbiased analysis of the Northeast Dairy Compact's impact on these stakeholders. 
Mr. President, there will likely be efforts to politicize this study and I will work with OMB and the analysts conducting this analysis to be sure that doesn't happen. I plan to meet with OMB Director Franklin Raines on this subject. Consumers and non-Compact farmers and manufacturers have a right to know how the Compact will impact them without interference by Compact proponents who wish to downplay the negative impacts of this price fixing scheme. This is especially critical given that farmers outside of the Compact region have suffered from extremely low milk prices throughout this year. If the Compact will further drive down milk prices nationally and increase milk supplies, farmers, consumers and taxpayers have a right to know. I, and the other cosponsors of section 732, will hold OMB accountable for the accuracy and objectivity of this study.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, the Senate will pass S. 1150, the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act. I am pleased, Mr. President, that several amendments I had planned to offer on the floor when the Senate took up this bill have been accepted by the chairman, Mr. Lugar, and the ranking member, Mr. Harkin, of the Agriculture Committee and have been included in the managers' amendment to the bill. 
Two of my amendments included in the bill address a new research program regarding precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is a system of farming that uses very site-specific information on soil nutrient needs and presence of plant pests, often gathered using advanced technologies such as global positioning systems, high performance image processing, and software systems to determine the specific fertilizer, pesticide and other input needs of a farmer's cropland. This technology may have the benefit of lowering farm production costs and increase profitability by helping the producer reduce agricultural inputs by applying them only where needed. In addition, reducing agricultural inputs may minimize the impact of crop production on wildlife and the environment. While precision agriculture, generally defined, encompasses a broad range of techniques from high-technology satellite imaging systems to manual soil sampling, it is most frequently discussed in terms of the use of capital intensive advanced technologies. 
Section 232 of the S. 1150 creates a new research program authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to make grants for the development and promotion of precision agriculture, including projects to educate producers on the benefits of this new technology. One of my amendments, which has been included in the managers amendment, ensures that educational efforts provide farmers with information about the costs of this technology as well. Any responsible federally funded farmer education efforts on precision agriculture must inform farmers of costs of this new technology. 
Cost considerations are particularly important given that precision agriculture technologies tend to be technologically sophisticated and capital intensive, requiring investments in computer systems, new software, and potentially new mechanical input applicators. Farmers who wish to avoid acquiring the equipment needed for precision agriculture may have to contract for these services with input suppliers. In either case, substantial financial investments may be required of farmers adopting precision agriculture technologies. Farmers need information that will allow them to balance the potential long-term benefits of precision agriculture technologies with the short-term and long-term financial costs. My amendment clarifies that any USDA funding provided for producer education efforts must provide information on both costs and benefits of precision agriculture. 
While precision agriculture may result in production efficiencies and improved profitability for some farms, many in agriculture are concerned that, because of the capital intensive nature of this precision agriculture systems, this new technology will not be applicable or accessible to small or highly diversified farms. It is unclear whether precision agriculture services, even if provided by input suppliers, will be available at affordable rates to small farms. Furthermore, some observers are concerned that private firms may find that marketing efforts directed at small farms are not lucrative enough and thus may avoid efforts to apply the technology to small operations. 
In addition to concerns about the applicability and accessibility of precision agriculture to small farms, many are concerned that precision agriculture may not be the most appropriate production system for small farms given the costs of acquiring new technology or contracting for additional services. There may be other production systems, such as integrated whole farm crop, livestock, and resource management systems, that allow small farmers to reduce input costs, improve profitability, and minimize environmental impacts of agricultural production that are more appropriate for smaller operations. 
To address this concern, I have proposed an amendment which adds new language to section 232 allowing USDA to fund studies evaluating whether precision agriculture technologies are applicable or accessible to small- and medium-sized farms. The amendment also allows USDA to conduct research on methods to improve the applicability of precision agriculture to these operations. It is critical that USDA's research investment in this new technology not exclude the needs of small farmers. If it does, this new research program could ultimately affect the structure of agriculture, potentially providing disproportionate advantages to large scale farming operations, furthering the trend to fewer and larger farms. My amendment will allow USDA to conduct research on low cost precision agriculture systems that do not require significant financial investments by farmers and that may be more appropriate to small or highly diversified farming operations. 
The final two amendments I have offered and which have been included in the managers' amendment authorize and provide funding for research, education and extension projects to improve the competitiveness, viability and sustainability of small- and medium-size dairy and livestock operations. 
Many Senators have expressed concern about the trend toward increased concentration in the dairy and livestock sectors. According to a 1996 report by the USDA Advisory Committee on Agricultural Concentration, concentration in cattle feeding has grown dramatically, with 152 feeders accounting for more than 40 percent of all head sold. Meatpacker concentration has also grown, with four packing firms accounting for 80 percent of fed cattle in the U.S. Extensive vertical integration in the cattle industry has also reduced price discovery and market information available to small producers. The combination of reduced price information and increased concentration in the feeding and packing industry has put small cattle producers under extreme financial pressure, necessitating more research, education and extension efforts to ensure the viability of small- and medium-sized cattle operations. 
Of greatest concern to producers in my home State of Wisconsin is the trend toward fewer and larger dairy farms in the United States. In 1980, there were 45,000 dairy farms in Wisconsin. In 1997, there are only 24,000 dairy farms. Of those 24,000 dairy farms, 90 percent are operations with fewer than 100 cows. The trend toward fewer but larger dairy operations is mirrored in most States throughout the Nation. The economic losses associated with the reduction in small farm numbers go well beyond the impact on the individual farm families exiting the industry. Rather, the reduction in farm numbers has affected the rural communities in my home State that have been built around a large number of small family-owned dairy farms. The grocery storeowners, input suppliers, schoolteachers, truckers, cheese manufacturers, and many other small rural businesses have been hurt as Wisconsin has seen its dairy farm numbers decline. 
There is substantial concern that past and present Federal investments in agricultural research have focused almost solely on the needs of larger scale agricultural producers, neglecting the specific research needs of small producers. Some have suggested that this 
research bias has exacerbated the trend toward increased concentration and vertical integration, particularly in the livestock sector. 
To address this concern, I have proposed an amendment to S. 1150, included in the managers' amendment, which authorizes a coordinated program of research, extension, and education to improve the viability of small- and medium-size dairy and livestock operations. 
Among the research projects the Secretary is authorized to conduct are: Research, development, and on-farm education low-cost production facilities, management systems and genetics appropriate for these small and medium operations, research and extension on management intensive grazing systems which reduce feed costs and improve farm profitability, research and extension on integrated crop and livestock systems that strengthen the competitive position of small- and medium-size operations, economic analyses and feasibility studies to identify new marketing opportunities for small- and medium-size producers, technology assessment that compares the technological resources of large specialized producers with the technological needs of small- and medium-size dairy and livestock operations, and research to identify the specific research and education needs of these small operations. 
The amendment allows the Secretary to carry out this new program using existing USDA funds, facilities and technical expertise. Dairy and livestock producers should not be forced to become larger in order to remain competitive. Bigger is not necessarily better. And in fact, Mr. President, expansion is often counterproductive for small operations requiring them to take on an even greater debt load. Farmers need more help in determining other methods of maintaining long-term profitability. For example, small dairy farmers may find adoption of management-intensive grazing systems combined with a diversified cropping operation a profitable alternative to expansion. But there has been far too little federally funded research devoted to alternative livestock production systems. Small producers need more Federal research and extension activity devoted to the development of these alternatives. I believe this amendment is a good first step in establishing the Federal research commitment to help develop and promote production and marketing systems that specifically address the needs of small producers. 
Using research dollars to help maintain the economic viability of small- and medium-size dairy and livestock operations has benefits beyond those afforded to such farmers and the communities in which they reside. Keeping a large number of small operations in production can provide environmental benefits as well. As livestock operations expand their herd size without a corresponding increase in cropping acreage, manure storage and management practices become more costly and more burdensome for the operator and raise additional regulatory concerns associated with runoff and water quality among State and Federal regulators. Research that helps dairy and livestock operators remain competitive and profitable without dramatic expansion will help minimize these concerns. 
Finally, Mr. President, I proposed an amendment to require the Secretary to fund research on the competitiveness and viability of small- and medium-size farms under the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems--a new research program authorized by S. 1150 funded at total $780 million for fiscal years 1998 through 2002. With the inclusion of my amendment in the managers amendment, the Secretary is directed to make grants for research projects addressing the viability of small- and medium-size farming operations with funding made available under the Initiative in fiscal years 1999-2002. This amendment ensures that the research needs of small dairy, livestock, and cropping operations will be addressed under the substantial new funding provided for agricultural research in this bill. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation of the chairman, Mr. Lugar, and the ranking member, Mr. Harkin, of the Agriculture Committee and their staff in addressing the important research needs of small- and medium-size farms by including my amendments in this important bill. I look forward to working with them to maintain these amendments during conference committee consideration of this bill.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I also rise today, as did the Senator from Minnesota, to discuss the visit of the President of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin, who arrives in Washington tonight for a state visit. 
That Mr. Jiang and President Clinton will meet is not in itself extraordinary. The promotion of dialog between the United States and China can be a constructive use of our own diplomatic energies. Indeed, President Clinton has already met Mr. Jiang several times at various international fora. 
What strikes me is the kind of visit that is about to take place. It is a state visit that involves champagne toasts and 21-gun salutes--all the trappings of honor and prestige. While I do not oppose high-level contact, I feel strongly that the pomp and ceremony of a state visit is inappropriate at a time when the human rights situation in China and in Tibet remains such a serious obstacle to good relations. 
Simply put, it is my view that an official state visit is premature, absent a stronger commitment from China to improve human rights. I fear that this state visit will actually boost the legitimacy of a regime that brutalizes its own people and jails anyone who dares to complain. 
In other words, Mr. President, while dialog is important, you don't need champagne toasts and red carpets to have a dialog. 
Is the memory of the Tiananmen Square massacre so distant that we are willing to clink glasses with China's leaders as though nothing happened in Tiananmen Square? For me, the answer is no. When Jiang is given a 21-gun salute tomorrow, the South Lawn will sound much like the streets of Beijing did on the night of June 4, 1989. 
By agreeing to this state visit without receiving any kind of concession in the area of human rights, the administration may be squandering perhaps its strongest source of leverage with Beijing. Nevertheless, if the administration insists on hosting Jiang Zemin right now, the least that can be done is to accord discussion of human rights the same priority as the myriad other issues that confront our bilateral relations with China. Unfortunately, I don't think that is going to be the case. 
As we all know, there are many areas of disagreement between the United States and China, aside from human rights. The United States' trade deficit with China will likely reach $50 billion this year. China has a long and well-known record of assisting the nuclear programs of Iran and Pakistan and, as always, the sensitive issue of Taiwan remains a trouble spot. 
Arguably, there are some positive signs. China has agreed to make significant cuts in tariffs as a part of its bid to join the World Trade Organization, and Beijing has promised to tighten controls on nuclear exports. It is widely reported that an agreement to restart United States-China cooperation on nuclear power will be the centerpiece of the summit. 
Mr. President, on human rights there are few, if any, positive signs. Despite China's announcement on Saturday that it will sign the United Nations' Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, I see no evidence of real human rights improvement on the ground. The fact that human rights conditions in China are growing worse, not better, indicates that human rights needs to be given top priority. 
Three years after the President's decision to delink most-favored-nation status from human rights, a decision that I have always said was a mistake, we have seen the reimprisonment of dissidents and increased repression in Tibet. The State Department human rights report makes this very clear. According to the report covering the calendar year 1996: 
The Government continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic freedoms . . . Abuses included torture, and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and lengthy incommunicado detention. Prison conditions remained harsh. The Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy and workers rights. 
Just one year ago, we were witness to yet another example of these policies when Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, was sentenced to 11 years in prison. Also last December, a Beijing court sentenced activist Li Hai for collecting infomation on those jailed after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. 
The situation is just as bad in Tibet. 
Last year, China arrested Ngawang Choepel, a Tibetan musicologist and Fulbright scholar, and sentenced him to 18 years in prison on trumped-up spy charges. China has also intensified its campaign to smear the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people and a Nobel laureate. Tibetans are not even free to display a photo of the Dalai Lama, much less show reverence for him. There have been numerous reports of Tibetan monks and nuns suffering torture at the hands of Chinese authorities. The State Department human rights report cites three recent cases of Tibetan monks who died while in jail. 
Mr. President, despite signing two formal agreements with the United States on prison labor, Chinese prison-labor products continue to appear on our shores. Tong Yi, who worked as an assistant to Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng, knows the prison labor system first hand. Released just last year after serving a 2 1/2 -year sentence of re-education through labor--a sentence she received, by the way, without the benefit of any kind of trial--Ms. Tong says she was forced to work endless hours making products for export. 
In the rush to reach agreements with China on WTO and proliferation, the United States cannot shove human rights aside. While the United States can and does talk tough on issues such as trade and intellectual property protection, we must do the same when the conversation turns to Tiananmen and Tibet. 
In the run-up to the summit, Mr. Jiang has given several interviews during which he made some disturbing comments on human rights. 
When Time magazine asked Jiang Zemin about the plight of political dissidents Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng, Jiang responded that Wang and Wei are criminals, not dissidents. Indeed, it is a crime in China to publicly and peacefully criticize the Government as Mr. Wang and Mr. Wei have done. 
Mr. Jiang is willing to dismiss questions about human rights because he likely thinks U.S. concerns extend to only a few high-profile dissidents. But, in fact, Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan are merely symbols of the hundreds, if not thousands, of people in the People's Republic of China who are thrown into prison cells for demanding democracy, organizing prayer meetings, or for simply displaying loyalty to the Dalai Lama. These people might not be as famous and Mr. Wang and Mr. Wei, but they show the same type of courage, and they are every bit as important. 
Mr. President, there are three key messages on human rights that Jiang Zemin must hear loud and clear while he is in Washington. 
First, Jiang Zemin must realize that people who care about conditions in China seek more than the release of a token dissident or two. China likes to play a game where people like Wei Jingsheng are used as bargaining chips in the PRC's effort to curry favor with the international community at key moments. We saw this in 1993, when China tried to win a bid to host the year 2000 Olympic Games. Just a week before the International Olympic Committee was to vote on the matter, China released Wei Jingsheng. As we all know, Beijing lost the bid and, a few months later, Wei Jingsheng was back in prison, on charges of subversion. 
We saw this again in 1995 when China suddenly decided to release Chinese-American human rights activist Harry Wu shortly before the First Lady was to arrive to address the U.N. women's conference. 
But, the United States should not get caught in this cynical game. 
For there to be true friendship between the United States and China, China must implement across-the-board and institutional changes such as strengthening the rule of law and allowing citizens to question government policy without fear. Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders must realize that United States-China relations will never reach their full potential so long as hundreds, if not thousands, of dissidents languish behind bars; so long as Tibetan Buddhists are subject to arrest and torture; and so long as citizens are not free to select their rulers. 
Second, the United States must make clear to Jiang Zemin that the United States will not allow China to redefine the concept of `human rights' in a way that makes the term meaningless. 
China's leaders have stated numerous times that the Peoples Republic of China is committed to upholding the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This document affirms the right of every human being to enjoy freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is no special exception for China or any other country, nor should there be. 
Furthermore, article 35 of China's own Constitution states that `Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of procession, and of demonstration.' 
China's late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping was found of saying `seek truth from facts.' Well, the fact is that China denies its citizens the very rights that the Government has vowed to protect. 
I would like to ask Mr. Jiang if his government ever intends to grant its citizens the rights that, according to his country's own Constitution, Chinese citizens should already enjoy. Or will China's article 35 remain a meaningless provision, subject to endless caveats about the need for state security, social stability, and the rights of the collective? Will China continue to say it upholds the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, even though it systematically violates so many of the declaration's principles? 
If the United States can demand that China fulfill its obligations under the international arms control regime, then the United States should be able to demand just as strongly that Beijing keep its obligations under international human rights agreements. 
Third, Jiang Zemin should know that those of us--in the United States and around the world--who demand improvements in human rights are not trying to impose American or Western values on China, nor are we demanding that China be perfect according to some kind of American ideal. That would not be appropriate. 
China does often point to many flaws in American society: The high crime rate and the lingering problems of poverty and drugs. China's official media often refers to the United States political system as a `money bags democracy.' Indeed, proponents of campaign finance reform, like myself, find some validity in that Chinese assessment. 
But what Chinese leaders do not seem to understand is that being open about your problems is a sign of strength, not weakness. China lacks even the ability to acknowledge its severe human rights problem. Those of us that wish to promote human rights improvements want to encourage China to establish the tools--a free press, open debate, and respect for political and religious minorities--that will ultimately make China a stronger society and nation. 
Mr. President, protecting human rights, respecting free speech, and tolerating dissent will bestow more legitimacy on China than any summit or White House photo-op could ever do. 
This is what Jiang Zemin needs to hear. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to make a few brief comments regarding the nomination of Mr. Peter Scher to be the Special Trade Ambassador for Agriculture which the Senate approved yesterday. I am pleased to report that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on which I serve, considered the nomination of Mr. Scher and favorably reported his nomination last month. 
I met with Mr. Scher following his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss with him the problems Wisconsin's agricultural sector has had with our existing trade agreements such as the Uruguay Round of GATT and the North American Free Trade Agreement. I urged Mr. Scher, in his new position, to work diligently to ensure that our trading partners are complying with their agricultural trade obligations established by these agreements. 
Specifically, I asked Mr. Scher and the USTR to accept a Section 301 petition filed by the dairy industry asking USTR to challenge the Canadian export pricing scheme before the World Trade Organization. Canada's dairy export subsidies violate the export subsidy reduction commitments under the Uruguay Round. These subsidies disadvantage the U.S. dairy industry in its efforts to compete in world markets. I also pointed out that Canada also has effectively prohibited our dairy industry from exporting products to lucrative Canadian markets. Not only must USTR aggressively pursue WTO dispute settlement proceedings against Canadian export subsidies, but it must also seek greater access for U.S. dairy products to Canadian markets, among others, in any upcoming trade negotiations. 
I am pleased that late last month U.S. Trade Representative Barshefsky agreed to pursue formal WTO dispute resolution proceedings challenging the Canadian dairy export subsidy scheme as well as European Union violations of the dairy provisions of the Uruguay Round. I appreciate the cooperation of Mr. Scher and Ambassador Barshefsky on this important matter. 
I also raised with Mr. Scher the problems the U.S. potato industry has had with respect to access to both Canadian and Mexican markets. I urged him to pursue negotiations with the Canadians to allow greater access of U.S. potatoes to their domestic markets and to aggressively seek accelerated reduction in Mexican tariffs for U.S. potatoes, a commitment made to potato growers when NAFTA was approved. Mr. Scher assured me that potatoes would be among the commodities to be considered in upcoming negotiations with Mexico. 
I believe Mr. Scher has a fundamental understanding of both the importance of trade to agriculture generally and of the complex trade problems the U.S dairy industry faces regarding compliance with existing trade agreements. For that reason, I have supported the approval of his nomination. But I expect USTR, with Mr. Scher acting as Ambassador, to aggressively pursue the resolution of the critical issues facing our domestic dairy and potato sectors. I will continue to work with USTR to resolve these issues and will hold Mr. Scher to his commitment that USTR will use all existing tools to ensure compliance with existing trade agreements and to pursue greater access for agriculture to international markets. 
I continue to have serious reservations about U.S. efforts to begin new trade negotiations until the problems with our current bilateral and multilateral agreements are successfully resolved. Wisconsin is home to 24,000 dairy farmers, 140 cheese processing plants and many other businesses associated with milk production and processing. Dairy contributes some $4 billion in income to Wisconsin's economy and provides 130,000 jobs. Wisconsin is also the fifth largest potato producing state with a large chip and french fry processing sector. Overall, Wisconsin ranks tenth in the nation in farm numbers and ninth nationally with respect to market value of agricultural products sold. 
Wisconsin's farmers and food processing industry could greatly benefit by gaining a greater share of international markets. However, for that to happen, our trade agreements must not only be fair, they must be enforceable. To date, our trade agreements have not only failed to provide significant benefits for many agricultural sectors, including dairy, they have placed some sectors at a distinct disadvantage. I will look at all future trade agreement proposals with an eye to these issues and make decisions on those proposals based, in part, on how they treat Wisconsin farmers.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the minority leader, the Senator from South Dakota, I would like to correct the statement made by the majority leader in the Record. The majority leader indicated that he and the Senator from South Dakota had an understanding with regard to how to bring back the campaign finance reform issue. 
But the fact is that the agreement had not been reduced to writing, and that when it was reduced to writing, his understanding, that is, the understanding of the Senator from the State of South Dakota, my understanding, and the understanding of every member of our caucus was that the vehicle by which this would happen would be that we would bring back Senate bill 25, as modified. 
The agreement did not include that language. And there simply was no additional or new request made by anyone on our behalf. So I would like to correct that statement as well. That did not happen. We are hopeful that an agreement can be reached. But I do have to say, for the record, that it simply was not a correct representation of what happened with regard to the negotiations today. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on that point, let me agree strongly with the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from North Dakota and highlight what will happen in a couple of minutes. 
We will have a cloture vote that is purportedly on the issue of highway spending, but it is not about highway spending. It is not about transportation. It is not about investing in infrastructure. Those votes will come later. The vote we are going to have in a few minutes is about whether the first session of the 105th Congress is going to adjourn for the year without one single substantive vote on the issue of campaign finance reform and all the scandals that we have seen here in Washington. That is what is going on here. That is exactly what the American people have to be told in a straightforward manner. 
The discussion that we just had here indicated what really happened a couple of weeks ago on the campaign finance reform bill. We thought we were going to have a serious debate on that issue. We thought there was going to be an opportunity not only to debate the overall bill but to offer Senators what Senators come here to do--the opportunity to offer amendments and modifications. 
I was ready for that debate. These Senators were ready for that debate. The Senator from Arizona was ready for that debate. Even the junior Senator from Kentucky, the leading opponent of campaign finance reform, said he was ready for that debate. 
Well, we were wrong, Mr. President. We never had such a debate. We never had such amendments voted on. We had a sham, a con game played on the American people. We had a process that was purposely rigged so that one way or the other the Republicans and Democrats would have to filibuster, or better yet, if possible, make both of them filibuster. 
So my point is this: Let's have that debate. Let's have serious, substantive votes on this issue. Let's let Senators amend and modify and give their good ideas to the bill and then let the chips fall where they may. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
This morning we have another opportunity to speak again about this issue, campaign finance reform, which many people wish would go away but it is not going to. Again, it is a chance to review sort of the kaleidoscope of arguments that have been used to condemn our efforts on the McCain-Feingold bill and other campaign finance reform proposals. 
Listening to the Senator from Georgia, we hear again the claim that what is really wrong with this bill is that it violates the first amendment--which, of course, we dispute and also find just a little amusing when you consider, first of all, that if there is any problem with this bill under the first amendment, we still do have nine people across the street who know how to handle that. 
But many of the same Senators who are condemning our bill from the point of view of the first amendment are some of the first in line who are ready to amend the first amendment. That is part of the agenda of many of the folks on the other side of the aisle. 
There is no compunction at all on the part of some of these folks to pass a flag-burning amendment to the first amendment, to make an exemption of free speech there. No concerns at all with regard to the first amendment and related rights in passing a school prayer amendment, which many of our opponents believe would not be a violation of the first amendment and which I think would be. 
Virtually every opponent of this bill had no problem at all coming out here on the floor of the Senate and voting for the Communications Decency Act, which to me was the most blatantly anticonstitutional censorship bill we have seen in a very long time, and every single Member of the Supreme Court agreed; 9-0 they ruled that this bill, the Communications Decency Act, was unconstitutional. Where were all the Senators out here talking about the first amendment when I came out here in a rather lonely manner and said, `By the way, this on its face cannot possibly pass muster'? Where was the concern for the first amendment? It was not there. 
So I am puzzled about what the fear is. If it is so easy to play with the first amendment when it comes to school prayer and flag burning and the Internet, what is the problem with sending up a bill that reasonable people disagree about with regard to one aspect of its constitutionality? What is the threat to the Republic? Nothing, unless we have somehow eliminated the third branch. 
Then, of course, we have been treated again to my favorite argument in opposition to this bill, that there is not enough money in politics. 
We heard it again today. 
I have to tell you, that argument has proven to be the biggest loser of all with the American people. Does anyone really believe that the best thing that can happen in this society is that more money gets spent on election? 
Let's remember what Mr. Tamraz said before the Governmental Affairs Committee on September 18, 1997. He is one who certainly understands what to do and what it means if we are going to keep expanding the role of money in politics. This is what he had to say in response to a question from our colleague, the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman]. 
Senator Lieberman. So, do you think you got your money's worth? Do you feel badly about having given the $300,000?

Mr. FEINGOLD. I will try to conclude quickly. 
Mr. President, at this time, the Federal Express Corp., according to Congressional Quarterly on October 2, 1996, had contributed, between October 17 and November 25, $200,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and $50,000 to the national Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. Specifically, the company also gave $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee and $100,000 to the Republican National Committee right before this provision was stuffed into conference committee. 
Now, this is the kind of democracy that we are ratifying.

Mr. FEINGOLD. That article details a similar series of activities that had to do with FedEx's desires with regard to trade and Japan. Here is the real conclusion of the story, and I want others to have a chance to speak, so let me continue by saying we all remember that the United Parcel Service had a strike not too long ago. It was the biggest news in America. Who is their competitor? The Federal Express Corp. The Federal Express Corp. used this process, this fundraising process, this access process, this soft money process, to get a special benefit so they don't have that kind of union. They don't have that kind of strike because their folks can't get together to do that because of Federal law. 
What happened? Apparently, as a result of the UPS strike, FedEx benefited. The Federal Express Corp., according to one report, is gaining market share because of its adroit handling of additional business during the recent UPS strike, analysts say. Some analysts estimate that the UPS market share slipped to about 70 percent of the U.S. package delivery market from 80 percent before the strike. 
Mr. President, there is a difference between FedEx and UPS, and the difference was the ability of campaign money to prevent FedEx employees from organizing the way they want. That is the kind of democracy and economy that we will have if the filibusterers prevail. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Interstate Distribution of State-inspected Meat Act of 1997 introduced today by my colleague from Utah [Mr. Hatch] and I thank him for his leadership on this issue. 
This is a very important bill for my State of Wisconsin which has nearly 300 State-inspected meat plants which provide jobs and income for rural communities. The quality meat products processed by these plants such as the Lodi Sausage Co. in Lodi, WI, Gunderson Food Service in Mondovi, WI, Goodfella's Pizza Corp. in Medford, WI, The Ham Store in Brookfield, WI, Country Fresh Meats in Hatley, WI, and Louie's Finer Meats, Inc. in Cumberland, WI are prohibited from being sold across State lines. These small businesses face the interstate marketing prohibition not because their products haven't been inspected--in fact all these businesses are inspected by the State of Wisconsin--but because of an archaic provision of Federal law which prohibits interstate shipment of State-inspected meats even though the State inspection program is certified as equal to Federal meat inspection programs. 
These plants, and hundreds like them in Wisconsin, produce quality specialty meat products which are demanded by consumers in other States. But the owners of these facilities are unable to capitalize on their specialties and meet that market demand. By limiting these plants to markets within their home-State borders, Federal law effectively prevents them from expanding their markets, increasing the number of people they employ, and generating additional economic activity in rural areas. 
These small plants pose no competitive threat to larger processors who are federally inspected. In most cases, State-inspected plants are small family owned businesses, employing between 1 and 20 people, producing specialty products to fill a small market niche. These plant owners and operators pay special attention to the quality of their products and because of this they cannot grow very large. Wisconsin's small-scale meat processors take great pride in their products which reflect the ethnic diversity in my State. In fact, it is my understanding that Wisconsin specialty meat products win nearly 25 percent of the awards at the American Association of Meat Processors' nationwide product show. 
Furthermore, these small State-inspected plants play a critical role in sustaining rural communities and helping to ensure diversity of size in the livestock industry. Most of these plants buy livestock locally which helps maintain the viability of nearby small family livestock operations. By buying locally they know exactly where their inputs bar coming from and how they are produced, which allows them to control the quality of their products. These local buying practices help counteract trends toward concentration in the livestock and poultry production and processing industries providing small livestock and dairy producers with marketing alternatives in any industry dominated by a few large meat packers. 
The owners of these small businesses in Wisconsin correctly point out that they face even more meat shipment restrictions than their competitors from foreign countries. Under our trade agreements, meat products from foreign countries are allowed into the United States and across State borders as long as the country has an inspection program that is `equivalent' to U.S. programs. Meanwhile, even if State inspection programs are `equal to' Federal inspection programs, meats inspected under State programs are still precluded from interstate shipment Mr. President, it simply isn't fair and it is time to eliminate this inequity. 
The bill we are introducing today makes a simple but important change to Federal law to allow State-inspected meats to be sold across State lines after the State inspection program is favorably reviewed and certified by the Secretary of Agriculture as at least `equal to' Federal meat inspection programs. If State programs are not equal to the Federal inspection program, they will not be certified by USDA and State-inspected meats will not cross State lines. The Secretary is also required by this bill to certify that the State inspection program is on schedule in implementing USDA's new Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points [HAACP] regulations. The bill also requires the Secretary to annually recertify the State program. To provide further safeguards, Federal meat inspectors may also randomly inspect State plants to ensure that they continue to meet Federal standards. The Secretary will have the authority to reinstate the interstate shipment ban on plants that fail to meet Federal standards. This bill is responsible to consumers while providing equity to small State-inspected plants. 
Mr. President, I think the best arguments in favor of this legislation are made by those small business owners who are directly affected by the interstate shipment prohibition imposed on their meat products. I want to share with my colleagues some comments made by owners of some State-inspected processing businesses in Wisconsin.: 
Louis Muench, owner of Louie's Finer Meats, Inc. In Cumberland, WI writes:  
We are the operators of a small meat processing and sausage making operation in a small town in northern Wisconsin . . . Our plant is 30 miles from the Minnesota border and we cannot even provide sausage for a pancake supper in Minnesota, let alone any wholesaling to supermarkets and convenience stores. We have received over 100 State and National awards for our sausage products. We cannot even market these products on a regional basis, let alone a national basis. This past May [1996], we were honored to receive two international gold medals for our sausage in Frankfurt, Germany. We are not allowed to market these products anywhere but Wisconsin. These kinds of restrictions make it difficult to maintain a profitable business. 
Dan Kubly, one of the owners of LazyBones Ham Store, in Brookfield, WI writes: 
We work very closely with our state inspectors and consider them an ally in our overall business. We constantly consult with them on equipment conditions, labeling and handling procedures in our plant. It makes no sense that we are permitted to ship our products anywhere as long as the retail customer buys the product at our stores, but are not allowed to ship the same product across state lines through a distributor . . . Our volume is increasing rapidly and we are interested in contracting with a multi-state distributor, however we are unable to do this because we do not have USDA inspection. We feel our business will suffer significantly and job creation will end if we are not permitted to expand due to this unnecessary prohibition. 
James Weber, owner of Gunderson Food Service, in Modovi, WI writes: 
We are operating a small meat plant in northwest Wisconsin and employ 9 people. We slaughter and and custom process for the local farm community, smoke ham and bacon, manufacture sausage and sell retail and wholesale. We are under Wisconsin meat inspection and are required to be equal to or better than Federal inspection. In the last 4 years we have taken 18 Wisconsin, national and international awards for our ham, jerky, beef sticks and sausage; but because I am in Wisconsin I am discriminated against by the Federal government. We are 30 miles from the Minnesota border but cannot sell our product there. If my products are of high enough quality to be sent 250 miles to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, then why is there a problem with me selling it 25 miles away in Waubaska, Minnesota? 
Bill Ruef, owner of Ruef's Meat Market in New Glarus, WI who processes a Swiss ready-to-eat snack called `Landjaeger' writes: 
This [Landjaeger] is our most popular item, and I get asked on a regular basis by business owners from other states--we are about 25 miles from the Illinois border--if we can ship our Landjaegers to them for resale in their establishments. It really hurts me and my business when I have to tell them `no' because we aren't federally inspected. This kind of unfair prohibition will only continue to drive small businesses to fold and allow large conglomerates to monopolize the industry. 
Mr. President, these business owners say it best. The current prohibition on interstate shipment of State-inspected meats is obsolete and patently unfair to small meat processors. It is time to correct this inequity and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me, first of all, congratulate the occupant of the chair for his vote yesterday. I heard his comments this morning. The occupant of the chair did the right thing yesterday. He voted for cloture and joined 52 other Senators--a Senator we had not in the past known for sure whether or not he was going to vote for cloture on any occasion, and I very much appreciate that. 
I realize that his words are sincere. He does, in fact, support campaign finance reform. It is important that, again, the Senator from Arizona and I signal what we have signaled in the past, and that is that we are very eager to negotiate, whether on the floor or off the floor, to make a bill that would be more palatable to Members on both sides of the aisle. 
I think the Senator from Arkansas has indicated some excellent ideas in the past. That is the signal I want to give, despite whatever indications one might feel from the press accounts, which, of course, all of us have to take with a grain of salt on both sides of the issue. The fact is that many of us really would like to change this system, and I believe the Senator who occupies the chair is one of them. 
Let me reiterate our offer, which I think we have made good on time and time again, that if modifications need to be made to pass this terribly important bill, we are ready to do it. That is how the junior Senator from Maine became such a tremendous advocate for our cause. She had some ideas that were better than ours, and we incorporated them and moved on to make the bill even better. 
So I look forward to working with the occupant of the chair so that, once again, he can feel comfortable voting for cloture as we continue to press this issue on the floor, which we will do until we get the result that the American people demand. 
Let me also suggest, this is a point that seems to be missed in this debate frequently. The Senator from Kentucky speaks frequently and eloquently about the first amendment. But the way our system is established, surely if you pass a bill in the Congress, a piece of legislation, a statute, it doesn't amend the Constitution. There is more to the process. The President has to sign the bill, and it has to go up to the United States Supreme Court, unless nobody challenges it. And I have a sneaking suspicion that somebody might challenge this bill if it became law. 
So what is the worst-case scenario? The worst-case scenario is that if, in fact, there is a shred of our bill that is unconstitutional, the Supreme Court will say so and strike it down. They know how to do their job. If we do our job, they will do their job. That is exactly what they did in the very famous case of Buckley versus Valeo. They determined that some elements of the bill were constitutional, despite the claim of the ACLU and others that they were not, and they said they were OK. 
For example, having a limitation on contributions. It is, obviously, the law now, and the Senator from Kentucky cannot dispute that it is the law, that right now somebody can't give more than $2,000 in the course of 6 years to a U.S. Senate candidate in hard money. That is a limitation. The Supreme Court said it is OK. 
On the other hand, in Buckley versus Valeo, the Court said you can't have overall mandatory spending limits because that, in their view, would be a violation of the first amendment. 
So what is the threat to the first amendment of passing a piece of legislation about which we have a good-faith disagreement as to its constitutionality? I happen to think it is clear that the major provisions of our bill are constitutional. 
I would be the first to concede that the closest case would be the one that the Senator from Kentucky has focused most of his firepower on in this debate, and that is the issue of what I like to call phony issue ads. But I can see that would be something the Supreme Court would have to take a long and hard look at, and I think they should. That is why, Mr. President, I don't support a constitutional amendment to get this done. The first amendment is too sacred. 
So, I want to address your concern about the first amendment to tell you that I was, I believe, the first or second Member of the U.S. Senate to come out here and oppose something called the Communications Decency Act. People fell all over each other voting for that bill that would have censored the Internet. I came out here and said, `Look, on the face of this, even though I am not a leading constitutional expert but I have looked at the Constitution, on the face of it, this is unconstitutional.' Yet, I believe 84 Members of this body, including the Senator from Kentucky, voted for it, sent it up to the Supreme Court and, guess what? Unanimously that Supreme Court--of which a majority of the Members were appointed by the majority party Presidents--unanimously ruled that that was unconstitutional. 
Mr. President, both with regard to your concern that we be flexible and open to other people's ideas, which I think you and I have established a good record on, and with regard to the issue of the first amendment to the Constitution, not only couldn't I agree with you more, but I believe we have a lot to talk about and work together on to achieve campaign finance reform. 
Since the Senator from Kentucky continues in his steadfast way to make a record, which I hope one day will get before the Supreme Court--he hopes it won't get that far--let me address a couple of other issues and put a few things of concern to me in the Record. 
The Senator from Kentucky has been proudly suggesting that the McCain-Feingold bill is dead, and yet we are out here today debating it again, and we will be debating it again. That is because it is not going away. It is because it is not simply a question of various elements of the media saying that the McCain-Feingold bill is a good idea. There are others who are not in the media who, I think, are not easily duped by the media who think we ought to enact some of the things that are in the McCain-Feingold bill.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in that letter, a number of our former colleagues from both Houses of the Congress state: 
We are pleased to join former Presidents Bush, Carter and Ford in expressing the hope that the current Congress enact meaningful bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation. 
This includes the names of people like the distinguished former Member Nancy Kassebaum Baker, former Senator from Kansas; Howard Baker, Jr., former leader and Senator from Tennessee; former Republican Senator John Danforth of Missouri, who I had the honor to serve with briefly; former Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon; former Senator Walter Mondale and former Vice President; former Senator Bill Bradley from New Jersey; former minority leader of the other body, Robert Michel; former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn; former Senator Al Simpson, the Senator from Wyoming with whom I disagreed frequently on the floor of the Senate who was among the toughest and most clever opponents you could have on the floor, but he cosponsored the McCain-Feingold bill last session after he made his retirement announcement, and he still supports it. And the list goes on. 
Mr. President, I do not think these folks are merely pawns of the media. These folks have been here; they have seen it; they have done it. And they know that spending a tremendous amount of your time in raising money is the corrupting of this process. And many of them, as they announced their retirements, said they were sick and tired of spending their time as Members of Congress raising money. The killing of the bill, the vain attempt to kill this bill, as it turns out, would prevent the first efforts to get our attention away from raising money and back to the business we were elected to do.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this one makes an interesting point, that is, that in addition to the various church and other religious groups, in addition to former Presidents, in addition to former Members of Congress, in addition to the hundreds of editorials by liberal papers, conservative papers, moderate newspapers all across the country that have supported McCain-Feingold and believe it has merit, that what we have discovered, Senator McCain and I, the Senator from Arizona and I have discovered, is that there are a whole lot of businesspeople that are tired of being the fall guys of this system. 
Under the system, even with hard money, let alone soft money, where they can be asked for hundreds of thousands of dollars, a lot of these CEO's feel like they have become the fall guys of American politics. 
I actually had the CEO of one of these companies, the Federal Express Co., come to visit me after last year's episode, where they were able to insert a provision into the Federal aviation bill that allowed them to not have a national union even though, as we very well know, their competitor, the United Parcel Service does have a national union, which they had to contend with recently, but they were able to place a provision in that bill, even though they had not won a vote on any occasion on the particular issue, shortly after they gave each of the two parties--I want to check my notes on this--but I believe they gave them each $100,000 of soft money just a few days--just a few days--before this provision was inserted into the bill. 
When I met with the CEO, who is a tremendous entrepreneur in this country, he said he has no choice, in effect, that if this is the way the rules are set up, he has to represent his employees and his shareholders and he has to fight and make political contributions, and he has to play hardball in effect. He did. He won. 
You know what? During that UPS strike, Federal Express, which has that protection against such national union advocacy, Federal Express picked up something like 10 to 15 percent of UPS's market share, something they had been trying to do forever. 
My point in introducing this item from the business leaders is to suggest that even the business leaders, who many might associate with the other side of the aisle in many cases, are saying, we are sick and tired of being the fall guys of a system that essentially has the potential to shake them down, otherwise, they are afraid their competitor might get an edge. 
It is almost exactly what Mr. Tamraz said when he indicated by paying $300,000 he got the room the other people got that paid $300,000. That is access, and that is how you get in the room, and that is in effect the American way. That seemed to be what he was saying. It is pretty sad that has become the American way. 
Even some of the corporate leaders of this country do not want this to become what it has become, which is in effect a corporate democracy, a democracy dominated by big money, not by the average citizen's right to have their vote count the same as others.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, at this point these are all the items I want to place in the Record at this time. But fortunately this debate will continue in one form or another. We will have an important cloture vote shortly on the overall bill. 
Tomorrow, there will be two more cloture votes. And it will continue because it is absolutely essential that we do not disgrace ourselves by going home, certainly for the 1998 elections, and even more importantly just going home at the end of this session having displayed to the American people all the abuses of the current system, the areas where the law is insufficient, the areas where there are loopholes in the law, and then to return home and say to everyone, `You know what? We didn't do anything about it. We didn't pass a single piece of legislation.' 
I don't think any of us on either side of the aisle consider that to be an acceptable outcome. 
I would like finally to say again to the Chair, I look forward to working to negotiate the kind of legislation that he can support. And I again thank him for his vote yesterday. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I first thank my leader, Senator Daschle, not only for his kind words but for his important reiteration of the offer he has made. It is an unusual offer. The offer is to have S. 9, the so-called Paycheck Protection Act, come up as its own bill and relinquishing the right that Senators always have, which the Senator from Kentucky knows very well, to filibuster. In other words, it would be guaranteed an up-or-down vote. I think that is a significant offer that raises the real issue of whether we are talking about something that is, in fact, an attempt to destroy this McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill, which I think it clearly is. 
Mr. President, I would like to also put a few items in the Record, as the Senator from Kentucky has done. First of all, you see a lot of headlines when you work on an issue like this. Some are good; some are bad. Sometimes you see `McCain-Feingold bill is dead.' That was the litany for some time. Once in a while you see a headline you almost like, even though it isn't intended to be favorable. This one I like from The Hill, a Capitol Hill publication, of the other day, October 1, which informs us `Most Lobbyists Oppose McCain-Feingold Bill.'

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I guess I am delighted to see this kind of a headline, because I am not surprised. Most lobbyists do oppose campaign finance reform and the McCain-Feingold bill, because these folks are the folks I have come to regard, not as bad people, many of them are very good people, but as people who have basically become the Washington gatekeeper. They are the ones that control the campaign contributions now. If a local individual, if a local organization back home wants to contribute to your campaign or give you support, when they are part of this organization that has a lobbyist in Washington, they need to call Washington. 
So it is no surprise that the lobbyists oppose our bill. They are one of the most important forces against our bill, besides the unfortunate fact, of course, that every single Member of the Congress was elected under the current system. 
But even some of these groups that are represented by lobbyists have changed their minds. The Senator from Kentucky has made a great deal of the fact that the National Education Association, he has said, opposes McCain-Feingold. There was a time when their leadership did appear with Senator McConnell and indicate some opposition to some aspects of the bill. But as Senator McCain and I said from the beginning, we want to address various concerns of other Senators and organizations, and we have made some changes. Our bill is now supported by the National Education Association.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes, Mr. President. My point exactly. We have tried to adjust this bill to address the concerns of organizations and groups that the Senator from Kentucky has identified. That is our point. Senator McCain and I don't believe we have all the answers. In fact, neither of us love the bill. That is how we were able to come up with a compromise. We heard the concerns of the NEA. We addressed their concerns. They support us now. They no longer support the Senator from Kentucky. 
A further attempt that has been made on this issue is to suggest that the American people don't care about this issue, if you look at a poll or any other measure of public opinion that this isn't important to them that we change this big money system. The Senator from Arizona has already done a fine job today of helping to dispel that. 
I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a publication from the very conservative publication the Weekly Standard from September 22, 1997, entitled `Republicans Get Some Very Bad News.'

<TEXT>
Mr. FEINGOLD. As soon as I am done, I will be happy to yield momentarily to let that happen. 
Let me quote what was said by this publication that is certainly no friend of the McCain-Feingold bill and, frankly, no friend of campaign finance reform. The article indicated that: 
Republican senators got an unwelcome jolt last week at one of their usually uneventful . . . lunch meetings--a poll that showed they were in deep trouble. The poll, conducted by the Republican National Committee during the first week of September, gave the president his highest positive rating ever--almost 65 percent. 
And then it goes on to state:  
That was not the worst of it. For the first time this year, the numbers showed that more Americans wanted Democrats to control Congress than Republicans, and that Democrats were ahead on the `generic ballot' for November 1998. 
The point I want to emphasize is the following statement: 
But what really rattled the Senators was that, when asked what issues they cared most about, Americans had moved one new item into the first tier along with the old standbys of crime, education, and the like. The new issue: campaign-finance reform, which had moved from 2 or 3 percent in previous polls to double digits as the number one issue of concern. 
Mr. President, I know that the Senator from Kentucky wants to dispel this poll. I will yield to him in a moment to do so. But I just want to emphasize, in addition to the more independent polls that the Senator from Arizona has already cited today, that even a poll that was presented to the Republican National Committee indicates that campaign finance reform is a matter of very top concern to the American people at this time.

<TEXT>
Mr. FEINGOLD. When the Senator from Kentucky was putting items in the Record, I was letting him go. I will be available for questions in a moment. 
All I can say, Mr. President, is this is not the only measure we put in the Record. What is striking is that even the Weekly Standard believes that this issue has gone very high on the list of issues. Every measure that is being taken now does indicate a tremendous growth in the concern about this issue. 
I would be fascinated to hear more about exactly why the RNC changed its data on this. I will try to take a look at it later. I do not know why they indicated that it was incorrect. Somehow the Weekly Standard got the impression that this issue was on the move. On that point they are right. 
Mr. President, I would also like to note with regard to the statement of the Senator from Kentucky about the American Civil Liberty Union's position on this bill, yes, the American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concerns about the bill. 
I want to remind the Senator from Kentucky that the ACLU was wrong when they litigated the Buckley versus Valeo case. They did not win all the points that they litigated in that case. In fact, some of the individuals that the Senator from Kentucky has just cited were among those who litigated that case and lost. So, yes, they litigated it. They had their day in court. And they were wrong. 
In fact, the ACLU, an organization which sometimes I am criticized for agreeing with, happens to be dead wrong with regard to a release that they just put out entitled `Revised McCain-Feingold Legislation Would Trample on Americans' First Amendment Rights.' 
Mr. President, I would like to just quote a sentence from that release to show how reckless some people are being about describing this bill. The quote says this: 
McCain-Feingold imposes a 2-month, 60-day blackout before any Federal election on any radio or television advertisement that mentions any candidates for Federal office. 
Mr. President, that is not true. The bill does ask that certain rules apply during that 60-day period that do not apply outside of that period, and the rules are that you must use hard money limits and disclosure in order to do it, but there is no blackout, there is no prohibition. 
Mr. President, there isn't a single advertisement that you could possibly come up with that is barred by this bill. That is not what the bright line test is. In fact, it is very troubling to see an organization for which I have such high regard in terms of their professionalism, in terms of their ability to mount legal arguments, to see somebody actually say that the bill does something it clearly does not do. 
You cannot prohibit advertisements. You cannot say that people cannot say things. What you can do, I believe, and I believe the Supreme Court will support this, is during the electioneering period, which the Supreme Court has talked about, you can require that certain kinds of messages be disclosed in terms of who is making them and also that the money that is used and raised for it be under certain kinds of limits. That is all it does. I think the ACLU is in error with regard to that provision. 
Mr. President, I would also like to place in the Record at this time Senate bill 143 from the 102d Congress. The other day there was a spirited conversation between my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, and the Senator from Arizona which centered around the fact that the Senator from Kentucky has cosponsored legislation that did a couple of things that he has now said on the floor are unconstitutional. 
In particular, Mr. President, the point was made by the Senator from Arizona that the Senator from Kentucky had cosponsored a bill that bans soft money. The Senator from Kentucky responded by saying: Well, you know, sometimes you sign on to a bill that you're not comfortable with, and you want to participate in a joint effort.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Senate bill 143 from the 102d Congress was offered by the Senator from Kentucky. It was not a group of people that had to sort of pull together to support the leader on this. Mr. McConnell, the Senator from Kentucky, was the lead author, and then other Senators, distinguished Senators, agreed with him--Senator Dole, Senator Simpson, Senator Packwood, Senator Cochran, Senator Domenici, Senator Murkowski, Senator Roth, and Senator Hatfield; but the lead author of the bill was the Senator from Kentucky. And the bill banned soft money. 
Mr. President, it specifically provides for the ban of soft money which the Senator from Kentucky has denounced as an unconstitutional part of the McCain-Feingold bill. So this notion that somehow the Senator from Kentucky was not supportive of this kind of concept, at least at that time, does not seem to withstand scrutiny. 
Mr. President, I would also like at this time to spend a few moments talking a little bit about a very important item, and that is the proposal before us offered by the majority leader. That represents, to me, an attempt to put the onus of the entire campaign finance issue just on organized labor. That is the substantive impact of this proposal. 
But I am afraid the proposal is, in the end, going to serve a larger purpose, if it prevails. The majority leader made it pretty clear that was his purpose. The purpose of the proposal, it seems to me, is to kill the McCain-Feingold bill. I know the majority leader has said that that is not the case. But I am not the only one who believes this is a poison pill. Just about everyone who has looked at this feels this is an attempt to kill this bill by insisting that Senate bill 9 be brought up at this time. 
The Senator from Kentucky said that Senate bill 9 was a very important bill; that is why it was No. 9. I understand the rules around here. The leaders get to introduce about five bills each they consider to be a top priority. Senate bill 9 was one of those top priorities of the Republican leadership. 
Why then, if it was such a top priority, did they wait almost until the end of this entire year, the end of this entire session, to bring it up? If it was so important, why wasn't it given the importance that it supposedly had? Others agree.

Mr. President, that editorial identifies clearly the belief of most Americans that the purpose of this amendment is not necessarily to simply resolve this issue, although I am sure Members on the other side of the aisle, many of them, feel strongly about it, but it is to kill the McCain-Feingold bill.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky is fond of quoting Mr. Broder, a leading columnist and expert on these kinds of issues in the country. But he lays out pretty clearly the fact that this is not simply another piece of legislation that happens to come up as the first and potentially only amendment on the campaign finance reform bill. He clearly lays out some of the political and other considerations that are involved in bringing up such a poison pill.

<TEXT>
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this again is another editorial indicating that people around this country know very well that what is going on here is not an opportunity to freely and fully debate and amend this bill but an attempt to narrow it down to one issue--and I am not saying it is not an important issue--but to narrow this whole issue down to one issue having to do with union dues, which could be easily resolved. 
If everybody took a look at the McCain-Feingold provision, a provision that codified the Beck decision, a provision we placed in the bill after much negotiation, it says if you are a nonunion member and you do not want your dues to go to a political campaign, we can refund that. We codified what the Supreme Court said in that. 
Our concern is that the majority leader's amendment goes well beyond that, knowing full well it would make it impossible for a real bipartisan bill to come out of this body. 
Mr. President, if this were a proposal offered by a Democrat, and it had as its central premise the idea that the Federal Government should be regulating the internal functions of a voluntary organization, such as the Christian Coalition or the National Rifle Association, you can bet those on the other side would be beside themselves. 
Mr. President, that is what a labor union is. In fact, if you read the Beck decision, as I did again today just to be sure, that whole decision is about the fact that the Taft-Hartley Act said they were not going to permit any more closed shops in America. So if you do not want to be a member of a union, you do not have to be but there would still be union shops. And that is because under that legislation, under that law, a union is a voluntary organization. 
If members of a labor union do not approve of the collective bargaining activities or the political activities or any other activities of the union, they have the right to use the democratic process to change those activities. They can run for office within the union. They can build coalitions and seek leadership posts. And of course, Mr. President--and this is a point that has been glossed over far too often in debate--if the individual wants absolutely nothing to do with the union, he or she has the option of quitting or not joining the union in the first place. 
Union membership is not mandatory. It is voluntary. But as the Democratic leader has pointed out, this provision, this amendment is not about reform. I am afraid it is a little more about the last election. 
The sponsors of this proposal have come to the conclusion that all of the problems in our campaign system can be traced to the political activities of just labor unions. Who believes that? Clearly, labor unions are participants, but they are only one kind of participant and by no means the greatest participant when it comes to the kind of money that has been spent in recent elections. 
The Senator from Arizona and I have come to a different conclusion. I know the Senator from Arizona believes passionately that the spending by organized labor has to be controlled with regard to elections, but he and I have come to the conclusion that to simply say that unions alone are the problem does not really measure the problem. 
We have concluded we should craft a reform proposal that affects both parties--that affects both parties--in a fair and equal manner. We have concluded that corporate America is just as much to blame for our campaign system as labor unions or anyone else. That is the point here. There is plenty of blame to go around for everybody. Democrats are responsible, Republicans are responsible, corporations are responsible, labor unions are responsible, groups that are trying to divide us in this country are responsible. Everybody can and should accept part of the blame for this disastrous system. 
What we are trying to do, what the Senator from Arizona and I are trying to do, is to get this nonsense to come to an end. Instead, we are being told by the supporters of the Lott amendment, apparently that when the Ford Motor Co. takes the money of its shareholders and makes a $500,000 soft money contribution to a political party, that is perfectly fine; but if the United Auto Workers makes a similar soft money contribution to a political party, that is not OK. That has to be what the authors of this amendment are suggesting because they are not suggesting that we treat them in the same way. 
Of course, the other problem with the amendment is that it appears to be offered under the mistaken assumption that the underlying McCain-Feingold proposal would have no impact on labor unions. Mr. President, that is just false. The Senator from Arizona and I have worked hard to make sure that in a fair manner the activities of unions and other organizations that seem to distort the political process are affected. 
First of all, the bill bans all union and corporate soft money contributions to the parties. We ban it across the board. That includes all union soft money. But it also includes if it is done by the Ford Motor Co. In short, Mr. President, under McCain-Feingold it will be illegal--illegal--for a labor union to use the dues of its members or nonmembers--members or nonmembers--to make a soft money contribution to political parties. 
So what is the problem if the dues can't be used for soft money, I say to my colleagues, whether union member or nonunion member? Where is the evil that we are not correcting? 
Second, the McCain-Feingold bill provides that no organization, whether it is a labor union, a corporation or any other organization, can use unregulated soft money to fund those phony attack ads against candidates that are disguised as so-called issue ads. That is because of our concern that if we only ban soft money, all the money will flow into phony issue ads and you will end up with the same situation. That is a very significant restriction on the way in which unions participated in the last election, probably even more significant in terms of dollars than the soft money restrictions. 
Again, it would be illegal, Mr. President, illegal under McCain-Feingold for a union to use the dues of its members or nonmembers, either one, to run those political ads attacking or supporting candidates that are not raised using hard money and properly disclosed during the 60-day period. 
Mr. President, the third provision in this bill is one that is actually aimed only at labor unions. The other two really take care of the problem. The issue of phony issue ads and soft money are the big-ticket items with regard to union or corporate spending, but the third provision is aimed directly only at labor unions. Mr. President, it does exactly what the folks on the other side of the aisle have been calling for for years. It codifies the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in the Beck decision. 
This provision requires unions to notify nonunion members that those individuals are entitled to have their agency fees reduced by the amount the union spends on political activities. Mr. President, as you can see, the unions have every right to participate in our political system, and are taking a number of hits already under this bill. Our point is they should not be singled out as the only ones to be limited in this regard. Unfortunately, that is not enough for the sponsors of this proposal. I fear they want to cut unions out of our political process completely. 
Some Senators have said they do not believe anyone in America should have to contribute involuntarily, Mr. President, to any political campaign. But what would happen if you applied that principle to corporations and other organizations, as well? Say I am living in Eau Claire, WI, and I own several shares of stock in AT&T. I assume that money I have invested in that corporation was being used to grow that company and improve its market share. That is what I would hope the company would do to protect my dollar, to do their fiduciary duty to their stockholders. Would I be surprised to learn my money is being used to finance a $500,000 soft money contribution to a national political party? Sure I would. Would I be informed of that 
contribution? Would AT&T have to get my permission before they use my money for that purpose under the Lott amendment? Absolutely not. Unions have to do it but AT&T doesn't have to do it. So much for fairness under this amendment. 
Another telling indicator of the true purpose of this proposal, I am afraid, is the timing. If these union activities are such an affront to our democratic system, I want to repeat, why wasn't S. 9, a bill introduced on the first week of our Congress, brought to the floor before this point? The senior Senator from Oklahoma introduced this bill on this matter on the very first day of the session back in January. It was one of the highest priorities of the Republican leadership. Why hasn't it been marked up, even in committee? The answer is clear. It is serving a different function. Its function here is to fill up the tree, as we say, and prevent other amendments and perhaps to kill the bill. Mr. President, I am afraid this is not about the role of labor unions. It is too much about partisanship. 
The majority leader stated a week ago Friday his intention was to create a situation where the Democrats would be forced to filibuster campaign finance reform. Those on the other side know that the passage of this amendment will trigger such opposition. I am disappointed that some have concluded that the purpose of this debate should be to see which party can get the other one to kill campaign finance reform. The Senator from Arizona and I have been working hard on ensuring that this proposal is fair to both parties. We have made compromises. We have attempted to craft a bill that would give both parties credit, together, for passing campaign finance reform. 
Make no mistake, whether it was truly intended to do this or not, the proposal before the Senate today in the form of the Lott amendment would kill campaign finance reform. The vote on this proposal would be the vote to determine if we pass meaningful campaign finance reform this year or not. We know the vote will be close. We know it will come down to one or two Senators. So I hope, regardless of every Senator's personal feelings about how much we should do with regard to unions specifically, my colleagues will recognize this is not a vote about restricting labor unions but a vote to kill campaign finance reform. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to 
say what a Senator of courage the Senator from Maine is. This is a very difficult issue. The Senator from Maine, of course, is a loyal Republican, but for her to come out here and have the courage to stand up and join with us to say that this amendment would kill our bill is extremely important. 
I have heard her admonition as well that this must continue to be bipartisan. But the fact that she would come out here at this key moment and say that she will stand with a bipartisan effort, as she has done in the past, is not a minor matter. It is the same thing the Senator from Maine did a few months ago when everyone kept saying, `You don't have any cosponsors; you only have two Republican cosponsors.' It was the Senator from Maine who actually had some ideas that were better than our ideas, and we added them to the bill and improved it. 
Let me add both my personal and professional gratitude for the commitment of the Senator from Maine to reform. We in Wisconsin like to think that we are the greatest reform State, but Maine sure gives us a challenge.

<TEXT>
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in our debate today we have talked about a number of things. Again, you might think from the discussion that there was only one provision of our bill, the McCain-Feingold bill, and that provision had to do with the issue of express advocacy. 
Of course, that is a very important aspect of the bill. Not only are we confident of the constitutionality of those provisions, but we know it is one of the very important issues that has to be resolved if we are going to deal with the problem of big money in politics. 
If you listen to the opponents of this bill you can swear that is all McCain-Feingold is. But there are 25 other provisions that our opponents choose to ignore, because not only are they essentially noncontroversial provisions, they are the very provisions that, for example, the Senator from Montana was just talking about. 
A number of Senators today said on the floor, why don't we do full disclosure? What I want to say to my colleagues, Mr. President, if you kill the McCain-Feingold bill, you will be eliminating a number of very key new provisions that will provide exactly the full disclosure that Members of the other side have been calling for. In other words, our bill does disclosure and more. So, why all this talk about why don't we do full disclosure of campaign contributions? 
The bill greatly enhances disclosure. Instead of simply saying that contributions over $200 per person be reported, the McCain-Feingold bill as modified requires all contributions over $50 to be reported. The McCain-Feingold bill provides the most immediate disclosure possible by requiring that candidates file electronically with the FEC. It is no longer sufficient to just file a big stack of papers every 6 months and make people go through them. This will require computer reporting and immediate public access to this information on a daily or weekly basis so the connection between contributions and votes can be plainly seen. That is real disclosure. I can't imagine 
a fuller disclosure than that, unless we went to absolute zero which I would be happy to do in terms of contributions. 
The bill also requires--you don't hear about this from the other side; they want to pretend somehow the bill is just about issue ads--the bill requires groups and parties running independent expenditures against candidates to disclose these expenditures to the FEC. 
So, more information, more disclosure, more transparency, with regard to independent expenditures. The bill requires that the Federal Elections Commission make campaign finance records available on the Internet within 24 hours of filing. The bill requires the campaign to collect and disclose all required contributor information. Right now, under the current law you can do something apparently that is called making your best effort to figure out who is the person that made the contribution and what their profession is. Our bill, the McCain-Feingold bill, requires all such information be obtained upfront. 
The bill also bars campaigns from depositing campaign contributions over $200 into their campaign accounts until that information has been disclosed. This is the disclosure that Senator after Senator who is against our bill has called for. What they have never mentioned is that it is in the bill. If you kill McCain-Feingold, you are killing all of these disclosure provisions. 
And there is another one that my constituents in Wisconsin have called for, and that is to simply require political advertisements to carry a disclaimer identifying who is responsible for the content of a campaign ad. Time and again, I have heard my constituents say they are sick and tired of all the negative campaigning, and they find it particularly irritating that the people who run the ads aren't even required to say who they are, who is doing the ad. This is disclosure. This is what it is all about when it comes to letting the American people have the information they need and deserve to evaluate what is happening with money in politics. 
Yet if you listen to the debate by our colleagues on the other side of this issue, you could swear there is no disclosure. I have not heard a single idea regarding disclosure that goes beyond this. This is full disclosure, Mr. President. Kill McCain-Feingold, you kill these disclosure provisions. 
The same thing goes for stronger provisions with regard to enforcing our laws. All afternoon, Senators came to the floor and said `We don't need new laws. We need to enforce our current laws.' I happen to agree that we should more carefully and clearly enforce our current laws. I don't think that does it by itself, but what it does do is indicate a seriousness about any violations that have occurred. I agree. But it has become clear in the middle of the scandals and the allegations that some of the provisions in our statutes need some shoring up so that enforcement can improve. 
What do we do about enforcement? What does McCain-Feingold do about enforcement of the law that would be eliminated if the filibuster succeeds? If McCain-Feingold is defeated, not only would our efforts to deal with phony issue ads and that are really express advocacy ads be defeated but all of these strengthening provisions would also go down. One provision prohibits foreign nationals from making any sort of contribution or donation to candidates or parties. After all the talk on both sides of the aisle about foreign contributions distorting our political process--a concern which I share--do we want to kill campaign finance reform, and with it eliminate a provision that would prohibit foreign nationals from making any sort of contribution or donation to candidates or parties? We need to strengthen that law. The filibuster would kill it. 
Mr. President, this bill some would like to kill strengthens current law, making it absolutely clear that it is unlawful to raise or solicit campaign contributions from Federal property, 
including the White House and the U.S. Congress. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of talk by Senators today about the need to deal with that problem. This bill makes sure there are no excuses for those who would pretend whether they are in the White House or in an office of a Congressman or Senator, that somehow there is a way to get around it and actually raise money from your office. Our bill takes care of that. Killing it destroys it. 
The bill increases the penalty for knowingly and willfully violating Federal election law. The bill permits the Federal Election Commission, for the first time, to conduct random audits at the end of a campaign to ensure compliance with Federal election law. The bill bars Federal candidates from converting campaign funds for personal use such as for a mortgage payment or country club membership. Yes, it bars minors, those under 18, from contributing so that we don't have 3-year-olds giving $1,000 contributions anymore which is perfectly legal under current law. Those who would defeat and filibuster McCain-Feingold would wipe out all of these new enforcement provisions and leave nothing.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Senators on both sides have been very generous with the time today. I will try to keep it brief. Beyond the disclosure and enforcement, we also do something about the fact that we all know that incumbents have an advantage under the current system. Our system says that if people agreed to limit their personal spending to $50,000, they would be able to continue to receive help from their parties in the form of coordinated expenditures; otherwise, not. That could be a deterrent to an advantage for an incumbent or perhaps a very wealthy individual who is trying to obtain a Senate seat through spending a great deal of money. 
Our bill simply bans Members of Congress from sending out taxpayer-financed mass mailings under the franking privilege during the calendar year of their election. This is a major advantage that incumbents have over challengers. Again, if you wipe out the bill, you wipe out McCain-Feingold, you haven't just addressed the one or two matters the other side identified as a problem, you have wiped out these reforms as well. 
Finally, Mr. President, with regard to the issues of soft money and what I like to call `phony issue ads,' I have noticed that throughout this debate Senators on the other side have focused their attention primarily on trying to claim that our provisions with regard to express advocacy are somehow going to be struck down by the Supreme Court. Of course, in that regard, what I say is, in the worst-case scenario if our provisions are unconstitutional, the Supreme Court will strike it down and it won't go into play. But what I have noticed is that at the same time that this constitutional argument has been advanced we hear virtually nothing anymore about the fact that our bill bans soft money. 
Where has the argument gone that banning soft money is unconstitutional? It appears to be gone. There is no challenge to our claim and our ability to demonstrate that 126 constitutional scholars believe this is not only constitutional but essential. 
With that, Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that there is a great deal to this bill that would be destroyed if we do not avoid this filibuster. In that regard, I want to say that I listened with great interest earlier to my colleague as he discussed the decision this morning of the Supreme Court to deny certiorari with regard to the FEC. The fact is, Mr. President, the claim of the Senator from Kentucky that the Supreme Court struck down some kind of decision is just not true. The Supreme Court simply chose not to take up that case, just as it chose in the past not to take up the ninth circuit case that makes almost the opposite decision. 
There is a conflict between the courts. The Supreme Court, at some point, may have to resolve this. Maybe they will have to resolve it when acting on the McCain-Feingold bill. But what is clear is it was neither striking down of a provision, nor was it a huge moment. It was nothing but the Supreme Court saying we are not going to take this up right now. I recognize the pressure that is behind the effort to kill this bill. I recognize the temptation to try to make something of a decision that is simply not there. But to suggest that this is a major decision or a precedent that has something to do with what the law of the land is is simply not true. The Court didn't even offer an opinion. They just said: we are not going to take up this first circuit case. 
Mr. President, I listened with great interest earlier today to my colleague as he discussed the decision this morning, of the Supreme Court to deny cert--without opinion--in the case of Maine Right to Life versus the FEC. 
I think it is essential to put this silent decision into its proper perspective, lest it be given weight it simply does not deserve. 
Mr. President, there are any number of reasons, ranging from the facts of the case to the simple fact that they can only hear so many cases in a given year, which might lead to the Supreme Court denying certiorari in any case. 
The Supreme Court's unwillingness to consider the appeal of this case is no more dispositive on the issue of express advocacy than was a similar decision to deny cert some 10 years ago in FEC versus Furgatch. 
In Furgatch, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that context is relevant to determining what constitutes express advocacy. In Furgatch, the court found that there was no doubt that the ad in question asked people to vote against President Jimmy Carter. 
The court also gave weight to the timing of the ad, noting that it occurred within 1 week of the election. Further, they were not issues based, but attacked the candidate directly--for personal qualities. 
On October 5, 1987, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a petition for cert filed by Mr. Furgatch. 
Mr. President, today we have heard that a similar decision of the Supreme Court--without comment, leaving in place a first circuit decision that held the FEC's regulations regarding voting records and voting guides were invalid, should be construed as to signal the end of the debate on campaign finance reform. 
Now we can debate the merits of the Maine case and the Furgatch case and we may or may not reach a mutual opinion of what those cases mean. However, what is not in dispute--in regard to either case--is that the silent decision of the Court is not necessarily a substantive affirmation of the lower courts. 
Such a conclusion is simply not appropriate. There may be any number of reasons--the exact reason we will likely never know--why the Supreme Court passed upon the Furgatch case and on the Maine case this morning. 
If we start inferring substantive approval to every lower court case the Supreme Court refuses to hear, we will be left with a patchwork of rulings and laws which defy any thread of continuity or precedential value. 
Mr. President, before we impute too much importance to the denial of cert this morning in order to avoid comprehensive reform, I think we in this body should take a long hard look at our role in this process. 
We have an opportunity to address the very issues of Furgatch and Maine Right to Life and rather than hide behind the silence of the Supreme Court we should accept our responsibility and do just that. My colleague, from Kentucky argues that McCain-Feingold is unconstitutional despite the fact that legal scholars find otherwise. 
The rejection of cert today means that the decision of the first circuit remains in effect in that circuit, just as Furgatch remains controlling in the ninth. 
The two are in conflict and yet, the Supreme Court has elected to pass on both. If the decision today, as my colleague from Kentucky argues, means they support the first circuit, what does that mean in the ninth circuit--that it is no longer good law? 
Of course that is not what it means. What it means is that we have a conflict which will remain unresolved unless either the Supreme Court moves to resolve the conflict, or we, the legislative body make the law clear. 
We have no control over the Supreme Court--although I would note that many in the Congress have been attempting to exert some control over the courts in the past months--but we do have, in this body, an opportunity to resolve this impasse ourselves. 
This issue before this body remains the same as it has from the outset--will we reform the campaign finance system of this Nation. Nothing the Supreme Court said--or didn't say--this morning changes that fundamental fact. 
We should debate the constitutionality of this legislation and I welcome that debate. We should not, however, hide behind the silence of the Supreme Court as an affirmation of either position in this debate. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. It has been an interesting debate. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from New Mexico. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I just want to go over a couple of points relating to the Brennan Center for Justice letter of September 22. 
First of all, the Senator from Kentucky made a statement a few days prior to the release of that letter on national television. He said something to the effect as follows: Russ does not have one single constitutional scholar who supports his position. So I can understand the Senator from Kentucky being a little tender about a letter signed by 126 constitutional scholars that says exactly what it says. 
I would first like to ask the Senator from Kentucky if he ever heard any of us, either at the news conference or otherwise, purport that that letter included references to the issue of issue advocacy versus express advocacy?

Mr. FEINGOLD. That is right, Mr. President, because this is nothing but a red herring. The Senator from Kentucky does not like what the letter says, so he is trying to pretend that we actually said it said something else, and then get me to say it did not say that. 
Let me ask the Senator from Kentucky whether he, in reviewing the letter, recognizes that there are two main points to the letter, one is the view of these 126 scholars that a ban on soft 
money is constitutional; and, second, that a system that would provide voluntary incentives to candidates who agree to some limits on their spending would also be constitutional? 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-feingold-wi-6-19970929</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. FEINGOLD. Of course the Senator from Kentucky is correct. The very reason we would have asked for such a letter to be signed by 126 constitutional scholars is that for years the Senator from Kentucky has said that it is unconstitutional to ban soft money, even though the Senator from Kentucky proposed a bill in the 103d Congress that would ban soft money himself. He has stood on the floor of the Senate repeatedly, year after year, and said that a system that would provide an incentive to a candidate to limit his or her spending is unconstitutional because, in his words, `It would put a gun to the head of a candidate, in effect forcing him or her to do so.' 
So watch the shifting constitutional argument. First, the Senator from Kentucky focused his debate last year against our bill on the PAC ban, which is no longer in the bill. Then he focused on the soft money ban. Then he focused on the issue of whether or not voluntary incentives could be given. In each case, the Senator from Kentucky concluded emphatically, on the floor and off the floor, that it is plainly unconstitutional. He does not have a leg to stand on anymore; 126 constitutional scholars have said to him: Wrong, wrong, and wrong. 
So now he is moving to another discussion. Now he is going to put up another figleaf in front of this obvious attempt to keep the current system in the form of a----

Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me respond to that in a slightly different way. Another point I wanted to clear up in response to that question, the Senator from Kentucky is suggesting that there are no spending limits in our base bill. That is incorrect. Our bill, the modification that was just offered, does provide that a candidate who wants to get the coordinated party expenditure benefit from their party has to limit their personal wealth contribution to no more than $50,000. 
So the fact is that provision, which these 126 constitutional scholars have suggested is perfectly constitutional, is in our base bill. The Senator is, of course, correct, that we do intend to add--in fairness to his comment--we do intend to add an amendment that would go further, that would, in fact, bring back some of the other proposed voluntary limits that would then be coupled with what we hope would be an incentive for reduced cost for television time. We hope to add that to the bill, but the concept is already in the base bill.

I believe that under the Buckley versus Valeo decision--which the Senator knows I accept because I oppose a constitutional amendment that would require mandatory spending limits--I believe that under that decision, it is permissible and appropriate to offer voluntary spending limits, and that is the kind of spending limit that I would support. I would not support a constitutional amendment, for example, to require mandatory spending limits.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I don't believe it is my language that there is such a thing as too much money. It is all in context, and the context is this: If somebody chooses, as they may under their constitutional right, to spend as much as they want, I believe we should establish a system whereby a person who is challenging that person has a chance to at least get their message out. 
So I don't have any theoretical limit that I believe in. If Michael Huffington wants to spend $30 million in California, that's his right, but it is my belief that we ought to provide some kind of incentive to those who would voluntarily limit their spending so they could have a fair chance to get their message out. 
I don't accept the premise of the Senator's question, that I believe there is some sort of a magical number. What I want is some kind of fairness in the system, some kind of leveling the playing field so not just multimillionaires would get to participate.

Mr. FEINGOLD. I will be happy to respond to that question. First of all, of course, this provision is not what is before us at this point. Nevertheless, I do believe in the system of overall voluntary spending limits, and the real driving force behind that is a concern about television costs. Any modifications or changes in the formula that had to do with a State-by-State difference without a doubt had something to do with the question of what does it cost to run a television campaign in a U.S. Senate race. 
I find it slightly amusing that the Senators question me about language that my colleague from Arizona used about limiting spending in campaigns, when the Senator from Kentucky, in S. 7, 103d Congress, had a bill entitled `To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to reduce special interest influence on elections, to increase competition in politics, to reduce campaign costs, and for other purposes.' 
The point is, actually all three of us agree that you should not mandatorily limit campaign spending.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Of course, it is my hope they would accept them, but only voluntarily, so that not a single person in this country is forced to give up their free speech rights. That is not a part of our bill. The whole premise of reducing the amount of money in politics is not to deny anyone their rights, but, in appropriate cases, to encourage people to limit their spending so we can have fair races, so we don't have a scenario like the one that we have now where a Senate race, on average, costs $4.5 million or $10 million or $15 million. 
I would be curious if either the Senator from Utah or the Senator from Kentucky believe there is any amount of money that is inappropriate in terms of a U.S. Senate race?

Mr. FEINGOLD. One other question, a point I am trying to make for the Record is I agree with the Senator from Kentucky that should we pass this legislation, this, of course, will go to the Supreme Court. I think it is very important that we acknowledge as we make this Record that they will review it, and that they will want to know exactly what our intentions were with regard to this legislation. 
I want to ask a question in terms of making this Record, following on the question of the Senator from Arizona. I will read the Senator from Kentucky an advertisement that supposedly was an issue advocacy ad, apparently legally treated that way, and ask him if he believes this is properly characterized as issue advocacy rather than express advocacy or campaign ad. 
The ad concerned a Winston Bryant. The announcement said, `Senate candidate Winston Bryant's budget as attorney general increased 71 percent. Bryant has taken taxpayer-funded junkets to the Virgin Islands, Alaska, and Arizona, and spent about $100,000 on new furniture. Unfortunately, as the State's top law enforcement official, he has never opposed the parole of any convicted criminal, even rapists and murderers; and almost 4,000 Arkansas prisoners have been sent back to prison for crimes 
committed while they were out on parole. Winston Bryant: government waste, political junkets, soft on crime. Call Winston Bryant and tell him to give the money back. 
Does the Senator from Kentucky consider that to be an issue ad within the Supreme Court definition, or does he think it is possible--possible--that the U.S. Supreme Court just might find that to be a campaign ad?

Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his candid answers and say I have great confidence in the U.S. Supreme Court. They are perfectly capable of handling this provision. Our job is to pass a law so they can take it up and they can strike it down if they don't like it. That is the approach we take here when there is a good-faith disagreement about a constitutional provision. Surely there are good-faith arguments on both sides, and the right body to resolve it is the Supreme Court.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me first thank my friend, the Senator from Georgia, for his kind remarks, but more importantly for his steadfast support on the issue of campaign finance reform. 
The first thing that the Senator from Georgia did when he became a Member of this distinguished body was to cosponsor our legislation. But he didn't stop there. He has been out here every single time we have had to fight the battle. And I know he will be again. I thank very much the Senator from Georgia for his support. 
I also want to thank my colleagues, Senators Levin, Lieberman, Dorgan, Collins, and, of course, Senator McCain for taking the time on what is usually a quiet Monday to have a very intense debate to continue this discussion on campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, one of the most important tactics that has been used already in this debate is to single out a couple of provisions of the McCain-Feingold modification and to suggest that they are the entire bill. It happens that the provisions that have been discussed--the issues having to do with express advocacy, and a couple of others--are very important provisions, but you would swear that they were the whole bill. That is because it is virtually impossible to criticize or attack the rest of the bill. Let us remember what is included in the entirety of the McCain-Feingold modification--the bill that we introduced today. 
First of all, it completely bans soft money. We have heard virtually nothing on the floor effectively criticizing banning these $100,000, $200,000, and $500,000 contributions that have clearly undermined our political process and made a mockery of the fact that for almost a century corporations have not been allowed to give contributions to campaigns directly, and for almost half a century labor unions have not been allowed to give contributions directly to campaigns. Our bill bans that, and the other side apparently has dropped their concern about that. 
There is also virtually no discussion of the fact that our bill strongly improves the provisions having to do with disclosure of information about campaign contributions; and strengthens the hand of the Federal Elections Commission so it can do its job; so we can enforce the current laws--the very argument that we have heard the majority leader and the Senator from Kentucky make. `Why don't we enforce the current law?' 
Why no comment about the series of important provisions in our bill that do exactly that, that improve disclosure and improve enforcement? 
Why no comment on the lowering of contribution limits from $200 to $50? If somebody gives $100 to a candidate, we think this ought to be reported. 
Why no comment on the fact that our bill strengthens the hand of the Federal Election Commission by tripling the penalty for knowing, willful violations of Federal election law? This is exactly the kind of provision that the other side claims we should have and yet fails to mention it is part of the bill. 
Why no mention of the fact that our bill does provide for electronic filing with the FEC on a daily basis of campaign contributions so that the public does not have to wait and the media do not have to wait for 6 months to find out whether a contribution occurred in close proximity to a vote? Our bill provides for that. Our bill provides that the FEC would make campaign finance records available on the Internet within 24 hours of their filing. 
The bill also strengthens the hand of the Federal Election Commission by permitting the FEC to conduct random audits at the end of a campaign to ensure compliance with Federal election law. We are strengthening the hand of enforcement under the current law. 
Why no discussion at all of the fact that our bill, in addition to the other issues, makes it absolutely clear that campaign contributions cannot be used for personal purposes? You cannot buy a new suit with campaign contributions. You cannot finance various family activities or mortgage payments or country club memberships. Some of this has been done in the past. Why no comment on the fact that our bill tightens up on that? 
Why no reference to the fact that the McCain-Feingold bill requires political advertisements to carry a disclaimer that clearly identifies who is responsible for the content of the campaign ad? 
Do you know what really irritates my constituents in Wisconsin? It is all those negative ads and the fact that the candidates who put them out make sure that they are not identified, that people do not know who made the ad? The McCain-Feingold bill says if you want to say it, you can say it, but how about letting us know you are saying it. The other side completely ignores this provision that I think would be of great appeal to many members of the public. 
Why doesn't the other side say anything about the fact that the McCain-Feingold bill bans the practice of using mass mailings under the franking privilege in an election year? We get rid of that. We get rid of that incumbent protection provision in current law that allows Senators to send out thousands, tens of thousands, of items at public expense, at Government expense when they are running for reelection. We get rid of that. I happen to not do these mailings anyway. A number of Senators do not do them anyway. But we get rid of that in an election year. But no comment whatsoever from the other side. 
Our bill also clarifies, which is long overdue, that it should be absolutely unlawful to raise any money or solicit any money on Federal property, whether it be in the White House or whether it be in the Capitol or whether it be in one of these Senate or House office buildings. We do know that even Members of Congress have already said that they have done that. This bill makes it clear that there are no excuses for doing that in the future. 
No reference from the other side except for a brief one to the fact that we do begin in this bill to voluntarily provide an incentive to candidates to limit their spending. Our bill, as we introduced it today as a modification to the underlying bill, says that if you contribute over $50,000 of your own personal money to a campaign, you can do that, but you shouldn't be able to get the large party-coordinated expenditures to assist you. We do that. 
We have provisions relating to clarifying contributions regarding money contributions from foreign nationals. 
All of this is in the bill. They are very good provisions. But yet, in an effort to distort what this bill is about, the focus has been on only one or two provisions rather than the heart of the bill. 
Mr. President, I should like to summarize the debate today by pointing out that all of this emphasis on a couple of items in the bill to the exclusion of the rest of the bill is merely a prelude to the three principal arguments that our opposition has raised thus far as we have debated the issue on Friday and today. 
The first argument has been the primary argument in the past, but it is flagging. The argument that our bill will be deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court just is not having the same luck it has had in the past. 
The senior Senator from Kentucky recently said on one of the national news shows with reference to me, he said:  
Russ has got no constitutional experts with any credentials who will say that this is going to be upheld in court. 
That was on Fox News Sunday, September 14, 1997. Not one constitutional expert, the Senator from Kentucky said, would support our view that the basic provisions of the bill are constitutional. 
That was an unfortunate claim because 1 week later we were able to release a letter signed by 126 constitutional experts across this country representing 88 different institutions, including those in Kentucky, saying just the opposite--126 constitutional scholars specifically said that the ban on soft money and those provisions that relate to providing voluntary incentives to candidates to limit their spending are perfectly constitutional within the ruling of the Supreme Court 20 years ago in Buckley versus Valeo. 
It is hard to read this chart because there are so many of them, because 126 of the leading constitutional experts in this country say that this constitutional argument is wrong. In fact, the constitutional argument is nothing but a smokescreen because it has been shifting from month to month. First, it was the claim that the PAC ban was unconstitutional, even though the Senator from Kentucky knew very well that we had a backup provision because of that concern which he himself had introduced in the past. The Senator from Kentucky had proposed the very provision that he said was unconstitutional. So then he shifted to saying that banning soft money was unconstitutional. 
Well, that is not working out very well after 126 constitutional scholars say just the opposite. There is no credible argument under current law that banning that kind of contribution is unconstitutional. There simply is no credible authority who believes that. 
So the Senator from Kentucky shifts again. He says that providing voluntary incentives to candidates to limit their spending is unconstitutional. But that is the very thing that Buckley versus Valeo laid out as a mechanism by which you could limit spending voluntarily. 
So now the Senator from Kentucky seems to have dropped all of these constitutional arguments and all he has left now is to try to say that our attempt to clarify the meaning of express advocacy is unconstitutional. Well, he is wrong about that, too. But as he admitted in the Chamber today--and this is critical--in the worst-case scenario, in the very worst-case scenario, if he is right and we are wrong, the Supreme Court will simply strike that provision down. 
Our bill is severable. What does that mean? It means that if the Supreme Court determines a provision is unconstitutional, they can sever that provision, leaving the rest of the bill intact. That's exactly what the Court did in the landmark case of Buckley versus Valeo, where the Court said you can't have mandatory spending limits, and it severed that from the bill, but the Court did say you could have contribution limits, which is what we have had for 20 years. This is where PAC's are limited to $10,000 per campaign, where individuals are limited to $1,000 per individual. So the fact is that these constitutional arguments, if they are right, in the worst-case scenario, will simply be dealt with by the Supreme Court doing their job. Now, why can't we do our job and let the Supreme Court do their job? 
Where was the concern of the Senator from Kentucky about this when he voted for the Communications Decency Act, saying that it violated the first amendment? And the Supreme Court voted 9 to nothing: No, you can't do that. It was taken care of, it was struck down. It is not a law. So, this is a smokescreen. Mr. President, 126 constitutional scholars have already said that the basic provisions of our bill are constitutional. 
So, the constitutional argument is flagging. So the opponents of reform, who I think sometimes can also be known as the filibusterers, go to a second tactic, that is killing the bill by trying to force a filibuster. Today, not surprisingly--the majority leader had his choice of any amendment he could offer. That is his right. He could offer a substitute amendment, a whole new bill, he could offer a simple amendment having to do with certain kinds of contributions or aspects of soft money or FEC enforcement--he could choose any amendment he wanted. What did the majority leader choose? And what did he use to fill up the tree? He used a provision specifically and harshly directed at labor unions. The majority leader, and I do appreciate his letting us have this bill come to the floor, came out here and said that that choice, to be the first item we debate, was not intended as a poison pill. 
What does that mean? What it means is, he is saying he didn't pick that amendment as a way to cause a filibuster. But this does not square with what the majority leader said last Friday. He was quoted in the Wall Street Journal, saying `I set it up so they will be filibustering me.' That is what I am talking about. He had his choice. He came out here, he purposely offered a strong antilabor amendment, he set it up in the hope that he would force Members on the other side of the aisle to filibuster the bill so that he and his colleagues would not be blamed for killing it. How can you say that's not a poison pill, if your very statement was that you set it up so the other side would filibuster? That is the definition of a poison pill. Let no one mistake this. This is an intentional effort to kill campaign finance reform. 
Why, if this concern about this issue was so great, was it not brought up earlier? This is S. 9, that he has brought up. It is a bill I believe offered by the Senator from Oklahoma. Why was this not brought out to the floor earlier? Why is this the item that we lead with, if it is not intended to destroy campaign finance reform and make sure somebody else gets blamed for it? It is a poison pill. It's a more dangerous attack than the flimsy constitutional arguments. It does run the risk--it does run the risk of destroying the bill, and everyone should know that when we vote on the poison pill antilabor amendment, that is exactly what it does. 
Most of the time that has been taken up on the floor of the Senate by those who seek to kill this legislation has been devoted to a third attempt. That third attempt is to make the public believe that this bill somehow creates a giant Government bureaucracy that is going to regulate their speech. If I could just show a copy of the bill--the problem with that is, in the past, when folks have tried to argue that a bill is a huge Government bureaucracy bill, they hold up the bill. They hold up the President's budget: 2,000 pages. They hold up the health care bill and they weigh it on a scale. But this is not going to work with the McCain-Feingold bill. It is only 55 pages. It is pretty hard, the way lawyers write, to set up a giant Government bureaucracy in 55 pages. 
But that is what they want folks to believe. They want folks to believe that somehow we are creating a new world of campaign financing that will change the way things are done in this country and will change the ability of members of the public to speak their mind in an election. I think it is just the opposite. I think what the current system is, I think the status quo, that the Senator from Kentucky defends so vigorously, is so at variance with the system that I grew up to believe in that it is shocking. I think we have come so far from the notion of one person one vote; so far from the notion that every child born in this country could grow up to serve in the House or serve in the Senate, or perhaps even be President, that it is an embarrassment. 
Look at what Mr. Tamraz said recently about this system and how he apparently gamed it. He said, before the Governmental Affairs Committee on September 18, 1997, in response to a question--the question was a very direct question:  
Was one of the reasons that you made these contributions because you believed it might get you access? That's my question. 
Mr. Tamraz' response was very straightforward. He said: 
Senator, I'm going even further. It's the only reason--to get access, but what I'm saying is once you have access, what do you do with it? Is it something bad or something good. That's what we have to see. 
When I heard that comment from Mr. Tamraz I just couldn't help but think how far we had come from the America that I was brought up to believe in. Maybe I was naive, growing up back in Janesville, WI, but I really believed it when my parents told me 
that, `You may not be the richest kid in town, you may not be the most powerful person in the town or in the State or in the country. But every American has the same vote. Your vote counts the same as a Rockefeller's.' That was the name we used in those days. 
So, when you look at the story of what has happened in the last 30 years, I can't help but reflect that when I was 7 years old and John F. Kennedy was running for President, the way that we would sort of observe a Presidential campaign was not just through the television. There were a few television sets. You could go out to the Sauk County 4-H fair. There was a little Democratic booth. Just a few feet away was a little Republican booth. And there was a little ribbing going back and forth. You know, those booths have not moved an inch in 37 years. They are in the exact same place they always were. That is where the campaign was, people talking to each other. 
Nobody said anything about raising money. I'm sure they had to fund their campaigns, but that was not what the news stories were about. I'm sure the Senator from Utah, who is on the floor, would agree with me, that that was not the nature of the discussion, who had the most money to win an election in those days. Then, as I got into my teen years, the civil rights movement came upon us, the Vietnam war, the beginning of the environmental movement, the women's movement--so many political movements; on the other side of the political spectrum, the great concern that arose about law and order in this country. These were the great discussions of our time, as well as others. 
I recall some kind of conversation about Howard Hughes giving some money to both Presidential candidates, but it was sort of an odd story, an esoteric story. `What is going on? Why would this rich fellow, a recluse, give all this money to Presidential campaigns?' It was not the stuff of public life. It was not the news, who was giving what money to what political party. In fact, the gentleman who used to hold this seat before I did, a couple of Senators back, my friend Gaylord Nelson, told me recently that in his distinguished career in Wisconsin politics as a Member of this body for 18 years, he never once made a phone call to raise money. He never once picked up the phone and said: Hey, I'm running for reelection, can you give me some money? 
I suggest that those were the good old days. What the Senator from Kentucky is trying to defend is a new world, where not only are Senators expected to make phone calls almost every day to raise money for their campaigns, but where Senators and others are encouraged to call up people and ask them for $100,000. This is not the system that I grew up with. This is not the system that led the late Robert Kennedy to refer to politics as an honorable profession. 
Then, in high school, the people used to rib me a little bit. I guess I was a little bit too open about my desire to go into politics. Some of them would say, because I talked so much I would be a good politician, and other comments like that. But the one thing they never said to me was, `Russ, if you want to go into politics you have to go out and make $10 million first; that there is an opening ante, there is an opening fee, that you must be a millionaire.' That we are, in effect, recreating here in Washington the House of Lords, which we freed ourselves from over 200 years ago. Nobody ever said that to me. 
Politics was still church dinners and Rotary clubs and the State fair and all those things that one may regard as corny. But the fact is, it was a pretty good system. This is a lousy system; a system where somebody pays $300,000 to get in a room to be with his competitor who has paid $300,000, a room that none of us could ever get in. That is a lousy system. 
I was still under the perhaps naive belief, in 1982 when I sought election to the State senate in Wisconsin, my first race for public office--I was under the illusion that money wasn't important. Thanks to the good laws of the State of Wisconsin it wasn't terribly important. 
I had no money, but the State law provided that if I could raise $17,000, the State would match it with $17,000 if I agreed to a $34,000 limit and that that would be a reasonable amount for a campaign voluntarily. That's what I did. 
I wrote to every relative I had. I wrote to a few former professors and teachers of mine. They all sent in a few dollars. We had $17,000 by August, and we went out and campaigned. I went to the Sauk County Fair, walked in parades, and had some very civil and nice debates with my opponent. 
I do remember a brief moment, though, at the end of that campaign when one of the senior Democratic officials in the State called me up and said, `Russ, you're going to lose if you don't borrow $10,000 for the last few days.' 
I said, `I can't do that. I'm just not going to do that to my family.' 
He was almost right, because I only won that election by 31 votes out of 47,000. It was the closest election in the history of the Wisconsin State Senate. But the fact is, it was reasonable--$35,000. It was something I could at least think about as a person of average means. 
Now the same races in that same district, just 15 years later, cost something like $250,000, $300,000 just for a Wisconsin State Senate seat that pays somebody some $35,000 to $40,000. But yet I still believe, because I won by the slimmest of margins, that running for office was not equal to having a lot of money. 
I got a bit of a rude awakening, Mr. President, in 1987 when I started thinking about running for the U.S. Senate. I thought I had amassed a decent record over the years as a Wisconsin State Senator, and I wanted to run against the incumbent senator. But as I went around the State gradually for several years trying to build a grassroots organization, I wasn't asked what I had done in the State Senate; I wasn't asked what I had done before I was in the State Senate; I wasn't asked what my views might be. Almost every single encounter, whether with the media or with a potential supporter, was, `Russ, this is fine and good and you seem like a nice young fellow, but where are you going to get the money?' 
`Where are you going to get the money, Russ?' 
`How can you possibly think you have a right or an opportunity to run for the U.S. Senate unless you are independently wealthy or if you are well connected to Washington?' 
That was the message I was given over and over again. Anybody who knows the kind of race I went through--I had a lot of good fortune, obviously, because I am standing here--that was my biggest problem. I wasn't considered credible because I wasn't wealthy. That didn't feel to me like what my parents had told me. That didn't feel to me like the assurance that I would have a fair chance to compete with everyone else simply because I am an American citizen. It felt really bad. Maybe it made me work hard. Maybe it made me stay the course. 
It got particularly difficult when I would go to a group with whom I had a good relationship; for example, the independent bankers, a group with whom I have a very good relationship. I always admired their independence in Wisconsin. And I said to them, `Could you give me some support for my race?' 
They said, `Well, we think you have done a good job, but we have to check in with Washington.' There is a guy in Washington 
who makes this decision. 
Then when I checked in with some of my friends in the labor unions, whom I probably do support on many, many issues, I thought they would be able to decide at the local whether or not they would want to back me. But, no, they had to check in with Washington, with the Washington gatekeepers who want to kill this bill. That is what I learned about the system. 
Of course, partially because my two primary opponents were both very well-heeled and attacked each other that I wound up winning the primary. They used their money to make each other look pretty bad, and I wound up winning the primary because I was the other guy who was running. And that gave me momentum to win the final election. 
As I stand here with these colleagues I admire greatly, sometimes I wonder, am I the last person of average wealth and income who will ever serve in this body? Is the door going to slam on people who actually worry about making ends meet, people who actually worry about their mortgage payment, as I do? Am I the last person who is not a millionaire who will be invited to serve in this institution? 
I don't think that is the way it will end up, but I can tell you this, if we don't pass a reform like the one we have before us today, it will be. I cannot in good conscience look at a high school senior today, as I was in 1971, and say, `You know, it would be great if you pursued a political career; it will be wonderful; just learn the issues, work with people, show people that you are a natural leader.' I can't just leave it at that. If I am being honest with a young person, I would have to say, `And you better darn well come up with $10 million or nobody is going to take you seriously.' That hurts my image of America that I have to say that to a high school senior today. 
The opponents of this bill have absolutely no answer for those high school students. They say somehow that free speech in America means that they don't matter, it means that they can't participate, it means that they don't have the same right that everyone else does to run for an office in the House or Senate and have some kind of a belief that they can prevail. 
Each of us, I suppose, wants to tell our own story of how we got here, as I just did. It is a great honor to serve in this body. Less than 2,000 Americans have ever done so. I appreciated it when the majority leader the other day spoke to some of his concerns when he was running for office. This is the only issue where all the Members of the Senate are experts, because we have been through it and we know. 
But the reason I am involved with this bill is that the senior Senator from Arizona had the courage to come to me and say, `Look, we've got to do something to change this system, to put aside our partisan differences.' We just decided that we couldn't live with a country where a Presidential candidate would begin his campaign, make the high point of his announcement for President the following statement:  
I have the most reliable friend you can have in American politics and that is ready money. 
That was a leading comment in an announcement for President of the United States. I don't remember either John F. Kennedy or Richard Nixon leading their campaigns in 1960 with that comment, on anyone else. That is a tragic commentary on where we have come over the years. 
So that is what this really comes down to. You have heard the constitutional arguments and have seen them fall. You see 
already an attempt to bring a `poison pill' out on the floor to kill this bill by making it too harsh for either side to accept and destroy its bipartisan nature. You have heard the effort to distort what this bill really does by suggesting that somehow our bill will create a large governmental involvement in free speech. 
The fact is, it is this system that is destroying free speech. It is a system where people can give hundreds of thousands of dollars of unregulated money or give huge contributions or fundraisers of hard money to candidates that cut the average person out of the process. This is the corporate democracy that we have come to. 
So, in the coming days, we will hear more of the efforts of our opponents to take each little piece of the bill and indicate that there is a problem here or a problem there. Of course, that is the purpose of the debate. But we are ready, Senator McCain and I, to negotiate to solve some of the real problems. But what we will not tolerate is the suggestion that we should do nothing. Our opposition has no alternative. They have no answer to the careening role of money in American politics. They just want to kill this bill and get back to the business of running elections. 
Mr. President, there will be much more to say on this bill. 
All I can say is that we will not allow this debate to become mired in the minutia of important issues that ultimately would be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court. We will come back again and again to the central point that this is still a country of one person-one vote, not $1 million-1 million votes. And it is still a country where every high school student should at least be able to think or dream about participating in the process without having to become a multimillionaire first. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to begin by once again expressing my admiration and gratitude to the senior Senator from Arizona for his extraordinary leadership on the issue of campaign finance reform. This effort has already been a long and difficult one, but it is all about his courage and his exceptional commitment to the good of this country. He is in a more difficult situation than I am in as a member of the majority party. But the fact is he is one of the greatest Republicans of our time. And they are lucky to have him. 
Mr. President, I also want to thank Senator Lott, the majority leader, for helping us get this bill up to the floor. And I also appreciate the fact that he took some time this morning to say a little bit about how he got here; about what it was like for him to try to be elected to the U.S. Senate. 
I think those kinds of stories and accounts are going to be very important as this debate proceeds because we need to tell the American people just what is involved in running for the Congress these days. We need to tell them the truth about how many people are truly invited to participate in a process that is so awash in money that almost every American must feel like they are not invited to participate. 
I also want to, of course, especially thank my leader, Senator Daschle, not only for his powerful statement on behalf of our bill but also for his leadership in working diligently to make sure that all 45 members of the Senate Democratic caucus are in support of the McCain-Feingold bill; a bill that has been initiated by a member of the other party. That is a great tribute to him and to the cause of bipartisanship in favor of campaign finance reform. 
I also want to do something that may not be terribly popular out here as the debate goes on. I want to thank the President of the United States, because the fact is he has been diligent, consistent, and persistent in support of this particular piece of legislation. He has offered his personal help. He has offered the help of his staff. Before it is finished, before we claim our final victory on this issue, I am going to certainly repeat the fact that President Clinton has been fighting for reform. 
Mr. President, it was just over 2 years ago that the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Thompson, and I began this long, sometimes tortuous, journey on the path to campaign finance reform. In fact, it was September 1995 when we first introduced our bipartisan reform proposal, a proposal that is centered on the premise that it is imperative that we reduce the role and influence of money on our electoral system. 
For 2 years, though, Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona and I have been stymied by opponents of reform who desperately cling to the absurd notion that the more money you pour into the political system that our democracy somehow gets better. Sometimes the comparison is made that we spend as much money on elections as we spend on potato chips. I don't know what this has to do with the question of political reform but it is an argument we are treated to anyway. Of course, no one outside the Washington Beltway believes in that argument. No one outside of this town thinks we need more money spent on the political process. In fact, if you talk to any average American they will tell you they are just horrified by the amount of money that is spent on our electoral system. But they are tired of excessive spending. They are tired of the onslaught of negative attack ads all throughout a campaign season. And, yet, they are even more tired--they are sick and tired--of the ongoing revelations of abuse and wrongdoing related to elected officials and campaign fundraising. 
Nonetheless, our opponents, such as our colleague and our friend, the junior colleague from Kentucky, continue to argue that more campaign spending somehow strengthens democracy and expands citizen participation. Of course, I disagree with him on this point. And so do the facts. 
The facts say this: The 1996 election speaks for itself. In 1996, candidates and parties spent in excess of $2 billion. That was an all-time record amount of campaign spending. 
In a year where we spent more money on Federal elections than in any other year in our history, let's ask the question: Was democracy strengthened? Did we expand citizen participation? We all know the answer. Mr. President, we did not. Almost a year after the fact we are still feeling the fallout from the 1996 
elections. After months of hearings by the Governmental Affairs Committee, led by the Senator from Tennessee, it is clear that we had widespread abuse and wrongdoing on both sides of the aisle. We have had congressional investigations, a Justice Department investigation, an FBI investigation, and even a CIA investigation, all relating to the way we elected our representatives. 
That doesn't sound like the strengthening of democracy to me. 
As for participation, we had the lowest voter turnout in 72 years--a clear sign that the electorate was not exactly energized by all this campaign spending. We know the truth. They were turned off. 
Perhaps most disheartening, our campaign finance system just lacks any sense of fairness anymore. 
In 1996, incumbents outspent challengers by ratios of 2 to 1 and 3 to 1, and to no surprise. The reelection rate for Members of the House and Senate remained well above the 90 percent level. 
As the Senator from Arizona has said, the time for reform is right now. 
Over the course of the last several months, the Senator from Arizona and I have had two clear consistent messages. The first was that our preference was to work with the majority leader in scheduling debate on bipartisan reform legislation. Thankfully for the kind of cooperation that serves this body very well, we have achieved that. 
Of course, the majority leader has already begun the debate. He says we should not shift the subject. He wants to focus instead on the White House. But I think what we ought to focus on is the whole system. We ought to focus on the question of whether this system has anything to do with the principle that everybody's vote should cost the same. 
We are already hearing talk about filibusters--about ways to make sure the legislation does not pass. 
But I do want to say that I am very impressed with the way in which this bill came to the floor, and I am grateful. 
Our first choice always was the cooperative approach. 
Mr. President, our second message was one that the Senator from Arizona just made very plain once again. That is our willingness and continued willingness to make the changes that need to be made to do the right thing. 
We demonstrated this willingness to compromise when we worked with the junior Senator from Maine who suggested a number of changes to our bill that I think actually strengthen the bill. I think there may be amendments out on the floor by either party that can make the bill stronger, and a better reform bill. 
That is the spirit in which Senator McCain and I come to the floor. We know that this bill isn't perfect. It is not the ideal Feingold bill. It is not the ideal McCain bill. That is how we got together--by compromises and trying to come up with a reasonable passage. 
Prior to the August recess, the Senator from Arizona and I stood here on the Senate floor with some of our colleagues and expressed the hope that this debate would occur. We also said that if we were unsuccessful with that effort we would bring the legislation to the floor in September. 
Mr. President, for opponents of campaign finance reform, for those Washington interest groups--whom I like to refer to as `the Washington gatekeepers'--who joined with the Senator from Kentucky in opposing any changes to our current system, it is September. It is a Friday in September. And we hope for all of those who have declared this bill dead over and over again that today will be remembered for them as `Black Friday.' 
For the rest of the country, for the 90 percent of the Americans who believe we should be spending less on our elections, for the underfunded challengers who are consistently blown out of the water by well-entrenched incumbents, and for those who believe that the first amendment is a right belonging to all Americans, not just a commodity for the wealthy few, I hope this Friday will be remembered as the day we took the first step in providing with this 
reform proposal the first real opportunity to fundamentally change the nature of our political system. 
The base package of reforms the Senator from Arizona and I have pieced together represents a solid first step on the path to more comprehensive reform. 
As he has already highlighted, the package will ban so-called soft money. That means that the Washington soft money machine that has fostered the multihundred-thousand dollar contribution from corporations and labor unions and wealthy individuals will be shut down forever. The American people won't have to hear about outrageous levels of contributions that they couldn't even dream of giving even once in their lives. 
The base proposal also modifies the current statutory definition of `express advocacy.' It does not affect issue advocacy. It redefines in an appropriate manner `express advocacy' to provide a clear distinction between expenditures for communications used to advocate candidates and, on the other hand, those used to advocate issues. And that is all it does. 
It does not do, as the majority leader has suggested, ban billboards. Of course, it doesn't. It doesn't touch voter guides. We explicitly provide that voter guides are permitted. And it doesn't ban one single television or radio ad, ever. It simply does not do that. And we will repeat that statement as often as it needs to be repeated. 
Candidate-related expenditures will be subject to current Federal election laws and disclosure requirements. Of course they will. But that is all. 
No form of expression will be prohibited. 
That statement is simply inaccurate. 
The proposal will require greater disclosure of campaign contributions and expenditures, and provide the Federal Election Commission with the tools to better enforce our campaign finance laws. 
It includes a strict codification of what is known as the Supreme Court's Beck decision, thus requiring labor unions to notify nonunion members that they are entitled to request a reduction of the portion of their agency fees used for political purposes. Of course, I find it laughable that anyone could believe that the central problem in the campaign finance system is an issue of union dues. That is laughable on its face. 
What about corporations? What about all of the other special interest groups? Does anyone really believe that labor is the only problem? Nonetheless, we try to reasonably and appropriately address this issue rather than ignoring it. 
Finally, the base package includes a provision that for the first time encourages candidates to abide by some kind of a voluntary fundraising restriction. That is a significant step. 
As my colleagues know, the Supreme Court ruled in the decision in Buckley versus Valeo that it is fully consistent with the first amendment to offer candidates incentives to encourage them to voluntarily limit their campaign spending. 
In fact, the Buckley Court specifically upheld the Presidential system that we have today which offers public financing in exchange for candidates agreeing to voluntary spending limits. 
The Senator from Arizona and I have added a provision to this base package that tracks that concept. 
Under current law, Mr. President, political parties are permitted to make expenditures in coordination with the Senate candidate up to a certain limit. That limit is based on the size of each State. 
In California, for example, the parties are each permitted to spend about $2.8 million in coordination with the candidate. 
Our proposal provides that candidates who decide to pour a great deal of their own personal funds into a campaign would simply no longer be entitled to those party expenditures on their behalf. 
Specifically, if a candidate agrees to limit their personal spending to less than $50,000 per election, they will continue to 
receive help from their party committees. If they don't, they just won't receive that money. 
It is a basic concept. If you want to pour millions and millions of dollars of your personal money into a campaign to try to buy a Senate seat, you should be able to do so. 
We don't disagree with Buckley versus Valeo on that point. We don't disagree. We just do not think you should get some kind of a benefit, some kind of a privilege after you have done so. 
It is very important to recognize that distinction. 
That is what Buckley said, and that is what this proposal reflects. We should not reward such candidates. We should not give them the equal benefit with their opponent who is not a millionaire and who should be able to receive that. 
So, Mr. President, that is the outline of our base package. It is modest reform. It is a strong step in the right direction, and it provides us with the vehicle to move campaign finance reform forward. 
But there is another piece to our effort. The base package makes several important reforms. 
But the one thing it does not do enough of is doing something about the position of incumbents and challengers in financing their campaigns. We know what the problems are. Incumbents consistently blow away challengers who lack the resources to run their campaign. 
The flow of campaign cash through the corridors of Congress undermines public confidence and trust in this institution. Officeholders spend more time panhandling for campaign contributions sometimes than they do on the Nation's legislative business. 
That is why the Senator from Arizona and I are announcing our intention to offer a McCain-Feingold amendment to our own vehicle. Why? Because we want some accountability on this issue. We want to see that the Members of the U.S. Senate are prepared to stand up in the public spotlight and tell the American people whether they are willing or unwilling to change a system that is so clearly rigged in their own favor. 
Mr. President, that road is going to be a true test of reform. That will be one of the votes that tells us how serious the U.S. Senate is with fundamentally changing a political system that has spiraled out of control, and has led to so many charges of abuse and undue influence; and, yes, Mr. President, corruption. 
Our amendment will again build on what the Supreme Court said was permissible in the Buckley decision. The amendment offers an incentive to candidates to encourage them voluntarily to limit their fundraising. The incentive in this case is a half-priced discount on television time. And that, of course, would have more to do with reducing the cost of campaigns than anything else. 
Candidates who wish to receive the discounted television time would have to agree to three simple rules. First, they would have to agree to raise a majority of their campaign funds from people who live in their own State. That seems reasonable. Second, they must agree to raise no more than 25 percent of their total campaign contributions from political action committees. Finally, they have to agree again to spend no more than $50,000 of their own personal money on a campaign. 
By doing so, Mr. President, we would provide candidates, for the first time ever, with the opportunity to run a competitive campaign without having to raise and spend millions of dollars. It tries to level the playing field. It is fair to both parties, and that provision, that amendment that we will offer, is clearly constitutional. 
There will be a vote on that amendment, and we will find out if Senators favor or support changing the rules that have so clearly fallen apart in recent years. I look forward to that debate. I look forward to the other amendments that will be offered that could well improve this bill even more. 
So before concluding, I do want to again thank my colleague from Arizona, but I want to make two points, two points that I think will be something of a road map to what will happen in the next few days. 
First, there is going to be, if you have a scorecard, two different groups out on the floor. One group of Senators is going to try to force a filibuster. They are going to offer amendments and use procedural tactics in any way they can to force either the Democrats or the Republicans to filibuster. The majority leader already said today, with great pride, that he would get the other side to filibuster. He has already announced that that is his goal. But there is another group of Senators, Mr. President. That is the bipartisan group. That is not the filibustering group. That is the group of Senators from both parties who are working together to avoid a filibuster and reform our system. Keep your scorecard. There are two very clear groups--the filibusterers and the bipartisan Senators. That is where we are in the difference on this issue. 
The second final point I want to make, Mr. President, is that not only are there two groups of Senators on this issue--and we will find out exactly who they are--there are also two different visions of our democracy represented in the Senate. One vision is the vision of a representative democracy. The other vision is what I like to call a vision, an acceptance of something that is more akin to a corporate democracy. We have become a corporate democracy. 
What do I mean by that? When I was 13 years old, I received a gift of a share of stock. One of our relatives wanted to teach me how the stock market worked and how our economy worked. I think it was maybe a $13 stock in the Parker Pen Co., one of our great prides in Wisconsin and in my hometown of Janesville. My father told me that in addition to owning a share of that stock, I would have a vote at the stockholders' meeting. And being already interested in politics, I thought: Great. When is the election? When is the stockholders' meeting? I want to go vote. And he laughed. He said, `Well, I better tell you something. The number of votes you get depends on how many shares you have. You don't have the same vote and the same power as everyone else because it is a corporation. It is based on how much money you are able to put into the corporation, and so you could go to the shareholders' meeting but your vote wouldn't count very much.' 
Mr. President, sadly, that reminds me more of America today than ever before. This is not a democracy anymore of one person-one vote. If we keep this system of $300,000, $400,000 contributions and access to politicians based on contributions, we will have sealed this as a corporate democracy, not a representative democracy. 
That is the question before us. Will we abandon all the other Americans who simply cannot afford the cash to play the game? We have to reject the corporate democracy, Mr. President. We have to return to a representative democracy. That is what this country is all about. That is what this institution is all about. Fortunately, in the coming days, we will find out who is on which side. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to join the Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] in highlighting the provisions in Department of Defense appropriations bill, as agreed to in conference, concerning the deployment of United States troops in Bosnia. 
The conferees agreed to include--in legislative language--a provision that stipulates that no funds may be made available for the deployment of United States ground forces in Bosnia after June 30, 1998--a date the President himself has specified--unless the President submits to the Congress a certification that the continued presence of our troops is necessary to protect our national security interests. In this certification, the President will have to justify for the Congress and the American people the reasons for such determination and specify details concerning the deployment. These include: the number of military personnel to be deployed, the expected duration of the deployment, the mission and objectives of the deployment, and the exit strategy for the U.S. forces who have been deployed. 
But most importantly, Mr. President, President Clinton will have to detail the costs associated with any deployment after June 30, 1998. This is perhaps the most troubling aspect of our involvement in Bosnia. After originally being told that the mission would cost the American people some $2 billion, recent estimates indicate that we will soon have spent well over $7 billion to deploy U.S. troops. Mr. President, that is more than a threefold increase. With the language included in the bill before us today, the administration will now have to be much more clear about the potential costs of continuing deployment in the region. I think this is vitally important so that we, the Members of the U.S. Congress, and the American people we represent will have a better idea of the financial implications of a mission that I feel has already gone on much too long with too little to show for it. 
Because of my concerns about this mission, concerns which I have detailed on the Senate floor many times before, I have joined with the Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] in developing a Senate Bosnia Working Group. She and I both feel that it is time to think about what policy alternatives we may have with respect to U.S. involvement in the Balkans. 
The compromise language arrived at by the conferees, while perhaps not as strong as I would have liked, hopefully represents a first step toward the development of a policy that we can all be more comfortable with. 
So Mr. President, I thank all the conferees for their efforts in this area.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution regarding the upcoming State visit by the President of the People's Republic of China, Mr. Jiang Zemin. 
As we all know, President Clinton plans to host Mr. Jiang on a State visit to Washington at the end of October. The resolution I am offering today is a sense of the Senate resolution that states that President Jiang should not be given a red carpet welcome in our Nation's Capital until we see some progress on human rights in China. Specifically, the resolution calls for China to release Wei Jingsheng and other prisoners of conscience from jail as a precondition for a State visit. 
By agreeing to this State visit without receiving any concession on human rights, the administration may be squandering perhaps its strongest source of leverage with Beijing. The Chinese Government has been pressing for such a visit in Washington for several years. The Chinese want to be treated like a great power. An invitation to the White House not only bestows legitimacy on the Communist regime, it will boost the prestige of President Jiang and help him to solidify his position as Deng Xiaoping's successor. In short, China needs this State visit more than the United States does. 
Agreeing to invite the President of China to the White House before any improvement is made on human rights will send a terrible message. It will confirm what many Chinese leaders already believe--that the United States offers lots of rhetoric on human rights, but no action, and that the United States ultimately cares more about trade than political prisoners. 
Judging by the administration's China policy, it is easy to see why the leadership in Beijing would come to such a conclusion. In 1994, the President delinked most-favored-nation trade status from human rights. This was a serious mistake. What we have seen since the delinkage is the reincarceration of political dissidents and increased repression in Tibet. 
Just this past April, at the meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission, the United States mounted what I view as a half-hearted attempt to win passage of a resolution critical of China's human rights record. As we all know, that resolution failed to pass, and some of our close allies--including France, Germany, and Canada--refused to cosponsor it. Finally, just this past June, the President once again unconditionally extended MFN to China for one more year. 
Now, the administration is preparing to give Jiang Zemin a red carpet welcome in Washington despite the deplorable human rights conditions in China. Why wouldn't Chinese leaders conclude that, in the final analysis, the United States is unwilling to back up its human rights concerns with concrete action? 
What we have then is not a policy of constructive engagement but one of unconditional engagement. 
An invitation to the White House is meant to symbolize a relationship of close cooperation. But the United States simply does not have such a relationship with China. On security issues, China has sold sensitive nuclear and missile technologies to countries like Pakistan and Iran. The People's Republic of China last year fired missiles toward Taiwan in an attempt to disrupt the island's first democratic Presidential election. China has blatantly violated agreements on copyrights and intellectual property. And, as I have stated, China has made little, if any, attempt to improve its human rights conditions. 
Now the administration is rewarding this lack of cooperation by hosting high-level visits by Chinese officials. Last December, the administration welcomed China's Defense Minister, Gen. Chi Haotian, to Washington. Mr. Chi, also known as the butcher of Beijing, was one of the People's Liberation Army officers who led the military assault against the citizens of the Chinese capital on June 4, 1989. Now, the administration wants to invite the President of China for a State visit, even though the Government of China--in the spirit of the Tiananmen Square massacre--continues to persecute anyone who dares criticize the Communist regime. Just this week, China's Justice Minister ruled out granting medical parole to pro-democracy dissident Wang Dan despite pleas from Wang's family, who say he is seriously ill. 
When Jiang Zemin is given a 21-gun salute at the White House, the United States will lose what little credibility we have left on the issue of human rights. 
Mr. President, this resolution simply calls on the administration to hold off on a State visit until China releases Wei Jingsheng and other political prisoners. This resolution focuses on Wei Jingsheng, but only as a symbol of the thousands of people who are rotting in Chinese jail cells or toiling in labor camps because they dared to peacefully express their political or religious beliefs. 
Wei Jingsheng may be the most famous Chinese dissident, but we should never forget that there are many more like him, people whose names we may not know, but who nevertheless show the same type of courage. This resolution calls for the release of a significant number of political and religious prisoners in addition to Wei. China must know that the release of one or two high-profile dissidents is not enough. 
In addition to demanding the release of political prisoners, the resolution also calls on China to give prisoners access to medical care, and to take concrete steps towards improving overall human rights conditions in China and Tibet. 
These are realistic demands. This resolution does not say China must change its political system or withdraw from Tibet, events that are unlikely to take place before next month. This resolution only states that, in order to create the right atmosphere for a State visit, China must make a good-faith effort to improve human rights. 
I should also point out that this resolution only applies to a State-level visit. The State Department's protocol office tells me there are several levels of visits including private visits, working visits, official visits, and finally, at the highest level, State visits. My goal in introducing this resolution is not to cut off all dialog between the United States and China. I would not necessarily object to having Mr. Jiang come to Washington for a working-level visit. But I feel the pomp and symbolism of a State-level visit is inappropriate given the present situation in China. 
Oviously, China will object to this resolution, but it contains a message that Beijing must hear. China's leaders have unfortunately interpreted the inability of Congress to reach a consensus on China's most-favored-nation status as evidence that Members of Congress do not really care about human rights. But I assure you, Mr. President, that even though many of my colleagues have different views on the MFN issue, all share my concern for the plight of people like Wei Jingsheng. 
China wants to be treated as a great power, but it does not want to accept the responsibilities that come with the role. It does not want to fulfill its treaty obligations nor abide by the international conventions--including those on human rights--that it has signed. This resolution sends a clear message that if the United States is to treat China like a great power, then China must comply with international human rights standards. 
Mr. President, I think it is time for the United States to end its policy of unconditional engagement and put human rights and trade on an equal footing in our China policy. 
I therefore urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to make a few brief comments regarding the nomination of Mr. Peter Scher to be the Special Trade Ambassador for Agriculture which this Senate is considering today. I am pleased to report that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on which I serve, considered the nomination of Mr. Scher and favorably reported his nomination yesterday. 
I met with Mr. Scher following his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to discuss with him the problems Wisconsin's agricultural sector has had with our existing trade agreements such as the Uruguay Round of GATT and the North American Free Trade Agreement. I urged Mr. Scher, in his new position, to work diligently to ensure that our trading partners are complying with their agricultural trade obligations established by these agreements. 
Specifically, I asked Mr. Scher and the USTR to accept a section 301 petition filed by the dairy industry asking USTR to challenge the Canadian export pricing scheme before the World Trade Organization. Canada's dairy export subsidies violate the export subsidy reduction commitments under the Uruguay Round. These subsidies disadvantage the United States dairy industry in its efforts to compete in world markets. I also pointed out that Canada also has effectively prohibited our dairy industry from exporting products to lucrative Canadian markets. Not only must USTR aggressively pursue WTO dispute settlement proceedings against Canadian export subsidies, but it must also seek greater access for United States dairy products to Canadian markets, among others, in any upcoming trade negotiations. 
I also raised with Mr. Scher the problems the United States potato industry has had with respect to access to both Canadian and Mexican markets. I urged him to pursue negotiations with the Canadians to allow greater access of United States potatoes to their domestic markets and to aggressively seek accelerated reduction in Mexican tariffs for United States potatoes, a commitment made to potato growers when NAFTA was approved. Mr. Scher assured me that potatoes would be among the commodities to be considered in upcoming negotiations with Mexico. 
I believe Mr. Scher has a fundamental understanding of both the importance of trade to agriculture generally and of the complex trade problems the U.S. dairy industry faces regarding compliance with existing trade agreements. For that reason, I support the approval of his nomination. But I expect USTR, with Mr. Scher acting as Ambassador, to aggressively pursue the resolution of the critical issues facing our domestic dairy and potato sectors. I will continue to work with USTR to resolve these issues and will hold Mr. Scher to his commitment that USTR will use all existing tools to ensure compliance with existing trade agreements and to pursue greater access for agriculture to international markets. 
I continue to have serious reservations about United States efforts to begin new trade negotiations until the problems with our current bilateral and multilateral agreements are successfully resolved. Wisconsin is home to 24,000 dairy farmers, 140 cheese processing plants and many other businesses associated with milk production and processing. Dairy contributes some $4 billion in income to Wisconsin's economy and provides 130,000 jobs. Wisconsin is also the fifth largest potato producing State with a large chip and french fry processing sector. Overall, Wisconsin ranks 10th in the Nation in farm numbers and 9th nationally with respect to market value of agricultural products sold. 
Wisconsin's farmers and food processing industry could greatly benefit by gaining a greater share of international markets. However, for that to happen, our trade agreements must not only be fair, they must be enforceable. To date, our trade agreements have not only failed to provide significant benefits for many agricultural sectors, including dairy, they have placed some sectors at a distinct disadvantage. I will look at all future trade agreement proposals with an eye to these issues and make decisions on those proposals based, in part, on how they treat Wisconsin farmers.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me take a moment, and reserve the right to object, to thank both of the leaders for coming together on this issue. It is of tremendous importance to everyone here in this body and to the American people. And I think they both have an extremely difficult task in dealing with an issue like this that is of such personal importance to each Member of the Senate. 
It is very heartening to know that we have an agreement that will allow the open debate on this issue. Last year when the debate came up, there were no amendments and a cloture vote within 2 days. It was not a great opportunity for the body and for the members of the public to be involved in. So I think this is a great step forward. 
I want to thank my leader, Senator Daschle, for his persistence on this. I want to thank the President for his absolutely relentless support of our legislation for over 2 years now. And I appreciate his involvement in this as well. 
But overall, what I think we have seen here is a bipartisan ability to come together on timing. I hope it leads to a bipartisan ability to come together on a meaningful piece of legislation. 
With that, I yield the floor.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, I want to pay tribute to an important institution in the Wisconsin State Legislature on its 50th anniversary: the Wisconsin Legislative Council. 
The legislative council was created as a joint committee of the State legislature in 1947, charged with convening special committees each biennium to study the more complex, controversial or sometimes tedious but necessary legislative issues, and to develop legislative solutions. The unique aspect of the council's directive has been to identify and appoint knowledgeable Wisconsin citizens to work alongside legislators to craft bills, often recodifying whole chapters of the statutes at a time. 
The Wisconsin Legislative Council is derived from the same Wisconsin Idea, fostered by the Progressives in the early part of this century, that created the Congressional Research Service. Senator `Fighting Bob' LaFollette saw the importance of having nonpartisan, professional staff provide research, analysis and bill-drafting to legislative bodies. The Wisconsin version, which has been the model for many other State legislatures, further improves on the concept by setting up a mechanism for open discussion and citizen participation directly in the development of legislative solutions in subjects selected by a bicameral body every 2 years. 
Since its inception, the joint legislative council has overseen 426 individual studies, conducted by not only State legislators but also including over 6,000 Wisconsin citizens as full voting members of committees. These committees are staffed by the legislative council staff under the direction of the joint legislative council. These nonpartisan professional staff members further support the work of the legislature by staffing committees, providing research and analysis to individual legislators and their staff, and performing a technical review of all proposed State regulations. 
Many of the members of the Wisconsin congressional delegation have had the experience of serving on legislative council committees--I served on three, once as chairman of a study committee reviewing laws on interstate sales and use taxes. 
On its 50th anniversary, I am pleased to pay tribute to Wisconsin's Joint Legislative Council and the dedication of the legislative council staff. May they continue their service to the state for many years to come.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friends and colleagues, Mr. Durbin of Illinois and Mr. Johnson of South Dakota, in cosponsoring amendment No. 1140. This amendment will ensure that private, third-party reviewers of class I and II medical devices will be subject to the same conflict-of-interest restrictions that federally employed reviewers are. 
Under current law, employees of the Food and Drug Administration who review drugs and medical devices are subject to strict regulations governing their interaction with the companies whose products they are reviewing. They are not allowed to accept gifts from such companies. In addition, they cannot designate other persons to accept gifts on their behalf. Another important restriction prohibits reviewers from having a financial interest in any company whose products they are reviewing. 
Mr. President, these are commonsense measures which help to maintain the public's confidence in the safety of our Nation's drugs and devices. The pharmaceutical and medical device industries command billions of dollars every year. We live in a world in which FDA approval can mean immediate and enormous profits for investors. In such an environment, it is absolutely critical that the Government be vigilant in its responsibility to ensure that applications are reviewed thoroughly and in an unbiased manner. 
We all know people--family members and friends--whose health, and even lives, rely on important medication and devices. There are few jobs more significant than assuring the safety and efficacy of these items. In my mind, Mr. President, this is a role--protecting health and safety--that is best served by Government, rather than by the private sector. However, the bill before us takes a different view, and establishes a large-scale pilot project to allow private sector review of medical devices. If we are to take this step, it is absolutely critical that we subject those private sector reviewers to the same conflict-of-interest restrictions that Government reviewers are subject to. 
The amendment sponsored by the Senator from Illinois would do just that. It would say to private sector reviewers, `You cannot own stock in any company whose product you review. You cannot accept any gifts from a company whose product you review, and you cannot designate any other person to receive such a gift.' That's it. Pretty simple and straightforward. But very important. 
As one of the lead sponsors of the Senate gift ban several years ago, I feel strongly that the public has a right to know that elected officials are working in the best interests of their constituency, and cannot be bought or sold over lunch provided by high-paid lobbyists. Just as politicians should not be trading on their influence, neither should private sector medical device reviewers be swayed in their decision process by gifts from industry representatives or the promise of huge profits derived from a recommendation for FDA approval. 
I hope my colleagues will do the right thing, and limit the potential for corruption in this bill by voting for this important amendment.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the road to campaign finance reform is obviously a long, hard one. But we are going to keep on it. I just want to say, because I am involved in a bipartisan effort here, that I believe the majority leader was engaged in the last couple of days in a good-faith effort, negotiating with Senator McCain, of course, with members of his own caucus, to try to resolve this issue. 
I believe there has been a relatively small misunderstanding here with regard to the specifics that sounds a lot worse than it actually is. What we are down to here is merely a difference, based on the conversation I just heard, as to whether the bill will come up in early November or whether it might come back some time in October. 
Surely, we will not allow such a difference to make the difference between whether we debate campaign finance reform or not. 
I just had the opportunity to speak with Senator McCain briefly. He and I share the view that I think most of the American people share, that too much has happened with regard to this scandal in this area to not address this matter. 
I think we need to work a little more on the UC. I had not seen the UC. I want that noted in the Record. I had not seen the UC, but I am not complaining. That is not my role in this institution to be the main person reviewing an agreement of that kind. 
But I am confident, once this small matter is resolved, that we will have an agreement very much like the one that was just propounded. That agreement would be a historic agreement. I think it would be the first time in memory that the leaders of both parties in this body had agreed to bring up bipartisan campaign finance reform. 
The nature of the proposal was quite reasonable. The proposal suggested that there would be full and open debate on this issue without a time limit, that there would be an opportunity to amend. We can fix the bill with amendments. We can accommodate Members' concerns. We can improve the bill or we can even defeat the bill, as my colleague from Kentucky may choose to do. But that is different than last year when we were given only 2 days, no amendments, and a cloture vote. 
The agreement that was just propounded was significantly better in that regard. The agreement would give the American people the opportunity with some certainty to know about when this issue was going to come up so that the people across the country 
could write their Representatives, call their Representatives, e-mail their Representatives, and say, `We'd really like this bill passed' or `We'd like it killed' or `We'd like it changed.' I think all of this is embodied in the proposal. 
So I say, on behalf of myself and Senator McCain, if I may do so, that, apart from this small issue of the exact timing, that this agreement, once agreed to, will do what we want it to. It is what we want. It is what we worked for for a long time, while all the pundits, especially in this town, have said that the issue will never come up. Most importantly, when we have this debate--and it will be in the near future--I am confident it will be done in an orderly manner. And it will give the American people what they deserve, an opportunity to have a real debate on this issue instead of just an endless stream of reports of abuses with regard to campaign financing throughout their Government. 
So, Mr. President, I am very optimistic that this brief conversation here was merely a blip and that we will not be forced to use the tactic of having to try to attach this legislation to other bills and in fact S. 25, which of course is still the McCain-Feingold bill, will in fact come before this body in the relatively near future. 
I want to thank the majority leader for his cooperation on this. I want to thank my leader for his efforts to try to resolve these differences at this point. I want to thank all 45 members of my caucus, all the Democrats for having signed on to the McCain-Feingold bill. Of course I want to thank the other cosponsors of the bill, Senator Thompson and Senator Collins on the other side of the aisle. 
I want to thank the President. The President has been very steadfast in trying to move this legislation forward. His staff has worked closely with us on a day-to-day basis to try to see if we could resolve the very difficult differences between the parties so we could have this matter debated. 
Mr. President, we will get there. We are getting there. I hope we can today begin to tell the American people they are finally going to be able to participate in, hear and understand the debate about whether big money is going to continue to control the Government of the people of the United States. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wanted to clarify with the subcommittee chairman and the ranking member the process, as described on page 116 in the Senate Committee Report on the Interior Appropriations bill (S. Report 105-56), for the expenditure of land and water conservation fund dollars provided in this legislation. Is this Senator correct in his understanding, Mr. Chairman, that the committee intends to work with the Appropriations Committee in the other body and the administration to develop a list of projects to be funded with the remainder of $700 million in land and water conservation fund moneys that are not allocated in this legislation for either specific Federal projects or for the States?

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham] in introducing the China Policy Act of 1997. This is a bill that I am proud to cosponsor and one that will send a much-needed message to the leaders of the People's Republic of China. I commend the Senator from Michigan for his efforts. 
The China Policy Act is an omnibus bill that covers a broad range of issues. This legislation will impose targeted sanctions against Chinese entities--such as the military and public security apparatus--that are directly engaged in weapons proliferation and human rights abuses. In addition, this bill calls for tighter enforcement of various laws related to China, such as the ban on Chinese prison-labor goods and controls on the export of high-speed computers to China. The legislation also contains funding increases for student, cultural, and legislative exchanges between the United States and China. 
The China Policy Act is designed to move Congress and the American public beyond the sometimes polarizing debate over China's most-favored-nation trade status, offering realistic alternatives to revoking MFN that merit broad bipartisan support. 
As many of my colleagues know, I have been a strong opponent of granting MFN privileges to China and, in fact, have been an original cosponsor of the resolutions of disapproval for the past 3 years. I strongly believe that, in light of Beijing's egregious human rights record, China does not deserve to have such trade privileges with the United States. Ever since the administration delinked MFN and human rights in 1994, I have watched with alarm as the Chinese Government has heightened its political and religious persecution throughout the country. 
But despite my strong views on the issue, I realize that the Congress has been unable to reach a consensus on whether MFN is the best tool to pressure China to make improvements in human rights. I know that many of my colleagues share my concerns over China's human rights record, but nevertheless feel that MFN is too blunt an instrument, especially for a nation as large and diverse as China. 
But once you step away from the debate over the effectiveness of MFN, there is widespread agreement among Members of both the Senate and the House that the administration's current policy of constructive engagement toward China remains unsatisfactory. 
I believe the administration is promoting engagement for engagement's sake, not as a way to halt the many offensive behaviors of the Chinese regime. I prefer to call the administration policy not `constructive' engagement but rather unconditional engagement. 
No matter how uncooperative China is, the United States appears ready to continue business as usual with the Chinese regime. This is especially true with respect to human rights. Recent events paint a very bleak picture. In October of last year, a Chinese court sentenced Wang Dan--a leader of the Tiananmen Square protests--to 11 years in prison for peacefully expressing his prodemocracy beliefs. Seventy-six-year-old Bishop Zeng Jingmu has been sentenced to reeducation through labor for organizing religious ceremonies outside China's official Catholic Church. In Tibet, Chinese authorities have banned the display of the Dalai Lama's photograph and the State Department Human Rights Report cites three instances of Buddhist monks dying in Chinese prisons in 1996. Sadly, this represents on a tiny fraction of the human rights abuses that are taking place in China today. It would be impossible to name all of the people who are being kept behind bars for the expression of their political and religious beliefs. 
Yet, even as the Chinese leadership continues to brutalize political dissidents and the people of Tibet, the administration is preparing to welcome China's President, Jiang Zemin, to the White House next month. What kind of message does this send? 
The China Policy Act of 1997 represents the efforts of both pro- and anti-MFN Senators to find new ways to deal with the problems the United States currently faces in China. 
And there is no shortage of problems. 
I have already mentioned my primary concern, which is China's deplorable human rights record, but in addition, the Government of China continues to sell dangerous chemical and nuclear weapons technologies to terrorist and rogue regimes. China has used military intimidation to disrupt free elections in Taiwan and has harassed its neighbors in the South China Sea. Furthermore, we have all seen reports of Beijing's unfair trade practices and rampant copyright violations. This is what I refer to as a `kaleidoscope' of problems the United States has with China. 
The China Policy Act of 1997 contains targeted sanctions aimed at the organizations most directly associated with China's poor behavior. For example, the bill contains provisions imposing comprehensive sanctions against enterprises run by the People's Liberation Army that have engaged in weapons smuggling or proliferation. The United States simply should refrain from doing business with companies that create security risks to our country. 
This bill will also require the administration to deny United States visas to high-level Chinese officials directly connected with human rights violations and religious persecution. This provision expresses United States outrage at China's human rights abuses while still giving the President adequate waiver authority to conduct foreign policy. 
I am particularly pleased this bill contains strong language on human rights, an area that has been a special focus of mine. The bill includes a provision stating that the 
administration needs to greatly increase multilateral efforts to condemn China's human rights record. As you know, Mr. President, this past April, the U.N. Human Rights Commission failed to pass a resolution criticizing China's human rights policies. Unfortunately, the United States only began lobbying for the resolution at the last moment and, as a result of this delay, many of our allies--including France, Germany, and Canada--would not cosponsor the motion. To make our China policy more effective, the United States must do a better job of coordinating with our allies in multilateral fora. 
In addition to addressing a wide spectrum of issues in Sino-United States relations, the China Policy Act also gives the Senate--and the American people we represent--an important opportunity to have an extensive debate about China policy. Such a debate is long overdue, and has continued to be delayed because of the controversy surrounding MFN. 
It is my view that the inability of Congress to reach a consensus on MFN has led the Chinese authorities to believe that they can continue to commit gross human rights violations without facing any consequences. Unfortunately, it may be that, until now, the Beijing leadership has been right. In China's eyes, Congress has become what Chairman Mao Zedong would have called a paper tiger, something that might act ferocious, but is, in fact, harmless. 
However, once Congress steps out of the restrictive confines of the MFN debate, I think China will be surprised at the level of dissatisfaction in Congress toward Beijing's actions. 
The Chinese Government will obviously condemn this legislation because it demands that Chinese leaders live up to the international and bilateral agreements on weapons-proliferation, human rights, and trade to which China is a party. The Beijing government categorically rejects any outside scrutiny of its policies and equates good relations with a complete lack of criticism. But truly close relations between two countries can only be built when both sides fulfill their obligations and act in good faith toward one another. 
The China Policy Act of 1997 is intended to send a strong message that Chinese Government's actions on many fronts remains unacceptable. Unfortunately, Chinese leaders have not heard this message loudly or strongly enough in the past. They have not heard it from the U.N. Human Rights Commission. They have not heard it from our trade negotiators. And, until now, they have not heard it from the U.S. Congress. 
It is my view that the time has come for us to send this message clearly. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for his efforts to include language in this appropriations bill relating to the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. I also want to thank his colleague, the senior Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], who chairs the Senate Special Committee on Aging, for joining me in advocating some additional direction to the Commission with respect to long-term care. I very much enjoy working with Senator Grassley on the Aging Committee, where he has continued a long tradition of bipartisanship. 
Mr. President, the language added to the bill at our request touches on one aspect of an enormously important segment of health care, namely long-term care. I have been deeply involved in long-term care issues for nearly 15 years, and have advocated significant reforms to our current system both at the State and Federal level. 
Mr. President, many will recall that as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we created the so-called National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. Established because of the need to reform and modernize the principal health care system of our Nation's seniors, that Commission will examine a host of issues relating to health care coverage and will make recommendations that we hope can lead to an improved Medicare system, one which will not only deliver better health care but also provide some relief from the growing pressure Medicare has been placing on our Federal budget. 
One of the key issues to be examined by the Commission is the area of chronic disease and disability. 
Mr. President, effective treatment of individuals with chronic health care needs requires a combination of acute and preventive care, disease management, health monitoring, and long-term care services and supports. However, as it is now structured, the Medicare fee-for-service program responds to specific and discrete episodes of care through separate providers, and often discourages timely, coordinated cost-effective chronic care. 
Mr. President, more than 20 percent of Medicare beneficiaries today have chronic health care needs, and they are the fastest growing segment of the Medicare population. A major part of the health care for these beneficiaries with chronic needs are the long-term care services and supports which are separately financed by beneficiaries and their families, or, for those without personal resources, by Medicaid and the States. 
This latter group of people with chronic care needs, those who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, help make up a particularly important group of beneficiaries. The so-called dually eligible make up about one-sixth of the population of these two programs, but account for nearly one-third of program expenditures and rightly have captured the attention of policy makers as one of the critical targets for policy reforms in the two programs. As a recent hearing of the Aging Committee revealed, the lack of coordination between these two programs, and more generally between Medicare and long-term care, creates perverse incentives for cost-shifting in the health care system, and often results in excess cost, inappropriate care, or no care at all. 
Mr. President, while the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare is already directed to examine this critical population, our proposal goes further be specifically calling on the Commission to examine the potential for coordinating Medicare with cost-effective long-term care services. 
Mr. President, I want to underscore the language we had included in the bill does not limit or even specify what the Commission might consider in reviewing the potential for coordinating Medicare with long-term care services. But there are a number of matters deserving the Commission's attention that I want to highlight, including the success of a number of States, such as Wisconsin, in developing effective long-term care programs built on flexible delivery systems that deliver more cost-effective, individualized care. The Commission should also take a particularly close look at efforts which build upon the existing system of informal supports, often provided by family members and friends, that currently account for the vast majority of long-term care provided in this country. 
More generally, while the primary focus of the Commission will be the future of Medicare, as the Commission calculates the future cost of the current Medicare program, I urge it take into consideration the total costs of care for individuals with chronic illnesses and disabilities, including the cost of long-term care services and supports, whether those costs accrue to Medicare, Medicaid, private insurers, or beneficiaries and their families. It is neither good budgeting policy nor good health care policy to partition off health care service planning, making changes to one program while ignoring the effect those changes will have in other areas. 
Mr. President, unlike the near-term focus of the budget process, the recommendations that we expect the Commission will make regarding Medicare will be based on a much longer and broader view. Some of the defects of the current Medicare program are arguably the result of short-term budget considerations that have led to unintended, sometimes expensive consequences. By taking a broader view, the Commission can avoid some of these past errors, and possibly contribute to one of the highest health care priorities we have, the need for significant long-term care reform.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution which I hope all of my colleagues will support. Milk is produced in every State of this country and in recent months the dairy farmers who produce that milk have suffered from unusually low milk prices. I am pleased to be joined in offering this resolution by the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], my senior Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan], and both Senators from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux and Ms. Landrieu] all of whom have worked hard over the past 10 months to find solutions to the problem of low milk prices. 
The resolution we are introducing today expresses the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Agriculture should use his administrative authority under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 to set a temporary emergency price floor under milk prices. 
Mr. President, as I am sure many Members are aware, milk prices have fallen in the past several months to levels far below the amount it costs many dairy farmers to produce that milk. In fact, the basic formula price for milk as calculated by USDA for every month since April has been below the cost of producing milk for all regions of the country--including the lowest cost milk producers in California. This situation might be bearable if dairy farmers had any assurance that prices might rebound--that the financial strain they are under would be alleviated--but many predictions about milk prices over the past 10 months have simply proven inaccurate. 
Last fall, milk prices fell from $14.13 per hundred pounds in October to $11.61 in November. This dramatic decline in milk prices was nearly unprecedented. And while milk prices were strong prior to the milk price collapse last fall, the higher prices of mid-1996 reflected the extremely high cost of feed last year which left dairy farmers with little to show from those high milk prices. Feed is the single most important, and most expensive, input to milk production. It is frequently the case that the cost of the input--in this case, forage and feed grains such as corn--is reflected in the cost of the output--milk. So while some dairy producers may have found 1996 to be a good year, many more were struggling under high feed bills that still had to be paid long after the strong milk prices had evaporated. 
Despite the milk price crash late last year, many dairy farmers had expressed optimism for 1997 as milk prices incrementally rose early this year, and were expected to continue to rise throughout the year. Many of my colleagues joined me and other dairy State Senators in asking the Secretary of Agriculture to take administrative steps to shore up milk prices, such as making advance purchases of cheese and other dairy products for the school lunch and breakfast programs and to export more dairy products under the Dairy Export Incentive Program. The Secretary took a number of steps in that regard that may have facilitated the slight increase in milk prices and we thank him for his efforts. 
Unfortunately, the milk price recovery was not sustained and in May, the basic formula price for milk hit a 6-year low of $10.70 per hundredweight and remained at roughly that level 
throughout the summer. Even the mailbox milk prices--that is, the milk prices that farmers are actually paid including all premiums--were below the cost of production for many milk producing regions of the country this summer. These tight margins have squeezed even the most efficient operators and have placed a great deal of financial stress on small- to mid-size family dairy farms who are less able to absorb the price shocks. 
While the recently announced basic formula price for August increased milk prices by about $1.00 per hundredweight, few farmers believe this is enough for them to continue to pay their bills through the fall and many farmers are skeptical that prices will increase much beyond this level. 
Mr. President, it has been a long summer for dairy farmers who have come to Washington today to demand our action and our support. They have brought with them thousands of petitions from farmers, rural residents, and agribusinesses seeking emergency price relief for milk producers. It is in response to those petitions, the hard work that has gone into gathering the signatures, and the months of exasperatingly low milk prices that we introduce this resolution today. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support their dairy farmers by supporting this resolution. 
This resolution simply expresses the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Agriculture should use the substantial administrative authority and discretion the Congress has provided him under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 to provide temporary emergency price relief to dairy farmers throughout the Nation. The resolution stipulates that such price relief will be provided in a manner that is equitable to farmers throughout the country. As many of my colleagues know, dairy policy has frequently been embroiled in regional battles over pricing. This resolution stipulates that all producers will receive the same price relief regardless of where they milk their cows. 
Many Senators have already asked the Secretary to implement this type of emergency price floor. Earlier this year over 30 Senators from all regions of the country contacted the Secretary urging that he provide price relief for economically stressed dairy farmers. And those requests came even before prices hit bottom this summer. I urge those Senators to join me in sponsoring this resolution. 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, however, has indicated that he needs more than just letters from Senators to provide this type of emergency price relief. Rather, he indicated in a July 9 letter to the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee [Mr. Lugar and Mr. Harkin] that he needs Congress to provide a more formal expression of support for temporary emergency price relief for dairy farmers. This resolution, when agreed to by the Senate, will provide the Secretary with the support he needs to provide milk price relief. 
The resolution, while directing the Secretary to take action, provides him with flexibility in providing price relief. If milk prices do indeed recover this fall, a price floor may be 
unnecessary and the Secretary will be able to take that into account. However, analysts are unsure as to what milk prices will ultimately be this fall when they normally reach their peak. High levels of nonfat dry milk stocks may continue to depress prices through the end of the year. 
Some might ask why dairy farmers should be given this assistance. The answer, Mr. President, is that a temporary emergency price floor is necessary because unlike other commodity producers, dairy farmers were singled out in the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act by having their only support mechanism--price supports--phased out. No other commodity program was terminated by the 1996 FAIR Act. Dairy farmers were not provided with the `Freedom to Farm' payments that have been provided to wheat and feed grain producers each year regardless of crop prices. These payments, also known as transition payments, were provided to crop producers in order to help them transition to a market without Government intervention. However, no transitional income assistance has been provided for milk producers even though their commodity program has been, in effect, eliminated. 
Similarly, while wheat and feed grain producers, as well as producers of many other commodities, have federally subsidized crop insurance available to help them manage their production risk, and in some cases, their price risk as well, there is no USDA insurance program for milk production. 
While producers of other commodities may be able to hedge their price and production risk using high volume futures and options markets that have operated in those commodities for decades, dairy farmers have no such markets to rely on. While futures and options markets exist for dairy products, the trading volumes for most of these markets are so low that few farmers are able to use them. 
For whatever reason, Mr. President, dairy farmers were not provided the tools to weather a transition to a more market oriented agricultural sector. 
Mr. President, I am not a strong advocate of Government intervention in dairy markets. I have seen the types of division and inequity that Federal involvement in dairy policy and milk prices can create in the dairy industry. So, I do not introduce this resolution lightly. But if there was ever a time for the Federal Government to step in to help dairy farmers, it is now. During the month of August, I traveled throughout Wisconsin conducting the listening sessions which I hold in each county, each year. And in the 15 years I have represented Wisconsin farmers, I have never seen a greater sense of despair among farmers and other rural residents. 
Mr. President, there is a sense in the countryside that Washington, DC, has turned a blind eye to the low milk prices of 1997. While that might be a misperception, as I know many of my colleagues have worked with me to find solutions to low milk prices, it is understandable that farmers feel this way. Farmers began asking for this type of price relief at the end of 1996 and 9 months later, nothing has come of that request. That must change. 
Mr. President, we must act now to provide some very short-term relief that will help economically distressed dairy farmers through this milk price crisis. We can do that by passing the resolution we are introducing today. The long-term solutions to volatile milk prices and farm income are more nebulous and we must work to address them. But first, we must take some steps to lessen the immediate financial strain on farm families throughout the Nation. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished managers of this bill for including language in the managers' amendment at my request. The amendment I intended to offer, which has been included in the managers' amendment, directs the Department of Education to conduct a study of the economic costs of addressing our Nation's burgeoning elementary and secondary student enrollment, projected to grow by over 2 million young people in the next decade, and the expected impact that this growth will have on student achievement. It directs the Department to estimate the costs to local school districts, States, and the Federal Government of the upcoming surge in enrollment, and to outline policy options for addressing this issue and make recommendations to resolve it. In estimating the costs and impact on students of increasing enrollment and making policy recommendations to address this problem, the study will also consider the costs and benefits of reducing class sizes in the earliest grades. 
Mr. President, parents are increasingly interested in enrolling their young children in schools that place an emphasis on small class size and individualized attention from teachers. Cities and States across the country are developing programs to help schools meet this goal. California's statewide initiative to reduce all classes in grades K-3 to no more than 20 students is the most ambitious, but by no means the only example. 
In my own State of Wisconsin, the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education, or SAGE, Program was developed several years ago to study the benefits of small class size in schools with high poverty rates. With student-teacher ratios of 15:1, the program is extremely popular with students, parents, teachers, and school administrators. Although is has only been implemented in a relatively small number of Wisconsin communities thus far, the reason for the program's widespread appeal is obvious--with fewer students in the classroom, teachers have more time and energy to devote to meeting children's particular needs and helping to spark their interest in learning in creative ways. This may seem like common sense, and it is--but now, we have science to back up what parents and teachers have known for years. 
Research indicates that children who are placed in small classes--classes of 15 to 20 students--in the earliest years of elementary school achieve better academically than their peers in larger classes. These benefits are retained in later years of school, even if students are not kept in small classes for later grades. The leading scientific studies of the impact of small class size, Tennessee's STAR study and its follow-up, the Lasting Benefits Study, found that small class sizes in grades K-3 produce substantial improvements in learning which are sustained in later years, even if students are placed in larger classes for later grades. 
Unfortunately, at the very time that States and localities are starting to apply the lessons learned in the Tennessee studies, many of our Nation's schools are on the brink of an explosion in student enrollment. According to a report released last month by Education Secretary Richard Riley, entitled `A Back to School Special 
Report on the Baby Boom Echo: Here Come the Teenagers,' there will be more elementary and secondary students in America this school year than there ever have been before. These increases will occur primarily among secondary school students; public high school enrollment is projected to increase by 13% in the next 10 years, while elementary school enrollment will increase only slightly. Total public and private school enrollment in the 1997-98 school year will rise to a record level of 52.2 million students, and it won't stop there. By the year 2007, total enrollment is expected to peak at 54.3 million students. 
Mr. President, this is a problem that isn't going away. Unlike our past experience with the baby boom, when there was a sharp rise in student enrollment which eventually declined, the U.S. Bureau of the Census projects that the number of births will remain stable or even increase slightly in the next few decades. States and local school districts are going to have to develop strategies for accommodating and educating very large numbers of students. This is likely to be costly, and will require creative solutions and the balancing of priorities. 
To some degree, this is a regional problem. Wisconsin, for example, along with many States in the Midwest, will actually experience small decreases in student population in the next decade. However, this will certainly not be the case in every community in my State, or in any of the States which are projected to experience decreases in student enrollment. Across the Nation, school districts are going to need to adapt to their larger student bodies, at the same time that many of them, rightly, will be investing in the creation of smaller classes for their early elementary students. 
Mr. President, smaller class sizes are the wave of the future. Parents want them, students benefit from them, and schools are recognizing the need. I thank my colleagues, the Senators from Pennsylvania and Iowa, once again for accepting my amendment, which will lay out options for schools to consider as they plan for a future with smaller classes and larger enrollment.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to a beloved figure in Wisconsin politics, William Osborne Hart, who passed away on August 22. As a longtime activist in the State's Socialist Party, Hart ran for political office 25 times, and lost 25 times. He spread his message by running for office, and understood that he didn't need to win to make a difference. He once said `I don't buy that Vince Lombardi nonsense that winning is everything. Change is everything. Most politicians in American life who win have lost their souls.' 
William Hart brought about change by challenging his opponents, and the voters, with his ideas. He was a champion of the Bill of Rights, and always remained so, refusing to compromise when it was politically unpopular. A tireless political organizer, Hart was a cornerstone of Wisconsin's Socialist Party and helped found Wisconsin's Labor and Farm Party. 
A great example of Hart's tenacity was his run for the Presidency in 1984. Though he was a well-known politician in his home State, Hart was almost kept off Wisconsin's Presidential primary ballot, not considered a viable candidate because he lacked national media exposure. He refused to abide by a decision that equated the ability to buy television time with the right to run for office, and sued for a place on the ballot with the Wisconsin branch of the American Civil Liberties Union. Hart won his lawsuit and scored an important legal victory. He didn't win the primary, but he did make a difference. 
`I've always said that if I won an election, the first thing I'd do is demand a recount,' said Hart, who loved to say that he'd once come `dangerously close' to winning a seat on the Madison school board. In 1992, at 80 years old, Hart ran in his 25th and last election. Walking with two canes and suffering from heart problems, most people would have decided 24 times was enough. But Hart defied convention to the end, and exemplified integrity and commitment to those who knew him. 
Though he felt strongly about politics, Hart never let partisanship get the better of him. His dignity, kindness and humor won him the respect and friendship of people across the political spectrum. He was also a deeply religious man who often acted as a lay preacher and was inspired by faith in everything he did. 
His message has resonated with me and so many others because of its simple truth: being true to your own beliefs is the highest ideal. I have tried to heed Hart's message in my own life, and I'll always be grateful for his example of political courage.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to offer a few comments on the recently negotiated bipartisan budget agreement. The past few months have been truly historic. We have seen both parties come to the table in good faith and negotiate a budget agreement that puts us on the track toward a balanced unified budget. And all of that has been done without a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Indeed, as I have noted before, I am convinced the presence of such an amendment would only have delayed such an agreement, perhaps by a decade or more. 
Mr. President, balancing our budget has been my highest priority as a Member of this body. I ran on that issue in 1992, and I am pleased that we will enact a budget package that puts us on track to achieve that goal. 
As we congratulate ourselves on fashioning this agreement, however, we should recall that this agreement would not have been possible without the President's deficit reduction package enacted in 1993, a package some now estimate will achieve approximately $2 trillion in deficit reduction between 1993 and 2002. The heavy lifting needed to balance the budget was done in that package, and while this budget agreement puts the finishing touches on the work of eliminating the deficit, it was that 1993 budget package that made it much easier to reach an agreement. 
But Mr. President, though I am pleased we are on track to balancing the unified budget, I have mixed feelings with regard to the specifics of the tax cutting aspects of the bipartisan agreement. As the headline of the editorial in yesterday's Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stated, this budget deal is well-intentioned, but flawed. I am particularly concerned at what appears to be backsliding on our commitment to fiscal prudence and responsible budgeting by passing a tax cut before we have eliminated our budget deficit. As the editorial stated, `any balanced budget strategy that also cuts tax revenue is inherently risky.' 
The tax-cut package in this agreement has the strong odor of business as usual about it, a return to the 1980's when politicians stumbled over themselves to promise newer and bigger tax cuts without regard to our budget deficit. The result was an explosion of deficits and debt which has taken years to contain. Even now, we are still coping with the legacy of fiscally irresponsible tax cuts. 
I was the first Member of either body to oppose the tax cut proposals of both parties nearly 3 years ago, and I am disappointed to see that some of the concerns I expressed then have been realized. Instead of remaining focused on how to balance the budget in the near term and how to address the fiscal pressures facing the budget in the long term, much of the discussion between the negotiators of both parties amounted to a tax cut auction, with each side bidding up their own favorite tax cuts in an appeal for political credit. 
As I noted almost 3 years ago, a tax cut bidding war will only serve to undercut the efforts we have already made and the work which remains to get our budget under control. Aside from the fiscal hole tax cuts produce, they divert us from the tough and unpleasant task of finding needed spending cuts. 
Mr. President, who wouldn't rather talk about cutting taxes than cutting programs that people like? Unfortunately, to some extent, this is what has happened in the budget agreement, with the result that the goal of a balanced budget may be taking a back seat to the more politically appealing debate of how to cut taxes. 
The evidence is fairly compelling in this regard, Mr. President, and both political parties are at fault. The movement of any tax-cut bill while we are still experiencing budget deficits is the most obvious sign. Moreover, that tax cut measure has grown over the past few weeks. In order to accommodate all their constituencies, negotiators for both parties produced a tax cut package even bigger than the plan agreed to this spring. 
And, there is reason to believe that in order to accommodate this expanded tax-cut package, the budget negotiators resorted to what some would describe as accounting gimmicks. 
Mr. President, these signs all indicate a potentially troubling trend. The desire of the negotiators for an even larger tax cut was such they were willing to resort to cooking the budget books. It is fair to conclude the national priority of fiscal prudence and a balanced budget are in danger of being pushed aside by politically motivated tax-cut proposals. 
Mr. President, let me be clear. I very much want to support a significant tax cut, but I won't support one until we balance the books. We do a disservice to those who elect us if we help shift the focus away from fiscally sound budgeting and instead promote self-serving but fiscally irresponsible tax cuts. 
At the time we passed the budget resolution, I expressed my concern that while the tax cut agreement might be sustainable as part of the shorter-term budget resolution, it could become unsustainable in the long run, and I am concerned that this is just what happened. 
The tax-cut package which passed the Senate was heavily backloaded with an annual cost of $54 billion. The negotiated tax-cut package produced by the conferees is even worse, and while accounting gimmicks and timing shifts might help achieve technical balance in 2002, they do not alleviate the problems we will face when the retiring baby boomer generation will put increased pressure on the budget. According to analysis done by the tax watchdog group Citizens for Tax Justice, the actual annual cost of this tax measure will be $64 billion, even larger than the cost of the bill as it left the Senate, and over twice the annual cost of the President's proposed tax cut. 
Mr. President, as I noted before, I very much want to support a tax cut, but it simply isn't fiscally responsible to enact a tax measure with an annual cost of $64 billion before we have balanced our budget. 
Balancing the budget must be our first priority, and this tax measure is inconsistent with that goal. 
Having noted my concerns about the tax package, however, let me conclude by expressing my support for the reconciliation measure which cuts spending. As I noted earlier, the bipartisan package is truly historic, and I applaud the work done by the negotiators from both parties who helped craft that measure. 
Certainly more needs to be done. The Medicare Program needs to be further strengthened and modernized, as does the Medicaid Program. As I have stated frequently, one of our highest priorities must be to reform our current long-term care system which is largely funded through Medicaid. I have introduced legislation which would implement reforms in this area, and I very much hope we can begin that absolutely critical task soon. 
We also need to continue to cut spending in Federal programs. Though we may be on track to achieve balance in the unified budget by 2002, we must dedicate ourselves to achieving the next goal of ridding the Federal budget of its dependence on the surpluses generated by the Social Security trust fund. Those surpluses mask our true budget condition, and if we are to ensure retirees will receive the benefits to which they are entitled, we need to pursue further spending cuts now. 
We must cut spending also to begin to pay down the massive national debt, the bulk of which was generated between 1980 and 1992, and which continue to require increasingly large interest payments--payments that account for a growing portion of our annual budget. 
We must cut spending also so we can enact a fiscally responsible tax cut, one whose benefits are distributed equitably to families at all income levels. 
Finally, we need to cut spending to ensure Government works more efficiently and effectively and to bolster the credibility and national confidence in our Government. 
The work of cutting spending and reducing the deficit which was accomplished by the 1993 budget package, and to a lesser extent by the bipartisan budget plan negotiated this week, must continue. I very much hope the bipartisan efforts which led to this year's agreement can continue as we pursue those further spending cuts. 
I congratulate the negotiators from both parties for their efforts on the reconciliation measure which does the real work, the spending reduction measure, and look forward to working with them in taking the next steps toward further spending cuts to balance the budget without using Social Security trust funds, begin to pay down the national debt, fund a fiscally fair and responsible tax cut, and to make Government programs more efficient and more effective.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last week this Nation lost a true American hero with the passing of former Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. The contributions of William Brennan to our democratic way of life are many and will continue, long after his passing, to touch the lives of people all across this Nation in the most important and fundamental ways. Always a staunch and unrelenting defender of individual liberty, William Brennan helped to preserve many important rights that each of us, as Americans, enjoy today. He fought relentlessly to preserve the right to vote, the right to free expression, and the right to be treated as an equal with your fellow citizens. His legacy is one that honors the fundamental notion that in America, the individual truly does matter. 
In terms of length of service on the Supreme Court and number of opinions written, William Brennan ranks near the top. However, to reduce his career to these simple numbers is to diminish the scope and importance of William Brennan in shaping this Nation's constitutional law. Many of Brennan's most significant decisions were decided by narrow margins and it is a testament not only to the undeniability of Justice Brennan's often cited Irish charm, but also to the power of his intellect that he could draw diverse Justices together to support important decisions which he drafted. In this regard, he may never be equaled. 
Mr. President, there are many reasons to admire and respect William Brennan. He was a man of enormous dignity and compassion. His intellect and reasoning, second to none. Although there are many areas which one could point to in order to highlight the greatness of William Brennan, I will note just two that are significant to me. First, his unrelenting defense of the first amendment right to free expression. Because of William Brennan, the media in this Nation retains the right to criticize the government, to show the American people what goes on in their elected bodies--in other words, to hold us accountable. Absent this right, the credibility of our democracy and our form of government would be, in my opinion, greatly diminished. William Brennan understood that if the first amendment was to mean anything, it must protect that expression which was not popular. In upholding the first amendment in regard to flag desecration, Justice Brennan wrote that; 
If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable. 
In typical Brennan fashion, his opinion was joined by four colleagues of diverse perspectives, Justices Marshall, Blackmun, Kennedy, and Scalia. 
In regard to capital punishment, Brennan remained steadfastly opposed. Although he acknowledged that his view was the minority, he maintained until the end that the death penalty was violative of the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. In his estimation, a system which treated human beings as nonhuman or objects simply to be toyed with and disregarded was simply not protected by the U.S. Constitution. In the wake of Justice Brennan's death I am reminded that just a few short weeks ago, a Member of the House of Representatives who supports the death penalty, stated on a national news program that someday in America we will execute an innocent person. He argued that while we don't want to do that, and will try to prevent it, it is an inevitable consequence of having capital punishment. This is a staggering, yet candid, statement which I think, makes Justice Brennan's point in a very stark and chilling way. Justice Brennan may well have been on the minority on capital punishment Mr. President, that is not to say however, that his position was incorrect. 
Mr. President, there is no question that Justice Brennan was a man that I admired. His opinions were reasoned, intelligent, and always consistent with the notion that in America the rights of the individual, no matter his or her background, upbringing, political ideology, or religious beliefs, mattered. That simple, yet often overlooked notion is the foundation of our democracy and was the cornerstone of Justice Brennan's approach to the law. He was truly the most influential Justice of his time. And while I certainly add my name to the list of those who mourn his passing, I also join those who celebrate the richness of his life and the countless opinions which helped improve the lot of millions of Americans. Ours is a better Nation because of William Brennan. 
However, Mr. President, the greatest measure of William Brennan is not one taken from afar--from simply reading his opinions or following the public persona--but from those closest to him, his family, friends, and those who sat with him on the bench. In this regard the comments of his colleagues are telling. Justice Souter called Brennan the most fearlessly principled guardian of the Constitution that has ever lived. Justice Scalia, a jurist often at philosophical odds with Brennan called him the most influential Justice of this century. Justice Kennedy called him a great friend of freedom, not only for those who enjoy freedom, but also those who seek it. Justice Clarence Thomas was quoted recently as saying that there simply isn't a more decent or brilliant human being than William Brennan. From these great jurists of diverse backgrounds and ideological perspective, the message is the same; William Brennan's contribution was undeniable, important, and lasting. It is not surprising Mr. President, that even in saying good-bye, Justice Brennan has once again forged a diverse coalition.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I require. 
Mr. President, it is truly a pleasure to be here on the floor with my friend and colleague and fellow campaign finance reformer from Arizona, the senior Senator, Mr. McCain, as well as our other colleagues who join with us today, including the junior Senator from Maine, Senator Collins, and shortly expected the senior Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, and, of course, my good friend, the junior Senator from Georgia, Mr. Cleland. 
We are all among a group of 33 Members of this body who have already cosponsored the McCain-Feingold legislation. As the Senator from Arizona said, we are here today to announce that we will be seeking consideration of bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation during the month of September. 
We will continue our discussions, as the Senator from Arizona indicated, with the majority leader. And I am hopeful that we will be able to reach a compromise that will allow us to have an open public debate on this issue, and allow all Senators the opportunity to participate in offering amendments to our proposal. 
However, as the Senator from Arizona has just indicated, if such an agreement with the majority leader cannot be reached, we are prepared to use other legislative proposals as a vehicle for campaign finance reform. That is not our preference. But we are committed to having a discussion of this issue and making sure there are votes on campaign finance reform during the month of September. 
We have said for some time now--and the Senator from Arizona just reiterated--that our bipartisan proposal is far from perfect. We have repeatedly told Senators on both sides of the aisle that we are open to making changes for modifications to this package. We do have some fundamental issues, however, that we will not waiver on. 
First, this proposal will ban soft money. The days when corporations, labor unions, and wealthy individuals could make unlimited contributions to the national parties will be over. 
Second, the proposal must try to level the playing field between incumbents and challengers. Currently, we have a system that provides incumbent Senators with a reelection rate of 90 to 95 percent and provides virtually no assistance to legitimate challengers who are essentially being shut out of the democratic process. 
We must provide an opportunity for candidates, particularly underfunded challengers taking on well-entrenched incumbents, to run a competitive campaign without having to raise and spend millions of dollars. 
Finally, Mr. President, whatever package of reforms we consider and whatever modifications we are willing to make, those reforms must be balanced and bipartisan. 
I am pleased at this point, Mr. President, to insert into the Record a statement today from the President of the United States, William J. Clinton, with regard to the campaign finance reform legislation. 
Mr. President, I would now like to read from the President's statement, which he asked us to present as a part of this presentation. 
The President says: 
In my State-of-the-Union Address, I called on Congress to enact bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation. I said that delay could be the death of reform, and urged Congress to move forward quickly. I strongly support the decision by Senators McCain and Feingold to bring campaign finance reform legislation to the floor of Congress in September for a vote. 
The problem with the role of money in presidential and congressional elections are plain. Since the campaign finance laws were last overhauled two and a half decades ago, the system has been overwhelmed by a flood of campaign cash. Both political parties are now engaged in an ever-escalating arms race for campaign funds. The consequences for our political system are clear; there is too much money in politics, and it takes too much time to raise. 
To make sure that ordinary citizens have the loudest voice in our democracy, we must act to change the campaign finance laws. This year, I have asked the FEC to ban so called `soft money' to parties; I have asked the Federal Communications Commission to require broadcasters to provide free TV time to candidates; and the Justice Department has indicated it will defend spending limits in the courts. But these steps, however important, are no substitute for legislation. America needs--and the American people demand--strong, comprehensive campaign finance reform legislation. As the new century approaches, we have an opportunity and an obligation to restore the trust of the American people in their politics--and this is our chance to do it. 
For years, the special interests and their allies have blocked reform. This year, those who seek to continue special interest influence as usual will filibuster again. But this year, we have an opportunity to come together across party lines to act and pass reform that cleans up the campaign finance system. September will be the time for members of the Senate to stand up and be counted for reform. I will do what I can to see to it that 1997 is finally the year that it is achieved. 
Mr. President, we welcome the support and enthusiasm of the President of the United States for our effort. 
The Senators who are here on the floor today have joined together across party and ideological lines to produce a compromise package that I like to refer to as moderate, mutual disarmament. 
We have already heard the top 10 excuses for why we can't pass campaign finance reform. And frankly, I am amazed at some of the absurd arguments we have heard from opponents of reform. 
We have been told, ridiculously enough, that there is not enough money flowing through our campaign system. That argument, incidently, is greeted with laughter every time I tell my constituents in Wisconsin that there are some folks in Washington who actually believe we need more money in our political system. 
We have been told that our proposal is somehow inconsistent with the first amendment--a giant red herring given that a number of the leading nonpartisan, first amendment scholars in the country, including the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, have all said otherwise. 
We have been told that reform is not possible without a constitutional amendment, an argument all too familiar to those of us who were told that we could not have a balanced budget without a constitutional amendment. 
We have been told that the Senate does not have enough courage to pass meaningful reform and that, once again, we should delegate responsibility to some sort of commission. 
We have been told by some that this bill goes too far, and interestingly, by others that it does not go far enough. Some might point to that as the working definition of a moderate proposal. 
We have been told that the American people do not care about this issue, despite numerous public opinion polls demonstrating 80 to 90 percent of the American people in support of these reforms. 
We have been told that this issue requires further study, despite 29 sets of hearings, 76 CRS reports and 522 different witnesses testifying on this issue over the last decade. 
We have been told that the outrageous fundraising practices that we witnessed in the last election and which have spawned congressional investigations, a Justice Department investigation, an FBI investigation, and a CIA investigation, and have led to charges of espionage, corruption and undue influence were `a healthy sign of a vibrant democracy.' 
In short Mr. President, we have heard more phony excuses than are heard by a high school vice-principal's office. 
Fortunately, no one is buying these excuses. Not the Senators who are standing here on the floor today and certainly not the American people. 
I look forward to having a public discussion during the month of September about the role of money in our political system. And I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in passing meaningful, bipartisan campaign finance reform in 1997. 
Mr. President, I want to conclude, as the Senator from Arizona did, by just mentioning the folks that are here on the floor with us today. Obviously, I have already talked about my great feelings about working with Senator McCain on this, but I know that the other three Senators we are going to hear from--Senator Collins, Senator Levin, and Senator Cleland--who are all members of the Governmental Affairs Committee, are intimately aware of what is wrong with our system. They have taken the time to come down here today to put forth a message, as Senator Cleland has done so well at the hearings. He has asked a number of witnesses, `Would these things have happened had McCain-Feingold been enacted?' The answer in every case was, `No.' 
So that is the challenge before us. 
Mr. President, at this point I would like to yield such time as she requires to the Senator from Maine.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for an excellent presentation this morning. We are very much looking forward to September. 
Let me include, because know various Senators have to go to Governmental Affairs Committee, one last anecdote. The chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Thompson, the other day heard reference to the McCain-Feingold bill, and he corrected it saying it's actually been called the McCain-Feingold-Thompson bill. I think that is a good sign for the future of our legislation. 
I thank the Chair.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last month, this Nation lost one of its most distinguished scholars when J. Willard Hurst, Emeritus Professor of Law at the University of Wisconsin, died at his home. He was 86. 
Professor Hurst was that wonderful and rare combination of truly gifted scholar and great teacher. Indeed, his scholarship was so profound, it was responsible for the creation of a new field of study, and today Willard Hurst is widely recognized as the Founding Father of American legal history. 
Hurst was born in Rockford, IL in 1910. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Williams College in 1932 and went on to Harvard Law School, where he graduated at the top of his class in 1935. 
Hurst worked as a research fellow for Prof. Felix Frankfurter, who was later named to the U.S. Supreme Court, and clerked for Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis before heading to Wisconsin, at Brandeis's suggestion, where he joined the University of Wisconsin law school faculty. 
When Hurst first joined the law school faculty, Dean Lloyd Garrison encouraged him to design a program in law and society that investigated how the State's legal system and economy related to each other. Hurst began that project by studying the law's impact on the State's lumber industry, research that would result in his seminal work, `Law and Economic Growth: The Legal History of the Wisconsin Lumber Industry.' That landmark study chronicled the social and economic forces that shaped and used the laws of property, contracts, accident compensation, and other legal areas to destroy the greatest natural stand of timber in the world between 1830 and 1900. 
That work was a classic application of the new scholarly discipline of American legal history, a discipline Hurst himself had created--his great legacy and a field he dominated directly or indirectly even in retirement. As Lawrence M. Friedman of Stanford Law School was quoted as saying of legal historians, `You're either a Hurstian or a revisor of Hurst.' 
In a 1990 article in the New York Times about Professor Hurst, David Margolick wrote of the state of the study of law when Hurst attended law school. `The law was a self-contained science and the law library its laboratory,' Margolick reported. `One need not study how law actually affected people or how legal institutions evolved; all wisdom could be gleaned from appellate decisions. This approach not only gave law professors a shot at omniscience but also spared them from having to learn other disciplines, set foot in a courtroom or state legislature, or even step outside.' As 
Margolick added, from the moment he arrived at the University of Wisconsin Law School, Professor Hurst changed all that. 
University of Wisconsin Emeritus Law Professor Bill Foster said Hurst forced people to think of problems separate from the law in an historic sense and think about the economic, social and political consequences. `He trained us to see around corners.' As Stanford Professor Hendrik Hartog noted, Hurst's interest in the relationship between the law and social sciences, especially economics, was really a study of how law was experienced by people. 
That approach to studying law found a nurturing home at the University of Wisconsin, which was heavily influenced by the so-called Wisconsin Idea, the Progressive Era philosophy which encouraged scholars to view the entire State as their campus, and which envisioned academics as a vital resource for reform-minded government. 
Willard Hurst and Wisconsin were a perfect match. Hurst loved Wisconsin. On three occasions he turned down offers to be Dean of the Yale Law School. He also turned down the offer of a chair at Harvard. Hurst said, `I guess I was just too pleasure-loving. I was having too good a time in Wisconsin.' 
At Wisconsin, Hurst was a prolific writer, contributing to law reviews, writing articles, and authoring over a dozen books, including `The Law Makers' (1950), `Law and Conditions of Freedom' (1956), `Law and Social Process in U.S. History' (1960), `Justice Holmes on Legal History' (1964), and `A Legal History of Money in the United States' (1973). 
Hurst was more than a great original thinker. He was an enormously talented and caring teacher. Robben Fleming, former president of the University of Michigan and former Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin, said that Hurst was the finest teacher he ever had. University of Wisconsin Law Professor Stewart Macaulay said Hurst was wonderfully generous. `What Willard would do is go out to lunch with someone who was an absolute beginner. He would give you time, make incredible suggestions, make contacts for you.' 
Willard Hurst continued to be an academic force in retirement with a steady flow of research and writing. As Margolick reported in the Times, even in retirement Hurst remained one of the few legal scholars whose work could be `measured in shelf feet--and shelf feet of bona fide research rather than cut-and-paste cases and comments.' 
A number of his books became standard texts for law students. In fact, I still remember of the five books I was asked to read before I entered Harvard Law School, two were written by Willard Hurst. 
As the acknowledged grandfather of American legal history, Hurst's legacy is not only a new field of study, but generations of law students, and dozens of distinguished scholars. Willard Hurst was a giant intellect, but a gentle giant who cared about his students and who loved his adopted State. I was privileged to have known him.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment offered by Senator Grams which has been agreed to today and it has been my pleasure to work with the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Grams] and the Senators from Vermont [Mr. Leahy and Mr. Jeffords] to reach an agreement to require the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to study the impacts of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. I appreciate the cooperation of the senior Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran] and the senior Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] in reaching agreement on this amendment. 
Mr. President, the amendment we have offered today is an extremely reasonable amendment on which all Senators should agree. This amendment simply requires that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget study the economic effects of implementation of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact with respect to consumers, dairy farmers outside the compact as well as on vital low income nutrition programs such as the National School Lunch Program, the School Breakfast Program, and the Summer Food Service Program all offer milk to children from low-income families. The congressional oversight provided by this amendment is the responsible thing to do and I am pleased that the managers of the bill and the compact supporters have agreed to have this study conducted. 
The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact was included in the conference report of the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, or farm bill, despite the fact the full Senate decisively struck the compact from the Senate bill by a vote of 50 to 46. The compact was in neither the Senate farm bill nor the House version of the farm bill as passed by both Chambers. 
It is unfortunate that the will of the Senate was undermined by the backroom agreements of the conference committee. That conference agreement further undermined the authority of the Congress by improperly delegating to the Secretary of Agriculture the ability to consent to the compact, regardless of the national public interest. This amendment will help us to determine whether the public interest is subverted by the compact. 
And the public interest is definitely implicated by the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The compact allows six States to fix milk prices paid to dairy farmers well beyond the minimum price specified under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. The compact also allows those six States to keep out milk produced by farmers from other parts of the country, regardless of how competitively that milk is priced. The compact provides competitive credits, or subsidies, to compact milk processors in order to allow them to sell their milk outside of the compact region. Meanwhile, the compact fails to protect consumers from increased prices and does not have any mechanism in place to protect farmers outside the compact from the actions of dairy farmers in six States who are isolated from the market conditions that non-compact producers face. 
Mr. President, up to this point both the concern about, and the promise of, the Northeast Dairy Compact has been conjecture. But now that the compact has gone into effect we will have hard data to examine its economic impacts. 
The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission fixed the price of fluid milk in the compact region at $16.94 per hundredweight on July 1, 1997. That price is a full $3.00 above the price Northeast farmers would have received in July under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. As many of the compact opponents had predicted, the retail price of fluid milk has increased by as much as 26 cents per gallon--a full cost increase pass through to consumers--something the compact proponents said would never happen. 
And media in the Northeast report on farmers who are now considering adding more cows to their herds to increase their production and income when in fact, compact proponents suggested that the compact would not increase milk production in the Northeast. These production increases in the compact region come at a time when producers in the 44 other States are facing 6-year low prices due to excess dairy product stocks. At a time when the market is sending the dairy industry the signal to cut back of supplies, the compact farmers are getting the signal to increase production. 
Furthermore, anecdotal reports from milk buyers in the Northeast suggest that excess milk production from the Northeast is already being dumped on States outside of the region at prices less than half the price being paid to compact producers. Farmers fear this excess milk will depress prices nationally which are already at devastatingly low levels. Yet compact opponents were assured that no milk would be dumped outside of the compact because the compact was a net milk importer. 
Mr. President, given that many of the things compact proponents said could never happen appear to be happening--increased consumer costs, increased milk production, lower priced exports of milk from the compact region--we must take a careful look at the impacts of this compact. 
We must scrutinize how the compact affects our vital low-income nutrition programs. The National School Lunch Program serves 25 million children daily and in 1996 served 4.3 billion lunches. The six compact States alone served 170 million school lunches in 1996, nearly all of which were served with milk. Milk is also a component of the School Breakfast Program, the Summer Food Service Program, the Child and Adult Care Food Program and the Special Milk Program, programs all offered in the compact States. 
If the cost of milk to consumers is going up in the compact region due to compact milk price, the value of food stamps for poor families may be declining, costs to schools, summer food service institutions and child and adult care facilities are likely increasing as their per meal reimbursement remains flat and the cost of the milk they serve increases, and the food dollars of low-income families are likely not stretching as far as they used to. It is absolutely critical that we determine the impact of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact on 
 these vital nutrition programs and I am surprised that compact proponents do not agree. 
The amendment that has been accepted today will help determine whether or not the benefit of the compact exceeds the financial cost to dairy producers in other States. 
The Northeast dairy compact has been extremely controversial in the U.S. Senate because it takes an entirely regional approach to dairy policy, walling off a few farmers in six States from the conditions faced by tens of thousands of dairy farmers elsewhere. And Mr. President I believe the Northeast dairy compact will ultimately harm Wisconsin's 24,000 dairy farmers. But I also believe it will hurt dairy farmers in the 44 non-compact States such as California, Washington, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Idaho, and Indiana, among others. 
Milk is produced and marketed in a national, not a regional market. And what happens with respect to milk prices and production levels in one region has national repercussions. Wisconsin's family farmers, with an average herd size of 55 cows, are concerned that increased production in the Northeast spurred on by the high compact milk price, will depress prices throughout the Nation. Farmers who are suffering from the current national $10.74 basic milk price cannot afford to suffer further price declines due to increased milk production from the Northeast. Furthermore, as history has shown increased milk production in one region in surplus of what is needed for fluid purposes results in surplus production of cheese, butter and similar product. This in turn depresses cheese prices which directly impact prices paid to producers. These concerns are serious and the compact must be carefully evaluated to determine if compact farmers are producing too much milk to the detriment of non-compact farmers. 
Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate today has recognized the obligation of this body in ensuring that the compact is carefully monitored and its impacts scrutinized. 
Mr. President, I remain strongly opposed to the compact and will continue to work toward its repeal. The compact sets a dangerous precedent in allowing one region to fix prices for its producers to the detriment of non-compact producers. I believe the Northeast dairy compact will harm the 24,000 family dairy farmers in my State of Wisconsin. Hopefully the information that may be gathered by the study required by our amendment will help persuade the Senate that it erred in allowing the inclusion of the amendment in the 1996 Farm bill. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as many in this body know, I have been concerned that while the total number of Federal employees has been reduced in recent years, the same cannot be said of executive branch political appointees. 
Indeed, between 1980 and 1992 the number of political appointees grew 17 percent, three times as fast as the total number of executive branch employees. 
Mr. President, let me emphasize that political appointees play a vital role in implementing those very policies for which an administration is elected in the first place. Political appointees often also bring backgrounds rich in experience as well as a fresh perspective that can strengthen our Government. 
But as many distinguished observers have noted, too many political appointees may actually interfere with the efficient and effective implementation of administration policies. Author Paul Light has documented this problem in his book `Thickening Government: Federal Government and the Diffusion of Accountability.' 
Various public commissions and Government watchdog groups have also voiced concerns from the 1989 National Commission on Public Service, chaired by Paul Volcker, to the Congressional Budget Office, and most recently the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on the Presidential Appointment Process, chaired by two former Members of this body, former Senators John Culver and Charles Mathias. 
Mr. President, I have introduced legislation to cap the number of political appointees at 2,000, a level which represents a reduction of about 30 percent from current levels. That proposal is identical to the recommendation of both the Volcker Commission and the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force, and also mirrors a proposal by the Congressional Budget Office which is included in their publication of spending and revenue options to reduce the deficit. My bill would save taxpayers over $330 million during the next 5 years. Just as important, bringing the number of political appointees to a more manageable level will enhance flexibility and increase the ability of the President to implement administration policies. 
Mr. President, this administration has a commendable record in bringing the overall growth of the Federal employees under control, and, in fact, beginning to reduce the number by several hundred thousand. 
And recently, I was encouraged to see that work also began with respect to political appointees in the Commerce Department, an agency where the growing number of appointees has been a particular concern. 
Mr. President, while I believe we have a long way to go in this area, there has been some progress made by the administration and I will not offer my legislation as an amendment to this particular bill as I have in the past. 
I firmly believe further work is needed in this area, however, and I will be following the progress made by the administration in reducing the number of political appointees with great interest.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as someone gravely concerned with the human rights situation in East Timor, I am pleased to see strong language regarding military sales to Indonesia included in the foreign operations appropriations. I would like to commend the managers of the bill, the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] and the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for including this provision. 
The bill states that any agreement to sell, license for export, or transfer lethal military equipment or helicopters to Indonesia must include a statement that these items will not be used in East Timor. 
I am pleased with this language because it is important to remind Indonesia that Congress is still very concerned about the situation in East Timor. The May 29 Indonesian elections spurred new violence in East Timor. In the weeks surrounding the voting, fighting between Indonesian troops and East Timorese rebels resulted in dozens of casualties on both sides. These deaths were only the latest in the troubled region, which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1975. Human rights monitors estimate that as many as 200,000 East Timorese have died since the occupation. 
Mr. President, as we all know, the Indonesian Government announced last month that it was no longer interested in participating in IMET or purchasing F-16 fighters. Congress should not relax our scrutiny of Indonesia's human rights practices and policies in East Timor just because these high-profile deals have been canceled. 
Human rights organizations have expressed concerns that helicopters may be used against civilians in East Timor. Thus it is important to ensure that any such hardware provided by the United States is not used for internal repression. Certainly the answer to the East Timor problem does not lie in further arming the Indonesian military and police forces. Thus I am also pleased that the administration has reaffirmed its existing policy of precluding the sale to Indonesia of small arms, riot control equipment, and armored personnel carriers. 
The bill's provision strengthens this policy, reflecting Congress' continued concerns.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from Kentucky about committee report language directing that no peacekeeping funds be made available for the Africa crisis response initiative [ACRI]. I understand the House version of this bill and the accompanying report contain no such restrictions. 
I understand further that the Committee on Appropriations has raised several concerns about this initiative which are currently being resolved by the administration. 
Therefore, I wonder if the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations will be looking to support the House mark in the peacekeeping account and to revise the report language in conference to reflect this change, along with continuing concerns.

Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his cooperation on this matter. I want to take a few moments to express my views on the ACRI. 
Mr. President, I was disappointed to read in the report on this bill that the Committee on Appropriations directed `that no funds be made available for the Africa Crisis Response Force,' an earlier title of what the administration now refers to as the Africa Crisis Response Initiative [ACRI]. This language would prohibit the administration's flexibility to use up to $15 million of the peacekeeping account for this initiative. 
The ACRI, in my view, is an inventive proposal on the part of the administration. It seeks to expand the capacity of qualified African militaries to respond to peacekeeping needs in Africa by merging the resources of the United States and several of our European partners to provide peacekeeping training. The ACRI would help create effective, rapidly deployable peacekeeping units that would be able to operate together. Such an initiative could ultimately reduce the burden on U.S. resources in the event of a major humanitarian or other crisis in the region. 
Let me elaborate on what we are talking about. The Africa Crisis Response Initiative would provide training to selected African militaries to raise their capabilities to a common peacekeeping standard derived from United States, British, Nordic, and United Nations doctrine. In most cases, this will involve intensive training over a 2-month period in any single country, and will include important train-the-trainer activities so that additional instruction may take place after the international representatives have departed. 
Troops will be trained in tasks common to peacekeeping operations and on how to utilize common communications equipment. Equally as important, they will also receive instruction in civil-military relations and respect for human rights. U.S. trainers intend to use nongovernmental and private voluntary organizations in the training where possible. Any equipment that is provided to the participating countries would be nonlethal in nature and could include items to support mine detection, water purification, or night vision. 
Already several African countries have told United States officials they would like to participate in the ACRI, including Ethiopia, Uganda, Ghana, Mali, Senegal, and Malawi. Senegal and Uganda will begin training at the end of this month. It is also important that the Secretaries General of the United Nations and the Organization for African Unity have indicated their support. I should also note that this proposal is strongly supported by the U.S. Joint Staff and by our military command in Europe--the United States European Command [EUCOM]. 
The ACRI proposal appeals to me because it provides a mechanism through which the United States can both contribute to the resolution of crises in the region, while at the same time, help ensure that the United States will not bear the total burden of doing so. By having ready, trained troops on the ground in Africa, the ACRI would decrease the time it takes to respond to local crises. But most importantly, if the proposal is implemented as intended, it would decrease the amount of outside support the Africans would require and preclude the need to send American combat troops to the region when there is a crisis. The ACRI is a means to provide appropriate African governments with a capacity they have said they want--the capability to respond to regional crises. 
This is a concept that I have been pondering for several years. A 1994 trip to Liberia later heightened my interest. At the time, many observers were convinced that the only way to solve the crisis in Liberia, a country wracked with civil war since 1989, was to deploy a large force of American soldiers to stop the fighting and then maintain the peace. 
Like many other Americans, I opposed the deployment of American troops for this purpose. But I became intrigued with an alternative that had been employed in Liberia since 1990--an all African peacekeeping force. This force, the West African peacekeeping force known by its French acronym ECOMOG, has not--by any definition--been a perfect mission, and has certainly had its share of problems. But after many fits and starts, ECOMOG troops have succeeded in establishing security in the country such that Liberians will have the opportunity to safely go to the polls this weekend to participate in an important national election. The United States has made important contributions to this effort in the form of airlift and other logistical support to ECOMOG. 
While I do not want to put too much reliance in the ECOMOG experience itself, since its record has been mixed, I think we can draw at least two important lessons. First, African governments do want to contribute to maintaining peace in neighboring countries. Second, the United States can support those efforts by sharing our strengths in areas such as technical assistance, logistics, and communications, for example. Our European partners would make similar contributions. 
That is what this proposal is all about. It is a cooperative effort to which all participants contribute. 
Despite my enthusiasm for this initiative, Mr. President, I would also caution the administration on the tough choices it may soon have to make with respect to which countries can and should be invited to participate in the ACRI. When the administration first explored this proposal, it presented its preliminary ideas to 10 governments. These countries were understood to have excellent relations with the United States, as well as relatively disciplined militaries and democratic governments. It is my view that such qualities should represent the minimum standards for the United States to engage in the high-level military contact envisioned by the ACRI proposal. 
As beneficial as the ACRI will be for the United States, it is also beneficial for the African countries involved. Congress will look harshly at any decisions that might be made to work with a government that has come to power through military action or that abuses the rights of its citizens. I have concerns in particular about the possibility of including the Government of Nigeria in this initiative. While I recognize the strength of Nigeria's military and the important contribution it has made to the peacekeeping effort in Liberia, the Government's continued disdain for the needs of its people and continued human rights abuses I believe should preclude it from participation in the ACRI. 
Mr. President, in the long term, the administration anticipates that the trained and ready forces that have benefited from the ACRI will be able to respond quickly to crises in the region with African troops led by Africans. Although I can foresee that the international community might still be called upon to provide logistics assistance in certain cases, I believe strongly that technical assistance of that nature is an appropriate response for the United States. 
With the rising number of conflicts in the post-cold-war era, American troops are being called on more than ever to participate in peacekeeping operations that just are not tenable. The ACRI provides a creative way to respond to these demands while decreasing the need to deploy our own men and women. 
Mr. President, I hope the conferees will agree on funding and language that will allow the administration to continue to pursue this creative approach to crisis intervention in Africa. The ACRI strengthens regional abilities to respond in a rapid and effective manner, rather than calling for direct United States or European intervention.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk on behalf of myself and the distinguished Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] and the senior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain]. This amendment is the product of negotiations of a number of Senators and provides that none of the funds appropriated in this bill for the Animas-La Plata project can be expended for construction until the Secretary of Interior submits a report on a new scaled-down project design and the new project is actually authorized by Congress at a date subsequent to the date of the enactment of this bill. 
Mr. President, what this amendment means is that we will stop and evaluate what should be done before we spend more Federal dollars on this project. As colleagues may recall from my statement last year on this matter, the currently authorized Animas-La Plata project is a taxpayer-funded water development project planned for southwest Colorado and northwest New Mexico. The project is designed to supply 191,230 feet of water. The Animas-La Plata project consists of two major reservoirs, 7 pumping plants and 20 miles of canals and pipes and will pump water over 1,000 feet uphill, consuming enough power to run a city of 60,000 people to supply municipal, industrial and irrigation interests. 
Last Tuesday, Mr. President, prior to the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee markup of the legislation that is before this body, those who support the construction of the Animas-La Plata project announced that they have developed what they believe to be a cheaper and scaled-down alternative. The announcement of an alternative sends a clear signal to this body. After 30 years and $71 million in appropriations to date, the project costs of Animas-La Plata are too great and there are too many lingering substantive questions to proceed with the original design. 
As I indicated during the discussion over the fiscal year 1997 energy and water appropriations legislation, I do support the search for an alternative to Animas-La Plata. In fact, legislation that I introduced on March 13, 1997, cosponsored also by the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] and also by the Presiding Officer, the Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] and sponsored in the other body by my colleague from Wisconsin [Mr. Petri] and the Congressman from New York [Mr. DeFazio], deauthorizes the current Animas-La Plata reclamation project and directs the Secretary of the Interior to work with the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute tribes to find an alternative to satisfy their water rights needs. 
However, the taxpayers should not continue to be asked to sock money away in Bureau of Reclamation construction accounts as a placeholder for an option that has not yet fully been analyzed and authorized. 
This new alternative by the proponents has not had a full cost evaluation by the Department of Interior and, of greater concern to me, requires statutory changes to be implemented that I think should be reviewed by the authorizing committee in question. 
It is the jurisdiction of this body's Energy Committee to determine the benefits of a reclamation project, and it is the responsibility of the Interior Department to make certain that the Federal Government's legal responsibilities to the Ute tribes under any sort of an agreement are met. 
This revised project, which would be evaluated by the Department of Interior under our amendment, at a minimum may require major changes to several relevant laws and agreements. The 1986 Ute Settlement Agreement may have to be renegotiated to reflect changes in water allocations among parties to the agreement, particularly the reduced quantity of water, changes in contract and repayment requirements and obligations and changes in cost-sharing requirements. The 1988 Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act may also need changes to conform to a new agreement and new requirements. 
Finally, the Water Supply Act of 1958 would need to be changed to modify or waive current requirements that the beneficiaries of municipal and industrial water repay the Federal Government for construction costs with interest and pay for the Bureau of Reclamation operations and maintenance costs that are attributable to the amount of water they receive. 
Let me make it clear, Mr. President, because we will be reauthorizing this project at some date in the future, the language in this amendment allows the Secretary to explore and recommend any appropriate alternative, including nonstructural alternatives, in developing a revised plan for submission to Congress. 
These issues will all be assessed under the amendment we are offering before any funds can be expended in the construction of a new project. I think this is a responsible way to proceed, and I am pleased that so many Members of the Senate have worked together toward this amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.

Mr. FEINGOLD. I also want to make one thing clear. In contrast to the Senator from Colorado, this amendment provides for the authorizing committee to act on a revised project plan. It does not put into effect the alternative plan. It does not prejudge what the project will look like. It allows full public hearings before Congress acts. It does not strike any funds, it simply says the funds in the bill cannot be expended for construction of a new project until it is authorized. I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, last week, the Senate expressed in very clear terms its view that the United States' mission in Bosnia should be terminated by next June, which is the administration's stated deadline. This was not a position that was taken without public debate. In fact, the Senate debate regarding the Bosnia operation began last Thursday evening and continued well into Friday morning. A number of Senators were involved in the debate at various times during the consideration of the DOD bill. Quite frankly, Mr. President, as we well know, there were some Senators--including the Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden] and the Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner]--who did express their disagreement with having a date certain for termination of U.S. ground troop deployment. Mr. President, they were clearly in the minority on this issue. 
The Senate took this action regarding an end date as part of one of the most important pieces of defense related legislation--the Department of Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. Mr. President, let me remind my colleagues what we did this past Friday. Indeed, one of the reasons that I pressed so hard to have a Bosnia-related provision added to that bill was because of the importance of having this debate on the DOD authorization itself. 
Now, today, we have begun consideration of the other key defense bill--the Department of Defense appropriations bill. As in the authorization bill, I do not think we can let the fact that we currently have 8,000 of our troops in Bosnia go unnoticed during a debate on the Department of Defense appropriations. 
Just 3 days ago, we passed an amendment to the defense authorization bill that clearly states the Senate's desire to have United States troops out of Bosnia no later than June 30, 1998. The resolution we passed was a modification of an amendment I had introduced that would have imposed a hard, statutory requirement that the administration stick to its announced pullout date of June 30, 1998. My original amendment was virtually identical to the one that passed the other body, the House, on a vote of 278-148 that literally cut off funding for the Bosnia mission after that June 30 date. 
The message of the action, Mr. President, in both the House and the Senate is crystal clear: It is the overwhelming desire of the Congress that the administration pull our brave men and women out of Bosnia by June 30, 1998. 
In light of these strong messages, Mr. President, I was somewhat disappointed in what I read in the papers over the weekend. Only 1 day after the Senate passed its resolution, President Clinton publicly stated what I am afraid the administration has been thinking all along--the possibility that the deployment of United States troops in Bosnia may well continue after the present mission expires. Let's not forget, this is already a major extension from the original date when it was supposed to terminate, which was approximately the end of December 1996. 
The President said, `I believe the present operation will have run its course by then'--referring to the June deadline--`and we'll have to discuss what, if any, involvement the United States should have there.' Meanwhile, the White House said that an international presence will be necessary in Bosnia for perhaps a considerable time past June 1998. 
Now, Mr. President, I fear these statements send the wrong message. By making these remarks, the administration is hinting that the United States might be willing to sign on to a new mission once the mandate of the NATO-led stabilization force, or SFOR, has run out. Mr. President, I think it frighteningly opens the door for additional U.S. troop involvement after that time. Now, this is contrary to what Congress has said, that the U.S. troops should be on the way home next June, not starting a new mission. There should be no maybes about the continued involvement of U.S. 
ground troops past the clear deadline that has been set by the administration and endorsed by both Houses of Congress. 
Mr. President, in 1995, President Clinton asked Congress to approve the deployment of United States troops to Bosnia, with an understanding. The understanding was that our military personnel would remain there for just 1 year. Well, as we all know, after the 1 year the original implementation force was turned into a stabilization force and renamed from IFOR to SFOR. It just kept on going. And as a result, the United States has kept 8,000 of our troops in the region under the premise that SFOR was somehow a completely new mission. But it obviously is not. 
I also do not need to remind everyone, I hope, of the ballooning costs of the Bosnia mission. This is really quite startling to me. Despite original estimates in the $2 billion range, we are now committed to pay at least, Mr. President, $7.7 billion, and it is going up. When I first raised this issue this year on the supplemental bill, the figure I brought to the floor was $6.5 billion. Now it is already up to $7.7 billion a few short weeks later. Every time there is an assessment of the cost of this mission, the figure goes up another $1 billion or $2 billion. 
After this weekend, I have a new fear that when the June deadline rolls around this mission will undergo another name change. Maybe the `stabilization' force will become the `coordination' force, or CFOR. Maybe it will become the `maintenance' force, or MFOR. Whatever the new acronym is, Mr. President, I am afraid the results will be the same--our ground troops will be asked to remain in Bosnia past June under the pretense of a new mission. 
Now, I don't doubt for a minute, Mr. President, that United States goals in Bosnia are to maintain the peace and to help the three sides rebuild a united government. While our mission has succeeded in stopping the fighting, we are far behind in preparing for the day when Bosnians will once again have to rule themselves without the benefit of NATO troops. In a May study of the Bosnia mission, the GAO noted there has been little progress in creating a united police force, or on building a functioning parliament, or even setting up offices for a new Bosnian cabinet. 
Mr. President, the best way to ensure that something never gets done is to constantly extend the deadline. If a teacher were to give his or her students a term paper assignment and tell them, `try to get it done by this year and, if that's not possible, maybe next year,' you can bet that the students will not be rushing off to the library to get the work done. In a way, that is a little like what we are doing in Bosnia. We are saying, `try to comply with the Dayton accords by June, but if you can't, we'll stick around anyway.' It is no wonder the various parties in Bosnia are not making much headway in rebuilding their civilian institutions, given that NATO and the United States seem committed, it appears, to policing this country indefinitely. 
Similarly, I do not think that our European allies will take seriously their own responsibilities to the region unless they clearly understand American intentions. I think that's why the compromise resolution the Senate passed last week actually included language that the President should inform our partners in Europe in this exercise of the expression of this Congress--tell them that we are planning to leave by June 30, 1998. I think this is a very important part of the Senate's position on this issue. 
The administration, our friends in Europe, and the parties to this conflict must all understand that this Congress does consider the June deadline a firm one. That is not to say that at the end of next June there will be no more American involvement in the region. That is not my position. I don't think that is the position of most Senators. As the Senate resolution indicates, Congress would be open to considering a different kind of supporting role in Bosnia. This could include activities such as airlift, logistics, intelligence, or equipment, for example. As long as such activities do not include the use of ground forces, and as long as the Congress is appropriately consulted, I too am 
open to considering the United States having such a supportive role for our allies. That is not inconsistent with the notion of making sure ground troops come home. 
Mr. President, there are many who feel uncomfortable with Congress actually using its literal `power of the purse' to command a withdrawal of U.S. troops from a military deployment. During the debate last week, some Members who firmly support termination of the Bosnia deployment by the June target date did express concern about the mechanism--a hard funding cutoff--that I had originally proposed. However, I want to point out that the reason Members of Congress turn to these drastic remedies, the reason I proposed it in the first place, and the reason the House passed such a hard date overwhelmingly is precisely because not only the administration but also some leaders in Congress seem oblivious to the calls by other Members of Congress for ending the mission by the target date. 
Given the statements we heard this weekend, Mr. President, it is even more imperative than ever that the conferees employ the strongest possible language regarding the June 30 pullout date when we get to the final version of the Defense authorization bill. I originally believed that a hard mandate--nearly 1 year in advance of that date--would give the administration more than enough time to prepare for and to implement an orderly withdrawal of U.S. ground forces. 
Unlike the President's remarks, the message from the Congress has to leave no room for interpretation or ambiguity. We should not just say that our ground troops should be back home next year, if possible. I think we have to say, as we have done in both Houses--and we have to say this in the conference report--that our men and women should be out of Bosnia by June 30, 1998, period. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment instructing the Pentagon to recommend the cancellation of one of the three aviation programs currently under development to modernize our tactical fighter force. Canceling one of these three programs would save American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars, and by all accounts still provide our Armed Forces with an effective yet affordable state-of-the-art tactical fighter fleet. 
This amendment which I am offering on behalf of myself and the senior Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, focuses on the Pentagon's current acquisition strategy for three new tactical fighter programs: The Air Force's F-22, the Navy's F/A-18E/F, and the multiservice joint strike fighter. 
DOD is currently planning on purchasing some 4,400 new fighters from these three programs at a total cost of at least $350 billion according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
Numerous experts, including the CBO and the General Accounting Office have concluded that given our current fiscal constraints and likely future spending parameters, the current acquisition strategy is just plain unrealistic and unwise and untenable. 
The recently released Quadrennial Defense Review, a collaborative effort by the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the individual services to reassess our strategic blueprints for our Armed Forces, as well as to review our inventories and projected needs, has recommended sharp reductions in two of these three jet fighter programs already, the F/A-18E/F and the F-22. 
The QDR proposed recommendations are a promising step in the right direction. But the problem is that the QDR still clings to the assumption that somehow we can adequately control a program's cost by simply scaling it back, just having fewer of each of the three kinds of planes rather than taking the tough and more wise step of simply terminating one of them. 
Mr. President, to understand just how serious this budget shortfall will be, we have to take a look back for a minute and look at the entire defense procurement budget comprised of a number of weapons systems and technology programs. But it is currently dominated by these three separate fighter programs. 
First, the Navy's F/A-18E/F program. 
All though the current C/D model of this airplane performed extraordinarily well--very well in the gulf war--and has the capability of achieving most of the Navy's requirements with some retrofitting, the Pentagon is currently still asking for 1,000 of these expensive E/F airplanes, with a cumulative program cost of about $89 billion, according to the GAO. 
The second program is the Air Force's F-22, a stealthy fighter intended to provide air superiority but at an extraordinary cost. This aircraft, which one Navy official has referred to as gold-plated, will cost as much as $161 million per airplane making it the most expensive plane in our history. In all, the F-22 program, slated to provide 440 airplanes to the Air Force, will cost at least $70 billion. 
The final one of the three fighters is truly still in its infancy. The joint strike fighter, expected to provide common, affordable 21st century strike aircraft for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps, is actually still on the drawing boards with two major contractors dueling for what is expected to be at least--at least--Mr. President, a $219 billion contract for close to 3,000 airplanes. 
Although the amendment I am offering today focuses on tactical fighters, I think to put this in context we should mention a few of the other programs on the Defense Department's wish list. 
We have focused on these because these programs will also have to draw on a limited procurement budget over the next few years. And it just seems impossible that all of these programs can go forward without some changes. In fact, it is likely that many of these nontactical fighter programs will receive reduced funding in the coming years as a result of the drain on our limited procurement dollars, particularly due to going forward with all three of these jet fighters. 
These programs include the $47 billion V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft being built primarily for the Marine Corps and Navy. There is the $25 billion Comanche reconnaissance and attack helicopter program for the Army. There is the Air Force's $18 billion request for 80 more C-17 cargo and transport airplanes. 
Mr. President, in addition to these new aviation programs, we must also factor into account the costs of the necessary replacement of other aging aircraft, such as the KC-135 refueller, the C-5A, the F-117, and the Navy's EA-6B aircraft. These are all important air assets that must be replaced in the next few years, Mr. President. 
That, Mr. President, is just the portion of the procurement budget related to aviation spending. The Navy, for example, is looking to increase the procurement of their surface ships, starting with another aircraft carrier, CVN-77, and 17 of the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyers, as well as four new attack submarines. 
In fiscal year 1999, the Navy would like to begin procurement of the new San Antonio-class amphibious landing ships for our Marine expeditionary forces. 
Unless, Mr. President, we take immediate action to avert this train wreck, with respect to tactical fighter spending, there simply will not be enough procurement dollars to fund all of these additional aviation and shipping programs. 
And a number of experts, Mr. President, in recent months, experts on military spending, have tried to warn the Department of Defense of this impending fiscal disaster. 
CBO, GAO, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle--even high-ranking Pentagon officials--have all forewarned the Defense Department that they will not receive the procurement funding level it has projected and will not be able to sustain these tactical fighter purchases at their planned acquisition levels. 
Here, for example, is what the GAO says:  
DOD's aircraft investment strategy is a business as usual approach that is wasteful--adding billions of dollars to defense acquisition costs and delaying delivery of weapon systems to the operational forces. 
GAO goes on to say: 
We found the DOD's aircraft procurement plans will reach unsustainable levels of the procurement budget if the procurement and the total DOD budgets do not increase. 
The aircraft procurement plans, if implemented as planned, will require drastic reprioritization of the procurement budget that will require significantly reducing the amount spent on other types of procurement (ships, tracked and wheeled vehicles, missiles, etc.) 
Mr. President, I understand that many of my colleagues are either strong proponents or opponents of one or more of these individual fighter programs. That is why, Mr. President, my amendment is careful not to target any one specific program for termination. The language in this amendment merely states the obvious, that the Pentagon's procurement budget over the next several years will not be able to support three costly tactical fighter programs and that the Pentagon must start the process of making the tough decisions. 
Let me read exactly what my amendment does. It says: 
Not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report containing the Secretary's recommendation on which one of the three new tactical fighter programs should be terminated if only two of such programs were to be funded. 
The report shall also contain an analysis of how the two remaining new tactical fighter programs (not including the tactical fighter aircraft program recommended for termination), together with the current tactical aircraft assets of the Armed Forces, will provide the Armed Forces with an effective, affordable, tactical fighter force structure that is capable of meeting projected threats well into the 21st century. 
That's it, Mr. President. My amendment merely requires the Pentagon to send us a report within 60 days with a recommendation for canceling one of these programs. It also requires the Pentagon to provide an analysis of how our current tactical fighter assets, including the F-15, the F-117, the F/A-18C/D and others might be utilized to continue to provide us with air superiority should one of the costly programs be canceled. 
My amendment does not single out any one program. That is the Pentagon's responsibility. It does not cancel funding for one single fighter aircraft. It merely calls for a recommendation. Once that recommendation is made, it will be up to Congress to determine if we are going to follow through on that recommendation. It does not lock in the Congress. 
That is what my amendment is about, Mr. President, making some tough decisions. We must have an acquisition strategy for tactical aviation that is affordable and tenable and consistent with the goal of Congress to achieve a Federal balanced budget in the coming years. My amendment is an attempt to force the Defense Department to understand the gravity of this situation. I hope we can get back to the path of fiscal responsibility in this area, as well, as we have sought so hard to do in so many other areas. 
I reserve the balance of my time, and I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me again remind the body that this does not require the termination of any one of the three jet fighters. It asks for a recommendation from the Department of Defense within 60 days as to which of the three should be terminated, if that became fiscally necessary. 
Second, it is simply not the view of everyone who knows a lot about this subject that this would jeopardize our national security or the defense capability of our Armed Forces. Take a look at the GAO reports, the CBO reports, the analysis of a number of military experts--that is just not the case. I hope the folks who have urged me to look at the hearing testimony which I and my staff have looked at with regard to the merits of these airplanes, would give the same kind of attention to the analysis, fiscal analysis and other analysis of others who we often rely on to give us advice about the effectiveness and cost efficiency of various programs, including the GAO and the CBO, as well as military experts. 
Look, I don't think anyone thinks these are not good planes. These are great planes that are being proposed. I went down and spent part of a morning seeing the wonderful E/F planes, but what we see here is a credit card mentality that somehow we can just have it all. There is no real plan here to make sure that we don't end up trying to have all of these things and, as a result, not end up being able to truly pay for the ones we most need. 
One of the arguments that came out of the QDR that was cited by the Senator from Indiana is that there are ideas about bringing down the cost of each of these by reducing the number of E/F's, reducing the number of F-22's, and reducing the number of joint strike fighters. It is suggested significant savings can be achieved by reducing the size and scope of the fighter programs. I certainly do not question the motives of those who say that. But the idea we can maintain all three of these fighter programs is simply inconsistent with balancing the Federal budgets. 
Two months ago, the Senate Armed Services Committee received testimony from CBO with respect to proposals to merely reduce, as has been suggested by QDR, rather than cancel these tactical fighter programs. In that testimony, CBO explained how the Air Force had proposed last year to buy 124 F-22's over the 1998 to 2003 period. This year, the Air Force has revised that estimate and proposed purchasing just 70 F-22's during the 5-year period. That is a reduction in terms of numbers of over 40 percent of the number of airplanes. But despite buying 54 fewer airplanes and reducing the buy by over 40 percent, CBO noted this, and I think it is very significant, 
that the funding level for this buy remained almost the same, at about $20.4 billion now compared with $21.5 billion in last year's estimate. Why? Unit cost. If you don't build more airplanes up to a high level, then you don't get the benefit of the reduced cost. You end up paying almost the same for much fewer airplanes. 
CBO pointed out that is a savings of about $1.1 billion, despite buying 54 fewer planes. In other words, we reduced the F-22 buy by over 42 fewer airplanes, but saved only about 5 percent of the funding. 
I ask my colleagues to consider the Pentagon's track record and the countless aviation programs that have promised so much in terms of cost savings and have delivered so little in terms of cost savings. In fact, the GAO estimates that the Pentagon's projections with respect to aircraft procurement typically have cost overruns of 20 to 40 percent. 
Clearly, that is not enough--and this may even exacerbate our budget problems--to simply propose reducing any one of these three planes without eliminating one. 
Time and time again, the Pentagon has promised an aviation program, promising large quantities of new aircraft at a given price, only to continually scale back the size of such program until we are receiving small quantities of aircraft but paying huge sums of money for those. 
The B-2 is a tremendous example. In 1986, the Reagan administration told us we were going to get 132 B-2's at a cost of $441 million per airplane. In 1990, the Bush administration revised this number and said, let's only have 75 B-2's, but at a cost of $864 million per airplane. 
Of course, by late 1996, we were on track to buy 20 B-2's at a cost of roughly $2.3 billion per copy. This isn't saving money. Over the course of a decade, Mr. President, we received less than one-sixth of the number of airplanes originally proposed, and we paid more than five times the original price quoted per airplane. 
Of the three tactical fighter programs identified in my amendment, the two programs currently under production, the F-22 and E/F, have already experienced this sort of program instability. In 1986, the Air Force originally proposed we buy 750 F-22's. That number was reduced to 648 in 1991, 440 in 1996, and now, in 1997, the QDR proposes purchasing just 339 of these aircraft. 
Likewise, the Pentagon claims that the Navy and Marine Corps originally intended to purchase 1,300 Super Hornets. In 1992, with the Marine Corps dropout, this figure went to 1,000, and now the QDR is recommending this number be dropped to as low as 548 of these airplanes. 
Again, we are buying fewer and fewer of these airplanes and we are paying more and more for them. That is precisely, Mr. President, why merely reducing the quantities of the tactical fighters, just reducing the numbers, will not avert the fiscal train wreck that is certain to occur if we continue to fund all three of these programs. 
That is why GAO has called this `business as usual,' and that is what it is. It completely shirks responsibility for how we are possibly going to afford all three of these programs 5 years from now. 
I hope my colleagues will not follow this road to fiscal irresponsibility and instead will support my amendment that simply says: Have the Pentagon tell us, within 60 days, which of these planes you can most do without, how they would go forward without one of these planes, and give us guidance on this so we can make the best decision here. Mr. President, we cannot afford these three fighters, and we have to make a decision at some point in the future about it. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am just a little puzzled as to how the term `draconian' can be applied to my amendment. What does my amendment actually call for? The Defense Department, on this issue--or at least the advocates--seem so nervous about talking about this problem that we can't afford these three airplanes that they are referring to an amendment as `draconian,' which only asks the Defense Department to give us their opinion, tell us what they think. If you had to give up one of these three airplanes, which one would it be and how would you proceed? 
I would understand if this was a ridiculous question and why ask it of them. But it isn't. The GAO has said that the E/F is a good airplane, but it is not that much better than the C/D, and it is going to cost $17 billion more. There are others who are really questioning whether this is a good idea. How can it possibly be termed `draconian' to simply ask the Defense Department to give us their opinion? It doesn't require a decision. 
If the crisis that the Senator from Indiana and I both agree may be coming has to be dealt with later, this is the kind of information that would be useful for us to have. We are not required to act on it. The Defense Department is not required to change their mind. How can this be described as draconian? What troubles me about that characterization is, what are we afraid of here as Members of Congress? Openly discussing the fact that there are some questions about whether we can afford this and whether we really need all three of these planes? 
This is really a business-as-usual attitude. The Defense Department will be better off and this country will be better off if it starts to join in the fiscal responsibility that all of us have been calling for. So I am very concerned that the Members of the Senate, who will vote on this soon, know that all this does is ask for a report within 60 days. It is asking for an advisory opinion from the Defense Department: If we had to cut one of these three planes, which one would it be? What possible harm would that be? I ask my colleagues to support this and help us solve what we all agree is an impending problem with regard to fiscal spending. How much time do I have?

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Madam President. 
This amendment asks that the Defense Department, within 60 days, issues a report to tell us which of the three planned jet fighters should be terminated because of the obvious problem that we don't have enough money in the procurement budget to have all three of these--the F-22 of the Air Force, the F-18E/F of the Navy, or the joint strike fighter that is being planned as a commonality plane for three branches of our armed services. 
The GAO, CBO, many military experts, and others agree that it is not possible for us to afford all three of these, and it is also not an answer, as the QDR suggests, to simply reduce each of the three, because the problem is that the unit cost of each plane is so high that at the lower number of planes that are produced, you don't get the savings. This is what happened with the B-2 bomber. 
We are facing a train wreck with regard to this, and we need some guidance from the Defense Department about which of the three should go, if that is what we have to do in order to continue to balance the budget. 
Thank you, Madam President.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, thank you. 
Mr. President, I am very pleased that the proponents of the modified Bosnia amendment have managed to work out a compromise, and I think, in fact, the changes that were made on the modification strengthened the second-degree amendment, made it stronger and tough, which, I think, is very appropriate here. 
While my original amendment would have prohibited the use of funds for the deployment of ground troops in Bosnia, I was willing to accept the sense-of-the-Congress language because I think it is vitally important that the Congress send a signal about our views on this mission during consideration of this bill, the Department of Defense authorization bill. 
I introduced this amendment in the first place because I felt it was critical that we debate this issue at this time. Frankly, I think it would have been somewhat irresponsible not to have any debate about the Bosnian involvement in the context of the Department of Defense authorization bill. 
As I indicate by my underlying amendment, I would greatly prefer a hard statutory requirement that the administration stick to its stated end date of June 30, 1998. That is, in fact, what the other body did. That is what the House has already done. The House voted 278 to 148 to limit the use of funds after that date. The House version and the modification to my amendment speak to the same goal. The Congress wants to see this mission end. Our main differences lay in the mechanism to achieve that goal. But when these two versions get to conference later this year, the conferees will have to resolve these differences. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that the conference will include the strongest possible language with regard to this issue. We have taken an important step today toward terminating the Bosnian mission and bringing home our men and women. 
I am delighted to have the support from so many Members on both sides of the aisle for my efforts in this area. I want to especially thank the Senators from Michigan and Rhode Island for their work, and the strong and consistent support of the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, who has been working with me on this important matter all along. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was disappointed to read language in the committee report accompanying the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill which called upon the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences [USUHS] to propose the construction of an additional building on the USUHS campus. While I fully appreciate such language is not binding, the provision is a clear invitation to the controversial school to expand the physical plant of a program which many already consider to be costly. 
More particularly, the provision is inconsistent with the view of a number of Members of Senate and the other body that USUHS not only should not be expanded, but instead should be terminated. That view is shared by others as well. The Department of Defense has proposed phasing out this school, and proposals to close the school have also been offered by the Congressional Budget Office [CBO], the Grace Commission, and the National Performance Review. 
Mr. President, USUHS is the most expensive source of physicians for our military, according to CBO costing 4 to 10 times as much as other sources and supplying only a tiny fraction of the needs of the Pentagon for new physicians--less than 12 percent in 1994. 
Expanding the physical plant of a program that is already 4 to 10 times as expensive as alternative sources of physicians for our military makes no sense, and is inconsistent with both the increasing pressure on the Defense Department's budget and our efforts to balance the budget. 
Mr. President, I urge the Department of Defense to carefully review the non-binding language included in the report accompanying the fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense authorization legislation before it moves to expand a school that cannot justify its current cost to taxpayers.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to condemn the coup that occurred in Cambodia this past Sunday. 
I want to put special emphasis on the word `coup' because the United States State Department has been reluctant to use this term to describe the events in Phnom Penh. The facts, however, leave no doubt. 
On Sunday, troops loyal to Hun Sen, Cambodia's second prime minister, attacked the forces of Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Cambodia's first prime minister and leader of the royalist party known as FUNCINPEC. According to news reports, Hun Sen's army is currently rounding up political opponents. Already, at least one senior royalist official has been executed. As an added insult to the Cambodian people, Hun Sen's forces have been looting shops in the capital. 
I am sure my colleagues will agree that Hun Sen's use of military force to oust his rivals and take sole control of Cambodia's government is, by definition, a coup d'etat. 
Hun Sen is a man who has always preferred the gun over the ballot. In 1993, his party was defeated by the royalists in the United Nations-sponsored elections. Nearly 90 percent of eligible voters participated in that historic event. Even though he lost the election, Hun Sen threatened to restart Cambodia's civil war unless he was named as a second prime minister alongside Prince Ranariddh. In an effort to avoid further bloodshed, the U.N. agreed to let the two factions govern together. 
After uneasily sharing power for 4 years, this clumsy coalition finally began to unravel this year. On March 30, 20 people were murdered in Phnom Penh when gunmen fired grenades into a peaceful opposition rally. Investigations have linked Hun Sen's troops to this cowardly attack. The political violence in Cambodia has only grown worse in the weeks since that tragic event. 
The only good news to emerge from Cambodia in recent weeks was the capture of Pol Pot, the genocidal leader of the Khmer Rouge. The ruler of Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, Pol Pot is responsible for the deaths of as many as one million people. This notorious war criminal was taken prisoner by Khmer Rouge defectors who indicated a willingess to turn him over to the government. Hun Sen's takeover, however, may jeopardize efforts to have Pol Pot brought to Phnom Pehn and eventually extradited to an international tribunal.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the editorial, `Calling a Coup a Coup,' argues that the United States and the international community should condemn Hun Sen's actions as a coup and halt aid to his government. 
Mr. President, I agree. I believe the administration should officially recognize Hun Sen's actions as a coup. This is the right policy. While nobody wants to increase the suffering of the Cambodian people, the United States cannot legitimize Hun Sen's actions by maintaining the current flow of aid and development assistance. 
As we all know, the United Nations spent over $2 billion in 1993 to bring peace and democracy to Cambodia. We made a large investment, but an important one. Now, even though this long-suffering nation appears to be slipping back into a civil war, we should not conclude that the efforts of the United States and the international community have been in vain. In 1993, Cambodia's citizens overwhelmingly rejected tyranny, and they will do so again. 
U.S. support for democracy, though, will seem shallow if we do not take action against the use of violence. Like the military dictators of Burma, the Hun Sen regime too should be subject to the toughest sanctions. The United States must do all it can to insure that Hun Sen does not become the next Cambodian dictator.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to S. 936, the Department of Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. This amendment simply would prohibit the use of funds within the bill for the deployment of any ground forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina after June 30, 1998. 
As we all know that is the date that the President has said now United States troops would be out of Bosnia. My amendment would simply codify this goal. This amendment would allow appropriate exceptions, however, for Armed Forces personnel deployed in Bosnia to protect United States diplomatic facilities or noncombat personnel to advise NATO commanders. It would also not affect the President's constitutional authority to protect the lives of American citizens. 
Mr. President, this is similar to an amendment I introduced in May to the supplemental appropriations bill. That amendment, which applied only to the approximately $1.5 billion worth of `emergency' appropriations included in that bill, prohibited the use of fiscal year 1997 funds after the date of December 30, 1997. In order to accommodate the views of several other Members of this body, I did agree to accept an amendment by the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, that changed that date to June 30, 1998. 
I was pleased that on that occasion the Senate unanimously chose to accept the modified version of my amendment on that bill. Although it was eventually dropped in the conference committee, I was pleased that the conferees included language in their report expressing the concern of the Congress regarding the Bosnia deployment and requiring the President to provide regular reports to Congress on the deployment itself as well as on the cumulative costs stemming from various United States efforts associated with Bosnia. 
So here today, Mr. President, we now have an opportunity again to go on record regarding the continuation of the Bosnian operation beyond next June. 
I have held strong reservations about United States troop deployment in Bosnia ever since it was announced in 1995. These doubts were so strong that I ended up being the only Democrat in the Congress to vote against deployment of United States men and women to support the Dayton accord. 
It was a hard vote, but I voted no because I felt that the administration's promises to bring our men and women home after just 1 year were simply not plausible. Now, here we are in July of 1997--nearly 2 years later--our troops are still in Bosnia, and it is already clear that at a minimum we will remain there at least until the middle of 1998. 
Mr. President, my concerns about our involvement in Bosnia have not changed since that first `no' vote. 
I will be the first to acknowledge, though, that the international intervention in Bosnia has had some positive benefits. The Dayton accord and the deployment of the NATO-led implementation force, IFOR, put an end to the bloodshed of the 3-year Bosnian war. In this sense, Mr. President, the IFOR mission in Bosnia was a success. 
There also can be no argument about the bravery and professionalism of the United States personnel who served in IFOR and are still in Bosnia as a part of the stabilization force, SFOR. Amazingly, there have been virtually no casualties even though there have been as many as 27,700 United States troops in the theater at one time. These men and women work through harsh conditions in a complex and often unstable environment. Although there have been passionate debates about whether our military should stay in Bosnia, admiration for the outstanding performance of our troops has been unanimous. 
Mr. President, my problem is with the seemingly endless duration of this mission. 
When in late 1995, the President first announced he would be sending United States forces to Europe to participate in the IFOR mission, he promised the Congress and the American people that the IFOR mission would be over within 1 year. This promise was reiterated by the President on several occasions and continually backed up by senior American military and diplomatic officials in public statements and in testimony before Congress. 
I think we all understood that promise. I think we all understood that promise to mean that our military men and women would be withdrawn from the region by December 1996, or at least very shortly thereafter. 
But in November 1996 the President announced that he would extend the U.S. mission for an additional 18 months, through June 1998, for participation in the NATO force now known as SFOR. Mr. President, despite this new acronym, SFOR really represents nothing more than an extension of the original IFOR mandate, albeit somewhat more limited in scope. 
Mr. President, I am afraid that there is still no clear end to our mission. The main factions in Bosnia are not making progress toward creating a viable nation that can survive without the presence of the international force. Although the IFOR and SFOR deployment has certainly halted the wide-scale fighting, there has been little progress on the political front. According to a May report by the General Accounting Office, the united governments Parliamentary Assembly has met just once and has yet to pass any legislation. The unified Council of Ministers has no authority, no funding, and no office space. 
So long as SFOR maintains an indefinite commitment to serve as referee in Bosnia, I don't think we can expect any movement by the three Bosnian factions to build the institutions that will be needed, once the NATO force pulls out. So unless we set a deadline for our involvement to end, Mr. President, I believe there will be little to no incentive for the three sides to create a lasting political solution to the conflict. 
Mr. President, Bosnia's problems are still immense. Authoritarian rulers from all sides are hampering democracy. Many refugees are still unable to turn to their homes, and acts of ethnic violence occur on a daily basis. In short, Mr. President, there will never be a good time to pull out of Bosnia. If we stay in Bosnia until the Croats and Serbs and Bosnians learn to live together, then we may never leave. 
At the heart of the conflict is the fact that the strategic political goals of the warring factions remain unchanged. There are many observers who believe that the presence of the U.S. troops alone, instead of helping in some way, actually serves to harden rather than soften ethnic tensions in the area. The longer the Muslim refugees are prevented from returning to their homes the more determined they are to fight for their right to do so. At the same time, the Serbs are thwarting resettlement efforts and ignoring indictments from the War Crimes Tribunal against their own leadership. I believe that the open-endedness of this mission is helping to keep the warring parties from truly fulfilling their commitments under the Dayton accord. 
Mr. President, I have a second concern, as well. It really is the crux of this amendment. It relates to the bill that the United States taxpayer is expected to bear to support this Bosnia operation. The Congress and the American people, Mr. President, were originally told the Bosnia mission would cost the U.S. taxpayers approximately $2 billion. Sometime in 1996 that estimate was revised to $3 billion. Then, subsequent to the President's November announcement extending the deadline for troop withdrawal, we learned that the cost estimate had been revised upward again, and really revised upward to a staggering $6.5 billion after the initial figure of $2 billion had been used. Six months later now, the May 1997 GAO report estimates this mission will cost $7.7 billion for military and civilian support for fiscal years 1996 through 1998. 
Mr. President, this latest figure is nearly four times as great as the administration's original estimate. To put this in perspective, the United States, over the course of 30 months in Bosnia, expects to spend an amount equivalent to over just half of the entire foreign operations budget for the current fiscal year for the whole world. 
Mr. President, as I said during the debate over the supplemental appropriations bill, what we now have with United States involvement in the Bosnia operation is not mission creep, it has become dollars creep for the U.S. Congress and for the American people. At the very time we are straining so hard to eliminate the Federal deficit, we need to plug up the ever-enlarging hole in the Treasury through which funds continue to pour into the Bosnia operation. 
Mr. President, by setting a hard date, by prohibiting the use of funds after June 30, 1998, my amendment establishes an end date for the deployment of ground troops in Bosnia. This is the only hope we have to plug this hole in the Treasury. 
Mr. President, by establishing an end date for the funding of the deployment of U.S. troops, my amendment, I hope, serves the dual purpose of preventing both mission creep and dollars creep in the Bosnia situation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his commitment to this issue and his leadership in this debate and very clear explanation of the situation. I will not oppose the second-degree amendment that he and the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Arizona have proposed. I also wish to compliment the Senator from Rhode Island on his comments, which I think were very appropriate with regard, especially, to the issue of making it absolutely clear throughout all aspects of our Government that it really is our 
intention to be out of this situation in terms of our ground troops by the end of June 1998. 
As Senator Levin has described, his second-degree amendment expresses the sense of the Congress that United States ground troops should not participate in a follow-on force in Bosnia and Herzegovina after June of 1998. Of course, I heartily agree with that premise. I believe we have to have a firm end date to our mission in Bosnia. Without it, many of us have said it here on the floor tonight, the mission absolutely risks continuing for who knows how long. There simply is no sign or clue as to when our involvement would end. 
Of course, I would have preferred my own hard mandate in my own amendment, which would have cut the purse strings of the Bosnia mission after June 30, 1998. This would have absolutely ensured that United States ground troops would be out of Bosnia by that date. But I am willing to not oppose the change offered by the Senator from Michigan because not only is there more support for the amendment in this form, but because it, again, puts the U.S. Senate on record with respect to its concern about the Bosnia mission. 
I am particularly pleased that the Levin amendment includes language urging the President to inform our European allies of this expression of the sense of Congress. This may well be the most important point. It is pretty clear that our allies in the region, our NATO partners, have become dependent on the active participation of the United States in this peacekeeping operation. If I were them, I would not want to do it alone either. But it is my view that if President Clinton lets our allies know immediately and with all candor that U.S. troops will not participate in the mission after next June, then they will begin to think creatively about what our next steps should be in the region. 
If the President does not send that message, then our allies and partners will have every reason to believe that the United States will, of course, remain in Bosnia after that date, as we have done already with regard to a number of other deadlines. Why do I say that? Because the last time we had a deadline for completing the peacekeeping mission, the December 1996 end date for IFOR, the administration was only too quick to let it slip with just a few months left to go on our initial 1-year commitment, the mission got rebaptized as SFOR, and U.S. ground troops were stuck there for what is going to be at least an additional 18 months. 
I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed by people like Secretary Albright, Chairman Shalikashvili and Secretary Cohen. In her June 27, 1997 letter to the Senate leadership, Secretary Albright wrote that if legislation mandating a cutoff were to pass, it would `send exactly the wrong signal to our allies, to the signatories to the Dayton Accords, and to the American people about what American leadership in the world should mean.' 
Mr. President, I don't understand this statement. I don't understand this statement in light of the fact that the United States is already on record for wanting to end the military mission on June 30, 1998. How can people be so concerned about the statement sending a signal about that date when that is exactly the signal that the President of the United States has sent? 
By telling our European allies about the planned withdrawal date, as the Levin second-degree specifically calls upon the President to do, we can make it clear that our leadership role is there but that our leadership role has limits. In the event of a follow-on force in the region, the Levin amendment suggests that the United States may decide to provide support in the form of command and control, intelligence, logistics and, if necessary, a ready reserve force. I believe this kind of support is more appropriate than the deployment of our men and women to Bosnia. 
I am also aware that the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, had made an agreement during the Armed Services Committee markup of the bill to resist the temptation to offer Bosnia language in this bill. The issue of when and where we deploy our troops is a tough, emotional and controversial one for all of us. Because of that, I know that the members of the Armed Services Committee would all like to see a longer, more thoughtful debate on Bosnia at some point. 
I, too, would like the Congress to have the opportunity to engage in a more extensive debate on the issue. But I also believe, as we consider this legislation, we cannot ignore the Bosnia issue in the very bill that authorizes the activities of the Defense Department. So, in light of the initial hesitation of the Armed Services Committee, I am particularly pleased that Senator Levin and I have been able to work together on this issue. I think it is vitally important that in a bill as important as this one, the Senate go on record regarding our mission in Bosnia. 
Let me just conclude by saying if, in fact, we are able to pass my amendment, as amended by the Levin amendment, it will mean that both the House and the Senate will be on record on this DOD bill calling for termination of the Bosnia mission no later than June 1998. This should guarantee that this issue will not simply disappear in conference. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. It was just about 1 year ago, Mr. President, last June, when I stood here on the Senate floor with the senior Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and others, and participated in a somewhat abbreviated debate on the need for meaningful, bipartisan campaign reform. 
We discussed several issues during that debate, Mr. President. We talked about the 1994 elections and the resulting record amount of campaign spending in that election. 
We had a chance to talk briefly about how one candidate for the U.S. Senate had spent $30 million of his own money to try and win a California Senate seat. 
We talked about how the average amount of money spent by a winning 1994 Senate candidate had, unfortunately, reached over $4.6 million. We talked about the damaging effect that the unabated flow of campaign cash had on our political system as well as on the public perceptions of this institution. 
In response to all of that, interestingly, we were told by opponents of reform that all was well, that spiraling campaign spending would somehow strengthen our democracy, and that our system was far from crying out for reform. 
And then, on a quiet Tuesday afternoon, after a few paltry hours of debate and absolutely no opportunity for Senators to offer amendments, the bipartisan McCain-Feingold reform bill fell six votes short of breaking a filibuster, and that was done effectively by the guardians of the status quo. 
That was a year ago, Mr. President. Although our opponents continue to proclaim that all is well and reform is not a priority, the evidence from the 1996 campaign stands in stark contrast to the declarations of those who are trying to defend the indefensible. 
Last year, according to the Washington Post, candidates and parties spent a record amount of money on Federal elections--$2.7 billion. Mr. President, $2.7 billion was spent on those elections, which is an all-time record. This record amount of campaign spending, I assume, is exactly what the opponents of reform, including the Speaker of the other body and the junior Senator from Kentucky had really hoped would happen. 
Recall Speaker Gingrich's words from the last Congress:  
One of the greatest myths in modern politics is that campaigns are too expensive. The political process, in fact, is not overfunded, but underfunded. 
My distinguished colleague from Kentucky, referring to the 1996 election said: 
I look on all that election activity as a healthy sign of a vibrant democracy. 
Well, Mr. President, back here on planet Earth, and back home in my State of Wisconsin, the American people have a very different view. They are disgusted by our current campaign finance system. They are appalled at the insane amount of money that is being spent on democratic elections. And not surprisingly, they told us how appalled they are by staying home in huge numbers last November. In fact, fewer Americans turned out to vote in 1996 than in any Presidential election year in the last 72 years. 
There are mountains of evidence demonstrating the failure of current election laws. Poll after poll demonstrates the mistrust and cynicism the public feels toward this institution as a result of large campaign contributions. 
The newspapers and nightly news programs are brimming with reports of election scandals, with charges and countercharges of abuse and illegality filling the headlines every day. 
Scores of candidates--including many current officeholders--are choosing not to run for office principally because of the millions of dollars needed for a campaign for the U.S. Senate. In fact, the theory that unlimited campaign spending produces competitive elections has been completely discredited, as the average margin of victory in Senate elections last year was 17 percent. 
Let me repeat that, Mr. President. Not only did 95 percent of incumbent Senators win reelection last November, most of these elections weren't even close. On average, 17 percentage points separated the winners from the losers. 
Mr. President, while Rome burns and our campaign finance system crumbles all around us, the junior Senator from Kentucky characterizes the chaos of the 1996 elections as a healthy sign of a vibrant democracy. 
Mr. President, as the U.S. Senate continues to duck and 
weave and dodge around the issue of campaign finance reform, the American people are becoming more and more convinced that we here in this body do not have the courage or the will to reform a system that has provided Members of this institution with a consistent reelection rate of well over 90 percent. 
As we all know, Mr. President, this week hearings will begin in the Governmental Affairs Committee on the abuses and possible illegalities that occurred in the last election. I can think of no better time for us to make a major step forward to fundamentally overhaul our failed election laws. 
Opponents of reform will surely assert that we should wait until the conclusion of these hearings before we consider reform legislation, so we can adequately identify the loopholes and the gaps and holes in our campaign finance system. But, Mr. President, in the last 10 years on this issue alone, we have had 15 reports by 6 different congressional committees, over 1,000 pages of committee reports, 29 sets of hearings, 49 days of testimony, over 6,700 pages of hearings, 522 witnesses, 446 different legislative proposals, more than 3,300 floor speeches, 76 CRS reports, 113 Senate votes, and 17 different filibusters. 
So I think it is safe to assume that we have probably reviewed this issue more than almost any other issue pending before this body. 
So, Mr. President, it is time now for serious consideration of reform legislation. I have joined with the senior Senator from Arizona, and others, in authoring the only comprehensive, bipartisan plan to be introduced in the Senate this year. 
Mr. President, we are very aware that this bill is not perfect. Some have voiced their concerns or objections about this or that provision, or have criticized the legislation for not addressing particular areas. As we have said--and I think as we have shown all along--this legislation is primarily a vehicle for reform, and we are more than willing to consider additions, deletions, or modifications to the package. 
We do have some bottom lines, though. First, we should have a full and robust debate on the issue, with all Senators having the opportunity both to debate the many complicated issues involved here and, also, to have the opportunity they didn't have last year to offer amendments. 
Second, it is imperative that any legislative vehicle ban on so-called party soft money. These are the monstrous, unlimited and unregulated contributions that have poured in from labor unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals to the political parties. 
It is these multihundred-thousand-dollar campaign contributions that were, more than anything else, at the root of the abuses and outrage stemming from the 1996 elections. Individuals and organizations certainly should have the opportunity to contribute to their parties with funds that can be used for Federal elections. But all of those funds, Mr. President, should be raised and spent within the scope and context of Federal election law. 
Finally, Mr. President, we must have provisions in this reform legislation that encourage candidates to spend less money on their campaigns and, if we can, to encourage them to raise most of their campaign funds from the people they intend to represent in their district or State. 
We have to provide candidates, and particularly challengers who have less access to large financial resources, with the tools and means to effectively convey their message, without having to raise and spend millions of dollars. 
Unless we take fundamental steps to change the 90 to 95 percent reelection rates for incumbents that are seemingly enshrined under current election laws, the American people will justifiably perceive such reform as little more than one more incumbent protection plan. 
Mr. President, the senior Senator from Arizona and I have waited quite patiently for the opportunity to have this historic debate. It is my hope that we can sit down with the majority leader in the coming days and begin the process of bringing such a meaningful discussion to the Senate floor in the next few weeks. 
I look forward to that discussion, and I hope that it will eventually lead to passage of bipartisan reform legislation that will result in what I like to call moderate, mutual disarmament. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor. 
Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment eliminates percentage depletion allowances for four mined substances--asbestos, lead, mercury, and uranium--and it saves an estimated $83 million over 5 years. 
Unlike depreciation or cost depletion, percentage depletion allows companies to deduct far more than their actual costs. This results in a generous loophole for the company and an expensive subsidy for the taxpayer. But it gets worse, Mr. President. 
While we spend millions subsidizing corporations to mine these toxic substances, we spend even more on their downstream public health and environmental consequences. 
So, as the senior Senator from Arkansas says, this subsidy gives corporate welfare a bad name. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this provision, and I yield the remainder of my time in deference to the Senator from Nevada.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I intend to vote against this tax bill. 
Although I voted for the budget resolution which was designed to bring us to a balanced budget within the next 5 years, I have consistently said that we should actually achieve a balanced budget, before enacting any sweeping new tax cuts. As attractive as new tax cuts may be, I think our first fiscal obligation is to eliminate the deficit. We shouldn't ask our children and grandchildren to foot the bill for our program spending or our tax cuts. 
Having said that, let me address several other issues. If we are going to have tax cuts before the budget is actually balanced, then we should focus on the kinds of cuts that at least have some potential to help enhance economic productivity and increase revenues--tax changes that arguably will increase income and resulting revenues will help move us toward a balanced budget. 
For these reasons, I have indicated that if we are to have tax cuts before the budget is in balance, we should limit them to changes that will stimulate economic growth. A number of my constituents have presented me with strong arguments that some reductions in the capital gains and estate taxes will enhance economic productivity and growth, and I have been willing to support capital gains and estate tax changes if crafted in ways that target the benefits so as to stimulate growth and economic activity. For Wisconsin, this means, in particular, that capital gains and estate tax changes should be targeted to help family farms and other smaller family businesses that are passed down from one generation to the next. 
Arguments for certain types of education tax cuts and child tax credits are not as persuasive. And they become less so when they are not available to those families who might most need such relief. If we are going to provide tax cuts to families with children, then we shouldn't exclude millions of working families with lower and moderate incomes. Over 565,000 kids in Wisconsin, nearly 40 percent, live in families that will not receive the tax credit. 
Altogether, as desirable as tax cuts might be, we need to keep our focus on balancing the budget first, then consider tax cuts. American families will benefit enormously by the Federal Government bringing down the deficit and achieving a balanced budget. Anything that diverts us from that course should be resisted until we have finished the job. 
Finally, if we must have tax cut legislation as part of the budget agreement, it ought to be both fiscally responsible and fair. This bill fails on both counts. The tax cut bill is heavily back-loaded. While costing $85 billion over the first 5 years, the plan will cost close to $60 billion annually once it is fully in place. That kind of exploding cost moves us away from a balanced budget, and puts us back on the track to rising deficits. It is ironic that those who shout the loudest about the need for a balanced budget amendment to our Constitution are among the biggest supporters of a tax bill that is nothing less than a budget buster. 
The tax plan also fails the test of fairness. A package of tax cuts, even one targeted toward economic development, need not be skewed to the wealthiest. Unfortunately, this measure is. According to the tax watchdog group Citizens for Tax Justice, over half the proposed tax cuts in the bill go to the top 5 percent of all taxpayers. And while the 40 percent of families with the lowest income receive no tax benefit, the top 1 percent receive an average benefit of nearly $16,000. 
Mr. President, let me emphasize my firm belief that our highest priority must be to balance our Federal budget before we cut taxes. We have come too far and worked too hard to bring our deficit down to jeopardize that effort with a fiscally irresponsible tax cut bill. I support the bipartisan balanced budget agreement negotiated by the congressional leadership and the White House, but this tax package is not consistent with the spirit of that agreement, and needlessly risks the progress we made in the reconciliation package we just passed.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise as an original cosponsor of the legislation being introduced today by the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] to close the U.S. Army School of the Americas [SOA] located at Fort Benning, GA. 
SOA was created in 1946 to train Latin American military officers in combat and counterinsurgency skills, with the goal of professionalizing Latin American armies and strengthening democracies. Originally located in Panama, the SOA moved to Fort Benning in 1948. There has been a great deal of controversy surrounding the types of leaders that have graduated from the SOA, leading it to be called the School for Dictators. Some of SOA's graduates include Manuel Noriega, at least 19 Salvadorean officers implicated by El Salvador's Truth Commission in the murder of 6 Jesuit priests, and officers who participated in the coup against former Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
In 1991, following an internal investigation, the Pentagon removed certain SOA training manuals from circulation. On September 22, 1996, the Pentagon released the full text of those training manuals and acknowledged that some of those manuals provided instruction in techniques that, in the Pentagon's words, were `clearly objectionable and possibly illegal.' The techniques in question included torture, extortion, false arrest, and execution. I and other Senators have written the Department of Defense several times to request additional disclosure of SOA policies, curriculums, training manuals and other materials so that the history of the school can be fully understood. 
The horrendous record of the SOA has inspired hundreds of Wisconsin residents to contact my office to express their support for closing this school. Numerous organizations, including Public Citizen, the Washington Office on Latin America and Human Rights Watch also support the elimination of SOA. 
As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I am committed to promoting human rights throughout the world. In my view, our Government cannot continue to support the existence of a school that counts so many murderers among its alumni. While I do not doubt that it can be in our national interest to conduct military training with our friends and partners, it is unexcusable that such military training should take place at an institution with the reputation of the School of the Americas. This bill gives Members of the Senate an opportunity to separate the legitimate training exercises conducted by the U.S. military from the sordid acts of many individuals who have been trained at SOA. We must lift the cloud of suspicion that has fallen on these programs by closing SOA once and for all. 
Not only are the human costs of this training program unjustifiable, but so are its monetary costs. With a national debt in excess of $5 trillion, every Federal program needs to be carefully scrutinized to ensure that Federal tax dollars are wisely spent. Given the end of the cold war, and in light of documents indicating the SOA training program provided instruction in techniques which violate human rights standards, I feel that the School of Americas is an unwise expenditure, and I support eliminating it as soon as possible.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to applaud today's U.S. Supreme Court decision striking down the Communications Decency Act as an unconstitutional restriction of free speech on the Internet, affirming the 1996 lower court decision. 
In striking down the provisions of the CDA, which effectively censors the speech of adults on the Internet, the Court stated `We agree with the District Court's conclusion that the CDA places an unacceptably heavy burden on protected speech.' The Court concluded that the CDA `threatens to torch a large segment of the Internet community.' 
Mr. President, this decision is a victory not only for Internet users, it is a victory for all Americans who hold the first amendment right to free speech among their most cherished rights. 
The Senator from Vermont [Senator Leahy] and I spoke in opposition to the CDA when it was first brought to the Senate floor in 1995 during consideration of the Telecommunications Act. The high court decision pointed out the many flaws of the CDA that the Senator from Vermont and I raised before the legislation was approved. Among other concerns, we pointed out that indecency restrictions which have been upheld when applied to other media, were unconstitutional when applied to the Internet due to its unique nature. We urged our colleagues to study the problem and the potential solutions more carefully before they rushed headlong to pass what we knew to be unconstitutional legislation. Ultimately, the CDA passed the Senate in June 1995 with only 2 hours of debate and no Congressional hearings. The lack of congressional consideration of the CDA's problems was among the reasons cited by the Court in its finding that the act violated the first amendment. In failing to carefully examine the problem, the Congress merely tied the CDA up in Court for over a year while getting no closer to its goal of protecting children on the Internet. 
Both the Supreme Court, and the lower court before it, conducted an exhaustive review of the nature of the Internet and of the technologies that exist to protect children and concluded that the CDA was an unconstitutional restriction on the free speech of adults that was not narrowly tailored to the goal of protecting kids on the Net. 
Specifically, Mr. President, the Supreme Court found that: 
Other laws restricting speech that have been upheld by the Supreme Court are substantially different from the CDA. Fundamentally, the Court determined that unlike other media that have been subject to some speech restrictions, the Internet receives full first amendment protection. Additionally, the Court pointed out that restrictions previously upheld by the High Court have been time, place and manner restrictions, rather than `content-based blanket restriction on speech.' Those differences bring into question the constitutionality of the CDA rather than confirming it. 
The characteristics of other media that have some speech restrictions, such as the 
scarcity of broadcast spectrum and the invasive nature of broadcast media, do not apply to the Internet. 
The combination of criminal penalties for violations and the vague nature of the `indecency' prohibition will chill speech on the Internet because speakers will not know which speech is prohibited and which is acceptable. 
The breadth of the indecency standard in the CDA is unprecedented. 
The CDA attempts to protect children by suppressing constitutionally protected speech of adults. This burden of speech is constitutionally unacceptable because less restrictive means of achieving the Government's goal are available. 
Mr. President, the Supreme Court correctly struck down the Communications Decency Act. While this decision precludes enforcement of the act, Congress should act quickly to repeal the CDA. It is time to conduct a thorough and thoughtful review of constitutional methods to protect children on the Internet from those who would seek to harm them. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to read today's Supreme Court decision striking down the Communications Decency Act and work toward more effective solutions to protect our kids.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I'm pleased that the Senate is turning its attention today to the Drug Free Communities Act. As a cosponsor of this legislation, I want to thank Senator Grassley for his leadership in developing the bill and the chairman for agreeing to move it through the committee expeditiously. This is an important bill for children and communities, and it deserves to be passed quickly and signed into law. 
The Drug Free Communities Act will provide needed support to local partnerships, which play an important role in helping children and teens to resist drugs. My State of Wisconsin currently has 132 such community-based partnerships--groups of parents, teachers, community and religious leaders, youth advocates, and others who come together to teach leadership skills and provide kids with alternative activities and opportunities. 
In Marshfield, WI, for instance, the Wood County Partnership Council has focused on activities to reduce drunk driving by teens. Programs sponsored by the council have included regional teen institutes, parent to parent workshops, and general prevention training of community members. 
In Milwaukee, Neighborhood Partners has developed grassroots neighborhood organizations which focus on preventing substance abuse and drug-related crime. These organizations have helped to establish neighborhood watch programs, after school tutorial programs, and block patrols. Two years after founding this partnership, the personal property crime rate in the targeted area fell by 16 percent, as compared with a Milwaukee-wide decrease of 12 percent. 
These are the sorts of programs that might apply for funding under the Drug Free Communities Act, in order to help support parents and other community volunteers reach more youths with their important messages. 
No new funds will be appropriated under H.R. 956. Instead, funding for qualifying local partnerships will be diverted from the existing $16 billion drug control budget. In order to ensure that the coalitions receiving these Federal dollars are sustainable, grants will be made available only to broad-based, local partnerships that have been active for at least 6 months, and are able to match their Federal awards dollar for dollar, with either cash or in-kind contributions. 
Supporting locally-based prevention initiatives is a critical piece of a comprehensive drug control strategy. The Judiciary Committee, on which I sit, spends a good deal of time addressing issues of crime that stem from youth and adult drug use. I'm pleased that today the Senate is focusing, in a bipartisan way, on preventing the root cause of so much crime, by supporting parents and localities in their efforts to prevent youth drug use.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to S. 903, the State Department authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. What my amendment would do is strike the provisions in division A of the bill concerning international broadcasting activities in the United States. 
Mr. President, I find it rather extraordinary that in the very bill that seeks to reorganize and consolidate the foreign policy apparatus of the U.S. Government, we find language to create a new independent Federal agency to administer the U.S. international broadcasting program. Let me be clear on this: This bill creates a new Federal agency. It grants that agency the authorities and mandates that all Federal agencies have under title 5. It also gives the agency the authority to hire temporary workers and to grant them reimbursement for their services, and it also gives the agency the authority to receive donations. So despite the claims you will shortly hear that are to the contrary, make no mistake, Mr. President, this is a new agency. 
Now, some will argue, of course, that there is no net increase in Federal agencies since at the same time that we create a new independent agency to operate the international broadcasting operations, we are also abolishing the U.S. Information Agency. 
So you will probably hear the argument that we are giving up one and adding a new one. I am afraid, though, Mr. President, that that argument hardly passes the laugh test. It is a new agency. You can be sure of one thing: It is going to act like an agency, too. 
This language simply makes no sense in light of the hard work that the Congress invested in 1993 and 1994 in restructuring the United States' role in overseas broadcasting. We consolidated various programs and we took some very clear steps to move Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty down the road to privatization. 
In the United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994, the Foreign Relations Committee took the lead in doing something that is all too unusual. It is unusual to find a program eliminated in Washington, but we, in that committee, and on this floor, Mr. President, actually wiped out a Federal agency. At the time, that agency was called the Board for International Broadcasting or the BIB. We consolidated all of our Government's international broadcasting programs, including the Voice of America, as well as the so-called surrogate programs, such as RFE/RL. We did it within one Federal agency--the U.S. Information Agency, which is the government's public diplomacy arm. 
The 1994 act imposed tight fiscal controls on the two programs that were rife with fiscal abuse and mismanagement. It mandated steps toward privatization for Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. Very importantly, it also ensured an active role by the inspector general. As a result, Mr. President--and this is no small matter--of this one series of actions and consolidation, we saved the Federal Government, the taxpayers of this country, on this one change alone, close to $1 billion over a 9-year period. This isn't me talking about what can be done if we do something--we did it. We started in 1993 and we saved $1 billion. That was my first bill here as a Member of the Senate. I am extremely pleased that the changes proposed in this bill cannot undo the fiscal progress that we have made in the past. I add that, at this time, when we are trying so hard to finalize our promising work on balancing the budget that this $1 billion in savings was an important step in that direction. 
But there was more to the story--a story of abuse. At the time Congress took this action, the RFE/RL was spending 25 percent of their budget on administrative costs, while the Voice of America was spending less than half of that--only 12 percent. Lavish salaries. Mr. President, there were salaries of $200,000 to $300,000, paid by the American taxpayers; and perks for executives that were a deeply ingrained way of life in these programs. These excesses are what inspired me and other Members of Congress to take a long hard look at how to fix this problem. This, of course, is our role--to oversee the programs of the executive branch and protect the dollars of the people who elect us. 
In this particular case, we actually did a pretty good job, after many years. Now, though, Mr. President, I am concerned about what will happen in the future. Now the Foreign Relations Committee has reported out a bill that includes language to recreate what, to me, looks virtually identical to this old BIB, the agency we finally got rid of. It creates an independent Federal agency, governed by a board of directors. Others may say that the Broadcasting Board of Governors, or the BBG, under the arrangement assumed by this bill, is very different from the old BIB. I will agree that the BBG is a stronger, more disciplined body than its predecessor; but because of its worldwide presence, international broadcasting is unfortunately an area that is almost inherently vulnerable to mismanagement and abuse. It is very hard to oversee, especially if it is constituted through an independent agency. 
In the past, the BIB fell prey to these vulnerabilities and exercised virtually no control over the abuse of the radios under its jurisdiction. There were two decades worth of GAO and inspector general reports noting fiscal and other problems with the radios, but the BIB just chose to ignore them. Spending abuses 
were brought under control under the BBG structure because of very detailed congressional mandates contained in the 1994 legislation. That didn't happen because the board suddenly decided to clean up its act nor because of any inherent qualities of the BBG itself; it is because we here in Congress did our job and mandated that this organization clean up its act. 
Mr. President, it is my view that recreating this independent structure is a roadmap for a return to where we started out 3 years ago. I find it simply incomprehensible that just as we are consolidating our foreign policy apparatus under the reorganization plan in this bill, we would create a new Federal agency that is virtually identical to the one we wiped out less than 3 years ago. 
Mr. President, let me outline briefly the problems I have with this broadcasting section of the bill. First, fiscal abuse. The structure proposed by the bill, as I have indicated, has historically been a breeding ground for fiscal abuses. These weren't just uncovered 3 years ago. I have a stack of GAO reports and IG reports going back two decades documenting the fiscal abuses that this independent structure generated. It was this independent structure, sitting out by itself, not being managed or controlled by any part of our Federal Government directly, that had these problems. 
A colleague from many years ago, Senator John Pastore, in 1976, said of the problems of this organization, `The abuse has reached the point of becoming almost scandalous * * *' That is what we put an end to in 1994. We put an end, finally, to two decades of abuse. 
A second problem, Mr. President, is privatization. We made a clear commitment in 1994 that Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty would be privatized by the end of this century, only 2 1/2 years from now. Mr. President, why would we now recreate an independent agency to administer the grants for Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty for such a short period of time? If we create this new entity, I can assure you that somehow it will find a justification to continue. All of the hard work and all of the consensus that was developed around the basic idea that it is high time that RFE/RL be privatized will be under attack. We have a chance to finally privatize something. We are almost there. But this bill seeks to undo that. 
Third, Mr. President, as I have indicated several times, and will again, this bill creates a new Federal agency. I find it hard to believe that this Congress, which has been dedicated to downsizing the Federal Government and achieving deficit reduction, would choose to create today a new Federal agency--an agency that isn't even needed. That is exactly what these provisions will do--create an unnecessary, new Federal agency, with all the overhead, all the bureaucracy, and all of the trappings of a brand new agency. 
Mr. President, I also wish to respond briefly to the arguments made by the proponents of this proposal and, in particular, my good friend and leader on these issues, the Senator from Delaware, Senator Biden, who cares deeply about this issue. 
First, Mr. President, he asserts that the fiscal controls and measures designed to curb the kinds of flagrant abuses that plagued RFE/RL in the past will be retained under the new structure, and that nothing we achieved in terms of deficit reduction will be lost as a result of the new structure he has proposed. I sure hope he is right; but I doubt it. I appreciate the intent, but I am concerned that history has shown that just the opposite is going to happen, that what we have achieved could well be undermined by recreating the kind of structure and incentives that led to these problems in the first place. 
Now, what do I mean by incentives? I mean the natural propensity of any institution--especially an entirely independent institution--to protect itself, to try to expand itself, and to relentlessly try to find a way to justify its existence. That is inherent in the nature of independent agencies. 
If the radios are actually going to be privatized by the end 
of 1999, what is this new Federal agency going to be doing in 2 1/2 years? Are they going to be running the Voice of America? Is there a reason, all of a sudden, after all these years, to create a new agency to run the Voice of America? I don't think so. I don't think the Senator from Delaware would be proposing this structure if his concern was the independence of the Voice of America. Rather, his concern has been clearly stated in the past, and it is to house the surrogate radios, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and others that are scheduled to lose their Federal support in 1999. 
Even Radio Free Asia, RFA, has a sunset date in the authorizing legislation that terminates its authority in 1998. So what is the agency going to do after all these rather up and coming dates arrive? What are they going to do, Mr. President? Are they going to lobby Members to extend these deadlines? I am concerned that they will. Is there any doubt in the minds of anyone in this room that if we create a new Federal agency, it will do all it can to find good reasons to argue that it has to continue to exist. 
Secondly, the proponents of these provisions will say that we are talking about something different here because the broadcasting functions have been successfully consolidated into one agency. We mandated the consolidation intentionally, Mr. President, to save money and to eliminate duplication. Mr. President, if these provisions are adopted, the gains we made in both of these areas could be lost. Rather than using, in the name of efficiency, the accounting, personnel, and support services that already exist in the State Department--as it has with the services of USIA--this new entity will have to have its own legal office; it will have to have its own personnel department; it will have to have its own publication office, and who knows what else. That is what you get when you set up a new Federal agency. That agency needs all of those new things, instead of having the State Department handle it under its current budget. 
Again, these provisions--and, Mr. President, I hope I am making the case--head in completely the opposite direction, not only of the whole spirit of the last couple of Congresses, but specifically in the opposite direction of the whole point of the bill the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has put forward in terms of consolidation and reorganization. 
Now, some may say that Congress can protect the taxpayer by maintaining the spending caps we put into the 1994 legislation. I am certainly glad those caps are still there, and that may be true for those programs that are capped. But what is not clear is what happens with administrative costs. 
Mr. President, the comptroller's office of USIA has explained to my staff that some $28 million in administrative services are currently provided to the broadcasting operations by the United States Information Agency. This represents expenditures that are over and above the annual operating budget for the broadcasting operations. Instead, these costs are borne by USIA for property and for housekeeping functions, such as payroll, the payment and vouchers, accounting, contracting, and security. On these latter items, broadcasting `borrows' partial time from USIA employees to carry out highly specialized tasks. If the broadcasting operations are to be separated out from USIA, as is contemplated by this bill now, it remains very unclear how broadcasting would get these services. Would the new public diplomacy bureau at the State Department have to provide these services and, if so, how would that be calculated? Or what would concern me the most is, will the new broadcasting entity, this new Federal agency, simply have to hire its own people, new Federal employees, new Federal positions to carry out those services? 
The point, Mr. President, is that the broadcasting operations currently appear to gain significant economies of scale by using the infrastructure of the USIA. That is what we caused to happen a few years ago. After decades of abuse, we finally forced this Government to show some efficiency and consolidation, and we got some economic benefit out of it. Instead, creating a new agency may lead us to lose those savings and force this new entity to come to Congress for new funds, or it may lead to a situation in which the broadcasting activities lose out when, for every new attorney, or office, or light bulb, and all the bureaucracy that goes with it, there will be less broadcasting hours to some far-flung place in the world to which we believe it is in our national interest to communicate. I guess this doesn't make any sense to me. 
Third, Mr. President--and this is really the most philosophical of the arguments--there are those who really passionately believe that an independent structure is required or is necessary in order to protect what is called the `journalistic independence' of these programs, and really this question gets to the core of what is going on. 
Either you think it is our national interest to continue to pay for--not just subsidize, but pay for--independent radio programs, or you don't! I, for one, think it is essential to compare the surrogate radios to the Voice of America. VOA was created to be, and remains, an essential tool for the U.S. government to communicate U.S. policies and prerogatives to the rest of the world. Let me quote directly from the President's budget request concerning VOA's mission: `The Voice of America was founded in 1942 to provide accurate, objective and comprehensive news and information about America and the world to listeners in other countries.' VOA now broadcasts in more than 50 languages. WORLDNET television similarly supports and explains U.S. policy objectives to foreign audiences worldwide. VOA and WORLDNET employees are U.S. government employees, and no one doubts that a primary mission is to communicate the views of the U.S. government. 
The surrogates--Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty--on the other hand, concentrate their resources on reporting and analyzing domestic and regional events in the countries to which they broadcast. As someone who believes strongly in the rights of free speech and expression, I do not doubt that the development of independent media is perhaps one of the most important challenges for a newly democratizing country. And I do not question those who think that the United States should actively support or encourage such outlets. But that does not necessarily imply that we should bear the cost of running an entire service! The fact that U.S. tax payers are still subsidizing RFE/RL broadcasts to Poland astounds me. We are, in fact, subsidizing the competition in Poland and, in so doing, may even be preventing the development of other alternatives for this kind of activity in that country. But setting aside for a moment whether we should continue to pay for broadcasting in countries like Poland, let me focus upon the issue of so-called `journalistic independence.' 
Mr. President, let me just briefly review some of the history. 
First, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty were established by the CIA, a fact widely known, for the purpose of undermining communist governments. 
Second, they have been funded by the US taxpayers from their inception, a fact that is also widely known and not disputed. 
Third, the Board of Directors for this new entity, like the current one, is appointed by the President of the United States. I would like to know how you can be independent of the U.S. government when your governing board is appointed by the President of the United States! 
Let me make sure everyone understands the bizarre relationship between the BBG and RFE/RL. This is an interlocking board of directors: the members of the BBG are--by statute--identical to the members of the RFE/RL board. As bizarre as it may be to an outsider, the BBG gives a grant to RFE/RL, even through they each have the same board. And these board members are all appointed by the President of the United States! 
Fourth, their budget is debated by Congress each year. Numerous Congressional committees call them up to account for how this money is being spent. We are even debating it right now. 
So how can you even make any kind of claim to be independent on those facts? No one is going to buy it. 
In fact, as the fifth point, let us be honest. The rest of the world views these radios as belonging to--guess who? The United States. Whatever games you want to play with their names or their governing structures, everybody knows these broadcasts represent the views of the United States. U.S. officials parade through these facilities abroad all the time. 
When President Clinton was in Prague in early 1994, the President of the Czech Republic offered the United States facilities within Prague to house RFE/RL. The Czech President offered the buildings to the U.S. President, because he knew, as the whole world knows, that these radios are 100 percent owned by the US government, paid for by the US taxpayers, and subject to oversight by the US Congress. 
Frankly, Mr. President, I do not see how these programs can ever really be independent as long as they are dependent upon federal funding. If they want journalistic independence, the best way is the old-fashioned way: stop taking Federal dollars. 
If these programs need autonomy and independence, the best thing they can do is to privatize. 
Mr. President, I know the debate over `journalistic independence' and over how the United States can best support newly emerging democracies is one that can be highly emotional for many Members of this Chamber. But whichever side my colleagues come out on, I urge you to consider what I find to be the most offensive part of this bill, and that is the provision to create a new, independent federal agency. 
I do not want to be repetitive, but I just can't believe that the Senate, that this body that is working so hard to eliminate inefficiencies and duplications in the Government, would have supported provisions such as these in a bill such as this. 
So Mr. President, let me point out that my amendment has been endorsed by groups who have worked hard to reduce the Federal deficit and eliminate unnecessary spending programs, including Citizens Against Government Waste and Taxpayers for Common Sense.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, to conclude, the letter from Taxpayers for Common Sense really did a good job of reiterating that the question underlying this debate is whether the Senate is capable of following through on budget cuts. If we today recreate the same BIB structure we abolished just 3 years ago, the savings achieved in the 1994 act could be jeopardized and the effort to privatize these radios could be undermined by this new agency as it desperately struggles to justify its existence. 
I hope that the Members of the Senate will reject the creation of this new Federal agency and adopt my amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am enjoying this debate and also enjoying the Senator's command of popular culture. I think this has been a very instructive thing for me over the past few years to work with him on this. I admire his passion. It is born of a lot of experience and knowledge of foreign policy over the years, to which I defer. So I do respect him on this and appreciate the kind words about the savings we have achieved. The Senator is right. And I do try to be straightforward. The Senator from Delaware would say, in fact, he is correct. We have made those savings working together, including with the chairman, whose good support also made that possible. 
That is a victory that we can be happy about. But I can't just look at this bill and feel this is the end of the story. Whatever analogy you want to use, winning the inning but not winning the game, it is not terribly satisfying if you achieve something and then find out a few years later that you set up a scenario--not a fact, I again give you that, but a scenario--where you have the feeling that it might come undone, that there is a good chance it will come undone. Because we are making what appear to be the same mistakes that were made in the past, in terms of how this was set up, that led to the abuses, that led to the need for the agreement that the Senator and I put together several years ago. 
It reminds me of the expression, I still can't find out who said it, I don't know if it was President Reagan or President Bush, something along the lines that `the only thing that is immortal in Washington, DC, is a Federal agency,' 
this concern that somehow we can't ever wean ourselves from the structure of an independent agency, that once they exist they have their own constituency and they exist forever.

<DOCNO>105-feingold-wi-9-19970617</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, to answer the Senator's question, I appreciate his very positive political prognosis for me, and I hope he is right. I would rather not, after all the work I have done on this and all the work he has done on this, simply leave this issue to the hope that I or others in the future will have the time, the energy and the interest to focus on this particular matter. There are so many things we need to work on to cut the fat out of the Federal Government. It is incredible. 
We go home and tell people we finally passed a bipartisan balanced budget, and they look at us skeptically. The first thing I say to them is, `Don't kid yourself, there is still an awful lot of fat in Washington, an incredible amount.' The energy it takes to focus on this one particular piece and clean it up is very, very taxing. I can't simply hope that my own ability to pursue this will last forever. 
Let's face it, these radios have been there for 50 years. I know there are Members here who approach that kind of tenure, but for most of us, we have to try to set something up that we hope will last after we are gone. 
This is relevant to an interesting point that the Senator from Delaware was making where he eloquently outlined the past, the important role that Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty played during the cold war. But in so doing, he made an interesting comment about how things are different now. He said `We have gone from cold war to chaos.' I think that was well said. 
But the problem is that this new world that we are living in is much more complicated than it used to be, involving a lot of different forums for different ideologies, different constellations in power. But there are also different technologies, technologies that did not exist at the time the assumptions that the Senator from Delaware was speaking about were made. Things like the BBC, things like CNN, things like the Internet. 
That is not to say that radios do not have an important role, and perhaps a unique role, as you were indicating, in a number of these situations. But, Mr. President, it is a different world than the world that required us to set up Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty in the way that we did as a surrogate radio. 
Who is to say that we cannot at this point, without using Federal dollars, have our official Government broadcasting done by the Voice of America and then have these alternatives that we have 
described function as they are doing and didn't in the past, such as BBC, CNN and the Internet and then, yes, perhaps, and here I actually do not disagree with the Senator from Delaware, perhaps have a fully privatized Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, a fully privatized Radio Free Asia, and whatever else can be established, be a part of that combined effort to make sure that people who live under any kind of authoritarian government, such as China or any other type of government like that, whether Communist or not, would have the opportunity to get the information they need? 
Mr. President, what the Senator from Delaware has really pointed out by his excellent description is what I said from the beginning. This Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, as a Government-funded entity, not as an entity on its own, but as a Government-funded entity, based on the notion of a need for a surrogate, is a cold-war relic. The concept of the surrogate that is somehow a part of the Government but not really part of the Government is, in my view, a relic. It is a fact and important part of the history of the 20th century. It is not a guidepost for the 21st century. 
But the most important point is this. The Senator cleverly tries to take the argument as to whether or not I think radios are needed for freedom. I am not necessarily disputing that at all. Let's for the sake of argument agree that some kind of radios of this kind are a part of the constellation of services and technologies that are needed for freedom. The question here today is whether we need an independent, federally funded agency to get that job done, this sort of hybrid that claims to be independent but, obviously, isn't because it is funded by the taxpayers and the President of the United States appoints the board. This isn't independence. No one thinks it is independence, although, yes, as the Senator from Delaware points out, perhaps during the heart of the cold war, in that context at that time, there may have been this mythical distinction which I question just how many people actually believe. 
So the question here isn't do we need the radios--let's concede that for the moment--the question is, do we need a new independent agency to run the radios when the Senator himself just said this whole thing is supposed to be completely privatized by 1999 anyway. How important can it be to have an independent agency to do this funded by the Federal Government when he himself just said we are going to privatize the whole thing by 1999? 
What it comes down to is this. The Senator from Delaware has given a great speech, a very accurate speech, but it is most appropriately a speech given to people in this country who have a lot of money, who want to privatize and pay for a privatized Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. That is to whom these words should be spoken, people like Steve Forbes who would be able to put in this kind of money and is interested in it. That is who should hear the plea, not the U.S. taxpayers who have paid enough already in this area. 
Let's just review the facts about independence and lack of independence. 
Fact: The Board for International Broadcasting was an independent agency, and during its tenure as an independent agency, there were horrible revelations of fiscal abuse. That is the fact. The Senator from Delaware says, what would you rather have, an agency that stands out there alone or one that is in the State Department? The fact is, when the Board for International Broadcasting stood alone, that is when the huge abuses, the $200,000 and $300,000 salaries paid by the American taxpayers, occurred, when it was independent. 
Fact No. 2: That there has been a time period when this board was not independent, when, under our agreement, it went under the United States Information Agency. And what happened during that tenure when it was not independent, when it was supervised, when it did have to submit its budget to the head of USIA? What happened is we achieved these things, we achieved these efficiencies. That 
is when it happened. 
So I will go with the same test the Senator from Delaware has suggested: When it was on its own, it failed and was abusive; when it has been under the supervision of another agency that is dedicated to controlling it, it has been under control. We cannot simply create a new pleader here in the form of a new Federal agency. It will need its own staff and personnel. The Senator from Delaware says it won't be required to, but it is allowed to. 
I simply cannot understand how any of us believe after the record of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty under the Board for International Broadcasting, that letting it be free--subject only to appointment and confirmation hearings--that somehow that will lead to a better situation. That is the history, two different scenarios: the record, when it was independent, which is one of terrible fiscal abuse, and the record since it was put under another department under the USIA, which everyone has conceded has been much better. 
Mr. President, I strongly suggest we should avoid this step of creating a new Federal agency. I yield the floor.  
Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment would establish an independent inspector general for the new agency. Under the committee-reported legislation, the State Department's IG would assume responsibility for the new agency. 
An independent IG was designated for the Board for International Broadcasting in the 1988 inspector general legislation. When we consolidated BIB into USIA in the 1994 broadcasting legislation, those functions were assumed by the USIA Inspector General. More recently, the USIA inspector general's office was merged with the State Department inspector general. 
Because of the problems that had plagued the BIB and the role that the then-BIB inspector general's office had played in bringing those problems to public attention through a series of well-documented reviews, I authored provisions in the 1994 legislation that required continuous on-site monitoring by the inspector general of the activities of RFE/RL. 
Frankly, Mr. President, I have been disappointed at the level of attention and quality of work that has been provided by the State Department IG since that office assumed responsibilities for the broadcasting programs. History has demonstrated, over and over, that these programs have been fertile grounds for fiscal abuses and mismanagement. Between 1988 and 1994, the independent IG assigned solely to the BIB produced detailed reports to Congress every 6 months on the problem areas, in addition to a series of special reports that helped identify the abuses in the areas of excessive salaries, deferred compensation, housing allowances, travel improprieties, and other problem areas within BIB. 
If we are going down the path of recreating the BIB structure, then I think it is very important that we recreate the watchdog entity that helped bring to light what fiscal abuses were rampant in these programs under the independent agency structure. 
I am very concerned that the IG's office in the State Department may have little incentive to provide the broadcasting programs the kinds of scrutiny that is warranted, given the history of abuse. 
Therefore, the amendment that I am offering will reestablish the independent IG's office within the new agency in the same manner that its predecessor, BIB, had an independent IG. 
I appreciate the willingness of the managers to accept this amendment.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me thank the chairman of the Banking Committee, Mr. D'Amato, and the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Sarbanes, for accepting this modification to H.R. 1306, which preserves the right of States to opt out of Federal preemption under provisions of the 1980 Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act [DIDA]. With this amendment, the measure retains a key distinction between DIDA and the National Bank Act by continuing to allow States the right to regulate, except as to national banks, both interest rates and noninterest rate terms, such as late charges, over the limit fees, and not-sufficient fund fees, and I am pleased to offer this modification. 
As the former chairman of the Wisconsin Senate Banking Committee, I know the important role of State in this area, and of the contribution State regulation makes to the entire banking system. As the interstate banking and branching laws are implemented, it is critical that States retain that vital role.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise as an original cosponsor of the bill to prohibit U.S. deployment of antipersonnel landmines introduced today by the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] and the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Hagel]. I want to commend the Senator from Vermont for his countless hours of work to ban antipersonnel landmines. 
As we all know, Mr. President, antipersonnel landmines continue to ravage the populations of war-torn areas around the world long after the last shot has been fired and the soldiers have gone home. These weapons pose an enduring threat to postwar reconstruction efforts and to innocent civilians in places such as Bosnia, Angola, and Cambodia. These instruments of war lay in fields where children now play or where farmers seek to grow food for the local populations. In fact, displaced populations are often unable to return to their homes because of the presence of unmarked landmines, and roads have been rendered useless since they cannot be traveled. Antipersonnel landmines cause such high levels of civilian casualties, 500 wounded or killed per week in fact, that they have been called weapons of mass destruction in slow motion. 
In 1995, this body went on record against landmines by passing an amendment offered by the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] to the fiscal year 1996 Department of Defense authorization bill which I was pleased to cosponsor. That amendment imposed a moratorium on the use of antipersonnel landmines except in limited circumstances. 
While, unfortunately, we can never be sure that war-torn areas are completely clear of all active landmines, the current Leahy-Hagel bill will prohibit any U.S. agency from deploying or arming any new antipersonnel landmines after January 1, 2000. This bipartisan legislation also contains language relating to the deployment of landmines on the Korean Peninsula. While I believe that this is an important first step in the eventual elimination of new landmines from the face of the Earth, there is much work still to be done. 
I, and many other Senators, believe that this legislation represents the least we can do on this subject. Because of this view, I wrote to President Clinton in February to express my contention that a ban on antipersonnel landmines should be an urgent priority for the United States. 
In that same letter, I voiced my support for the so-called Ottawa initiative, which calls for a total ban on the production, storage, trade, or use of antipersonnel landmines and includes a plan to develop and sign a treaty by December 1997. In my view, the administration's decision to pursue negotiations through the United Nations Conference on Disarmament, rather than the Ottawa initiative, jeopardizes the likelihood that the Ottawa initiative will succeed. I believe that we should work within the framework of the Ottawa initiative because it is the best avenue currently available to a total worldwide ban on landmines. 
As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I cannot ignore the approximately 110 million uncleared landmines across the globe. To their credit, some of the countries whose landscapes are riddled with these weapons have begun to take positive steps to ban their further use. In February, the South African Government announced its intention to ban the use, production, development, and stockpiling of antipersonnel landmines. In a news conference announcing this decision, the South African defense minister said that the `indiscriminate use [of landmines] has had a devastating effect internationally, in Africa and in our region. In Angola, the number of amputations resulting from antipersonnel landmines is, tragically, one of the highest in the world, and in Mozambique, thousands of these mines remain uncleared.' 
The worldwide devastation caused by landmines was discussed earlier this year at the Fourth Annual NGO Conference in Landmines in Maputo, Mozambique. While the conference focused on clearing landmines from Southern Africa, the tales of destruction and death could apply to many areas of the globe. Since the 1992 Peace Agreement ending the civil war in Mozambique, more than 100 people have been killed by landmines, two-thirds of them children. Mr. President, we owe it to these children--who have seen too much violence and death in their young lives--to make sure they have a safe place to play. And we owe it to our young men and women in uniform, who have represented our Nation so well across the globe, to make sure that the United States will cease deploying new landmines. 
In closing, Mr. President, this legislation is an important first step in protecting future generations from the devastation that many face on a daily basis all over the world. This bill gives the United States the opportunity to take a leadership role in the banning of antipersonnel landmines. This is an opportunity we should not miss.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child Exploitation Sentencing Enhancement Act of 1997. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my friend and colleague from the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Senator DeWine. The legislation we are introducing today will increase the criminal penalties for individuals who use computers and the Internet to commit crimes of sexual abuse and exploitation against children. 
Just as the miraculous advances in computer technology have opened new worlds to many of us, some have chosen to exploit these technologies to advance criminal activity. Most troubling are those who use computers and the Internet to sexually exploit and abuse children. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, which supports this legislation, criminals are increasingly using computer telecommunications technology as a means to assist in the sexual victimization of young children. 
Mr. President, there can be no doubt that the Internet and advancing computer technologies provide each of us with many new and promising means of communication. However, when these technologies are used to further the criminal sexual exploitation and abuse of children, it is essential, in my view, that this conduct be punished more severely. FBI Director Louis Freeh recently testified before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee for Commerce, Justice and State and highlighted this problem;  
The same marvelous advances in computer and telecommunications technology that allow our children to reach out to new sources of knowledge and cultural experiences are also leaving them unwittingly vulnerable to exploitation and harm by pedophiles and other sexual predators in ways never before possible. 
Mr. President, advances in technology should not be the shield from behind which pedophiles and sexual molesters target and prey upon our children. 
In responding to this problem, the Feingold-DeWine legislation directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase criminal penalties for people who intentionally use a computer to entice children into illicit sexual conduct. The bill also directs that sentences be increased for those criminals who seek out children on the Internet and misrepresent their true identity in a knowing effort to gain the trust of the child they intend to sexually victimize. 
The provisions in this bill are directed squarely at those molesters and sexual predators who go on-line and hang out in computer chat rooms targeting unknowing young victims. One distinct and unfortunate advantage of the Internet for criminals is that they are able to reach a much wider audience of potential victims than they would if physical contact were required to initiate their criminal activity. Another troubling aspect of this situation is that criminals are provided with near fool-proof anonymity while cruising the Internet looking for victims. In some cases, victims are enticed or lured to meet with the sexual molester. The ability for the 
criminal to misrepresent their true identity and thus gain the confidence of the victim is a significant aspect of these crimes. Director Freeh also noted this problem recently: 
Pedophiles often seek out young children by either participating in or monitoring activities in chat rooms that are provided by commercial on-line services for teenagers and preteens to converse with each other. These chat rooms also provide pedophiles an anonymous means of establishing relationships with children. Using a chat room, a child can converse for hours with unknown individuals, often without the knowledge or approval of their parents. There is no easy way for the child to know if the person he or she is talking with is, in fact, another 14-year-old, or is a 40-year-old sexual predator masquerading as a peer. 
Clearly, Mr. President, a child molester who stalks children on the information superhighway derives benefits that are simply not present if direct physical contact is required to target and recruit the victim. Director Freeh's testimony also noted that sexual criminals also target young victims by posing as children looking for pen pals or by posting notices on computer bulletin boards in order to facilitate and develop relationships which can in turn provide a victim for the predator's illegal sexual activity. 
In addition to increasing sentences for criminal activity involving this type of conduct, the legislation expands the pattern of activity sentencing enhancement to a wider range of sexual abuse and exploitation crimes. In doing so, those criminals who have shown an ongoing pattern of sexually exploiting minors will be held accountable for their conduct through longer prison sentences. In doing so, the criminal is incapacitated for a longer period of time thus reducing the potential that they will be set free to victimize again. This sentencing enhancement will now be applicable in cases of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, and the coercion and enticement of minors for an illegal sexual activity. Additionally, this legislation targets repeat offenders by increasing penalties for repeat offenses and by increasing maximum penalties available under the Federal criminal code. Finally, the legislation authorizes funding to be used to appoint guardian ad litem for children who are the victims of, or witnesses to, crimes involving abuse or exploitation. 
Mr. President, there can be no doubt that our children are our most precious resource. I am the father of teenage children and I, like any parent, worry about the health and safety of my children. I encourage my children to utilize the Internet and to gain the benefits of these amazing new technologies--technologies which simply did not exist a few years ago or when I was growing up. During my tenure in this body I have been a strong believer in the potential of the Internet and sincerely hope that as we move toward the next century that potential will be realized. However, in doing so, I am mindful of the dangers that always exist when individuals--criminals--exploit a new technology to further their illicit criminal activity. The legislation being introduced today speaks directly to the small percentage of individuals who intentionally misuse the Internet to sexually prey upon children. The adoption of this legislation will send a loud and clear message that the Congress of the United States will not tolerate the sexual exploitation of our young people and that the information superhighway will not become a haven for pedophiles and sexual predators.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce S. 879, the Long-Term Care Reform and Deficit Reduction Act of 1997, legislation to reform fundamentally the way we provide long-term care in this country. 
This legislation gives States the flexibility to establish a system of consumer-oriented, consumer-directed home and community-based long-term care services for individuals with disabilities of any age. It does so while reducing the deficit by $30.4 billion over the next 5 years, and $145.7 billion over the next 10 years with the potential for even greater savings. 
Mr. President, the bill is based on Wisconsin's home and community-based long-term care program, the Community Options Program, called COP, which has been a national model of reform. COP was the keystone of Wisconsin's long-term care reforms that have saved Wisconsin taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. 
The legislation is also similar, in large part, to the excellent bipartisan long-term care proposals developed by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources as well as the Senate Committee on Finance during the 103d Congress, which in turn stemmed from the long-term care reforms included in President Clinton's health care reform proposal. Unlike so many other aspects of health care reform, the long-term care provisions that came out of the two Senate committees, that were included in the Mitchell compromise measure, and that were part of the proposals produced by the standing committees in the other body, received bipartisan support. It is somewhat remarkable that when there was so much controversy over so many issues relating to health care reform that there was so much agreement over the need to include long-term care reform. 
Mr. President, the success of the Wisconsin program upon which this measure is based stems in large part from its flexibility, a flexibility that benefits both individual consumers of long-term care as well as local administrators. 
This legislation reflects that same kind of flexibility. First and foremost, it does so by not creating a new, unfunded mandate. This program is entirely optional for States, and beyond four core services--assessment, care planning, personal assistance, and case management--those States choosing to participate will be free to decide what additional services, if any, they want to offer. States would be able but not required to offer such things as homemaker services, home modifications, respite, assistive devices, adult day care, supported employment, home health care, or any other service that 
would help keep a disabled individual at home or in the community. 
Equally important, the measure provides both some initial funding, and the ability of States to recapture the bulk of the savings they can generate within the current long-term care system. The bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit to Congress a proposal by which States could retain, in this new more flexible program, 75 percent of the Federal Medicaid long-term care savings they are able to generate. This not only provides a direct incentive for States to produce Medicaid savings, it also directly links the future of this reform to its ability to deliver results. 
The legislation also creates a small hospital link pilot program based on our experiences in Wisconsin where such an initiative has helped direct individuals needing long-term care services out of hospitals, and back to their own homes and communities. The hospital discharge is a critical point of embarkation into the long-term care system for many, and this program helps ensure that those who leave a hospital in need of long-term care can receive needed services where they prefer them--in their own homes. 
Mr. President, though I am convinced that long-term care reform can result in substantial savings to taxpayers--and this has been our experience in Wisconsin--this measure does not depend on hypothetical savings for funding. This measure includes funding provisions consisting of specific savings within the health care system. Those savings include extending and making permanent the Medicare secondary payer provisions; establishing a prospective payment system under Medicare for nursing homes; eliminating the technical errors in the reimbursement of certain outpatient hospital services, known as the formula-driven overpayments; and, reforming the way Medicare risk contractors are reimbursed. 
Mr. President, this last provision, fixing the payment system for Medicare HMO's, deserves special notice. The current system of reimbursement is flawed, and results in grossly inequitable distribution of costs and benefits within Medicare. Because the risk contract reimbursement formula is driven by the average fee-for-service costs in an area, Medicare beneficiaries in States like Wisconsin, where Medicare's standard fee-for-service costs are kept low, are punished. By contrast, areas with higher costs, including costs driven by unnecessary utilization and even waste, fraud, and abuse, are rewarded with generous benefit packages and little or no copayments. 
This system of incentives is backward, and I am pleased to include a proposal to bring some sense and equity to Medicare's reimbursement of risk contracts as part of this measure. 
Mr. President, the offsetting reductions in this measure produce savings of $34.1 billion over 5 years, and $166.2 billion over 10 years. Altogether, including the long-term care reforms and grants to States, the bill produces net deficit reduction of $30.4 billion over 5 years, and $145.7 billion over 10 years. 
This must be the approach we adopt, even for those proposals which experience shows will result in savings. By including funding provisions in this long-term care reform measure, we ensure that any additional savings produced by these reforms will only further reduce the budget deficit. 
And there is strong evidence that there will be additional savings, as we have seen in Wisconsin. Between 1980 and 1993, while the rest of the country experienced increased Medicaid nursing home use of 35 percent, thanks to Wisconsin's long-term care reforms, Medicaid nursing home bed use actually dropped 16 percent in the State, saving Wisconsin taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Mr. President, aside from the immediate benefits of reducing the budget deficit, we need long-term care reform in its own right. 
While the population of those needing long-term care is growing much faster than those providing indirect support as taxpayers, informal care, which is largely provided by families, has been stretched to the limit by the economics of health care and the increasing age of the caregivers themselves. 
The default system of formal long-term care, currently funded through the Medicaid Program, requires that individuals impoverish themselves before they can receive needed care, and it largely limits care to expensive institutional settings. 
Failure to reform long-term care will inevitably lead to increased use of the Medicaid system--the most expensive long-term care alternative for taxpayers, and the least desirable for consumers. 
Mr. President, there are few statistical forecasts as accurate as those dealing with our population, and estimates show that the population needing long-term care will explode during the next few decades. The elderly are the fastest growing segment of our population, with those over age 85--individuals most in need of long-term care--the fastest growing segment of the elderly. The over-85 population will triple in size between 1980 and 2030, and will be nearly seven times larger in 2050 than in 1980. 
The growth in the population of elderly needing some assistance is expected to be equally dramatic. Activities of daily living, or ADL's, are a common measure of need 
for long-term care services. These activities include eating, transferring in and out of bed, toileting, dressing, and bathing. In 1988, approximately 6.9 million elderly could not perform all of these activities. By 2000, this population is expected to increase to 9 million, and by 2040 to 18 million. 
Mr. President, that we have been able to stave off a long-term care crisis to date is due in large part to the direct caregiving provided by millions of families for their elderly and disabled family members. But here also we see that the demographic changes of the next several decades will result in increased strain on the current system. 
While the number of people in need of care is increasing rapidly, the population supporting those individuals, either through direct caregiving, or indirectly through their taxes, is growing much more slowly, and thus is shrinking in comparison. 
In 1900, there were about 7 elderly individuals for every 100 people of working age. As of 1990, the ratio was about 20 elderly for every 100, by 2020 the ratio will be 29 per 100, and after that it will rise to 38 per 100 by 2030. 
These population differences will be further aggravated by the changing nature of the family and the work force. As the Alzheimer's Association has noted, smaller families, delayed childbearing, more women in the work force, higher divorce rates, and increased mobility all mean there will be fewer primary caregivers available, and far less informal support for those who do continue to provide care to family members in need of long-term care services. 
Mr. President, while some elderly are relatively well off, thanks in part to programs like Social Security and Medicare that have kept many out of poverty, it is also true that too many seniors still find themselves living near or below the poverty line. This is especially true for those needing long-term care, who, on average, are poorer than those who do not need long-term care. In 1990, about 27 percent of people needing help with some activity of daily living survived on incomes below the poverty level, compared with 17 percent of all older people. About half of impaired elderly have income under 150 percent of poverty, compared with 35 percent of all elderly, and, according to Families USA, while 20 percent of the population as a whole had annual family income under $15,685 in 1992, nearly half of the disabled population had income under that level. 
Further aggravating the problem is that informal family member caregivers are getting older. These caregivers are already an average of 57, with 36 percent of caregivers 65 or older. As the population ages, so will the average age of caregivers, and as the population of caregivers increases, their ability to provide adequate informal care diminishes. 
Mr. President, all in all our country faces a rapidly growing population needing long-term care services, a population which is disproportionately poor. At the same time, the group of family caregivers, that has kept most of the population needing long-term care out of Government programs like Medicaid, is shrinking relative to those in need of services, and is becoming progressively older. 
The inescapable result of these trends is substantial pressure on Government provided long-term care services--services that are inadequate in several fundamental ways. 
First, with some exceptions, the current system fails to build effectively on the informal care provided by families. 
Mr. President, most people with disabilities, even with severe disabilities, rely on care in their home from family and friends. The Alzheimer's Association estimates that families provide between 80 and 90 percent of all care at home, willingly and without pay. The association estimates that this informal off-budget care would cost $54 billion to replace. 
This last figure can be only an estimate, not because it doesn't fairly represent the services currently being provided by family members, but because comparable services are largely unavailable from the long-term care system. The variety of home- and community-based services provided by family members simply do not exist in many areas. 
Mr. President, the prevalence of family-provided caregiving affirms that, in reforming our long-term care system, it is vital that we build on top of the existing informal care that is being provided, not try to substitute for that care by imposing a new system. The goal of long-term care reform is first to enable family caregivers to continue to provide the care they currently give and that their family members prefer. 
Mr. President, another weakness of the current long-term care system is the lack of a home and community service capacity. This is due in part to the inadequacies of the Medicaid Program. Enacted in 1965, Medicaid was primarily a response to the acute care needs of the poor. Though Congress did not envision Medicaid as a long-term care program, it quickly became the primary source of Government funds for long-term care services. 
For many years, those long-term services provided under Medicaid were almost exclusively institutionally based. Not until institutional services, such as nursing homes, had become well established were community- and home-based services funded. 
The result of the head start given institutional long-term care services has been a continuing bias toward institutions in our long-term care programs. The rate of nursing home use by the elderly since the advent of Medicare and Medicaid has doubled, while the community and home-based alternatives to institutional care are considered exceptions to institutional care. A State must get a waiver from the Federal Government in order to qualify for community and home-based nonmedical service alternatives under Medicaid and, in many cases, an individual must otherwise be headed to an institution in order to qualify for those Medicaid funded community and home-based alternative programs. 
More significantly, there remains an absolute entitlement to institutional care that does not exist for the home and community-based waiver alternatives. 
Mr. President, many families have been able to provide long-term care services themselves to their elderly and disabled family members, but the lack of even partial support services makes it increasingly difficult for families to choose to keep their family members at home. 
According to a 1991 Alzheimer's Association study, the family caregiving alternative to Government funded long-term care is likely to disappear not because of the increasing impairment of the long-term care consumer, but because of the physical, emotional, or financial exhaustion of the caregiver:  
Family caregivers suffer more stress-related illness, resulting from exhaustion, lowered immune functions, and injuries, than the general population . . . Depression among caregivers of the frail elderly is as high as 43 to 46 percent, nearly three times the norm. . . . The likelihood of health problems is heightened by the relatively high age of caregivers: the average is 57. Thirty-six percent of caregivers are 65 or older. 
Mr. President, the impact on the economy of the family caregiver is also significant. Beyond the obvious strain on the personal economy of those families with members needing long-term care services, there is also a significant effect on employers. 
One-quarter of American workers over the age of 30 care for an elderly parent, and this percentage is expected to increase with 40 percent of workers expecting to be caring for aging parents in the next 5 years. 
These are impressive statistics when one considers that caregivers report missing a 
week and a half of work each year in order to provide care, and nearly one-third of working caregivers have either quit their job or reduced their work hours because of their caregiving responsibilities. 
For those working 20 hours or fewer a week, over half have reduced their work hours because of caregiving responsibilities. 
Mr. President, long-term care is very much a woman's issue. Women live longer than men, and make up a greater portion of the population needing care. And women are much more likely to be the family member that is providing care to a loved one who needs long-term care. One in five women have a parent living in their home, and nearly half of adult daughters who are caregivers are unemployed. Over a quarter of these women said they either quit their jobs or retired early just to provide care for an older person. 
In addition to the impact on caregivers as employees, workers, and family breadwinners, there is also a measurable impact on their personal health. As the Alzheimer's Association study noted, caregivers are more likely to be in poor health than the general population, and are three times more likely to suffer from depression, a condition that raises the risk of other ailments such as exhaustion, lowered immune function, stress-related illness, and injury related to their caregiving responsibilities. 
Compounding both the work-related and health-related problems, the burden of this kind of caregiving can increase over time. The Alzheimer's Association study noted that unlike caring for a child, which diminishes over time as the child matures and becomes more independent, caregiving responsibilities for an aging parent often increase as they become more dependent and require more care. 
Mr. President, failure to reform long-term care will also lead to cost shifting and will undermine our efforts both to contain acute care costs and further reduce the deficit. 
Thanks in large part to the lack of universal coverage and the attendant shared responsibility, the health care system has become expert at shifting costs. Federal and State policymakers, in attempting to control costs, have often only created bigger incentives to shift costs as they try to clamp down in one area only to see utilization jump in another. All too often, no real savings are achieved in the end. 
This was seen, for example, when the Federal Government changed several aspects of Medicare reimbursements. Patients were discharged from hospitals quicker and sicker than they had been before with a resulting increase in utilization in other areas, including long-term care services such as skilled nursing facilities. 
This example is particularly appropriate. As efforts are made to limit costs in the acute care system, it is precisely this kind of shifting, from the acute care side to the long-term care side, that will occur unless long-term care reforms are pursued. 
A grandmother who is discharged from a hospital by an HMO seeking to lower its costs, may have little alternative but to enter a nursing home. Long-term care reform could provide her family with sufficient additional supports to be able to care for that grandmother in her own home, and at significantly lower cost to the family and the system as a whole. 
But, Mr. President, as important as it is to gain control of our health care costs, long-term care reform is needed first and foremost as a matter of humanity. 
In my own State of Wisconsin, long-term care has been the focus of significant reforms since the early 1980's. 
One long-term care administrator, Chuck McLaughlin of Black River Falls, WI, testified before a field hearing of the Senate Aging Committee in the 103d Congress that prior to those reforms, he saw an almost complete absence of community or home-based long-term care services for people in need of support. 
This was especially visible for older disabled individuals. Except for those seniors with sufficient resources to create their own system of in-home supports, he saw many forced to enter nursing homes who would have liked to have remained in their own home or community. 
McLaughlin noted that though some eventually adjusted to leaving their home and entering the nursing home, others never did.  
I saw people who simply willed their own death because they saw no reason to continue living. These were people who were literally torn from familiar places and familiar people. People who had lost the continuity of their lives and the history that so richly made them into who they were now. People who had nurtured and sustained their communities which in turn provided them with positive status in that community. These people were truly uprooted and adrift in an alien environment lacking familiar sights, sounds, and smells. Many of them simply chose not to live any longer. While the medical care they received was excellent, they were more than just their physical bodies. Modern medicine has no treatment for a broken spirit. 
Mr. President, for many, the current long-term care system continues to be so inflexible as to be inhumane. 
Mr. President, there are many reasons for pursuing long-term care reform--certainly more than are addressed here. But the one which may be the most meaningful for those actually needing long-term care is the ability to make their own choice about what kinds of services they will receive. In particular, this will mean the chance to remain as independent as possible, living at home or in the community or, if they choose, in an institution. 
Survey after survey reveal the overwhelming preference for home-based care, and these findings are consistent with the anecdotal evidence available from just about every family facing some kind of long-term care need. 
Ann Hauser, a 74-year-old woman who retired after 30 years as a ward clerk in a Milwaukee hospital, offered testimony at a May 9, 1994, field hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging that is typical of what many have said over the years. 
Now living at home with help from Wisconsin's home and community-based long-term care program, the Community Options Program [COP], Ms. Hauser related a number of problems she had experienced while in different nursing homes. 
While at this nursing home and the others, I was to continue on IV antibiotics and needed some, but not total assistance for chair transfers. Before much time had passed, I was assisted in moving around so seldom that I lost muscle tone. Within 5 months, I became bedridden. The Heuer lift became a cop-out, and I learned that I was better to refuse it so that I would keep the use of some of my muscles. The less active I became, the more depressed I became. I was going downhill fast. 
How could I be happy in places that allowed the aides to switch the TV station on my television to their favorite soap operas (when I don't even like shows like that)? Furthermore, when I would remind them that I was at their mercy to finish my bed bath as they stopped to watch just one more minute, they would take away my remote control while I shivered and waited. 
The particulars of Ms. Hauser's experience are less important than the overall loss of control and independence that she experienced, something that is common for many in nursing homes. As Ms. Hauser noted: 
How could I thrive in an environment that counted on my remaining inactive when I had been so active until now? 
Dorothy Freund also gave testimony at the May 9 field hearing. At the time, she was a nursing home resident. Ms. Freund, who received her B.A. from Ohio State University, majored in English, and later received an additional degree from Maclean College of Drama, Speech, and Voice in Chicago. 
After a brief stay in a hospital for treatment to her ankle, she came to a nursing home for further treatment. She gave up her apartment, because it was not designed for maneuvering in a wheelchair, and she has been on the COP waiting list for a year and a half. 
Ms. Freund testified that she enjoys helping people, and this was obvious to those at the hearing as she related her efforts to tutor a nursing assistant who had worked at the nursing home. The aide decided that she would like to become a nurse, to get her LPN, but needed to get her high school diploma. Ms. Freund helped her with English, geometry, government, and geography, and, thanks in large part to Ms. Freund's efforts, the nursing assistant did receive her high school diploma. 
Ms. Freund spoke about her experience and her thoughts on living in a nursing home:  
Then why not stay at the nursing home and help others in the same way? It is not an atmosphere of peace and quiet for any length of time. I'm not deprecating the nursing home and its quality of care. They are always looking for ways to improve situations and to solve problems that arise. Nor am I downgrading those who are trying their best to give that care. But when the shouting, moaning, screaming, and babbling all go on at the same time it can be bedlam. It may erupt at any moment. . . . The frustrations of being stuffed in a nursing home, the struggle to ride out the storms, and keep one's head above the turbulent waters, can seem overwhelming when there's not even a gleam at the end of the tunnel. But I just can't resign myself to a life of Bingo and Roll-a-ball. `Don't give up; there must be a way,' I keep telling myself. 
Ms. Freund's testimony, again, is typical of the experiences of many needing long-term care. And it bears emphasizing that the desire to live in one's own home, and to be able to function as independently as possible, exists despite the high quality of care that is provided in most nursing homes. 
Mr. President, this should come as no surprise in a society that values independence so 
highly. We cannot expect an individual's value system to change the instant they require some long-term care, though this is precisely how our current long-term care system is structured. 
If for no other reason, we need to reform our long-term care system to reflect the values we cherish as a nation, to live, as we wish, independently, in our own homes and communities. 
Mr. President, during the debate over comprehensive health care reform in the 103d Congress, I issued a report reviewing the long-term care provisions in President Clinton's health care reform legislation and offering some modifications to those provisions based on our experience in Wisconsin. In that report, I noted that Chuck McLaughlin's eloquent comments on the importance of community were not only relevant, even central, to the discussion of long-term care, but that community must also be the focus of our efforts in many other areas of our lives as Americans and citizens of the world. 
More often than not, the critical problems we face stem from a failure of community or a lack of adequate community-based supports--for example jobs and economic development, housing, crime, and education. These and other important issues are usually confronted by policymakers at a distance--from Washington, DC or from State capitals--essentially from the top down. 
Too often we have tried to solve these challenges, including the challenge of long-term care, by imposing a superior vision from above. This approach has led to inflexible systems that cannot react to individual needs, but rather end up trying to fit the problem to their own structure. 
This fundamental weakness is often enough to undermine even the sometimes huge amounts of money that we send along to implement the problem solving. It also limits the kinds of creative approaches those who are `on the ground' may see as useful and necessary. 
Mr. President, just as we have a need to reinvent government to respond more efficiently to our country's needs and our national deficit, we need also to reinvent community to allow flexible approaches to problems, and to allow those in the community to exercise their judgment as to how best to solve problems. 
A great strength of the Wisconsin long-term care reforms, and especially the home and community-based benefit on which this legislation is based, is that it is focused on the needs of the individual. Eligibility is based on disability, not age, and services are 
centered around the particular needs of an individual rather than the perceived needs of a group. 
The approach this legislation takes is not only appropriate, but integral to the nature of long-term care. 
Mr. President, the population needing long-term care services is a diverse group with widely differing needs. 
Of the many misconceptions about long-term care, and about programs providing long-term care services, the most common may be that long-term care is purely an elderly issue. Though it is true that the elderly make up the largest part of the population needing long-term care services, long-term care is an issue facing millions of younger Americans. Approximately 1 million children have severe disabilities that require long-term care services. 
Beyond the wide difference in the ages of those needing long-term care services, there is a diversity of needs, including the needs of the caregiving family members who may need a variety of different long-term care services. 
From individuals with cerebral palsy to families that have a loved one afflicted with Alzheimer's disease, however well intentioned, no one set of services will address the individual needs of long-term care consumers. 
Rather than trying to fit all of those needing long-term care services into one set of services, this legislation lets case managers, working with long-term care consumers and their families, determine just what services are needed and preferred. 
Mr. President, the failure to enact comprehensive reform will not interrupt my own efforts to advocate and push individual reforms that respond to the needs of people and that can help save our health care system money. 
In home and community-based long-term care reform, we can achieve both. 
For taxpayers in Wisconsin, COP has saved hundreds of millions of dollars that would otherwise have been spent on more expensive institutional care. 
At the same time, COP has provided an alternative that allows the consumer to participate in determining the plan of care and in the execution of that plan. 
But, Mr. President, at the Federal level we are behind Wisconsin and other States in 
reforming long-term care. Despite the creation of community-based Medicaid waiver programs, consumers are, for the most part, faced with few alternatives. This proposal will begin to provide the flexibility State government needs to provide consumer-oriented and consumer-directed services.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my friend, the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], in marking the anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's historic speech on nuclear disarmament. It was in that speech, given June 10, 1963, at American University, that President Kennedy announced the initiation of negotiations for a comprehensive ban on nuclear tests. I am pleased to see that now, 34 years later, a comprehensive test ban is on the verge of becoming reality. 
I am a strong supporter of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty [CTBT] as a way to curtail nuclear proliferation. This treaty, once it is ratified by the 44 actual or potential nuclear powers, will ban all nuclear explosions no matter how small. In 1993, I cosponsored legislation that extended our moratorium on nuclear tests and called on the United States to end all testing by the year 1996. That bill passed and the United States' unilateral move to stop testing has shown our commitment to a worldwide ban on nuclear explosions. As we all know, the CTBT won approval in the U.N. General Assembly last September and, just days after the U.N. vote, President Clinton signed the treaty on behalf of the United States. More than 100 other nuclear and nonnuclear states have also signed the CTBT. 
Mr. President, the CTBT will act as an essential complement to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and will help end the threat of nuclear war. By prohibiting nonnuclear states from developing atomic weapons, the Non-Proliferation Treaty has greatly enhanced global security since it was first signed back in 1968. The CTBT, by prohibiting nuclear testing, will provide further assurance that no additional states will develop nuclear weapons. The world will undoubtedly be a safer place once all nuclear explosions, even underground ones, are permanently outlawed. 
Since President Kennedy first initiated test ban negotiations, the United States has taken the leading role in ending nuclear testing. We must maintain this momentum. I urge the President to submit the CTBT to the Senate for its advice and consent at the earliest possible date and then I would hope the Foreign Relations Committee would take it up for consideration soon thereafter. The United States should continue its leadership by ratifying the CTBT. We should demonstrate that our commitment to a nuclear test ban is as strong as ever.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join in marking the eighth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre, a tragic day when a still unknown number of Chinese--some say hundreds, others thousands--died at the hands of the People's Liberation Army. 
This anniversary is significant because it is the first since the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, the man who orchestrated the bloody crackdown against the pro-democracy movement. Unfortunately, even with Deng out of the picture, the Chinese Communist Party remains unwilling to re-examine the events of June 4, 1989. Indeed, China's leaders would like nothing more than to have Tiananmen fade from the world's memory. 
But Tiananmen is still very much a part of the present. As all of us are aware, Wang Dan, a student leader of Tiananmen, was sent back to prison last October for continuing to advocate democratic reform. According to Amnesty International, 303 people remain in prison for their role in the 1989 demonstrations. Certainly for these people and their families, Tiananmen remains a part of daily life. 
Today, Tiananmen is still very much on the minds of Hong Kong's people. The 1989 prodemocracy demonstrations created an outpouring of support from the British colony. Hong Kong residents donated hundreds of tents and sleeping bags to the students occupying Tiananmen Square. Thousands are expected to gather this evening in Hong Kong's Victoria Park for a candlelight vigil. Many are worried that public observance of Tiananmen will be banned once Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule this summer. After the transfer of Hong Kong is completed, commemoration of June 4 will become the ultimate test of whether China will allow Hong Kong to maintain its cherished freedoms. 
For those of us who are concerned about human rights in China, June 4 is still a powerful reminder that the Chinese Government has not changed. I was appalled to hear that, during his visit to Washington last December, China's Defense Minister Chi Haotian said that `not a single person lost their life in Tiananmen Square.' That was an insult to the memory of those who died on the streets of Beijing that night. 
Mr. President, yesterday Senator Helms and I submitted a resolution of disapproval of the President's decision to renew most-favored-nation trade privileges to China. I feel strongly that the decision in 1994 to delink human rights and MFN was a mistake. Disconnecting the two has helped make China's leaders feel secure enough to renew their crackdown on the democracy movement and commit further human rights atrocities in Tibet. I believe that denying MFN is the best way to communicate to the leadership in Beijing that the United States still values human rights. 
It is the best way to tell the Chinese Government that we will not forget Tiananmen.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to draw the Senate's attention to the parliamentary elections that took place in Indonesia last Thursday, May 29. 
Actually, it does not seem accurate to call this event an election since the polling was conducted amid worsening political repression and human rights abuses by the Indonesian Government. As in past elections, all candidates were prescreened and new political parties banned. Individuals who posed even the slightest challenge to President Suharto's power were not allowed to participate. We cannot mistake this process for a real election. Rather, it was a pitiful example of a brutal authoritarian Government attempting to masquerade as a democracy. 
Clearly many in Indonesia are angry about not having a voice. This latest election was the most violent in 30 years. Rampant corruption among Indonesia's ruling elite and continued high unemployment have created a deep vein of discontent. Yet Indonesians are given no choice other than Suharto, who already has ruled Indonesia for more than three decades. 
Mr. President, the human rights situation in Indonesia remains as bad as ever. Five demonstrators were killed by troops last July after the Government engineered an attack on the office of an opposition party. In addition to the 5 dead, 23 protestors are still missing. Also last summer, labor leader Muchtar Pakpahan was arrested on trumped-up sedition charges. Mr. Pakpahan's only crime was to demand democracy, respect for human rights, and decent labor conditions. 
The State Department's 1996 human rights report indicates that prisoners like Mr. Pakpahan frequently die at the hands of their interrogators. The report states that Indonesian `security forces continue to employ torture and other forms of mistreatment, particularly in regions where there were active security concerns, such as Irian Jaya, and East Timor. Police often resort to physical abuse, even in minor incidents.' 
Indeed, the human rights situation in East Timor continues to be a matter of great concern. Since last Tuesday, as many as 41 people--both East Timorese citizens and Indonesian soldiers--have died in election-related violence. Unfortunately, such killings are a part of daily life in East Timor. Human rights monitors estimate that as many as 200,000 East Timorese have died under the Indonesian regime. Two hundred thousand. That represents a full third of East Timor's population before Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony back in 1975. 
On the day before Indonesia's election, East Timorese activist and co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize Jose Ramos-Horta visited Washington. Mr. Ramos-Horta carried with him graphic evidence of human rights abuses that have occurred in East Timor in the last few months, evidence that includes disturbing photographs of Indonesian military officers torturing 
East Timorese detainees with electric shocks and lit cigarettes. 
In his statement on the elections, Mr. Ramos-Horta notes that the unrest in East Timor is now spreading into Indonesia as people grow more frustrated with the existing political system. According to Mr. Ramos-Horta `a spiral of violence can be anticipated for Indonesia from now on as dissent grows. It will be met with the customary repression by the military-backed regime, now increasingly desperate as its grip on power begins to slip, leading to an extended period of instability, disruption to peace and much human suffering.' 
I agree that the violence in Indonesia will only subside after President Suharto initiates real democratic change and, for example, allows all parties to compete equally in the political process. 
However, like their counterparts in China, Indonesian authorities try to argue that greater democracy will lead to instability which in turn will impede economic development. I fundamentally reject this idea. Clearly, with so many Indonesians venting their anger against the present regime, the problem is not too much democracy, but too little. Just because President Suharto's government has boosted economic growth does not mean it has the right to murder and torture Indonesians and East Timorese. 
Mr. President, the events of last week only further my discomfort regarding United States policy in Indonesia. As you know, the United States has supplied Indonesia with military training and weapons. Rather than aid Indonesia's military, we should encourage the democratic forces within Indonesian society. As a world leader with great influence in Jakarta, the United States should work to convince Indonesia's leaders that holding real elections, the kind that give people a true say in how they are governed, is a sign of national strength, not weakness.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee [Mr. Helms] and I have today introduced a joint resolution of disapproval for the President's decision to extend most-favored-nation status to China. 
This is third year in a row that I will be introducing this joint resolution, and--I am pleased to say--the second time with Senator Helms. I have joined with the chairman once again because I believe that trade policy is an effective tool that the United States can and should use with respect to the Chinese Government. I am pleased that Senators Wellstone and Hutchinson of Arkansas have joined us in introducing this bipartisan resolution. 
Mr. President, on May 19, President Clinton announced his intention to extend for another year most-favored-nation trading status to China, which he formally requested from the Congress last week. Although we have expected the President to make such a decision for some time now, I can only say that I am once again disappointed in the President's decision. In fact, I have objected to the President's policy regarding the extension of MFN status to China since 1994, when he de-linked the issue of human rights from our trading policy. The argument made then is that trade rights and human rights are not interrelated. At the same time, it was said, through `constructive engagement' on economic matters, and dialogue on other issues, including human rights, the United States could better influence the behavior of the Chinese Government. 
That was a mistake. 
Let those who support `constructive engagement' visit the terribly ill Wei Jingsheng in his prison cell, and ask him if developing markets for toothpaste or breakfast cereal will help him win his freedom or save his life. I do not see how closer economic ties alone will somehow transform China's authoritarian system into a more democratic one. Unless we press the case for improvement in China's human rights record, using the leverage afforded us by the Chinese Government's desire to expand its economy and increase trade with us, I do not see how conditions will get much better. 
De-linking MFN has resulted only in the continued despair of millions of Chinese people, and there is no evidence that MFN has influenced Beijing to improve its human rights policies. Basic freedoms--of expression, of religion, of association--are routinely denied. Rule of law, at least as I would define it, does not exist. 
Mr. President, shortly before the Memorial Day recess, the Foreign Relations Committee held several hearings on the current situation in China. We had, for example, an excellent hearing on the situation in Tibet, where China continues its cultural and political repression and still refuses to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama, a Nobel laureate. We also heard testimony about how China is not sticking to its commitments under a 1992 Memorandum of Understanding with the United States on the issue of the use of forced prison labor. It is unconscionable that American consumers have unwittingly been used to help finance the abhorrent Chinese policy of reform through labor. 
And that is not all. 
Virtually every review of the behavior of the Chinese Government over the past year demonstrates that not only has there been no improvement in the human rights situation in China, but in many cases, it has worsened. 
Now, 3 years after the President's decision to de-link MFN from human rights, the State Department's most recent Human Rights report on China describes, once again, an abysmal situation. According to the report, 
The Government continued to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic freedoms. . . . Abuses included torture and mistreatment of prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and lengthy incommunicado detention. Prison conditions remained harsh. The Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, and worker rights. 
In October 1996, we were witness to yet another example of these policies, when Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, was sentenced to 11 years in prison. This was, of course, after he had already been held in incommunicado detention for 17 months in connection with the issuance of a pro-democracy petition. Many political prisoners--some whose names we know, like Mr. Wang and Mr. Wei, and many of whose names we do not--have become ill as a result of their prolonged incarcerations, and are not receiving proper medical care. 
The past year also saw the December arrest of Ngawang Choepel, a Tibetan musicologist and former Fulbright scholar who was the subject of a recent Moynihan resolution that I was proud to cosponsor. Also in December, a Beijing court sentenced activist Li Hai for collecting information on Tiananmen activists in prison. Li was trying to compile a list giving the name, age, family situation, crime, length of sentence, and the location of the prison in which these activists were held. 
In June 1996, university teacher Zhang Zong-ai was arrested and later sentenced for meeting with Wang Dan and writing to Taiwanese leaders. Earlier this year, reports emerged from Tibet indicating severe torture of Tibetan nuns allegedly involved in separatist activities. 
Freedom of expression is curtailed by other means as well. Although the government has recently encouraged the expansion of the Internet and other communications infrastructure, it requires Internet users to register and sign a pledge not to endanger security. Selected web sites, like those from news organizations based in Hong Kong and Taiwan, or those hosted by dissidents, are blocked by the government, and authorities continue to jam Voice of America broadcasts. 
Mr. President, Beijing's contempt for United States values is evident in many fora: in the loathsome compulsory one-child family planning program, in the increased incidence of religious persecution, in the sales of nuclear equipment to Pakistan or missiles to Iran, and in China's utter disregard for agreements to end violations of United States intellectual property rights. Lack of progress in these areas flies in the face of the United States policy of `constructive engagement,' with respect to China. 
In my view--and I know that Senator Helms agrees with me here--it is impossible to come to any other conclusion except that `constructive engagement' has failed to make any change in Beijing's human rights behavior. I would say that the evidence justifies the exact opposite conclusion: human rights have deteriorated and the regime continues to act recklessly in other areas vital to U.S. national interest. 
At the May 13, 1997, Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on The Situation of Tibet and its People, Dr. Robert Thurman, a renowned expert in Tibetan culture who has traveled to the region numerous times over the past 35 years, presented compelling testimony about the Chinese Government's intentions toward the Tibetan people. Dr. Thurman explained quite clearly that, `It is a calculated policy consistent [of the] Chinese Government . . . to eradicate those who might some day claim the land of Tibet back to them.' In order to achieve this goal, Dr. Thurman explained, the Chinese Government engages in all kinds of activities to destroy Tibetan culture, Tibetan religion and Tibetan identity, and in so doing, attempts to assimilate Tibetans into the Chinese way of life. 
But what was most striking about Dr. Thurman's testimony was his description of the behavior of the Chinese Government over the past 3 years, and in particular, Beijing's reaction to United States trade policy. Mr. President, allow me to read from his oral testimony:  
It is definitely a fact that anyone who goes to Tibet regularly--and I have been there eight times--anyone who goes there regularly will tell you that since 1994, when our Executive Branch misguidedly delinked . . . trade privileges from the Chinese behavior, the Chinese behavior accelerated in a negative direction to an extreme degree. Since 1994, the complete oppression of Tibetan religion and the Tibetan national identity has been reembarked upon by the recent and current administration in China. From 1994 to 1997, their policy has returned to being completely genocidal, no longer pretending even to tolerate Tibetan religion. . . . They have expelled many monks from monasteries. They have closed important monasteries. . . . [The Chinese] will never abandon [Tibet] when they feel we have no real will to do anything serious no matter what they do. . . . This has been proven in religious terms . . . in the last three years, since 1994. Once you delinked the money from their treatment of human rights, from their treatment of religion in Tibet, they just went and completely abused everything totally. They undid all sorts of liberties that had been allowed in the 1980s, in fact. They completely have undone them. 
So, Mr. President, we have here compelling testimony of my main argument: that the delinking of trade privileges from human rights issues has actually led to a worsening of the human rights situation in China. 
Perhaps equally disturbing, China continues to violate agreements with the United States on other issues. Violations of agreements on intellectual property rights cost U.S. firms an estimated $1.8 billion annually. Violations of the memorandum of understanding on prison labor, according to some estimates, have resulted in millions of dollars worth of tainted goods being imported into our country. And China's blatant disregard for international efforts to control nuclear proliferation cost us unimaginable sums in future international security. 
We have so few levers that we can use against China. And if China is accepted by the international community as a superpower under the current conditions, it will believe it can continue to abuse human rights with impunity. The more we ignore the signals and allow trade to dictate our policy, the worse we can expect the human rights situation to become. 
We know that putting pressure on the Chinese Government can have some impact. China released dissident Harry Wu from prison when his case threatened to disrupt the First Lady's trip to Beijing for the U.N. Conference on Women, and it similarly released both Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan around the same time that China was pushing to have the 2000 Olympic Games in Beijing. After losing that bid, and once the spotlight was off, the Chinese government rearrested both Wei and Wang. 
Examples such as this only affirm my belief that the United States should make it clear that human rights are of real--as opposed to rhetorical--concern to this country. Until Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, and others committed to reform in China are allowed to speak their voices freely and work for change, United States-China relations should not be based on a business-as-usual basis. Last Sunday, Fred Hiatt illustrated this point in a Washington Post editorial called The Skyscraper and the Bookstore. In recalling the 1993 tour of Beijing that Chinese leaders offered to Mr. Wei after he had been in prison for 14 years, Hiatt wonders whether the skyscraper, a powerful symbol of Western-style economic modernization, or a bookstore, in which Wei found little literary diversity, is the more significant portent for China's future. Hiatt's point is that the more the United States focuses on its trade and economic relations with China, the more skyscrapers might be built in Beijing. But despite massive urban development, there has not been massive development in the most basic freedoms of expression and ideas.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, recently, the distinguished Senior Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl] and I, along with our colleague from the House of Representatives, Representative Thomas Petri, wrote to the Secretary of the Navy, the Honorable John H. Dalton, indicating our strong support for the proposal to name the third Seawolf class submarine the Manitowoc, recognizing the unique contribution by the city of Manitowoc, WI, to the development of U.S. submarine superiority in World War II. 
The Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co. produced 28 submarines during World War II--roughly ten percent of America's submarine fleet during that war. The 25 Manitowoc-built submarines in the Pacific theater sank 132 enemy ships. 
Prior to World War II, the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co. had never produced submarines. As America entered the war, and the Nation committed its resources and energies to the effort, this shipbuilding company took on the task of retooling, retraining its employees, and restructuring its facilities to produce high-quality submarines at a wartime pace. They completed production of the submarines 19 months ahead of schedule and $1.8 million under budget. In all, some 7,000 people were employed at the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Co. at the height of World War II production, many working numerous nonstop shifts. Many also came from other cities and towns and the Manitowoc community opened up its arms to support these workers, giving them a home-away from home, which helped to maintain the morale of these essential workers in the war effort. 
I am pleased to note that the Wisconsin State Senate has just passed a measure urging the Navy to name the new submarine the Manitowoc. Naming the new sub the Manitowoc would honor those who served on the Manitowoc-built subs, those individuals who worked 24 hours a day to build them, and the city which extended its support to the Herculean production effort. It would be a fitting tribute.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this is a notable occasion. 
We are adopting a bipartisan budget plan, an uncommon event, made even more exceptional because that plan outlines a path toward achieving balance in the unified budget. 
As others have noted, this budget resolution is not perfect. 
No one of us would have proposed precisely the same combination of provisions we have in this resolution, that is the nature of political compromise. 
The result, however, is a package of provisions that does provide the opportunity to reach balance. 
Mr. President, balancing our budget has been my highest priority as a Member of this body. 
I ran on that issue in 1992, and I am pleased that we will enact a budget outline that puts us on track to achieve that goal. 
Mr. President, it is important to note that this agreement would not have been possible without the President's deficit reduction package enacted in 1993. 
Some now estimate that package achieved approximately $2 trillion in deficit reduction between 1993 and 2002. 
By contrast, the deficit reduction achieved in this year's budget outline is much smaller, but it is still an important accomplishment. 
Mr. President, I think it also needs to be said this important accomplishment was achieved without amending our Constitution. 
Indeed, I am convinced that the lack of a constitutional amendment pushed both sides to get the job done right now. 
No one was able to say to their constituents: `Well, we passed a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, now it's up to State legislatures.' 
Mr. President, we still have a ways to go. 
This budget resolution is only the beginning; we still have to enact the necessary spending cuts to reach balance. 
More importantly, our longer-term budget prospects need much more serious work. 
In fact, my biggest concern is that the agreement leaves enough room for either or both sides to push tax or spending policies that worsen our longer-term budget prospects. 
I am particularly concerned that while the tax cut agreement may look sustainable in the budget resolution, it may become entirely unsustainable in the long-run, and only aggravate the serious budget problems we know we will face with the retirement of the baby boomers. 
We all must continue the bipartisan commitment reflected by this budget agreement to ensure the resulting tax and spending legislation does not undermine either the immediate goal of that agreement--balancing the unified budget--nor our ability to take the next critical steps--enacting necessary entitlement reform, balancing the budget without relying on the Social Security trust funds, and beginning to reduce our national debt. 
Mr. President, while many can be congratulated for the work done to produce this budget, I want to note especially the work done by our Budget Committee Chairman, the senior Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] and our ranking member, the senior Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg]. 
I joined the Budget Committee this past January, and this is my first experience as a member in working on a budget resolution. 
To say the least, Mr. President, it has been a remarkable first experience. 
We all realize that reaching this kind of settlement is not simply a matter of finding policies on which there is agreement. 
The character and good will of the negotiators makes an enormous difference, and both sides of the aisle were well represented in this regard. 
Mr. President, understandably, we often find ourselves focusing on the developing details of the agreement as the negotiations proceeded, and we all have specific matters to which we pay special attention. 
All of that is appropriate. 
But we often lose sight of the big picture, and the big picture here is that this budget resolution gives us the opportunity to actually achieve balance in the unified budget by 2002. 
That is an historic achievement, and a great deal of the credit for that achievement should go to our chairman and ranking member. 
I am proud to serve with them, and delighted to be a member of the committee they oversee. 
I look forward to working with them next year on a budget resolution that takes the next important steps: enacting necessary entitlement reforms, achieving true balance without using the Social Security trust funds, and reducing the national debt.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joining the junior Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] as an original cosponsor of legislation to designate 5.7 million acres of Federal lands in Utah as wilderness. 
Though this is the first time this particular measure has been introduced in this body, it is not the first time that the protection of Utah's public lands has been before the Senate. During the last Congress, I joined with the former Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Bradley, in opposing the Omnibus Parks legislation because it contained provisions, which were eventually removed, that many in my home State of Wisconsin believed not only designated as wilderness too little of the Bureau of Land Management's holding in Utah deserving of such protection, but also substantively changed the protections afforded designated lands under the Wilderness Act of 1964. 
Wallace Stegner wrote `No place is a place until things that have happened there are remembered in history, ballads, yarns, legends, or monuments.' 
The lands of southern Utah are legendary, alive, and well remembered in the minds and hearts of the people of Wisconsin. In writing to me last Congress, my constituents described these lands as places of special family moments, healing silence, and incredible beauty. In March 1996, during debate on the omnibus parks bill, Ed Culhane of the Appleton Post-Crescent wrote:  
This is some of the most beautiful landscape in the world and each year hundreds of thousands of people hike into these canyons, into this hard, dry land of varnished cliffs and blasted mesas. 
Aldo Leopold once asked if a still higher standard of living was worth its cost in things natural, wild, and free. If we lose the Redrock Wilderness, we will get precious little in return. 
Some may say, Mr. President, that this legislation is unnecessary and Utah already has the `monument' that Wallace Stegner wrote about, designated by President Clinton on September 18, 1997. However, it is important to note, the land of the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument, included among the lands to be given wilderness protection in this bill, is less than one third of the lands this bill protects. 
I supported the President's actions to designate the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument. On September 17, 1997, amid reports of the pending designation, I authored a letter to President Clinton, cosigned by six other members of the Senate, supporting that action. That letter concluded with the following 
statement `We remain interested in working with the Administration on appropriate legislation to evaluate and protect the full extent of public lands in Utah that meet the criteria of the 1964 Wilderness Act.' 
I believe that the measure being introduced today accomplishes that goal. Identical in its designations to H.R. 1500 sponsored in the other body by Representative Maurice Hinchey of New York, it is the culmination of more than 10 years and four Congresses of effort in the other body beginning with the legislative work of the former Congressman from Utah, Mr. Owens. 
The measure protects wild lands that really are not done justice in words. Truly remarkable American resources of red rock cliff walls, desert, canyons and gorges are found on these BLM lands which encompass the canyon country of the Colorado Plateau, the Mojave Desert and portions of the Great Basin. They include mountain ranges in western Utah, stark areas like the new National Monument, and wildlife intensive areas like the Deep Creek and Stansbury Mountains, that support habitat for deer, elk, cougars, bobcats, bighorn sheep, coyotes, birds, reptiles, and other wildlife. These regions appeal to all types of American outdoor interests from hikers and sightseers to hunters. 
Phil Haslanger of the Capital Times, a paper in Madison, answered an important question I am often asked when people want to know why a Senator from Wisconsin would cosponsor legislation to protect lands in Utah. He wrote on September 13, 1995 simply that `These are not scenes that you could see in Wisconsin. That's part of what makes them special.' He continues, and adds what I think is an even more important reason to act to protect these lands than the landscape's uniqueness, `the fight over wilderness lands in Utah is a test case of sorts. The anti-environmental factions in Congress are trying hard to remove restrictions on development in some of the Nation's most splendid areas.' 
Wisconsinites are watching this test case closely. I believe, Mr. President, that Wisconsinites view the outcome of this fight to save Utah's lands as a sign of where the Nation is headed with respect to its stewardship of natural resources in Wisconsin. For example, some in my home State believe that among Federal lands that comprise the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore and the Nicolet and Chequamegon National Forests there are lands that are deserving of wilderness protection. I know first hand what spectacular and special places these Federal properties are, and what they mean to the people of Wisconsin. Wisconsinites want to know that, should additional lands in Wisconsin be brought forward for wilderness designation, the type of protection they expect from Federal law is still available to be extended because it had been properly extended to other places of national significance. 
What Haslanger's Capital Times comments make clear is that while some in Congress may express concern about creating new wilderness in Utah, wilderness, as Wisconsinites know, is not created by legislation. Legislation to protect existing wilderness insures that future generations may have an experience on public lands equal to that which is available today. The action of Congress to preserve wild lands by extending the protections of the Wilderness Act of 1964 publicly codifies that expectation and promise. 
Finally, and perhaps the most important reason why this legislation is receiving my support, and deserves the support of others in this body, is that all of the 5.7 million acres that will be protected under this bill are already public lands held in trust by the Federal Government. Thus, while they are physically located in Utah, their preservation is important to the citizens of Wisconsin as it is for others. 
I am eager to work with my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, to protect these lands. I commend him for introducing this measure.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will vote against H.R. 1122, the so-called partial-birth abortion bill that would outlaw a particular abortion procedure, the intact dilation and extraction, sometimes called intact D&E. I do support a ban on post-viability abortions, if it contains important and constitutionally required exceptions to protect the life and health of the woman. I am disappointed that the proponents of H.R. 1122 have steadfastly refused to accept any amendment, no matter how tightly crafted, which would include provisions to protect women's health. 
I have said repeatedly here on the floor of the Senate, during hearings in the Judiciary Committee, and at listening sessions held across the State of Wisconsin that I believe that a law to ban this controversial procedure could have been enacted last year with one simple addition--an exception that would allow physicians to perform the procedure on women whose health is at risk. Such an exception, in combination with the bill's existing exception to save the life of the woman, is an important and necessary provision. I am sensitive to the fears of the bill's proponents that such an exception could prove to be a major loophole, and I agree that the health exception should be narrow. But it needs to be there. 
Let me remind my colleagues that the Supreme Court has clearly ruled that, although States have the right to restrict post-viability abortions, exceptions must always be made to protect the life and health of the mother. Women cannot be required to trade off their well-being in order to increase the likelihood of fetal survival. 
Last Thursday, I voted for the bipartisan alternative amendment to H.R. 1122 introduced by Senator Daschle and others. I voted for this amendment because it took a comprehensive approach to banning abortions on viable fetuses, rather than merely banning a single procedure. In addition, Mr. President, this amendment contained the critical, constitutionally necessary exception to protect the life and health of the woman. 
I believe that the health exception in the Daschle amendment was sufficiently narrow to satisfy most reasonable people's concerns about creating a loophole in the law. It would have required a physician to certify that continuation of the pregnancy would threaten the woman's life or risk grievous injury to her physical health. Grievous injury was defined in the amendment as a severely debilitating disease or impairment specifically caused by the pregnancy, or an inability to provide necessary treatment for a life threatening condition. 
The other side claims that abortion is never necessary to protect a woman's 
health. But Mr. President, I have met women whose doctors believed differently. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports them, and has stated that although the intact D&E procedure is never the only option to save a woman's life or preserve her health, it sometimes may be the best or most appropriate procedure, depending on the woman's particular circumstances. 
Members on both sides of this debate can cite respected physicians who will support their positions. But precisely because I am not a doctor, I say again that it is essential to include a health exception in any bill we pass. The point is, Mr. President, that there is a dispute within the medical community about the necessity for and the risk associated with intact D&E. And that is where it should be resolved. It should be women and their doctors, not politicians, who decide which medical procedure is appropriate in those circumstances where an abortion is performed. 
If some doctors believe that it is never necessary to perform an intact D & E on a viable fetus to protect a woman's health, then they would not recommend such an intervention. But for those physicians who disagree, I do not think it is the place for this Senator or any other government entity to override that judgment. A decision regarding which medical intervention is necessary is best decided on by individual women and their physicians, in light of their individual circumstances. 
Another equally important aspect of the Daschle alternative amendment was its comprehensive ban on post-viability abortions. Rather than taking the approach of H.R. 1122, which would prohibit a single procedure, regardless of the stage of pregnancy, this amendment took a broader approach. It would have protected women's constitutional right to choose an abortion before the fetus is viable. But once the fetus is determined by a physician to be viable, usually around the 24th week of pregnancy, this amendment would have outlawed abortion, except in the situations I have already addressed, in which the woman's life is threatened or her health is at risk of grievous injury. 
This bipartisan alternative amendment struck the right balance between protecting women's constitutional right to choose abortion and the right of the State to protect future life. It would have protected a woman's physical health throughout her pregnancy, while insisting that only grievous, medically diagnoseable conditions could justify aborting a viable fetus. Both fetal viability and women's health would have been determined by the physician's best medical judgment, as they must be. It was a sensible and responsible amendment. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Daschle amendment was rejected. This is particularly disappointing, because if the underlying bill were to become law, it would not prevent a single abortion. It would merely deny physicians the right to exercise their best medical judgment, and it would force women in critical health situations who would have opted to have an intact D&E to use different, and perhaps less 
safe, options. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me address a related topic. We all know that this debate has unfortunately been characterized by a great deal of misinformation and distortion of the facts. One particular piece of misinformation has been widely circulated by the proponents of this legislation, and I frankly don't think it is helpful to a truthful debate. It involves the deliberate misinterpretation of a conversation that I had with the junior Senator from Pennsylvania last year. 
During last year's floor debate over the veto override, Senator Santorum and I had a brief exchange on the Senate floor which proponents of this legislation have used to suggest that I support infanticide--that is, killing an infant after it has been fully delivered. Obviously, that is untrue. I was answering the question I thought I had been asked. I was addressing the issue of who should decide whether the life or health of a woman was at risk. 
Let me be clear, for the record. Once a child has been born, there is no conceivable argument that would suggest a woman's life or health would be at risk any longer. The distortion of our exchange by the National Right to Life Committee and others is the kind of tactic which undermines efforts to reach an agreement that would ban late term abortions except in the most narrow of circumstances where a woman's life or health is at stake. 
We are near the end of Senate debate on this issue for the time being, but I suspect that this issue will arise again when this body attempts to override another Presidential veto. As we continue to engage in this volatile and emotional debate, both on the Senate floor and in the media, I hope we will make an effort to recognize that there are strong feelings about this issue on all sides. We should respect these differences, avoid efforts to confuse or trick each other and the public, and maintain a level of debate that reflects the importance of ascertaining the truth about this issue and finding responses that are sensitive and constitutionally sound.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to call for the immediate release of Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent political prisoner. 
Wei Jingsheng is no stranger to harsh unjust treatment. He has spent all but 6 months of the last 18 years in prisons or in labor camps, often in solitary confinement. Now serving his second sentence of 14 years for the crime of peacefully advocating democracy and human rights, Wei Jingsheng is terribly ill. His expected release date is 12 years from now--the year 2009--and that is assuming he lives that long. 
At 46 years of age, Wei suffers from life-threatening heart disease, he cannot lift his head, and he complains of severe back pain. His requests for medical attention have gone unfulfilled and all indications are that he has not seen a doctor in more than a year. 
A former electrician at the Beijing Zoo, Wei has been one of the strongest voices of China's democratic movement. In recognition of his efforts, Wei was named the 1994 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award laureate and, every year since 1995, Members of Congress have nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. 
While in prison serving his first sentence, Wei was allowed to write letters on certain topics to his family, prison authorities, and China's leaders. Because most of these letters urged democratic reforms, they were seized by authorities and never sent. Wei was later able to retrieve them and release them publicly, and they have now been translated and published as a book. Today, May 13, is the publication date of this book, `The Courage To Stand Alone: Letters From Prison and Other Writings.' This book states what is obvious to Wei and should be clear to Americans: China needs democratic freedoms. Unfortunately, China's leaders continue to show a flagrant disregard for human rights. 
In 1994, over the strenuous objections of those of us concerned over China's atrocious and repeated violations of international standards of human rights, the administration delinked granting of most-favored-nation trade status to China to improvements in its human rights record. The administration argued then that through constructive engagement on economic matters, and dialog on other issues, including human rights, the United States could better influence Chinese behavior. That was a mistake. 
Let those who support constructive engagement visit the terribly ill Wei Jingsheng in his prison cell, and ask him if developing markets for toothpaste or breakfast cereal will help him win his freedom or save his life. I do not see how closer economic ties alone will somehow transform China's authoritarian system into a more democratic one. Unless we press the case for improvement in China's human rights record, using the leverage afforded us by the Chinese Government's desire to expand its economy and increase trade with us, I do not see how conditions will get much better. 
In fact, the harsh prison conditions and lack of medical attention provided to Mr. Wei demonstrate that, after nearly 4 years, dialog and constructive engagement have made no impact on Chinese behavior. We should make it clear that human rights are of real--as opposed to rhetorical--concern to this country. Until Wei Jingsheng and others committed to reform in China are allowed to speak their voices freely and work for change, American-Chinese relations should not be based on a business-as-usual basis. I hope the administration will do everything possible to demand the immediate release of Wei Jingsheng and urge Chinese authorities to provide him with access to medical care that he urgently requires.

Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise today, with my friend and colleague, Senator Wellstone, and others to start up the conversation again about the need to clean up our election system and pass meaningful, bipartisan campaign finance reform. I am pleased to announce that as of yesterday the so-called McCain-Feingold legislation now has reached a milestone of having 30 cosponsors in the Senate, with the addition of the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Robert Byrd, as a cosponsor. 
The senior Senator from Minnesota, of course, was a leader on this issue long before I got here and continues to be, not only in our legislation but on other aspects and ideas about how we can clean up this system. 
One of the things that really highlights the importance of this issue is the type of work that was recently done by Public Citizen in releasing a report that lays out the fact that the McCain-Feingold bill, and I am sure other alternatives as well, really would make a difference, that had we done the job last July the elections of 1996 would have looked very different. 
They have analyzed three components of the legislation. One is the voluntary limits on overall spending that candidates would agree to in order to get the benefits of the bill. They analyzed the fact that the McCain-Feingold bill would ban soft money completely, as any good reform proposal must do. And Public Citizen analyzed the requirement in the bill that if you want the benefits of the bill, you cannot get more than 20 percent of your total campaign contributions from political action committees. 
Very briefly, since I want to obviously hear from the Senator from Minnesota, I just want to report what the figures were. Over the last three election cycles, had these provisions been in the law and had all candidates for the U.S. Senate in 1992 and 1994 and 1996 abided by the limits, $700 million less would have been spent on these campaigns--$700 million. That is just for Senate races in three cycles; in other words, just one whole series of Senate races for 100 seats--$700 million of less spending. It would have been $259 million in less spending overall by candidates because they would have agreed to an overall limit for their State; $50 million less in political action committee receipts and $450 million less in soft money. 
I wish to indicate, since some get in the Chamber and say this is a proincumbent bill, the Public Citizen report shows it is just the opposite, absolutely the opposite of a proincumbent bill. This is a prochallenger bill. Ninety percent of the Senate incumbents over the last three election cycles exceeded the limits for the McCain-Feingold bill--90 percent of the incumbents. Only 24 percent of the challengers exceeded these limits. So the challengers in most cases would have been the ones who would have been more likely to get the benefits of the bill; 81 percent of the incumbents exceeded the 20 percent PAC limit and only 13 percent of the challengers exceeded the 20 percent PAC limit. 
So there are many arguments that are posed against the bill, most of which do not hold water, including the notion that the bill is unconstitutional. We will address that on another occasion, but today I thought I would just use a few minutes of 
this time to indicate that this notion that this bill is protection for incumbents is false and just the opposite is the case as is indicated by Public Citizen. 
At this point I would like to----

Mr. FEINGOLD. I do really thank the Senator from Minnesota. In fact, I would very much like to join with him in coming out here each week, assuming we are permitted the time. This is the time to start this effort in the Chamber. We had great help from the President of the United States in endorsing the legislation and getting us off to the right start at the beginning of the year when there was a great deal of attention paid to this issue. 
Obviously, there are other priorities; the whole issue of balancing the budget has taken much of center stage for the last few weeks and obviously is now on a track, whether one likes it or not, that is moving in a direction that will be resolved one way or another. 
That is why I think this is the time, as the Senator from Minnesota is suggesting, to have an awful lot of the conversation here on the floor between now and the day we pass campaign finance reform be about this issue. We have to talk to the American people this way and in every other way about what the real facts are about this issue because it has been often distorted. 
For example, the point of the Senator from Minnesota about whether or not this is really a Republican-Democrat issue. It is not. The Public Citizen report, for example, points out there is not a lot of difference between the parties in terms of this issue: 54 percent of the Democrats who ran for the Senate in the last three election cycles exceeded the limits; 59 percent of the Republicans exceeded it. It is not a vast kind 
of difference, and the Members here really know that. The problem is somehow encouraging Members, incumbents here to realize that their lives and their jobs would be better and the opportunities for others who want to run for office would be better if we do this. But I think we do need to be out here talking about this, if not on a daily basis at least on a weekly basis, to let people know this is a serious effort and that we do intend to succeed.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I think we have to do this on the floor, in part because of the witness list. We went through this last year, where the committee hearings were used for a great deal of time and you did not get the feeling that the goal was to find a solution or to pass a bill. The goal was to sort of talk it to death. The floor is a superb place to do this. 
In fact, I would say to my friend from Minnesota, I think one of the best editorials that has been written on this subject, that I think we can sort of elaborate on on the floor in the coming weeks, is something from the Washington Post of April 21, 1997, entitled, `Skirting the Real Scandal.'

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me just read the last paragraph of this. The editorial basically talks about the way in which Members of Congress are very skilled about talking around the edges of this thing: Foreign contributions are the problem, or the problem is what the White House did, or what we need is an investigation, or what we need is an independent counsel, or we need investigations--all so you can talk about everything but the need to actually pass reform. This is what they identified, and I thought the last paragraph was effective. As it says: 
But the churning about the lurid particulars of how that money was raised last year ought not to be allowed to take the public eye off the broader questions: What do you do about the solicitation system generally? How do you keep electoral outcomes, and the policy outcomes to which they lead, from being bought? The politicians--both parties--are conducting a kind of mock debate about the lesser issues as a diversion and an alternative to dealing with the central one. That's the ultimate scandal, and they should not be allowed to get away with it. 
Mr. President, I think that is exactly what the Senator from Minnesota is referring to, talking around the edges, using the committee process to avoid talking about what is really going on, the need to change this big money system, and to talk about it on the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Not only do I agree, but I ask the Senator and I make sure we reach out to Members of both parties in this body who are cosponsors, and others who I think are very interested in reform and have not yet chosen to cosponsor it, to do just that. 
There are myths about the legislation and about the effort that have been perpetuated in an effort to make the public ignore the issue, thinking it cannot be resolved. But the facts speak differently. There have been newspaper articles indicating that we have fewer cosponsors than last year. That is just false. We have 30 Members of the U.S. Senate as cosponsors of this bill. I guess if we do not come out here on the floor and start to indicate these facts, it is very hard for the average citizen to relate to it. 
One of the reasons it is hard for them to relate to it is, when they start hearing about $100,000, $200,000 contributions, it is pretty hard for them to feel invited into the process. It is pretty hard for them to believe that anything will ever change. They are so used to believing that this system and this town is dominated by interests and powers that they cannot control, that the people of the country, when they are asked in a poll, may not say that campaign finance reform is the No. 1 issue. I think, if you ask them whether they think we ought to 
do the job and whether it is important, of course they would say yes. Many would support almost every aspect of the legislation we are proposing. 
But, for the average citizen, if you asked them what is their No. 1 concern, what are they going to say? They are going to say, `We are concerned about our kids' education, we are concerned about crime in our neighborhood.' Those are the things that people should identify, should feel free to identify, and they should not have to worry about a system that has gone out of control so far away in Washington. That is not the stuff of the daily lives of people in this country. That is not what it takes to make ends meet. 
But the fact is, until we clean up this system here, the ability of this Government to assist those families in getting through and making ends meet will be seriously compromised. When we reach the point that Members of this body get on the floor and say that what the problem is is that we do not have enough money in politics, and then we do not pass a piece of legislation, and then we have an election--we find out the result. More money was spent in these last elections than in any other election and we had the lowest voter turnout in 72 years. That is not just a fluke. It is because more and more people are feeling that they are no longer part of a system that is supposedly premised on the notion of one person one vote. 
So, today begins the effort to speak here on the floor on a regular basis--not just about the McCain-Feingold bill, but about the fact that we are not going to allow this year to pass without an effort to bring this issue back to the floor. Again, my lead author on this bill, the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain--I always have to apologize for his being right and my being wrong last year when he said it would probably take a scandal to get this passed. I said, please, don't say that. I want to get it passed this year. But he was right. It took something like the abuses of the 1996 election to get people in this body, to get people across the country, to realize that this just is not a quantitative change in what has been happening in elections since 1974. What happened was a qualitative change, a major change in the way in which elections are conducted. 
Basically, the current election system is falling apart through the use of loopholes and abuses and how much money people are willing to raise through soft money and their own campaigns. 
So our goal here is to make sure everyone knows this issue is not `not there.' It will become one of the dominant issues, not just in the media and the newspapers, as it has been, but it will become one of the dominant issues here in the floor in the not too distant future. 
How much time do I have remaining?

Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations Act that would effectively set an end date for deployment of ground troops in Bosnia. 
The Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1997 provides an additional $1.5 billion in fiscal year 1997 funds for the ongoing Bosnia operation. But what my amendment will do, Madam President, is seek to set a date certain for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from participation in the NATO-led Stabilization Force, or SFOR. Specifically, it prohibits the use of funding provided for under the Supplemental Act for United States Armed Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina after September 30, 1997, the end of our current fiscal year. 
Madam President, I recognize very sincerely that the Dayton Accord and the deployment of the NATO-led Implementation Force, IFOR, to enforce it, has not been without some real benefit. People are no longer dying en masse in Bosnia. And U.S. troops, in conjunction with troops from other countries, should be warmly applauded for having largely succeeded in enforcing the military aspects of the agreement. We should also be very thankful that there have been virtually no casualties. 
I think a special note should be made to commend the courage and the dedication of the U.S. military personnel in the region. These men and women continue to work tirelessly in an environment which has been challenging and very complex. Service men and women from across the United States have served in this mission with distinction and there should be no confusion between the honor and the admiration which they have earned and, Madam President, the need to terminate this operation. 
The issue of whether the United States should continue to deploy ground troops in Bosnia is a separate question from the outstanding performance of our military forces. 
Madam President, I have had strong reservations about United States troop deployment in Bosnia ever since it was initially announced in 1995. As some in this Chamber may recall, I was one of only a few Members of Congress, and the only Democrat in the Senate, to vote against the deployment of U.S. men and women to support the Dayton Accord. 
I said then that I doubted the value of a heavy U.S. investment in the region. I felt then that administration promises to have American men and women out of the region within a year's time were unrealistic and would not be kept. And I questioned then whether or not the Dayton plan would level the playing field between the Serbs and Moslems such that peace would reign in the region. 
So where are we today, Madam President? United States troops have now been on the ground not just for a year in Bosnia, but for nearly 18 months. And the concerns that I had then remain with us today. 
My concerns, Madam President, are twofold. One has to do with a mandate for a military operation that continues to grow, yet has increasingly less value. The other relates to the ever-spiraling cost of United States involvement in Bosnia. 
Let me first take up the question of the mandate under which our troops are operating. 
Madam President, when, in late 1995, the President first announced he would be sending United States forces to Europe to participate in the IFOR mission, he and many others promised the Congress and the American people that the IFOR mission would be over within 1 year. And this promise was reiterated by the President on several occasions and continually backed up by senior American military and diplomatic officials in public statements and in testimony before Congress, including in response to my own questions in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. There were repeated assurances that this would be over within 1 year. 
We all understood that that promise meant that our military men and women would be withdrawn from the region by December 1996, or at least very shortly thereafter. But, Madam President, in November 1996, the President announced that he would extend the 
U.S. mission for an additional 18 months. A mission that was promised to be only 1 year was just suddenly and very quietly extended by 18 months beyond that year through June 1998, for participation in the NATO force now known as the Stabilization Force, or SFOR. 
Despite the baptism of a new mission, Madam President, we all know that SFOR, although a bit more limited in scope, in reality represents just an extension of the original IFOR mandate that was supposed to expire within 1 year. The President's announcement of an extended deadline signaled that the United States would continue to be drawn deeper into a situation from which it has become harder and harder to extricate itself. 
Madam President, the war in Vietnam was called a quagmire. We referred to continued United States troop deployment in Somalia as `mission creep.' I fear that the Bosnia operation is presenting the same dilemma. With indicted war criminals still at large, refugees still unable to return to their homes, and the timing for upcoming local elections still in doubt, there will obviously continue to be many reasons to call for an ongoing U.S. military presence on the ground without any clear end in sight. 
In the meantime, in the heart of the conflict is the fact that the strategic political goals of the warring factions remain unchanged.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from Texas for her leadership regarding the issue of troop deployment in Bosnia, and will support her second-degree amendment. 
The language drafted by the Senator from Texas changes the date of the funding prohibitions in my amendment, as she indicated, from September 30, 1997, which is the end of the current fiscal year, to June 30, 1998, which is the date the administration is now using as its target end date for this mission. 
Of course, Mr. President, I would have preferred the earlier date, the September 30, 1997 deadline, which would effectively require the administration to begin plans to withdraw at least some of our troops starting tomorrow. That would be the quickest way for the United States to get out of a situation that, I think, is getting worse the longer we stay there. 
But I, of course, recognize there are concerns from a number of Senators that trying to dismantle an operation the size of the United States troop deployment in Bosnia within a 5-month timeframe would be difficult to accomplish. I also recognize that there is more support in this body for the later date that the Senator from Texas has suggested. There are many Members who are willing to allow the mission to continue through June of next year if, in exchange for that, they get a solid, firm, and irrevocable commitment to an end date. So I am prepared to support the end date of June 30, 1998. 
A point I want to emphasize is that if Congress does not establish an end date to our involvement in Bosnia, this mission will continue to drag on and on and on. Therefore, I am willing to accept the second-degree amendment of the Senator from Texas. I congratulate her for her efforts in this area. I have joined as a cosponsor of a freestanding bill that she is introducing to also help us accomplish this goal. Regardless of the result of today's debate, she and I will continue to press for an end date to this deployment.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to take this opportunity to respond to remarks in opposition to Senator Hutchison's amendment by the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Delaware. 
Let me, first of all, reiterate a couple of points about my attitude and the attitude of most Senators about this amendment and its purpose. First of all, no one can even begin to criticize what a wonderful job our troops and our military have done in Bosnia. In fact, all we can do is offer praise and gratitude. I feel that way, in particular, about the wonderful job some of our folks from Wisconsin, whom I have had a chance to speak with about this, have done. 
Second, I want to reiterate that I believe this mission has accomplished some very, very positive things. It certainly has not accomplished all that would have been hoped. But to suggest somehow that this mission has not accomplished anything in terms of saving lives and in terms of trying to resolve the situation would be wrong, and I do not suggest that. 
I also want to acknowledge that the two Senators who spoke in opposition to the amendment, the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Delaware, are two of the great leaders on this issue, two of the most compassionate Senators when it comes to being concerned about the tragedy in Bosnia, and I learned that fast when I came here to the United States Senate. I wish that we could be in agreement on this particular issue about how long this mission should continue, because we have been allies on many aspects of the Bosnia operation in the past. 
In fact, Mr. President, I just remind my colleagues that when I arrived here in 1993, the first resolution I ever submitted, was to simply lift the arms embargo that was being enforced against all the areas in the region, all the people in the region, but, in particular, the Bosnian Muslims. 
The reason I came to that position was because of the inspiration of the Senator from Delaware who had taken the lead in developing the concept of lifting the arms embargo prior to my arrival in the Senate. When I got here, I joined with other Senators, in fact, I think I was the first one in that Congress to introduce a resolution to lift the arms embargo. The Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Delaware and I and others all got up and talked about the important right of self-defense, the importance of people being able to defend themselves. We thought that they should be given arms to defend themselves, the right that they have, I believe, under unalienable human rights and under article 51 of the U.N. Charter to defend themselves. That is where many of us wanted to go. 
As the Senator from Connecticut indicated, we tried very hard. We won a vote on the Senate floor on a bipartisan basis, although, regrettably, it was not carried all the way through. I still believe that was the best answer to this situation. But, we did not get that done in a timely manner and, as a result, I think we were essentially forced into the Dayton accord. I think some of our European allies made sure, in effect, that we would be forced into sending troops into the region. 
So when many of us spoke about the importance of lifting the arms embargo, we discussed that it was the right thing for the Bosnians. But it was a way to prevent us from becoming ensnared in a military operation that we would not be able to get out of, where American men and women would be forced into a situation where an end-game or departure justification would be difficult to find. 
That is how we got to where we are today, unfortunately. That is why I have offered this amendment, and I believe it is one of the reasons the Senator from Texas has offered her second-degree amendment. 
When the Senator from Connecticut--and I say this with all respect, because I simply know no one who is more concerned about 
the situation, and I know at a very personal level as well, as a Senator, that he cares as deeply, perhaps more deeply than any other Senator about what is going on in Bosnia--but when he says it is inconceivable that we would try to do this on this bill in this way, let me suggest what I consider to be inconceivable. 
It is inconceivable to me that we would not have a clear debate on this issue when the initial understanding that was given to the American people about this is that it would cost $2 billion and be over within 1 year. I took every opportunity I could in the Foreign Relations Committee and in every other meeting that I had on this subject to ask the question: Is it truly the intent to be out of there in 1 year? And the answer was always yes. Even when it was just a few months before the December 1996 deadline, I asked many leading military and State Department officials about this. I said, `Is it going to be over in a year?' And they said, `Well, yes, give or take a few weeks.' 
The American people and the Congress were led over and over to believe that this was a 1-year operation. 
Then, really quite quietly, it was extended. It was extended by 18 months beyond that deadline, to a minimum of June of 1998. And even then, when I asked whether or not that is the end of the line for this operation, the remark has been simply, `We hope so, we think so, we think it's possible.' 
What is also inconceivable to me is that we add another $1.5 billion in this supplemental bill and then tell the American people what we are on track to do is to spend not just $2 billion--in fact, we are already in for $3 billion--but that the minimum estimate now is $6.5 billion through the middle of 1998. To me it is somewhat inconceivable that we would simply move in that direction without a full and thorough debate with regard to these numbers. 
Where is the public accountability on this? Where is the congressional accountability with regard to the expenditure of those kinds of funds and with regard to the duration of an operation that was promised to be over within 1 year? 
Others have suggested today that somehow this is an unprecedented kind of amendment, but all I can do is refer my colleagues to what we did when it came to the Somalia operation. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia offered an amendment, which we voted on on October 15, 1993, that provided for a cutoff date for the expenditure of funds with regard to Somalia. 
No one knows better the power of the purse of the Congress than the Senator from West Virginia, and he knows that that is the heart and the soul of congressional power when it comes to military operations. Both the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Delaware voted for the amendment that Senator Byrd offered that would cut off the funds for Somalia by a date certain. We signaled what we were going to do in that situation --we signaled it clearly--because we knew that it was time for us to get out. 
You know what is sad about that one. In the Somalia case, we waited until something bad happened. We waited until a tragedy occurred. We waited until we had essentially no choice but to extricate ourselves from a situation that became a mess. I am very pleased to be able to say today that we are not in that situation yet in Bosnia. I hope we never will be. But to wait for that moment to signal clearly when we intend to get out is the worst thing we can do in terms of our credibility in the world. To wait for a moment like that and then just run out of Bosnia because the public support may evaporate is the worst thing we can do in terms of our credibility. I do not think any of us regard what happened in Somalia as one of the finest hours in our diplomatic, military or foreign policy moments. 
So, Mr. President, let me simply say that this is a situation where we all have to decide whether we are just going to let this $1.5 billion go forward without asking serious questions. The Senators who are opposed to me and Senator Hutchison on this said we have not had proper hearings on our amendment. They have indicated they want to have a real debate on this matter. 
That is the whole point. 
We have not had real hearings on this. We have not had a real debate on whether we should spend $6.5 billion on Bosnia by the middle of 1998 or on the possibility of even more. We have not had a real national discussion about whether we should go forward with this. I think the American people and the Congress should be engaged in that kind of discussion. 
So let me conclude by saying that I think this amendment is appropriate. It does not go too far. It does not hamstring our military. There are opportunities for providing more funds later, if needed, for extending the operation, if needed. All this does is signal that neither this body nor this country is going to simply let this continue without any real consideration and public debate of where we are heading--especially since the operation is already costing $6.5 billion and has already more than doubled the duration that was originally promised. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of amendment No. 76, offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter] which requires the Department of Agriculture to collect and disseminate, on a weekly basis, statistically reliable information on bulk cheese prices throughout the Nation. Secretary Glickman has already initiated this price survey with the voluntary cooperation of cheese manufacturers using existing administrative authorities of the Department. The amendment offered by the Senator from Pennsylvania [Senator Specter] requires the Secretary to continue doing so until April 5, 1999. However, because the Secretary has already implemented this cheese price reporting initiative using existing authorities, I wanted to clarify that he can continue to collect and report this cheese price information after April 5, 1999 using the same authorities he is using currently. 
Does the chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Mr. Lugar, concur that the sunset provision in section (d) of amendment No. 76 in no way affects or diminishes the Secretary's existing authority to continue the voluntary collecting and reporting of cheese price information from cheese manufacturers after April 5, 1999?

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in the fall of 1940, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was attempting something audacious, unprecendented in American history--running for a third term as President. His opponent, Wendell Wilke of Indiana, a man with whom he would attempt to forge an alliance 4 years later, was gaining momentum. Roosevelt had waited until October to begin his formal campaign, but when he hit the trail, he did with characteristic gusto. 
`I am an old campaigner,' he told cheering audiences, `and I love a good fight.' 
Mr. President, it was the love of the fight, not in the sense of carrying a chip on one's shoulder, but more in the manner of relishing a challenge to one's ideas and abilities, that marked Franklin Roosevelt's character. That spirit motivated him in his fight against polio, sustained him during many a dark hour in the White House during the Depression and the Second World War and infused itself into his concept of a government that shrugged off old models of action--or inaction --and engaged in bold, persistent experimentation, seeking the best solutions for the pressing problems of the Nation. 
His administration did many things considered audacious in Washington, including the creation of then-radical programs like Social Security. It is well-documented that one of the sources for some of Roosevelt's bold experimentation was the Progressive tradition in Wisconsin, which pioneered unemployment insurance and workers' compensation. 
Mr. President, Franklin Roosevelt sometimes succeeded gloriously. Sometimes he failed. Sometimes he was helped by a fortuitous turn of events; other times, events frustrated his purposes. Through it all, however, he kept trying, kept experimenting, fueled by a restless intellect, guided by the constitutional responsibility of government to promote the general welfare of the people, and supported by a bedrock conviction that an honest attempt would, at the very least, yield a useful lesson and might well solve the problem. 
Mr. President, last week we dedicated the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, a celebration of his memory, his accomplishments and, perhaps most importantly, his spirit. He was a man of enormous complexity and energy who embraced life and encouraged others to follow his example. His philosophy of encouraging boldness and creativity in the service of the common good and his insistence on an inclusive, not exclusive politics will serve us well in any time.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and my senior colleague, Senator Kohl of Wisconsin, I rise today to submit a resolution calling for the restoration of fiscal responsibility to the Department of Defense's plan to modernize and upgrade our tactical fighter force. 
The resolution I am submitting today, focuses on the Pentagon's current acquisition strategy for three new tactical fighter programs; the Air Force's F-22 Raptor, the Navy's F/A-18 E/F SuperHornet, and the multi-service joint strike fighter. Numerous experts, including the Congressional Budget Office and the General Accounting Office, have concluded that given our current fiscal constraint and likely spending parameters, the current acquisition strategy is unrealistic, unwise, and untenable. 
The administration's fiscal year 1998 proposal for defense spending provides $250 billion in budget authority. According to projections provided by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the overall DOD budget is expected to rise after fiscal year 1998 until reaching a plateau of $277.5 billion. That is pretty amazing. 
Amazingly, while all other areas of Government are cutting back, the Pentagon is anticipating a $27 billion peacetime increase over the next 5 years. 
The overall defense budget is comprised of several individual budgets, including, among others, those for military personnel, operations and maintenance, military construction, and, of course, procurement, which relates to the purchasing of new aircraft, weapons systems, and technology. 
It is the procurement budget that I would like to focus on for a moment. The Pentagon's current procurement funding level for new weapons systems, ships, and aircraft in fiscal year 1997 is just over $44 billion. 
But under the Defense Department's current acquisition plan, in order to achieve the projected purchasing levels of new aircraft and ships, procurement funding will have to rise 55 percent, 55 percent Mr. President, over the next five years, until it reaches a level of $68.3 billion. 
Every other title within the Pentagon's budget request--whether we are talking about quality of life issues for service personnel or spending on research and development--every other title remains relatively stagnant over the next 5 years. 
No other program within the Pentagon's budget is receiving the sort of dramatic increase the procurement budget is slated to receive. 
The need for additional procurement dollars--24 billion of them--is the result of the Pentagon's planned purchase of some 4,440 new tactical fighter airplanes at a total price tag of at least $350 billion according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
The Defense Department argues that our fighter force is in need of modernization and that as a percentage of the overall defense budget, procurement spending is within historical norms. 
It is true, Mr. President, that the Pentagon's projections place our level of aircraft acquisition at or slightly below where we were in the 1980's, in terms of as a percentage of the overall defense budget. 
But this omits the fact that the defense budget was an entirely different creature in the 1980's than it is today. Thus, when the Pentagon argues that the piece of the pie they are asking for today in terms of procurement spending is roughly the same as it was in the 1980's, we must recognize that the size of the whole pie was profoundly greater than it is today. 
The procurement budget itself is comprised of a number of weapons systems and technology programs, but the Pentagon's acquisition strategy is dominated by the three tactical fighter aircraft proposals currently on the table. 
This strategy includes three separate programs, all very expensive, all the subject of questions raised by budgetary and aviation experts, and all scheduled to move forward at unrealistic procurement levels. 
We begin with the Navy's F/A-18 E/F SuperHornet program. This aircraft is the followup to the F/A-18 C/D, currently employed by both the Navy and the Marine Corps. 
The F/A-18 is an all-weather, multi-mission strike fighter, and the Navy currently has about 580 in its inventory. Although the C/D performed remarkably well in the gulf war and has the capability of achieving most of the Navy's requirements with some retrofitting, the Pentagon is currently asking for 1,000 of the expensive E/F airplanes, at a projected cost of about $42 million per airplane. The F/A-18 E/F program has a cumulative cost of at least $67 billion and up to $89 billion according to the General Accounting Office. 
The second program belongs to the Air Force. It is the F-22 Raptor, a stealthy fighter intended to provide air superiority but at a extraordinary cost. This aircraft, which one Navy official referred to as `gold-plated,' will cost at least $71 million per airplane, with some estimates reaching over $100 million per aircraft. In all, the F-22 program, slated to provide some 440 airplanes to the Air Force, will cost at least $70 billion. 
The final program is one which is truly still in infancy. The joint strike fighter, formally the Joint Advanced Strike Technology [JAST] Program, is actually still on the drawing board with two major contractors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, dueling for what is expected to be at least a $219 billion contract--$219 billion, Mr. President. That is some contract. And given the Pentagon's porous record keeping its aviation programs on schedule and on target, the costs of this program will likely surpass the initial $219 billion figure. The JSF is intended to be a joint-service, multipurpose aircraft tailored to each of the service's individual needs. The Navy variant will have carrier landing and takeoff capabilities. The Marine Corps variant will have short takeoff and vertical-landing capability. In all, the Pentagon expects to purchase 3,000 joint strike fighters over a 25-year period from 2005 through 2030. 
The Air Force would purchase about two-thirds of these planes, the Marine Corps about 640, and the Navy the remaining 300. 
The JSF program has thus far received mixed reviews. On one hand is the Pentagon's contention that these aircraft will be affordable because of commonality of components and high-volume production of an airplane capable of meeting each of the three services' differing operational requirements. On the other hand is the Pentagon's track record and the countless aviation programs that have promised so much in terms of cost savings and have delivered so little. In fact, the General Accounting Office estimates that the Pentagon's projections with respect to aircraft procurement typically have cost overruns of 20 to 40 percent. 
This, Mr. President, provides an overview of the Pentagon's current acquisition strategy with respect to tactical fighter aircraft. And although the resolution I am submitting today focuses on tactical fighters, it is important to mention a few of the other programs on the Defense Department's wish list, as these programs will also be drawing on a limited procurement budget over the next few years. 
There is the V-22 Osprey--a tilt-rotor aircraft to be used for troop and cargo transport, amphibious assault, and special operations--being built primarily for the Marine Corps and Navy. This is a $46.6 billion program expected to produce some 523 aircraft. 
There is the Comanche reconnaissance and attack helicopter for the Army. The Pentagon expects to purchase close to 1,300 of these helicopters at a total price tag of $25 billion. And the Air Force is asking for 80 C-17 cargo and transport airplanes, at a procurement cost of over $18 billion. 
That Mr. President, is just the portion of the procurement budget related to aviation spending. 
The Navy, for example, is looking to increase the procurement of their surface ships, starting with another aircraft carrier, CVN-77, and 17 of the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke destroyers, as well as four new attack submarines. And in fiscal year 1999 the Navy would like to begin procurement of the new San Antonio-class amphibious landing ships for our Marine expeditionary forces. 
Mr. President, in recent months a number of respected experts on military spending have warned the Department of Defense of an impending fiscal disaster. 
The Congressional Budget Office, the General Accounting Office, Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle--even high-ranking Pentagon officials--have all forewarned that the Defense Department will not receive the procurement funding level it has projected and will not be able to sustain these tactical fighter purchases at their planned acquisition levels. 
Unless we take a step back right now, in 1997, we will undoubtably have what some have dubbed a train wreck, or maybe more appropriately, a shipwreck, in the next few years. 
I understand that many of my colleagues are either strong proponents or opponents of one or more of these individual fighter programs. The resolution I am submitting today does not target any one program for termination--it does not even suggest that one of the programs should be discontinued. The language in this resolution merely states that we do not have now, nor will we have, the necessary available funding to move forward with the purchasing of the number of fighter planes the Pentagon currently has scheduled and given that, the Pentagon should present to the Congress a more realistic acquisition strategy to take us into the next century. 
In just 2 weeks or so, on May 15, the Pentagon is scheduled to deliver a reassessment of our strategic blueprint for our Armed Forces, known as the quadrennial defense review, or the QDR. 
This is the first such reassessment since the 1993 Bottom-Up Review, and represents a collaborative effort on the part of the 
Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the individual services to conduct a comprehensive review of our inventories and projected needs. 
The upcoming QDR presents the Pentagon a timely opportunity to reexamine its spending priorities and make a reasoned determination about what our tactical fighter force will realistically look like over the next 20 years. I am hopeful that the Pentagon will use this opportunity to present an acquisition strategy to the Congress that is affordable, tenable, and consistent with the goal of Congress to achieve a balanced Federal budget in the coming years. 
If not, I intend to offer the resolution I am submitting today, or a variant of it, as an amendment to the budget resolution or other legislation as part of an effort to force the Defense Department to understand the gravity of this situation. I hope such a step proves to be unnecessary.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution of ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
I am pleased that--more than 3 years after the administration sent this treaty to the Senate--the CWC is finally before us on the floor of this Chamber. 
In these three years, Mr. President, three Senate committees have held numerous hearings--nearly 20 of them--on the efficacy of this treaty. As a Member of both the Foreign Relations and Judiciary Committees, I have been privileged to participate in several of these hearings and to hear numerous perspectives during this debate. 
More recently, several Senators and Administration officials have spent a considerable amount of time negotiating the terms under which this treaty would come to the floor. And so I think we should all thank the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee [Mr. Helms] and the Senator from Delaware [Mr. Biden], the ranking member of that committee, for the time they both have spent on this issue. 
I would also like to recognize the efforts of the White House Working Group and the Lott Task Force to come to a consensus on the aspects of this treaty on which we can agree. I know that the Members and Administration officials involved in these negotiations have spent hours reviewing countless technical details. It is because of these efforts that the resolution of ratification before us today contains 28 agreed-upon conditions. These conditions were carefully crafted by our colleagues to respond to Members' specific concerns. I am myself comfortable with these conditions, which, for the most part, duly exercise the Senate's prerogatives with respect to treaty ratification, and instruct the administration to undertake certain commitments. They also require greater reporting requirements which will help the Senate to monitor U.S. participation in the Convention in the future. 
I am pleased that our colleagues have come to agreement on these points, because throughout the deliberations over this convention, I have made two observations: No. 1 the CWC is not a perfect document, and No. 2 notwithstanding that, the CWC is the best avenue available today for beginning to control the spread of chemical weapons, and leading, eventually, to the total elimination of such weapons. 
Like any document arrived at through consensus, the Chemical Weapons Convention can not claim to address every party's concerns. But, it is my view that the 28 agreed-upon conditions in the resolution before us today serve to strengthen what we do have. 
Let me speak first on my initial point--that the CWC is not a perfect document. There are real flaws that we all recognize, and that experts both pro and con acknowledge, related to the verifiability of the CWC. There may well be cheating, evasions, and attempts to disobey the spirit, as well as the letter, of the treaty. Some of this cheating may escape detection--although not enough, I believe, to pose a legitimate threat to the security of the United States. 
Nevertheless, I think we gain more by establishing an international regime that prohibits such behavior than we do by refusing to exercise U.S. leadership in that regime. 
My second, and more important, point is this: The CWC is the best avenue available today for beginning to control the spread of chemical weapons, and leading, eventually, to the total elimination of such weapons. 
Those countries that do ratify the treaty--and this group represents most of the responsible players on the international stage--recognize that through the CWC, the world firmly rejects the existence and use of chemical weapons. The treaty puts in place mechanisms to enforce its precepts and monitor its progress, and signatories are committed to complying with these mechanisms. 
What of the handful of nations who flout international will, and will not sign on to this treaty? 
First, defense experts at the very top of our military command structure are satisfied that the use of chemical weapons by these so-called rogue states does not pose a significant threat to our national security. In March 1996, then-Secretary of Defense William Perry told the Foreign Relations Committee that he was `damm sure' that the United States could respond massively and effectively to any chemical weapons challenge. 
Moreover, the CWC will make it easier for the international community to track the chemical ingredients necessary for weapons production and to inhibit the flow of these materials to rogue or non-signatory states. The Convention will impose trade sanctions on non-signatory countries whether or not they are known to posses chemical weapons. This provision was devised by the Bush administration specifically to make it expensive for countries not to join this Convention. 
As Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee earlier this month, `These penalties would not exist without the treaty. They will make it more costly for any nation to have chemical weapons, and more difficult for rogue states or terrorists to acquire materials needed to produce them.' 
Those states that we are most concerned about currently are unwilling to accept the norms that the treaty would establish. That is why they have thus far chosen not to ratify. 
But it is just as clear these states will never accept the treaty if the United States refuses to ratify. 
This is why I plan to vote in favor of striking the so-called killer amendments that would tie the deposit of our instrument of ratification to the actions of these nations. 
If the linkage were to remain in the resolution, the Senate would become responsible for painting the United States into a very uncomfortable corner, a corner from which we would be unable to exit. Such conditions would force the United States, which led the negotiations of this treaty, to engage in a game of chicken with other countries. It should instead join our allies in ratifying this treaty. 
Mr. President, this treaty provides a solid start to limiting the flow of chemical weapons. 
It urges the destruction of all chemical weapons. It will provide more information about the prevalence of chemical weapons than we have ever had before. And it will make the dissemination of such weapons--and the materials used to make them--more actionable than they have ever been before. 
Mr. President, do I think the treaty could be improved? Of course. So I am pleased that the CWC has the provision for amendment after it comes into force. 
But now is not the time to debate amendments to the treaty. One hundred sixty-one nations have signed the Chemical Weapons Convention and 74 of them have ratified it. 
I think we can all assume that--just as we played a leading role in negotiating the existing treaty--the United States will again be at the forefront of efforts to make the treaty more effective after a period to test its utility. We have the technological means and the economic weight to do so. But only if we ratify this treaty prior to its entry into force on April 29. Only by that deadline--now less than a week away--will the United States be a full participant in the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], the governing body that will have the responsibility for deciding the terms for the implementation of the CWC. 
Would I like to see the enforcement provisions of the CWC written in a less ambiguous manner? Certainly. 
Could sanctions against violators be spelled out more clearly? Absolutely. 
But the CWC was laboriously crafted throughout three decades to meet the security and economic interests of States' Parties. The United States led this effort, and the treaty which we are voting on reflects our needs. As Secretary Albright has said, this treaty has 
`Made in the USA' written all over it. That is why the CWC has the blessing and enthusiastic support of our defense and business communities. 
Mr. President, I would like to address an issue that is of particular importance to me, and that is the potential constitutional implications of this treaty. 
In particular, the argument has been made, incorrectly in my opinion, that adoption of the CWC would subvert, in some way, the constitutional protections of the fourth amendment which--as Americans--we all enjoy. Let me say at the outset that preserving the fourth amendment is a responsibility that I take very seriously and very personally. My concern about preserving the protections of the fourth amendment does not end at the corners of this treaty. I have opposed in this Congress proposals to weaken the fourth amendment's protections, for example, in the area of wire taps. 
In fact, I am pleased to see that throughout the debate over this treaty, many of my colleagues have taken an active interest in promoting the rights bestowed upon us by the fourth amendment. Indeed, I welcome the opportunity to work with these members on future initiatives related to this vital provision of our Constitution. 
With respect to the claim that ratification of this treaty risks constitutional protections for Americans, I think three points need to be stressed. 
First, this treaty, and in particular the inspection language therein, is the product of bipartisan efforts spanning many years. In fact, it was the Bush administration which rejected efforts to adopt overly broad, and undoubtedly unconstitutional inspection proceedings in favor of those in the treaty today. 
Second, although the treaty itself acknowledges the supremacy of the constitutions of its signatories, this would be the case even without specific language. The Senate cannot, be it through signing a treaty or passing a law, subvert any of the protections guaranteed by our Constitution. That is the very essence of our Constitution: it is the bedrock of our freedoms and cannot be abrogated short of amendment to the Constitution itself. 
Mr. President, during a Judiciary Committee hearing last September, I questioned Professor Barry Kellman of the DePaul Law School on various aspects of the constitutionality of this treaty and on each of the points I have raised here today. On each point, Professor Kellman was in agreement with me. In fact, Professor Kellman, who has dedicated many years, and much time and energy to reviewing the constitutional implications of the Chemical Weapons Treaty, testified that, `every serious scholar' who has looked into the issue has found this treaty to be constitutional. 
Finally, to the extent there are concerns to be addressed, and there may be, the proper context for airing those concerns is during what I expect to be a lively discussion over the implementing legislation, which we will have a chance to debate in the next several 
weeks. It is in the implementing legislation--not the treaty itself--where these issues should be addressed and resolved. 
I look forward to working with concerned colleagues as we consider implementation of the treaty, so I am pleased that the unanimous consent agreement arrived at regarding the resolution of ratification before us today included the intent to debate and vote on the implementing legislation prior to the Memorial Day recess. 
As the debate over the implementing language continues, I will work with my colleagues to ensure that the language we ultimately adopt fully and properly reflects the protections embodied in the United States Constitution. 
In the interim, however, we should not become side-tracked by arguments that this treaty is unconstitutional or subverts the fourth amendment. The inspections conducted pursuant to this treaty will be conducted pursuant to the Constitution of this nation. Nothing in this treaty can, nor does it even attempt to, alter that simple, but fundamental fact. 
Mr. President, I support the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention which I believe is in the best interests of the United States. 
And if the Senate is to lend its support to this treaty, we must vote to strike each one of the five conditions before us. Four of these would pronounce the treaty dead on arrival by linking the deposit of the U.S. instrument of ratification to conditions that are simply impossible to achieve--by April 29, or at any time in the near future. The other condition would establish a precedent for the selection of inspectors that would greatly undermine the entire inspection process. 
Mr. President, it is imperative that those of us who support this treaty help strike the language that would undermine U.S. participation in the Convention in this manner. 
And, after doing so, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for final passage of the resolution of ratification.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to re-introduce a measure designed to limit consideration of non-emergency matters in emergency legislation. This bill, S. 647, the Emergency Spending Control Act of 1997, passed the Senate during the last Congress as part of the Senate's version of the line-item veto act, though it was later dropped in conference. Identical language passed the other body during the 103d Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support, first as a substitute amendment by a vote of 322 to 99, and then, as amended, by a vote of 406 to 6. 
Mr. President, the support this measure has received in both Houses is a reflection of the keen awareness Members have of the abuses of the emergency appropriations process that have taken place. This measure helps address one aspect of that abuse by limiting emergency spending bills solely to emergencies by establishing a new point of order against nonemergency matters, other than rescissions of budget authority or reductions in direct spending, in any bill that contains an emergency measure, or an amendment to an emergency measure, or a conference report that contains an emergency measure. 
As an additional enforcement mechanism, the legislation adds further protection by prohibiting the Office of Management and Budget from adjusting the caps on discretionary spending, or from adjusting the sequester process for direct spending and receipts measures, for any emergency appropriations bill if the bill includes extraneous items other than rescissions of budget authority or reductions in direct spending. 
Mr. President, though this proposal relates to shoring up our budget rules, I want to stress that the rules themselves do not solve the deficit problem. No rule can--whether it is a procedural rule of the Senate, a statute, or a constitutional amendment. The only way we will balance the budget is through specific spending cuts and exercising fiscal restraint. 
However, we have made some progress over the past 4 years, and that progress, as well as the continued work we need to do, can be sustained through the budget rules we impose on ourselves by ensuring the sacrifices that have been made, and that we will ask in the future, will not be hollow or futile. 
The rules that have been developed over the past twenty years have proven useful in this regard, though it bears repeating that the deficit has begun to come down only as a result of our willingness to vote for tough measures. 
In general, the rules require that new spending, whether through direct spending, tax expenditures, or discretionary programs, be offset with spending cuts or revenue increases. However, the rules provide for exceptions in the event of true emergencies. 
The deliberate review through the federal budget process, weighing one priority against another, may not permit a timely response to an international crisis, a natural disaster, or some other emergency. We do not ask that earthquake victims find a funding source before we send them aid. But that should not, even in dire circumstances, be read to imply we must not find ways to pay for emergencies, rather than simply add their costs to the deficit. 
But, Mr. President, the emergency exception to our budget rules, designed to expedite a response to an urgent need, has become a loophole, abused by those trying to circumvent the scrutiny of the budget process, in particular, by adding non-emergency matters to emergency legislation that is receiving special, accelerated consideration. 
Mr. President, the measure I introduce today targets that abuse by helping to keep emergency measures clean of extraneous matters on which there is no emergency designation. 
When the appropriations bill to provide relief for the Los Angeles earthquake was introduced in the 103rd Congress, it initially did four things: provided $7.8 billion for the Los Angeles quake, $1.2 billion for the Department of Defense peacekeeping operations; $436 million for Midwest flood relief, and $315 million more for the 1989 California earthquake. 
But, Mr. President, by the time the Los Angeles earthquake bill became law, it also provided $1.4 million to fight potato fungus, $2.3 million for FDA pay raises, $14.4 million for the National Park Service, $12.4 million for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, $10 million for a new Amtrak station in New York, $40 million for the space shuttle, $20 million for a fingerprint lab, $500,000 for United States Trade Representative travel office, and $5.2 million for the Bureau of Public Debt. 
Though non-emergency matters attached to emergency bills are still subject to the spending caps established in the concurrent budget resolution, as long as total spending remains under those caps, these unrelated spending matters are not required to be offset with spending cuts. In the case of the LA earthquake bill, because the caps had been reached the new spending was offset by rescissions, but those rescissions might otherwise have been used for deficit reduction. Moreover, by using emergency appropriations bills as a vehicle, these extraneous proposals avoid the examination through which legislative proposals must go to justify Federal spending. If there is truly a need to shift funds to these programs, an alternative vehicle--a regular supplemental appropriations bill, not an emergency spending bill --should be used. 
The measure I am introducing today will restrict that kind of misuse of the emergency appropriations process. Adding non-emergency, extraneous matters to emergency appropriations not only is an attempt to avoid the legitimate scrutiny of our normal budget process, it can also jeopardize our ability to provide relief to those who are suffering from the disaster to which we are responding. 
Just as importantly, adding superfluous material to emergency appropriations bills degrades those budget rules on which we rely to impose fiscal discipline, and that only encourages further erosion of our efforts to reduce the deficit. 
Mr. President, as I noted earlier, this legislation has passed both Houses in recent years--in the Senate during the 104th Congress as the amendment I offered to the Line Item Veto Act, and in the other body, during the 103rd Congress, by a vote of 406 to 6. I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to pass this measure through both Houses during this Congress, and help end this abusive practice.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 82d anniversary of the Armenian genocide. Today we remember the Armenians who died during the years 1915 to 1923 at the hands of the Ottoman Empire. 
From 1915 to 1923, the Ottoman Turkish government systematically murdered 1.5 million Armenians and drove half a million into exile. On the eve of the first World War, 2.5 million Armenians lived in the Ottoman Empire. Following the brutal Ottoman Turkish campaign, less than 100,000 remained. These Armenians were victims of a policy explicitly intended to isolate, exile, and even extinguish the Armenian population. 
As we look at world events today--in Bosnia, in Rwanda, and elsewhere--we see a repetition of what happened in Armenia. In commemorating this day, we remember those who died, and condemn violations of human rights at anytime in the past or the future. We all know that, in the context of world politics, human rights violations are far too common and the response to those violations is often tame at best. 
As we meet here today, it is likely that somewhere, a political prisoner is being beaten by the police or armed forces, or by some paramilitary group whose members might include police officers or soldiers. It is likely that a union organizer is being detained or harassed by authorities, that a woman is being raped by government thugs, that a newspaper is being shut down, or that a prisoner has `disappeared.' It is equally likely that the people responsible for such outrages will never be held accountable. 
As Americans we must keep a vigilant watch on our world so that the horrors that occurred in Armenia 82 years ago might not be repeated again, and again, and again. History means nothing if we do not learn from it. On a day like today, we must remember what we stand for, and ensure that the U.S. continues to be a beacon of strength and hope for the heroes that stand up and survive such atrocities. These deaths should not be in vain. 
I am proud to commemorate this important occasion today.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce with the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, a bill which attempts to address problems in the dairy industry stemming from the lack of adequate price discovery in manufactured dairy product markets. 
There has been a great deal of controversy surrounding the National Cheese Exchange [NCE], currently located in Green Bay, WI. The NCE is a small cash market that trades less than 1 percent of all bulk cheese sold nationally, has few traders, short trading periods, and infrequent trading sessions. Those characteristics make this exchange vulnerable to price manipulation. Trading on this exchange would not be a concern if it did not have such tremendous influence over cheese prices nationally. However, because the Cheese Exchange is the only source of cheese price information in the country, it acts as a benchmark or reference price for most off-exchange cheese sales. There simply is no other reliable source of information, no other source of price discovery, available for buyers and sellers in this industry to use as an indicator of market conditions. Because the price for cheese directly and indirectly affects the price of milk, dairy farmers are justifiably concerned about the lack of adequate cheese price information and the influence of the NCE on prices they receive for milk. 
Concern about the Cheese Exchange among dairy farmers, while on-going for many years, heightened late last year when cheese prices at the exchange fell dramatically in just a few weeks, causing record declines in milk prices paid to farmers. While milk prices have recovered slightly, they are expected to fall again next month as a result of further price declines at the National Cheese Exchange. 
While the National Cheese Exchange is closing its doors at the end of this month, a new but nearly identical cash market for cheese is opening at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It is expected that this new market, which appears to share a number of the flaws of the Cheese Exchange, will serve as the reference price for cheese throughout the country. It is unclear whether this market will be capable of providing adequate price discovery for the dairy industry. 
That is why the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, and I are introducing this bill today. This legislation requires the Secretary to collect and disseminate statistically reliable cheese price information collected from cheese manufacturing plants throughout the country--a provision also included in my bill, S. 258, which I introduced in February. A price series of this type will not only provide more price information, it will provide more reliable information based on transactions throughout the country rather than on one thinly traded cash market. 
Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman has already begun this process. Last August, I asked the Secretary to use his existing administrative authority to initiate a weekly price survey of cheese plants to improve cheese price discovery and lessen the influence of the small but powerful National Cheese Exchange on milk prices. Secretary Glickman graciously agreed to conduct such a survey, which formally began this January on a monthly basis, and became a weekly survey last month. I have been very pleased with the Secretary's response to the concerns about cheese pricing and effect of the National Cheese Exchange on farm-level milk prices and I appreciate his efforts on this matter. 
Since that survey is relatively new, it is still unclear whether it will produce prices 
which reflect market conditions. That depends upon the voluntary participation of those manufacturers reporting prices as well as on the integrity of the data reported. 
On March 13, both Secretary Glickman and I testified before the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee about the problem of the Cheese Exchange and the lack of reliable price information in the dairy industry and the potential for this new price series to address that problem. At that time, the Secretary indicated that if participation by cheese manufacturers in his new survey was inadequate, the Department may need to consider requiring participation in that survey. However, under current law, the Secretary has only very limited authority to require cheese price reporting by manufacturing plants. 
The bill we are introducing today requires the Secretary to continue his cheese price collection and reporting activities and provides him with broader authority to require participation by cheese manufacturers in that survey. I want to make clear that this bill does not mandate that the Secretary require participation in the cheese price survey, but merely provides him with the authority to do so if it is necessary to ensure the new cheese price survey is statistically reliable. Under the current survey procedures, many cheese manufacturers are already participating voluntarily, so this new Secretarial authority may not be necessary. 
Mr. President, it is essential that dairy farmers have some assurances that cheese prices, which have such a dramatic impact on the price of milk, are reflective of market conditions and not vulnerable to manipulation. By improving price discovery, the new USDA cheese price survey implemented by Secretary Glickman may help accomplish that goal. If mandatory price reporting is necessary to produce accurate survey data, our bill provides the Secretary with the authority to require participation. However, I am hopeful that participation in the survey will continue to be high so that mandatory reporting never becomes necessary. 
I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for working with me to devise legislation that might effectively improve price discovery in the dairy industry and I welcome his interest in this important issue. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation designed to provide a practical solution to the all too common problem of interference with residential home electronic equipment caused by unlawful use of citizens band [CB] radios. This problem can be extremely distressing for residents who cannot have a telephone conversation, watch television, or listen to the radio without being interrupted by a neighbor's illegal use of a CB radio. Unfortunately, under the current law, those residents have little recourse. The bill I am introducing today will provide those residents with a practical solution to this problem. 
Up until recently, the FCC has enforced its rules outlining what equipment may or may not be used for CB radio transmissions, how long transmissions may be broadcast, what channels may be used, as well as many other technical requirements. FCC also investigated complaints that a CB radio enthusiast's transmissions interfered with a neighbor's use of home electronic and telephone equipment. FCC receives thousands of such complaints annually. 
Mr. President, for the past 3 years I have worked with constituents who have been bothered by persistent interference of nearby CB radio transmissions in some cases caused by unlawful use of radio equipment. In each case, the constituents have sought my help in securing an FCC investigation of the complaint. In each case, Mr. President, the FCC indicated that due to a lack of resources, the Commission no longer investigates radio frequency interference complaints. Instead of investigation and enforcement, the FCC is able to provide only self-help information which the consumer may use to limit the interference on their own. 
In many cases, residents implement the self-help measures recommended by FCC such as installing filtering devices to prevent the unwanted interference, working with their telephone company, or attempting to work with the neighbor they believe is causing the interference. In many cases these self-help measures are effective. 
However, in some cases filters and other technical solutions fail to solve the problem because the interference is caused by unlawful use of CB radio equipment such as unauthorized linear amplifiers. 
Municipal residents, after being denied investigative or enforcement assistance from the FCC, frequently contact their city or town government and ask them to police the interference. However, the Communications Act of 1934 provides exclusive authority to the Federal Government for the regulation of radio, preempting municipal ordinances or State laws to regulate radio frequency interference caused by unlawful use of CB radio equipment. This has created an interesting dilemma for municipal governments. They can neither pass their own ordinances to control CB radio interference, nor can they rely on the agency with exclusive jurisdiction over interference to enforce the very Federal law which preempts them. 
Let me give an example of the kind of frustrations people have experienced in attempting to deal with these problems. Shannon Ladwig, a resident of Beloit, WI has been fighting to end CB interference with her home electronic 
equipment that has been plaguing her family for over a year. Shannon worked within the existing system, asking for an FCC investigation, installing filtering equipment on her telephone, attempting to work with the neighbor causing the interference, and so on. Nothing has been effective. Shannon's answering machine picks up calls for which there is no audible ring, and at times records ghost messages. Often, she cannot get a dial tone when she or her family members wish to place an outgoing call. During telephone conversations, the content of the nearby CB transmission can frequently be heard and on occasion, her phone conversations are inexplicably cut off. Her TV transmits audio from the CB transmission rather than the television program her family is watching. Shannon never knows if the TV program she taped with her VCR will actually record the intended program or whether it will contain profanity from a nearby CB radio conversation. 
Shannon did everything she could to solve the problem and a year later she still feels like a prisoner in her home, unable to escape the broadcasting whims of a CB operator using illegal equipment with impunity. Shannon even went to her city council to demand action. The Beloit City Council responded by passing an ordinance allowing local law enforcement to enforce FCC regulations--an ordinance the council knows is preempted by Federal law. Earlier this year, the Beloit City Council passed a resolution supporting the legislation I am introducing today, which will allow at least part of that ordinance to stand. 
The problems experienced by Beloit residents are by no means isolated incidents. I have received very similar complaints from at least 10 other Wisconsin communities in the last several years in which whole neighborhoods are experiencing persistent radio frequency interference. Since I have begun working on this legislation, my staff has also been contacted by a number of other congressional offices who are also looking for a solution to the problem of radio frequency interference in their States or districts caused by unlawful CB use. The city of Grand Rapids, MI, in particular, has contacted me about this legislation because they face a persistent interference problem very similar to that in Beloit. In all, FCC receives more than 30,000 radio frequency interference complaints annually--most of which are caused by CB radios. Unfortunately, FCC no longer has the staff, resources, or the field capability to investigate these complaints and localities are blocked from exercising any jurisdiction to provide relief to their residents. 
The legislation I am introducing today attempts to resolve this dilemma by allowing States and localities to enforce existing FCC regulations regarding authorized CB equipment and frequencies while maintaining exclusive Federal jurisdiction over the regulation of radio services. It is a commonsense solution to a very frustrating and real problem which cannot be addressed under existing law. Residents should not be held hostage to a Federal law which purports to protect them but which cannot be enforced. 
This legislation is by no means a panacea for the problem of radio frequency interference. My bill is intended only to help localities solve the most egregious and persistent problems of interference--those caused by unauthorized use of CB radio equipment and frequencies. In cases where interference is caused by the legal and licensed operation of any radio service, residents will need to resolve the interference using FCC self-help measures that I mentioned earlier. 
In many cases, interference can result from inadequate home electronic equipment immunity from radio frequency interference. Those problems can only be resolved by installing filtering equipment and by improving the manufacturing standards of home telecommunications equipment. The electronic equipment manufacturing industry, represented by the Telecommunications Industry Association and the Electronics Industry Association, working with the Federal Communications Commission, has adopted voluntary standards to improve the immunity of telephones from interference. Those standards were adopted by the American National Standards Institute last year. Manufacturers of electronic equipment should be encouraged to adopt these new ANSI standards. Consumers have a right to expect that the telephones they purchase will operate as expected without excessive levels of interference from legal radio transmissions. Of course, Mr. President, these standards assume legal operation of radio equipment and cannot protect residents from interference from illegal operation of CB equipment. 
This bill also does not address interference caused by other radio services, such as commercial stations or amateur stations. Mr. President, last year, I introduced S. 2025, a bill with intent similar to that of the bill I am introducing today. The American Radio Relay League [ARRL], an organization representing amateur radio operators, frequently referred to as `ham' operators, raised a number of concerns about that legislation. ARRL was concerned that while the bill was intended to cover only illegal use of CB equipment, FCC-licensed amateur radio operators might inadvertently be targeted and prosecuted by local law enforcement. ARRL also expressed concern that local law enforcement might not have the technical abilities to distinguish between ham stations and CB stations and might not be able to determine what CB equipment was FCC-authorized and what equipment is illegal. 
Over the past several months, I have worked with the ARRL representatives and amateur operators from Wisconsin to address these concerns. As a result of those discussions, the bill I am introducing today incorporates a number of provisions suggested by the league. First, my legislation makes clear that the limited enforcement authority provided to localities in no way diminishes or affects FCC's exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of radio. Second, the bill clarifies that possession of an FCC license to operate a radio service for the operation at issue, such as an amateur station, is a complete protection against any local law enforcement action authorized by this bill. Amateur radio enthusiasts are not only individually licensed by FCC, unlike CB operators, but they also self-regulate. The ARRL is very involved in resolving interference concerns both among their own members and between ham operators and residents experiencing problems. 
Third, my legislation also provides for an FCC appeal process by any radio operator who is adversely affected by a local law enforcement action under this bill. FCC will make determinations as to whether the locality acted properly within the limited jurisdiction this legislation provides. FCC will have the power to reverse the action of the locality if local law enforcement acted improperly. And fourth, my legislation requires FCC to provide States and localities with technical guidance on how to determine whether a CB operator is acting within the law. 
Again, Mr. President, my legislation is narrowly targeted to resolve persistent interference with home electronic equipment caused by illegal CB operation. Under my bill, localities cannot establish their own regulations on CB use. They may only enforce existing FCC regulations on authorized CB equipment and frequencies. This bill will not resolve all interference problems and it is not intended to do so. Some interference problems need to continue to be addressed by the FCC, the telecommunications manufacturing industry, and radio service operators. This bill merely provides localities with the tools they need to protect their residents while preserving FCC's exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over the regulation of radio services. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I was pleased to see the Senate consider the President's nomination of Douglas `Pete' Peterson to be the United States Ambassador to Socialist Republic of Vietnam late last week. I supported this nomination in the Foreign Relations Committee. But I did so after careful consideration of the symbolism of this vote and of the signal it sends to Americans. 
Mr. President, the appointment of an ambassador is a normal consequence of having full diplomatic relations with a given country. And we have had diplomatic relations with Vietnam since July 1995 when the President signed an executive order establishing such ties. So, technically, the Senate's view on this nominee does not represent a statement of policy. It simply represents the normal procedure by which the Senate provides its advice and consent to a Presidential nomination. 
There has never been any serious question raised regarding the President's selection of Mr. Peterson to fill this position. Mr. Peterson is an outstanding citizen and public servant. He spent nearly 30 years in the U.S. Air Force, including 6 1/2 years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, and has received numerous awards for his valiant service. As a three-term Member of Congress from the second district in Florida, Mr. Peterson also has devoted significant energies to working with both the Bush administration and the Clinton Administration to bolster the U.S. search program for POW/MIA's. There are few people who have as deep of an understanding of the uniqueness of America's relationship with Vietnam, so I fully support the President's choice. 
This does not mean that there do not remain myriad outstanding questions and issues in our bilateral relations with Vietnam. One issue that is of particular concern to me is the human rights record of the Vietnamese Government which remains poor. According to the most recent State Department Report on Human Rights Practices, the Government of Vietnam continues to restrict basic freedoms; of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of privacy, and of religion. Citizens can be arbitrarily arrested or detained for trying to express political or religious objections to government policies. And although the Vietnamese Constitution provides for the right to privacy, according to the State Department, the Vietnamese Government continues to operate a `nationwide system of surveillance and control through * * * block wardens who use informants to keep track of individuals' activities.' The Vietnamese Government also has in place a policy of forced family planning. 
Mr. President, this is not a country that shares with the United States the principle that government should exist to promote the general welfare of its people. Nor is it one that has respect for the rule of law. 
But, as I said in 1995 when the President first announced his decision to restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam, I believe that diplomatic relations actually enhance our ability to advocate for issues such as human rights and political freedoms. Through a permanent, high-level presence in the country, I believe the United States can intensify the dialog on human rights, work more closely with Vietnamese reformers, and more effectively monitor developments in the human rights situation. 
Now I have listened carefully to the veterans in Wisconsin and to the national veterans' organizations. I recognize that the veterans themselves have differing opinions on the issue of diplomatic relations, in general, and of Senate confirmation of this nomination, in particular. The concerns are two-fold: Does having an ambassador on the ground in Vietnam actually help advance the accounting of POW and MIA cases? Or does the dispatching of a President's representative with ambassadorial rank imply that the United States no longer thinks we have reason to withhold a special privilege for Vietnam? 
Mr. President, it is my view that having an ambassador resident in Hanoi can serve to better advance U.S. interests, in human rights, as I said earlier, and on issues related to the continued accounting of our POW's and MIA's. I salute the efforts of all those who have tirelessly sought details about missing U.S. service men and women, and, from most of their testimony, I am inclined to believe that we will enhance our ability to collect more information about the remaining POW and MIA cases through fulfilling the President's commitment to full diplomatic relations. 
On the other hand, I think it is equally important to acknowledge that sending a Presidential representative of ambassadorial rank does indicate a symbolic change in our relationship with Vietnam that I know some observers still are hesitant to send. It is my view, however, that the United States can serve two purposes by that change: Better advance our interests as described above, and better indicate our concerns about Vietnam or its government through other actions. For example, that is why I voted against lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam and why I have supported congressional efforts to limit United States assistance to Vietnam. 
However, I believe that in an era of global engagement and integration, it usually makes little sense to refuse diplomatic relations with a country in the international community. Vietnam is a large presence in a fast-growing region where the United States has ever-increasing interests. We can no longer hope to isolate it, nor will isolation serve to advance any of our goals. 
To reiterate, Mr. President, I support the President's choice of Pete Peterson to be Ambassador to Vietnam because I believe that the United States best serves its citizens by having a Presidential representative of the highest order resident in the country. Nevertheless, I remain concerned about other aspects of our bilateral relations in that country and I will continue to scrutinize carefully the President's policies in that regard.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to terminate the U.S. Navy's F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet Program. 
The basis for this legislation is contained in a 1996 General Accounting Office report entitled `Navy Aviation: F/A-18 E/F Will Provide Marginal Operational Improvement at High Cost.' In this report, GAO studied the rationale and need for the F/A-18 E/F in order to determine whether continued development of the aircraft is the most cost-effective approach to modernizing the Navy's tactical aircraft fleet. GAO concluded that the marginal improvements of the F/A-18 E/F are far outweighed by the high cost of the program. 
Mr. President, in our current fiscal climate, I have serious concerns about authorizing funding for such a costly program, which according to GAO will deliver only marginal improvements over the current C/D version of the F/A-18. 
As GAO noted in its report, at a projected total program cost of $89.15 billion, the F/A-18 E/F Program is one of the most costly aviation programs in the Department of Defense. The total program cost is comprised of $5.833 billion in development costs and $83.35 billion in procurement costs for 1,000 aircraft. 
Mr. President, before I begin to describe GAO's findings in detail, I would first like to discuss briefly the role of the F/A-18 aircraft in our Nation's overall naval aviation force structure. The Navy performs its carrier-based missions with a mix of fighter (air-to-air combat), strike (air-to-ground combat), and strike/fighter (multicombat role) aircraft. Currently, carrier based F-14 fighter aircraft perform air-to-air missions; A6E's perform air-to-ground missions; and F/A-18's perform both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. The F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet is the latest version of the Navy's carrier-based F/A-18 strike/fighter plane. 
Mr. President, the F/A-18 E/F is just one of three costly new fighter programs the Department of Defense has on the drawing boards right now. 
In addition to the F/A-18 E/F, there is the Air Force's F-22, which is intended to replace the A-10 and the venerable F-16 Falcon. The F-22 is also intended to either supplant or augment the Air Force's top fighter, the F-15. It will have stealth capabilities and will be able to survive in dense air-defense environments. 
And of course, there is the Joint Strike Fighter, which I will discuss in greater detail in a few moments. The JSF is intended to perform virtually every type of mission that fighter aircraft perform in today's force structure, and is to be employed by the Navy, the Air Force, and Marine Corps in unprecedented fashion. 
There are few who seriously believe that the Pentagon can afford to maintain all three tactical fighter programs. The General Accounting Office, the Congressional Budget Office and many others have maintained that the likelihood that all three programs can be fully funded with the planned number of aircraft buys is virtually nil. In fact, many view the JSF as the only modernization program that should be continued. Given our fiscal constraints and Federal budget deficit, can we afford to finance three separate fighter programs with the caliber and costs of the F/A-18 E/F, the F-22, and the JSF? 
The answer is unequivocally no. And that is why I am introducing legislation to terminate any further development or procurement of the program that appears to be most questionable, the E/F upgrade. 
The Navy has based the need for development and procurement of the F/A-18 E/F on existing or projected operational deficiencies of the F/A-18C/D in the following key areas: strike range, carrier recovery payload and survivability. In addition, the Navy notes limitations of current C/D's with respect to avionics growth space and payload capacity. In its report, GAO concludes that the operational deficiencies in the C/D that the Navy cited in justifying the E/F either have not materialized as projected or such deficiencies can be corrected with nonstructural changes to the current C/D and additional upgrades made which would further improve its capabilities. 
One of the primary reasons the Navy cites in justifying the E/F is the need for increased range and the C/D's inability to perform long-range unrefueled missions against high-value targets. However, GAO concludes that the Navy's F/A-18 strike range requirements can be met by either the F/A-18 E/F or F/A-18 C/D. Furthermore, it concludes that the increased range of the E/F is achieved at the expense of its aerial combat performance, and that even with increased range, both aircraft will still require aerial refueling for low-altitude missions. 
The F/A-18 E/F specification requirements call for the aircraft to have a flight range of 390 nautical miles (nm) while performing low-altitude bombing missions. The F/A-18 E/F will achieve a strike range of 465 nm while performing low-altitude missions by carrying 2 external 480 gallon fuel tanks. While current C/D's achieve a flight range of 325 nm with 2-330 gallon fuel tanks while performing low-altitude missions--65 nm below the specification requirement of the E/F--when they are equipped with the 2-480 gallon external fuel tanks that are planned to be used on the E/F, the C/D can achieve a strike range of 393 nm on low-altitude missions. 
Recent Navy range predictions show that the F/A-18 E/F is expected to have a 683 nm strike range when flying a more fuel-efficient, survivable, and lethal high-altitude mission profile rather than the specified low-altitude profile. Similarly, although F/A-18 E/F range will be greater than the F/A-18 C/D, the C/D could achieve strike ranges (566 nm with 3-330 gallon fuel tanks or 600 nm with 2-480 gallon tanks and 1-330 gallon tank) far greater than the 
target distances stipulated in the E/F's system specifications by flying the same high-altitude missions as the E/F. Additionally, according to GAO, the E/F's increased strike range is achieved at the expense of the aircraft's aerial combat performance as evidenced by its sustained turn rate, maneuvering, and acceleration which impact its ability to maneuver in either offensive or defensive modes. 
One claim the Navy has made in response to the GAO report is that the C/D cannot be outfitted with 480-gallon external fuel tanks. GAO disputes this, citing contractor studies that concluded 480-gallon tanks can be carried on the C/D's inboard stations. GAO also points out that the Canadians have flown the F/A-18 C with the larger external fuel tanks. 
Mr. President, another significant reason the Navy cites in support of the continued development of the E/F is an anticipated deficiency in F/A-18C carrier recovery payload--the amount of fuel, weapons and external equipment that an aircraft can carry when returning from a mission and landing on a carrier. 
However, the deficiency in carrier recovery payload which the Navy anticipated of the F/A-18C simply has not materialized. When initially procured, F/A-18C's had a total carrier recovery payload of 6,300 pounds. Because of the Navy's decision to increase the F/A-18C's maximum allowable carrier landing weight and a lower aircraft operating weight resulting from technological improvements, the F/A-18C now has a carrier recovery payload of 7,113 pounds. 
F/A-18C's operating in support of Bosnian operations are now routinely returning to carriers with operational loads of 7,166 pounds, which exceeds the Navy's stated carrier recovery payload capacity. This recovery payload is substantially greater than the Navy projected it would be and is even greater than when the F/A-18C was first introduced in 1988. In addition, GAO notes that while it is not necessary, upgrading F/A-18C's with stronger landing gear could allow them to recover carrier payloads of more than 10,000 pounds--greater than that sought for the F/A-18 E/F (9,000 pounds). 
While the Navy also cites a need to improve combat survivability in justifying the development of the F/A-18 E/F, the aircraft was not developed to counter a particular military threat that could not be met with existing or improved F/A-18 C/D's. Additional improvements have subsequently been made or are planned for the F/A-18 C/D to enhance its survivability including improvements to reduce its radar detectability, while survivability improvements of the F/A-18 E/F are questionable. For example, because the F/A-18 E/F will be carrying weapons and fuel externally, the radar signature reduction improvements derived from the structural design of the aircraft will be diminished and will only help the aircraft penetrate slightly deeper than the F/A-18 C/D into an integrated defensive system before being detected. 
Mr. President, as we discuss survivability, it is relevant to highlight the outstanding performance of the F/A-18 C/D in the gulf war just a few short years ago. By the Navy's 
own account, the C/D performed extraordinarily well, dropping 18 million pounds of ordinance, recording all Navy MiG kills, and, in the Navy's own words, experiencing `unprecedented survivability.' 
In addition to noting the operational capability improvements in justifying the development of the F/A-18 E/F, the Navy also notes limitations of current C/D's with respect to avionics growth space and payload capacity. The Navy predicted that by the mid-1990's the F/A-18 C/D would not have growth space to accommodate additional new weapons and systems under development. Specifically, the Navy predicted that by fiscal year 1996 C/D's would only have 0.2 cubic feet of space available for future avionics growth; however, 5.3 cubic feet of available space have been identified for future system growth. Furthermore, technological advancements such as miniaturization, modularity and consolidation may result in additional growth space for future avionics. 
The Navy also stated that the F/A-18 E/F will provide increased payload capacity as a result of two new outboard weapons stations; however, unless current problems concerning weapons release are resolved--air flow problems around the fuselage and weapons stations--the types and amounts of weapons the E/F can carry will be restricted and the possible payload increase may be negated. Also, while the E/F will provide a marginal increase in air-to-air capability by carrying two extra missiles, it will not increase its ability to carry the heavier, precision-guided, air-to-ground weapons that are capable of hitting fixed and mobile hard targets and the heavier stand-off weapons that will be used to increase aircraft survivability. 
Understanding that the F/A-18 E/F may not deliver as significant operational capability improvements as originally expected, I would now like to focus on the cost of the F/A-18 E/F Program and possible alternatives to it. As previously mentioned, the total program cost of the F/A-18 E/F is projected to be $89.15 billion. These program costs are based on the procurement assumption of 1,000 aircraft--660 by the Navy and 340 by the Marine Corps--at an annual production rate of 72 aircraft per year. Mr. President, as the GAO report points out, these figures are overstated. According to Marine Corps officials and the Marine Corps Aviation Master Plan, the Marine Corps does not intend to buy any F/A-18 E/F's and, therefore, the projected 1,000 aircraft buy is overstated by 340 aircraft. 
Although the Pentagon contends that the Navy had intended to purchase 1,000 aircraft all along, extensive documentation and testimony demonstrates this not to be the case and the 1,000 figure was the original complete buy. 
I would also note the importance of the Marine Corps opting out of the E/F Program. Although the E/F was originally developed to service two branches with differing needs and requirements, the Marine Corps has chosen instead to invest in the Joint Strike Fighter program and use those aircraft to replace their AV-8B Harriers and F/A-18 C/D's. 
Furthermore, the Congress has stated that an annual production rate of 72 E/F aircraft is 
probably not feasible due to funding limitations and directed the Navy to calculate costs based on more realistic production rates as 18, 36, and 54 aircraft per year. In fact, according to the Congressional Research Service: `* * * no naval aircraft have been bought in such quantities in recent years, and it is unlikely that such annual buys will be funded in the 1990's, given expected force reductions and lower inventory requirements and the absence of consensus about future military threats.' 
Using the Navy's overstated assumptions about the total number of planes procured and an estimated annual production rate of 72 aircraft per year, the Navy calculates the unit recurring flyaway cost of the F/A-18 E/F--costs related to the production of the basic aircraft--at $44 million. However, using GAO's more realistic assumptions of the procurement of 660 aircraft by the Navy, at a production rate of 36 aircraft per year, the unit recurring flyaway cost of the E/F balloons to $53 million. This is compared to the $28 million unit recurring flyaway cost of the F/A-18 C/D based on a production rate of 36 aircraft per year. Thus, GAO estimates that this cost difference in unit recurring flyaway would result in a savings of almost $17 billion if the Navy were to procure the F/A-18 C/D's rather than the E/F's. 
Mr. President, this is certainly a significant amount of savings. Now I know that some of my colleagues will say that by halting production of the F/A-18 E/F and instead relying on the F/A-18 C/D, we will be mortgaging the future of our Naval aviation fleet. However, Mr. President, there is a far less costly program already being developed which may yield more significant returns in operational capability. This program is the Joint Strike Fighter or JSF Program. 
The JSF Program office is currently developing technology for a family of affordable next generation multirole strike fighter aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The JSF is expected to be a stealthy strike aircraft built on a single production line with a high degree of parts and cost commonality. The driving focus of the JSF is affordability achieved by triservice commonality. The Navy plans to procure 300 JSF's with a projected initial operational capability around 2007. 
Contractor concept exploration and demonstration studies indicate that the JSF will have superior or comparable capabilities in all Navy tactical aircraft mission areas, especially range and survivability, at far less cost than the F/A-18 E/F. The JSF is expected to be a stand alone, stealthy, first-day-of-the-war, survivable aircraft. Overall, the JSF is expected to be more survivable and capable than any existing or planned tactical aircraft in strike and air-to-air missions, with the possible exception of the F-22 in air-to-air missions. The Navy's JSF variant is also expected to have longer ranges than the F/A-18 E/F to attack high-value targets without using external tanks or tanking. Unlike the F/A-18 E/F which would carry all of its weapons externally, the Navy's JSF will carry at least four weapons for both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat internally, thereby maximizing its stealthiness and increasing its survivability. Finally, the JSF would not require jamming support from EA-6B aircraft as does the F/A-18 E/F in carrying out its mission in the face of integrated air defense systems. 
While the JSF is expected to have superior operational capabilities, it is expected to be developed and procured at far less expense than the F/A-18 E/F. In fact, the unit recurring flyaway cost of the Navy's JSF is estimated to range from $31-38 million depending on which contractor design is chosen for the aircraft, as compared to GAO's $53 million estimate for the F/A-18 E/F. Additional cost benefits of the JSF would result from having common aircraft spare parts, simplified technical specifications, and reduced support equipment variations, as well as reductions in aircrew and maintenance training requirements. 
Mr. President, given the enormous cost and marginal improvement in operational capabilities the F/A-18 E/F would provide, it seems that the justification for the E/F is not as evident as once thought. Operational deficiencies in the C/D aircraft either have not materialized or can be corrected with nonstructural changes to the plane. As a result, proceeding with the E/F program may not be the most cost-effective approach to modernizing the Navy's tactical aircraft fleet. In the short term, the Navy can continue to procure the F/A-18 C/D aircraft, while upgrading it to improve further its operational capabilities. For the long term, the Navy can look toward the next generation strike fighter, the JSF, which will provide more operational capability at far less cost than the E/F. 
Mr. President, succinctly put, the Navy needs an aircraft that will bridge between the current force and the new, superior JSF which will be operational around 2007. The question is whether the F/A-18 C/D can serve that function, as it has demonstrated its ability to exceed predicted capacity or whether we should proceed with an expensive, new plane for a marginal level of improvement. The $17 billion difference in projected costs does not appear to provide a significant return on our investment. In times of severe fiscal constraints and a need to look at all areas of the budget to identify more cost-effective approaches, the F/A-18 E/F is a project in need of reevaluation. 
Last year, I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 1997 authorization bill for the Department of Defense that required the Pentagon to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the F/A-18 E/F Program, and to report their findings to the Congress by March 30, 1997. This study was to include a review of the E/F program, an analysis and estimate of the production costs of the program for the total number of aircraft expected to be procured at several different production rates and a comparison of the costs and benefits of this program with the costs and benefits of the C/D Program. That analysis has not been forwarded to the Congress as of this date. 
In addition to this report, the Quadrennial Defense Review [QDR], responsible for evaluating all weapon system programs, is also scheduled to be completed in the near future. 
Unfortunately, I was enormously disappointed when the Secretary of Defense, rather than waiting for these reports to be completed and publicly released, announced on March 28 his decision to move forward with the E/F Program and procure 62 new F/A-18 E/F fighter planes at an initial cost of $48 million each. 
I would have hoped that the Secretary, who I have tremendous respect and admiration for, would have waited until the mandated reports had been provided to Congress and until the results of the QDR--which could have a significant impact on the Pentagon's tactical aircraft modernization plans--had been made public. Instead, this perplexing decision to proceed with the procurement of 62 of these expensive planes precludes the Congress from offering any input on the Department's policy based on a review of the required reports. I am puzzled as to why the new Secretary did not await these reports before announcing this decision. 
The 1996 GAO report concluded that we could achieve almost $17 billion in cost savings if the Navy elected to procure additional C/D versions of the F/A-18 rather than the costlier E/F model. Mr. President, by all accounts the F/A-18 C/D is a top quality aircraft that has served the Navy well over the last decade, and could be modified to meet every capacity the E/F is intended to fulfill over the course of the next decade at a substantially lower cost. 
Therefore, considering the Department of Defense has clearly overextended itself in terms of supporting three major multirole fighter programs, and given that the most promising tactical aviation program appears to be the triservice joint strike fighter which will likely outperform the F/A-18 E/F at a substantially lower cost, it is clear that we must discontinue the E/F Program before the American taxpayer is asked to fund yet another multibillion dollar duplicative program.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the escalating costs of the United States involvement in Bosnia. 
Recently, I asked the administration representatives for a ballpark estimate of the expected cost to the United States taxpayer of the American operation in Bosnia. 
I was astonished to hear that administration estimates have been revised to $6.5 billion. 
Six-point-five billion dollars. To put that in perspective, we were originally told that the Bosnia mission would cost the United States taxpayer some $2 billion. Later, the estimate was revised to $3 billion. Now, it has risen to a staggering $6.5 billion. 
Mr. President, the cost has now risen more than threefold since the original estimates we were given. That is equal to just over half of the entire foreign operation budget for fiscal 1997 which is about $12.2 billion. 
Let me review what has happened here. In late 1995, when the administration negotiated the United States troop commitment outlined by the Dayton accords, the administration came to the Congress with an estimate for United States troop participation in the NATO Peace Implementation Force in Bosnia, commonly referred to as IFOR. According to information provided to my office by the Office of the Secretary of Defense [OSD], this initial estimate of $2 billion was generated using a force deployment model based on experience in Desert Storm and Somalia * * * [although] the types of forces, deployment schedules, field conditions, and security situation had not been determined.' Once troops were deployed to Bosnia, new information about the field conditions became available and pushed the original estimate up by about 50 percent. 
As I understand it, unexpected and adverse weather conditions, including major floods, further complicated the operation--delaying the establishment of land routes and altering placement of planned camp sites. According to the Defense Department, additional reserves were also required to back fill for troops that had been deployed to the region. 
Further refinements of the cost estimate were again made in July 1996, when the Defense Department recognized the need for additional moneys--to the tune of almost $310 million--for pulling out heavy armored forces and replacing them with military police, as well as additional communications requirements. A new total cost estimate of $3.2 million for operations through the end of 1996--that is, for approximately one full year--was provided to congressional staff in July. 
The conditions that led to these refinements also helped throw the time line for the 1-year mission out of whack. So, no one could have really been surprised by the announcement last October--just as the Congress was preparing to take its long recess--that the United States had decided to dispatch additional troops to Bosnia. The new deployment of an additional 5,000 troops was to be part of a new mission--the one we now call SFOR, or NATO stabilization force--and would last 18 months, through June 1998. 
The extension of the U.S. mission in the region, of course, required a new cost estimate. Using actual costs to date, projected force levels for fiscal year 1997 and for fiscal year 1998, and expected operating costs, the Defense Department now says that total costs for the operation are expected to be $6,512,000,000. 
Mr. President, when Congress was first consulted about the Bosnia operation back in 1995, I asked whether or not the United States would be able to withdraw troops from IFOR in December 1996, as the administration said then, even if the mission clearly had not been successful. I had my doubts then that the stated goal--ending the fighting and raising an infrastructure capable of supporting a durable peace--would be achievable in 12 months' time. I foresaw a danger that conditions would remain so unsettled that it would then be argued that it would be folly--and waste--to withdraw on schedule. 
My concerns and hesitations of October 1995 were only compounded by the October 1996 announcement that additional troops were being deployed to Bosnia, and compounded further in November 1996 when it became clear that the mission was being extended for an additional 18 months. 
In my view, the handwriting has been on the wall for some time now. 
As many in this Chamber will recall, I was one of the few Members of Congress, and the only Democrat, to vote against the initial deployment of troops in 1995. At that time, I questioned the projections regarding the duration and cost of the mission. 
What I feared then has happened. The United States continues to be drawn deeper into a situation from which we appear unable to extricate ourselves. The war in Vietnam was called a quagmire. We referred to continued United States troop deployment in Somalia as mission creep. I fear that the Bosnia operation presents the same dilemma. There will continue to reasons to encourage continued U.S. military presence on the ground. Despite an original estimate of $2 billion, that presence is now moving closer and closer to $7 billion. 
I recognize that the Bosnia mission has not been without some positive results. We can all be grateful that people are no longer dying en masse in Bosnia and that United States and troops from other nations are to be applauded for having largely succeeded in enforcing the military aspects of the Dayton accords. But successive delays in holding municipal elections and the lasting, and at-large, presence of indicted war criminals are continuing signs that the progress of American troop presence is transitory at best. 
At the heart of the conflict is that the strategic political goals of the warring factions remain unchanged. Peace in the region appears to be achievable, unfortunately, only at the point of NATO arms. 
Mr. President, I now fear that, come next June, when the SFOR mission is expected to end, and after we will have invested $6.5 billion, there is a real danger that we will be back at square one. 
I hope that the lesson learned from Bosnia is that we should not make commitments of United States resources, be they military, humanitarian, or otherwise, without a candid assessment of the likely level and duration of the commitment. While it is clear that there were sound, military reasons for upping the financial projections for U.S. participation in both IFOR and SFOR, I can not believe that the original estimate was as candid of an assessment as we could have had, even that early in the process. 
We are told that U.S. troops will finish their mission next June. But that begs a question: What certainty is there that even this promise will be kept? I fear, as I did when the United States first committed 20,000 ground troops, that there is no easy way out of this situation. The cost of U.S. involvement continues to rise. And troops, from my State and from throughout the Nation, continue to be deployed. 
When will it end, Mr. President. When will it end? 
At the very time we are straining hard to eliminate the Federal deficit, the dollars continue to pour out of our Treasury. The cost of this excursion goes on and on.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those who have spoken about the need to bring the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] to the Senate floor for debate at the earliest possible date. As everyone in this body knows, the U.S. Senate must ratify the CWC by April 29, 1997, in order for the United States to become an original party to the convention. 
To date, 70 countries have ratified the CWC, and another 161 countries are signatories. The United States has taken a leadership role throughout the negotiations surrounding this treaty, and yet, with time running out, the Senate has not voted on the document that so many Americans have helped to craft. 
Time is of the essence in this debate for several reasons. One reason is, of course, the April 29 deadline by which the U.S. Senate must ratify this treaty so that the United States may be a full participant in the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons [OPCW], the governing body that will have the responsibility for deciding the terms for the implementation of the CWC. 
A second reason is the constitutional responsibility of the Senate to provide its advice and consent on all treaties signed by the President. This treaty was signed by President Bush in January 1993, and was submitted to the Senate by President Clinton in November of that year. Unfortunately, the Senate has not yet fulfilled its responsibility with respect to this treaty. 
A third reason, and what I believe is one of the most important, is the need for adequate time for debate of this treaty and its implications for the United States prior to the April 29 deadline for ratification. Many have expressed concern over various provisions in the CWC. Senators should have the opportunity to debate these concerns, and the American people deserve the chance to hear them. Senators will also have the opportunity to voice their concerns during debate of the treaty's implementing legislation, which will most likely be discussed in conjunction with the treaty itself. 
As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I have had the opportunity to participate in hearings on this issue. In all the hearings and deliberations over the efficacy of this treaty, two things have been made crystal clear: First, the CWC is not perfect, and second, the CWC is the best avenue available for beginning down the road to the eventual elimination of chemical weapons. 
There are real flaws, as we all recognize, with the verifiability of the CWC. There will be cheating and evasions and attempts to obey the letter but not the spirit of the treaty. But most of the responsible players on the international stage will recognize that through the CWC the world has spoken, and firmly rejected chemical weapons. 
The CWC was laboriously crafted over three decades to meet the security and economic interests of states parties. The United States was at the forefront of that effort; the treaty reflects U.S. needs and has the blessing and enthusiastic support of our defense and business communities. 
Can the treaty be improved? Of course. But the CWC has a provision for amendment after it comes into force. I would hope that the United States would be again at the head of efforts to make the treaty more effective after a period to test its utility. We have the technological means and economic weight to make it so. But only if we are a party to the treaty. And to become a party to the treaty, the U.S. Senate must perform its constitutionally mandated function of debate and ratification before April 29. 
Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the Chemical Weapons Convention is being held hostage to other, unrelated, matters. Time is of the essence, Mr. President, and time is running out. 
In closing, this treaty should be fully and carefully debated by the U.S. Senate at the earliest possible date, not at the 11 hour when the clock is ticking on our ability to ensure that the United States is an active participant in future revisions to the CWC. The American people deserve no less.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Speaker of the other body made a remarkable statement earlier this week. He argued that Congress should wait on cutting taxes, and instead make balancing the budget our highest priority. This is a significant and extremely positive development in the fight for a balanced Federal budget, and I congratulate the Speaker for making that statement in the face of significant opposition within his own party. 
Mr. President, the Speaker's comments are indeed welcome. They follow the comments made this weekend by the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee [Mr. Domenici], who informally offered a no-tax cut, no new spending programs outline of a possible budget agreement. Mr. President, I cannot emphasize enough how important the comments of the chairman were. They came after several days of highly partisan comments on the budget, from both parties and in both houses. Often, without leadership, it is the nature of some to retreat to the security of partisan politics--an easy path that leads us further and further apart. To his great credit, Chairman Domenici rejected the considerable forces of partisanship, and offered an alternative path. Mr. President, his path offers us a real chance for a bipartisan budget agreement, and I want to take this occasion to commend my chairman for his courage. I am pleased to serve on the Budget Committee, and deeply honored to serve with the senior Senator from New Mexico. 
Mr. President, the Speaker is of course absolutely right on the mark. As dearly as many of us would like to support tax cuts, our first priority must be to balance the budget. This is a position I took when I first ran for the Senate, and one I hold today. 
Major tax cuts undercut our ability to craft a politically sustainable balanced budget plan, as was so clearly demonstrated during the 104th Congress. As I have noted before, both parties are at fault. We cannot afford either the President's tax cuts or the Congressional Republican tax cuts. 
In November of 1994, I faulted the so-called Contract With America tax cuts--called the crown jewel of the Contract With America at the time. A month later, the day after the President proposed his own set of tax cuts, I took his proposal to task as well. 
Mr. President, we dodged a bullet during the 104th Congress. Despite formal support for a tax cut in some form from both the White House and the majority party in Congress, we escaped without doing serious damage to the progress we made in reducing the deficit. Regretfully, we did not build significantly on the work accomplished in the 103d Congress to reduce the deficit. Though we made some modest strides, the bulk of the work that remained at the end of 1994 must still be done. 
Mr. President, major tax cuts make the difficult task of enacting a balanced budget impossible. Most obviously, major tax cuts dig the hole even deeper before we begin. But major tax cuts also pose a significant and very real political problem, and the Speaker's comments about how including tax cuts leaves a balanced budget plan open to criticism are absolutely correct. There is no painless solution to the deficit. 
The fundamental premise of any plan to balance the budget rests on the willingness of the Nation to sacrifice, but we cannot expect the Nation to embrace a plan which calls for some to sacrifice while providing tax cuts for others. Such a plan would not be sustainable, as was demonstrated so clearly during the 104th Congress. We can enact a balance budget plan if that plan is seen broadly as spreading sacrifice fairly. Mr. President, no partisan plan has any hope of rallying broadbased public support. 
The only way we will enact a balanced budget plan, and sustain it through the several years it will take to achieve balance, is through a truly bipartisan effort. Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Domenici, and with the support of the Speaker, we have a chance to build such a plan. I hope my colleagues will not squander the opportunity they have given us at some personal political cost to themselves. 
I look forward to working with Chairman Domenici on the Budget Committee to fashion the beginning of a budget agreement. As I have indicated to him in the committee, there are several budget issues that are especially important to me, but I remain flexible on all aspects of the budget in trying to reach a bipartisan agreement. Mr. President, I applaud the Speaker for change of heart, and especially commend Chairman Domenici for his courage and leadership.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to offer tribute to Dr. Robert J. Lampman, economist, University of Wisconsin-Madison professor and noted researcher on poverty, who passed away March 4 at his home in Madison. 
Mr. President, Dr. Lampman spent much of his distinguished professional career studying and writing about poverty and working to develop strategies to achieve its end. In 1966, he became the founding director of the Institute for Research on Poverty, a nonpartisan center for research into the causes and consequences of poverty and social inequality in America, on the UW-Madison campus, which established the university as a leader of research in that field. A colleague at the University of Wisconsin, Dr. Lee Hansen, called Dr. Lampman `a true scholar in that he was always asking questions to get a better understanding of the issues.' 
Despite his standing in his profession, Dr. Lampman was known as a professor who regarded his students as colleagues. One news report describing his career included a recollection by Dr. Thomas Corbett, once a graduate student studying with Dr. Lampman and now a University of Wisconsin professor of social work and acting director of the IRP. Dr. Corbett recalled Dr. Lampman's stopping by his office and saying he wanted `to pick my brain.' `In a world where egos can become overwhelming, he was a guy who never lost his perspective,' Dr. Corbett said. 
In 1962, he joined the staff of President John Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisors, where he prophetically warned that economic growth, alone, would not eliminate poverty. He was later a key author of the historic chapter on poverty contained in Lyndon Johnson's `Economic Report of the President' in 1964 that helped call America's attention to poverty. 
Dr. Lampman became, in the words of Nobel laureate economist James Tobin, `the intellectual architect of the War on Poverty,' and he emphasized the importance of economic growth, income maintenance, and opportunities for education and jobs for those mired in poverty. 
In 1964, as the War on Poverty was getting underway, he predicted to a group of University of Wisconsin-Madison graduate students that, within 20 years, `by present standards, no one will be poor.' 
Mr. President, it turned out that Professor Lampman was overly optimistic. Poverty was not eliminated in 20 years, but the War on Poverty had an impact. In 1964, before the War on Poverty was up and running, 19 percent of Americans were poor. Within 5 years, programs created by the Federal Government and a broadly expanding economy had combined to bring that number down to 12.1 percent. By 1973, the poverty rate was down to 11.1 percent. 
That progress stalled, for many reasons. Census Bureau estimates for 1995, the most recent year for which data are available, tell us 13.8 percent of our Nation's population was poor, and, in the wealthiest nation in history, one American child in five lived in poverty. 
Mr. President, Dr. Lampman's dedication, his intellectual energy, and his commitment to solving one of the most difficult, complex, and persistent social challenges we face should inform and inspire us. We should apply, as Dr. Lampman did, our best efforts to ridding our world of the plague of poverty and finally establishing social justice. That would be the most fitting tribute we could pay to this man.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will support the bi-partisan compromise crafted by Senators Feinstein, Coverdell and the administration because I believe the United States must signal the Mexican Government that the status quo is no longer acceptable in regard to anti-narcotics cooperation. The massive and growing influx of illegal drugs into this country from Mexico is a significant threat to both of our countries and it must be stopped. 
Prior to the President's decision to certify Mexico, I joined 40 of my Senate colleagues in writing to the President and urging him to decertify Mexico because of its abysmal record --a record which includes a complete failure to extradite nationals wanted for drug crimes in this country, as well as rampant corruption at all levels of the anti-drug effort. The arrest last month of Mexico's top anti-drug official on charges that he was on the payroll of one of Mexico's largest drug cartels illustrates the nature and extent of this problem. Further, I am deeply concerned about Mexico's decision to replace much of its national police force, which was removed due to widespread corruption, with the Mexican military, an organization with a very poor record in regard to human rights offenses. 
Mexico may well be a significant economic partner with the United States, but the current level of illegal drugs entering this Nation unabated from the south is simply unacceptable. Our economic partnership with Mexico should not include the flourishing drug trade which currently uses Mexico as a primary transit point. While I believe the President should not have certified Mexico, I support the Feinstein compromise because, in light of the Administration's decision, it represents the only legitimate opportunity to hold the Mexican Government accountable. I will watch the actions of our southern neighbor very closely over the coming months in the sincere hope that the Mexican Government will rededicate itself to join the United States in our effort to deal with illicit narcotics which infect both of our nations.

Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator. All I wanted to do is be the first to congratulate the Senator from Georgia on his first speech as a Member of this body. I can't tell you how delighted we all are to have the Senator from Georgia here. The Senator from Georgia ran a tough race. I know the Senator from Georgia has run other races before. 
The people of Georgia know well that the Senator from Georgia did not come to this campaign finance reform issue in the last few weeks, or just after the revelations of the last election. The Senator from Georgia has been a leader in Georgia and in the country for years in authoring and considering and moving forward the issue of campaign finance reform. I can't think of anything that made me happier than when the Senator from Georgia said his first bill would be to cosponsor our bipartisan effort. On behalf of my colleagues and myself, it is a great moment in the Senate to have the Senator from Georgia join us and to hear his first speech.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to speak on the two resolutions which the Senate is debating, the so-called Republican version and the Democratic version. I take this opportunity to explain why I intend to vote against both versions as they are now being offered. 
At the outset, we should be clear that there is no reason for the Senate to actually consider either version. The statute authorizing the appointment of an independent counsel gives the authority to make the appointment to the Attorney General of the United States, and it also provides a mechanism for the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to invoke a procedure for the 
Attorney General to respond to a request for appointment of an independent counsel. Mr. President, that, in fact, is what has been used in recent days. Both the House and Senate Judiciary Committees last week voted to invoke that process. The Attorney General has 30 days to respond. 
In effect, what we are doing today, since all of that has already happened, what we are doing today is really just shear theatrical maneuvering. On the one side, we have the Republican resolution, which carefully restricts the request and any implication of wrongdoing just to the Clinton White House. That resolution puts Congress off limits for an independent counsel investigation for its alleged wrongdoing. It puts the Republican National Committee off limits for an independent counsel investigation. The Republican resolution turns a blind eye to any allegations of impropriety beyond the White House itself. 
On the other side, we have a Democratic resolution that stops short of even taking notice of the fact that there have been so many allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the Democratic Party that the public is crying out for an independent, impartial investigation. 
Mr. President, both sides appear to be ignoring the degree to which the fundraising practices of the 1996 elections have gone beyond any limits and created the appearance of a system totally out of control. The improprieties are not limited to the fundraising activities in the White House. Both parties engaged in an almost mindless race to the bottom. The staggering amounts of money raised in the 1996 elections, more than $2.7 billion, compelled the kind of fundraising excesses which continue to shock the country each day. Day after day the front-page story is yet another tale of improprieties and new scandals. The stories encompass both parties, the congressional races as well as the Presidential races. 
Mr. President, according to a poll released last week by the Wall Street Journal and NBC News, 91 percent of the American people believe that, if an independent counsel was appointed, the investigation should include all Federal elections, not just the Presidential race, but congressional races, as well. 
Last fall, Common Cause filed a request with the Attorney General for appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the violations of law by both parties in the 1996 campaign. 
At the time, I said that such action might be appropriate. More recently, I reached the conclusion that it was necessary because it had become clear that the seemingly endless scope of allegations arising from campaign fundraising activities touching all levels of our Government had grown so vast that the only manner in which the public's confidence can be ensured is, Mr. President, by the appointment of an independent counsel. In my view, given the breadth of the allegations, any investigation conducted by the Department of Justice is inevitably and unavoidably subject to the taint of political conflict in this context. To this end, I called upon the Attorney General to appoint an independent counsel. 
However, an important distinction between the position I have taken and that offered by the majority in the form of this resolution is that I believe that any call for an independent counsel must necessarily include an investigation of all potential wrongdoers, be it on the part of the executive branch, the political parties, or the Congress. The Republican resolution takes the position that neither Congress nor the Republican National Committee should be subject to such an investigation. I believe the American people will see through this approach. How can anyone suggest to the citizens of this Nation that potential illegalities should be subject to an independent counsel, provided the target is the President but not the Congress? When the target is one party, but not the other, they will surely see such a ploy for exactly what it is, yet another partisan maneuver designed to delude the public into believing that the problem is limited to a small group of people and not a systemic problem that demands a comprehensive overhaul of our system of campaign finance laws. 
Mr. President, as a threshold, it is essential to understand the basis for the independent counsel as well as who is covered by the law. The underlying premise behind the independent counsel law, a premise which we should sustain and that is threatened by partisan gamesmanship, is that we have an inherent obligation to ensure the confidence of the American people and the public in investigations of the Government. This law, born of the Watergate scandal, was derived to restore and protect the public's confidence in these types of investigations, and in the process preserve and promote the public's confidence in the integrity of the U.S. Government. 
Mr. President, the independent counsel law provides that the Attorney General must seek an independent counsel upon finding specific information, derived from a credible source, that a violation of Federal law has potentially occurred in regard to certain covered persons, such as the President, the Vice President, Cabinet members, certain high-level officials in the White House, among others. In addition to these mandatory provisions, the independent counsel law provides the Attorney General with certain discretionary power for other persons--those not covered by the mandatory provisions--and, Mr. President, to emphasize, Members of Congress. Members of Congress are included within these discretionary powers of the Attorney General with regard to the independent counsel. In regard to other persons, an independent counsel may be sought if, in the face of specific evidence of illegality, derived from a credible source, a personal, political, or financial conflict of interest exists or may arise as a result of a Department of Justice investigation. In regard to Members of Congress, the discretionary standard is a public interest standard. In other words, if the Attorney General has evidence of a violation of Federal law involving a Member of Congress, she may seek an independent counsel if she finds it to be in the public interest. 
Mr. President, over the past few weeks, I have been approached by colleagues and others who argue that Members of Congress are simply not subject to the statute. Mr. President, that is simply incorrect. In fact, if one reviews the legislative history of this law, one finds that Congress had previously been covered, albeit not explicitly, under the other persons provision. In the 1994 reauthorization, Congress clarified this and added a separate section solely for Members of Congress.

Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise today to oppose the proposed constitutional amendment offered by the junior Senator from South Carolina and the senior Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. President, first I would like to say a few words about the Senator from South Carolina. Our colleague, Senator Hollings, has been calling for meaningful campaign finance reform for perhaps longer than any other Member of the U.S. Senate. I disagree with this particular approach. But I certainly do not question his sincerity or commitment to reform. 
Mr. President, when the U.S. Senate last had an extended debate on the issue of campaign finance reform back in 1993, the junior Senator from South Carolina offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to take up a constitutional amendment very similar to the one that is before us today. 
I remember we had a very short period of time before that vote came up, and I made a decision and I voted with the Senator from South Carolina on that day. I did so because I believed that other than balancing the Federal budget, there was perhaps no more fundamental issue facing our country than the need to reform our election laws. 
Such a serious topic I believed at the time merited at least a consideration of a constitutional amendment. And I will confess to a certain level of frustration at that time with the fact that the Senate and the other body had not yet acted to pass meaningful campaign finance reform in that Congress. 
But, Mr. President, to be candid, I immediately realized, even as I was returning to my office, that that might not have been the best vote I ever cast. I started rethinking right away whether I really wanted the U.S. Senate to seriously consider amending the first amendment to address even this subject of which I and so many other Americans feel passionately about. 
Then, 18 months later, my perspective on this question began to change even more as I was presented with two new developments here in the U.S. Senate. 
First, I was given the privilege of serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and, second, I would soon learn that the new 104th Congress was to become the engine for a trainload of proposed amendments to the U.S. Constitution. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I had a very good seat to witness first hand what was being attempted here with regard to the basic document of our country, the Constitution. 
It started with a proposal right away for a balanced budget constitutional amendment, and we were considering a term limits constitutional amendment, and then a flag desecration constitutional amendment, then a school prayer amendment, then a supermajority tax increase amendment, and then a victims rights amendment. In all, Mr. President, 135 constitutional amendments were introduced in the last Congress. 
As I saw legislator after legislator suggest that every social, economic, and political problem we have in this country could be solved merely with enactment of a constitutional amendment, I chose to strongly oppose not only this constitutional amendment but others that also sought to undermine our most treasured founding principle. I firmly believe we must continue this reflective practice of attempting to cure each and every political and social ill of our Nation by tampering with the U.S. Constitution. Mr. President, the Constitution of this country was not a rough draft. We must stop treating it as such. 
I want to say, because the Senator from South Carolina has just arrived and I know that he is not one who has engaged in such an attitude toward the Constitution, I know very well he only makes a proposal like this with the most serious consideration and for the goal of trying to do something about campaign spending. What I am addressing here, what I saw in the last Congress was a wholesale attempt to try to amend what seemed to be almost virtually every part of the U.S. Constitution. 
We must also understand that even if this constitutional amendment were to pass this body today, which it will not, but even if it did, it would not take us one single, solitary step closer to campaign finance reform. It is not a silver bullet. This constitutional amendment merely empowers the Congress to set mandatory spending limits on congressional candidates. Those are the same kind of mandatory limits that were struck down in the landmark Buckley versus Valeo decision. 
Here is the question I pose for supporters of this amendment: If this constitutional amendment were to pass the Congress and be ratified by the States, would campaign finance reformers have the necessary 51 votes--or more likely what would be required would be 60 votes--to pass legislation that included mandatory spending limits? 
Mr. President, in January I joined the senior Senator from Arizona in introducing the first bipartisan campaign finance reform proposal in over a decade. That proposal, unlike the law that was considered in Buckley versus Valeo, includes voluntary spending limits. That is to say, Mr. President, we offer incentives in the form of free and discounted television time to encourage but not require candidates to limit their campaign spending. When the Senator from Arizona and I bring that legislation to the floor of the Senate, I have no doubt that we will be met with strong resistance from a number of Senators. So the notion that this constitutional amendment will somehow magically pave the way for legislation that includes mandatory spending limits simply ignores the reality of the opposition that campaign finance reformers face here in the Senate and I think would face in the Senate at the time of ratification of any such amendment. 
Mr. President, this amendment certainly, if ratified, would remove the obstacle of the Supreme Court. But it will not remove the obstacle of those Senators such as the junior Senator from Kentucky who believe that we need more money, not less, in our political system. 
Most disconcerting to me, Mr. President, is what this proposed constitutional amendment would mean to the first amendment. I find nothing more sacred and treasured in our Nation's history than the first amendment. It is perhaps the one tenet of our Constitution that sets our country apart from every mold of government form and tested by mankind throughout history. No other country has a provision quite like the first amendment. 
The first amendment is the bedrock of the Bill of Rights. It has as its underpinnings the notion that each individual has a natural and fundamental right to disagree with their elected leaders. It says that a newspaper has an unfettered right to publish expressions of political or moral thought. It says that the Government may not establish a State-based religion that would infringe on the rights of those individuals who seek to be freed from such a religious environment. 
Last year I stood here on the floor of the Senate with a number of my colleagues to oppose a proposed constitutional amendment that would have prohibited the desecration of the U.S. flag. I did so because that amendment as proposed, for the first time in our history, would have taken a chisel to the first amendment and said that individuals have a constitutional right to express themselves unless they are expressing themselves by burning a flag. 
Now, Mr. President, I deplore as much as anyone in this body any individual who would take a match to the flag of the United States. And I am firmly convinced that unrestrained spending on congressional campaigns has eroded the confidence of the American people in their Government and their leaders. I believe we should speak out against those who desecrate the flag. I believe we should take immediate steps to fundamentally overhaul our system of financing campaigns. Mr. President, I do not believe, as the supporters of this constitutional amendment and other amendments believe, that we need to amend the U.S. Constitution to bring reform to our system of financing campaigns. 
Mr. President, sometime in the next day or so, this constitutional amendment will lose. That has been predetermined, or the supporters of this amendment probably would not have been granted consideration here on the floor of the Senate in this manner. This debate has some characteristics of a charade. Again, that is not because of the author, who is sincerely advancing this provision because he believes in it and he thinks it should become part of the Constitution. The ultimate outcome of the charade is everyone knows this will not pass. There are those who want this to sort of be the campaign finance reform debate for this Congress. Have a couple of days of talk, no amendments, have a vote, and be done with it. Be done with campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, believe me, I know the feeling. The Senator from Arizona and I have been there. We were there last year, last summer. We were allowed to bring our bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation to the floor last June, but here was the deal: No amendments, just 2 days of debate, and then we had to vote on cloture, whether we will filibuster, just after 2 days. That was it. No chance to fix the bill up or make it appealing to other Members like we do in other things. That is very similar to what is going on here. We were only allowed to do that after the votes had been counted and assurances given that our bill would suffer a quick and painless death. It was not entirely painless, but it was not unanticipated. We did get a majority of the votes in this body on the first try, 54 out of the required 60 votes but, of course, when the process is set up like this, this simply with these few options, we know the outcome and we know what will happen here. 
Mr. President, I want to point out that things just look a little different this year on the issue of campaign finance reform than they did a year ago. A few things have happened. The McCain-Feingold bill has not been placed on the Senate Calendar this time. It does not appear that the majority leader is terribly interested in bringing it up before the March recess, the Memorial Day recess, or possibly even before the turn of the century. We can speculate about the meaning of that, but one thing is clear: This constitutional amendment will not pass this body, and until this body makes a commitment to considering meaningful, bipartisan campaign finance reform, campaign spending in this country will continue to go completely unrestrained. 
Nothing in this constitutional amendment before the Senate today would prevent what we witnessed in the last election--the allegation of illegality and improprieties, the accusations of abuse, and the selling of access to high-ranking Government officials would continue no matter what the outcome of the vote we had on this constitutional amendment. Only the enactment of legislation, Mr. President, that bans soft money contributions and that encourages candidates to voluntarily limit how much they spend on their campaigns will make a meaningful difference. 
Mr. President, I see Members of the Senate as having, really, three choices. First, they can vote for constitutional amendments and partisan reform proposals that basically have predetermined fates of never becoming law. That allows you to say you voted for something and put the matter aside. Second, they can stand with the junior Senator from Kentucky and others who stood here on the Senate floor last June and told us all was well with our campaign finance system and we should all be thrilled that so much money was pouring into the campaign coffers of candidates and parties. That is a second option that some folks are still pursuing. A third option, Mr. President, Senators can join with the Senator from Arizona and myself and others who have tried to approach this problem from a bipartisan perspective and have tried to craft a reform proposal that is fair to all. 
We have said on countless occasions that our proposal is open to negotiation. We simply have two goals: To encourage Senate candidates to spend less on their campaign and to give challengers an opportunity to run a fair and competitive campaign against well-entrenched incumbents. If you share those goals, we can work together to produce a meaningful reform proposal. 
Let me say our proposal is picking up steam. We seem to be adding new cosponsors a couple of times a week. 
Three days ago, I was challenged on the floor by a stated opponent of our bill as to why I was unwilling to address, he said, a particular aspect of our campaign finance system. Now, this surprised me very much because, in the 18 months since this legislation was originally introduced, this Senator had not approached me one single time to ask if I would be willing to address that issue. I told this Senator the other night, and I say to all my other colleagues, if you share those two basic goals of reducing campaign spending and leveling the playing field with the Senator from Arizona and I, we are willing to work with you to address those concerns. 
Let's do this in the context of a real effort, a real debate, not a charade. That real debate will begin when a comprehensive bipartisan campaign finance reform bill is brought to the floor of the U.S. Senate. After this amendment fails, and as the Governmental Affairs Committee proceeds with the investigation into illegal and improper conduct by Presidential and congressional candidates in the last election, it is my hope that there will be an opportunity for an open and full debate on the issue of campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, without meaningful bipartisan campaign finance reform, the American people will continue to perceive their elected leaders as being for sale. Unfortunately, they will continue to distrust and doubt the integrity of their own Government. 
So, Mr. President, I urge the Members of the Senate to reject this amendment, again, with the understanding that I greatly admire the sincerity and commitment that its author brings forward on this issue.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to deauthorize the construction of the Animas-La Plata water project in Colorado. I am very pleased to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback]. This measure is identical to a bipartisan effort in the other body introduced on February 13, 1997, by my colleague from Wisconsin [Mr. Petri] and my colleague from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio]. 
The Animas-La Plata project is a $744 million water development project planned for southwest Colorado and northwest New Mexico that is largely taxpayer funded. Designed to supply 191,230 feet of water, it will consist of 2 major reservoirs, 7 pumping plants, and 200 miles of canals and pipes. The project will pump water over 1,000 feet uphill, consuming enough power to run a city of 60,000, to supply municipal, industrial, and irrigation interests. 
The legislation I am introducing today deauthorizes the Animas-La Plata Federal reclamation project and directs the Secretary of the Interior to work with the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute Tribes to find an alternative to satisfy their water rights needs. It is supported by a broad coalition of taxpayer and environmental groups that includes: Taxpayers for Common Sense, Americans for Tax Reform, Citizens Against Government Waste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, and National Taxpayers Union. This legislation was also profiled in the 1997 Green Scissors Report, and the Animas project has shown up on a number of deficit reduction target lists, including one recently proposed by the Chairman of the Budget Committee of the other body [Mr. Kasich]. 
I believe that Federal legislation to terminate the Animas-La Plata project is needed for four reasons. First, as a Senator 
who is extremely concerned about the Federal deficit and debt, this project has an extremely high price tag--a projected total cost of $744 million in fiscal year 1998. That total projected cost estimate has increased $30 million over the fiscal year 1997 estimate of $714 million. The Federal share of that cost now exceeds half a billion dollars, $503 million to be exact, which is nearly 68 percent of the total cost. I believe, especially in these times of tight budgets, that commencement of significant Federal discretionary spending should be critically evaluated. 
By no measure or metric is this project cost effective, Mr. President. A July 1995 economic analysis by the Bureau of Reclamation, the only analysis that used economic procedures approved for Bureau analyses and a current discount rate, reported that the project's benefit-cost ratio is 0.36:1. In other words, Mr. President, the project will return only 36 cents for every taxpayer dollar invested. I am additionally concerned, Mr. President, because recent GAO reports have highlighted that Federal water projects, once built, do not recoup the costs of the projects from the users, who are supposed to be paying the government back for its investment. Municipal and industrial users are required under the Water Supply Act of 1958 to fully repay all the construction costs and operation and maintenance costs attributable to the supply of municipal and industrial water. Those repayment contracts are to be in place before construction begins. Currently, the Bureau has signed a repayment contract with two non-Indian project beneficiaries. Those that have been signed do not cover the construction costs of the full project, due to cost increases. It is questionable if the project will ever comply with the law and obtain full reimbursement of municipal and industrial costs from the project beneficiaries. 
Second, I am introducing this legislation because I believe that the Congress should support the State of Colorado's ongoing dialog over lower cost alternatives rather than proceed to initiate construction. The Animas-La Plata project has been the focus of controversy and litigation for many years. In response to legislative activities last Congress, which I will describe in further detail, Colorado Gov. Roy Romer and Lt. Gov. Gail Schoettler convened a discussion process in October 1996 with the Bureau of Reclamation, the Southern Ute and Ute Mountain Ute Tribes, interested water districts, irrigators, and environmentalists in an attempt to resolve disputes among the parties. To assist in the success of this process, the Bureau and the other parties executed a legal `stand still' agreement establishing basic ground rules for the dialog and identifying the activities that could take place outside the process. While the eventual outcome is not known, a recommendation for a different formulation of the project is possible. 
Thus far, the Department of the Interior, acting through the Bureau, is committed to finding a solution acceptable to the parties in general, and to the Colorado Ute Tribes specifically, due to the Federal Government's tribal trust responsibility. My legislation will codify that direction by specifically directing the Bureau to continue with these negotiations, rather than proceed with Animas-La Plata. 
Third, this legislation has been drafted to acknowledge the importance of demonstrating support for ensuring that the Federal Government's obligations to the Colorado Ute Tribes are fulfilled. During debate over the fiscal year 1997 energy and water appropriations bill, colleagues will remember that I offered an amendment to terminate funding for Animas-La Plata. I believe that amendment was not successful last year due to concerns by colleagues that the project is necessary to fulfill Ute tribal water rights. 
As I made clear to colleagues during the appropriations debate, despite the contention that the project will address the Ute claims, Animas-La Plata was not initiated as a way to address 
these claims. This project was authorized in 1968 to supply irrigation water to farmers growing forage crops in arid areas. Even back then, in the heyday of big water projects, this one was riddled with so many problems it couldn't get going. In 1988, nearly 20 years after it was authorized, the settlement of the Ute Indian water rights claims became an additional justification for pushing this project through. 
Construction of this project has not yet begun because of a variety of factors, including concerns raised about the adequacy of the April 1996 Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, issues surrounding cost-sharing and repayment agreements, and compliance problems with New Mexico's water quality standards. 
Both the Ute Mountain Ute and the Southern Ute tribal governments formally support construction of Animas-La Plata. The water that the Utes will be provided from the project, however, is only a fraction of the project's total capacity. Of the 191,230 acre-feet of water the project will supply, two-thirds will go to nontribal interests with only 62,000 acre feet of the total to be supplied to both tribes. There is dissent within the Southern Ute Tribe about the wisdom of this project, and I am pleased that this legislation terminating the project has received the support of the Southern Ute Grassroots Organization. 
I am concerned that the Animas-La Plata as currently proposed cannot meet the needs of the tribes because the initial construction phase of the project will neither provide the delivery system nor the quantity of water needed to fully honor the Federal Government's commitments. We should not spend hundreds of million of dollars and still find the tribal needs potentially unmet. Rather, I want to see that the Bureau is engaged in actively solving these problems rather than half-heartedly moving forward with construction and at the negotiating table to examine alternatives. The Ute Tribes' water rights settlement says that if the project isn't built and fully functional by the year 2000, the tribes may void the settlement and go back into negotiations or litigation. Last year, the Bureau indicated that it cannot complete the project before 2003. It is not unreasonable to expect that the Utes may seek to void their settlement, wherein the non-Indian irrigators will get their expensive project and Congress in the year 2005 or so will have to fund a new water rights settlement. 
Finally, I believe that there needs to be a proactive legislative solution put forward to address the Animas-La Plata project because the political support for continued appropriations for this project is eroding. Last year, during the 104th Congress, the other body voted 221 to 200 to stop the funding for the Animas-La Plata project as it is currently designed. The chairman of the Budget Committee in the other body has put Animas-La Plata on a target list of corporate welfare cuts. I believe that during the appropriations cycle for fiscal year 1998, the other body will again vote to terminate funding for this project. 
Politically, we may go back and forth for a few years with the other body terminating funding and this body restoring the money. But eventually, both Houses of Congress will resist and we will have wasted millions of dollars.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the recent celebration of International Women's Day, which took place on March 8, 1997. Women have made great strides in the past century, both here in the United States and around the globe. As we prepare to enter a new century, however, we must recognize that there is still much work to be done in the areas of equality and human rights for all women. 
Here in the United States, women are making impressive contributions at all levels of society. They are daughters, mothers, wives, and sisters; they are entrepreneurs, research scientists, teachers, and scholars; they serve our Nation in the military, as civil servants, and as Members of the House, of the Senate and of the President's Cabinet. 
This year, I was proud to be a Member of the Senate which unanimously approved the nomination of the first female Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright. More women serve in the 105th Congress than any other Congress in history, with 9 women in the Senate and 53 in the House. While women have made great progress in running for and attaining public office, we cannot forget that women are still vastly underrepresented at virtually every level of government. 
In 1996, American women celebrated the 75th anniversary of winning the right to vote. Sadly, many women--and men--in the United States fail to take advantage of this aspect of democracy. As we prepare to enter the next century, we ought to encourage women to participate fully in our democracy, as informed voters and as candidates for public office at the local, State, and National level. 
One striking inequity that persists for American women is in their earnings as compared to men. According to 1995 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, women earn only 71 percent of the wages of men. This wage gap varies by race: compared to white men, African-American women earn only 64 cents on the dollar, Hispanic women earn only 53 cents, and white women earn 71 cents. 
Sixty percent of women are employed in traditionally female jobs. Women also make up a large segment of the United States contingent work force, which includes independent contractors, part-time and temporary workers, day laborers, and on-call workers. According to the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), participation in this contingent work force has a significant impact on women aged 45 and above because contingent workers receive lower pay and fewer benefits and have less opportunity for advancement than do full-time workers. Women are more likely than men to be contingent employees due to an unequal distribution of parenting and household responsibilities which prevent many women from seeking full-time employment. 
Only part of this disparity is explained by differences in men's and women's career paths. Women and men employed in the same job also receive unequal pay. According to 1995 data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, women received equal pay for only 2 of 90 occupations that were studied. 
As we look toward the 21st century, we must continue to fight for equal pay for equal work and continue to reform our Nation's health care and Social Security systems for all Americans. While we have made great progress with the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, there is still much work to be done. 
Women abroad have also made progress over the past century. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I have had the opportunity to review the status of women on that continent. Last year, I was pleased to be a part of a hearing, chaired by Senator Kassebaum, which explored the status of African women. African women are becoming more active in the economy, in politics, and in solving national problems than they ever have before. Many development indicators that affect women--the number of girls attending primary school and life expectancy, for example--are also improving. 
But with all these advancements, we cannot forget the challenges that women face in Africa. In many countries, women are legally prevented from owning property or signing official documents without the consent of their husbands. Women comprise a substantial majority of the nearly 7 million refugees in Africa. And, in Africa, women suffer more from the HIV virus than do men. 
As we prepare to enter the 21st century, the great strides made by African women, and women in others areas of the world, should be applauded, but the fact that there is still much work to be done should not be forgotten. 
In closing, Mr. President, I see International Women's Day as both an opportunity to celebrate the advancements of the last century and to outline goals for the next century.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on Sunday, March 2, 1997, the Washington Post ran two op-eds profiling how the award of the Nobel Peace Prizes to Asian democratic activists in recent years have helped draw attention to the terrible human rights situation in Burma and in East Timor. The two companion articles highlighted the work of 1991 Nobel winner Aung San Suu Syi and the 1996 cowinners Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo and Jose Ramos Horta. 
I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Ramos Horta late last month, and he told me how--since the Nobel Committee's announcement in October--the attention of international policymakers and the press on the plight of East Timor has increased dramatically. 
Mr. President, the joint award to Bishop Belo and Mr. Ramos Horta, followed by the attention in the United States focused on political campaign contributions from Indonesians, has made United States policy toward Indonesia and human rights issues related to East Timor the subject of heightened interest. The Nobel Committee said it hoped the 1996 award would draw international attention to the situation in East Timor, and help build momentum for resolution of the conflict there. 
I commend the Nobel Committee's decision, because I believe the more light that the international community sheds on the horrible abuses taking place in East Timor, the sooner we will come to a resolution of this conflict.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senate's passage of Senate Resolution 19, regarding United States opposition to the prison sentence of Tibetan ethno-musicologist Ngawang Choephel by the Government of the People's Republic of China. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution, which was introduced by Senator Moynihan, and was successfully reported out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week. 
This resolution expresses the Senate's strong sense that Ngawang Choephel should be released from the prison where he has been held in since 1995. It also urges the United States to raise the issue of his release with Chinese officials, to promote a resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission, and to seek access for human rights monitors in Tibet. 
Mr. Choephel, a Tibetan national who--with the support of a Fulbright scholarship--studied ethno-musicology at Middlebury College in Vermont, was detained by the Chinese authorities in Tibet in August 1995. After being held incommunicado for a year, he was charged with espionage in October 1996. In December of that year, the Chinese sentenced him to a 18-year prison term following a secret trial. 
Mr. Choephel was preparing a documentary film about traditional Tibetan performing arts when he was detained. The State Department says there is no evidence that his activities were anything but academic. Unfortunately, Mr. Choephel's arrest and sentence appear consistent with previous Chinese actions to repress cultural expression in Tibet.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, it was not too long ago, just last June, when I joined the senior Senator from Arizona and the senior Senator from Tennessee, as well as the senior Senator from Minnesota and other Senators, in offering in this body the first bipartisan campaign finance proposal in over a decade. Although the legislation had received unprecedented bipartisan support, including the backing of President Clinton and Ross Perot and Common Cause, 161 different editorial boards nationwide and some 60 congressional Democrats and Republicans, we in this body did fail to invoke cloture on that measure by 6 votes. 
We have heard some interesting arguments during the past summer about this in the public debate, when we did finally debate campaign finance reform for just 2 days under a series of rules that would not allow us to amend the bill but would only allow us to have a debate for 2 days and then vote immediately on cloture. 
That was the deal we had to accept, just to have this issue heard in this body and before the American people. But we did so because we wanted a chance to be heard. 
We were told on that occasion by our opponents, led by the junior Senator from Kentucky, very clearly that he believed there really wasn't much of a problem with our current campaign finance system. We were told that the explosion in campaign spending that we had seen in 1992 and, again, in the 1994 elections was not only not a cause for alarm; we were told by some, led by the senior Senator from Kentucky, that this onslaught of campaign cash was healthy for democracy. That is what we were told, and it carried the day, although a majority of this body did vote to go forward. The status quo, we were told, was democracy at its finest, and more spending, more big spending, would only make it better. 
Of course, we heard the other side of this debate from those of us who adamantly are opposed to the status quo, and at one point during the public debate over this issue, I recall very clearly hearing both the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], and the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson], predict that the 1996 elections would produce a large-scale scandal. They predicted a scandal. I also remember their stern warnings that it would be a scandal of grand magnitude that would eventually compel the Congress to pass meaningful campaign finance reform. 
Mr. President, based on what has happened in the months that followed that debate, what was right? Who was right? Those who were proclaiming that money in politics was a match made in Heaven, or those who suggested that money in politics was closer to gasoline and matches? 
I believe the debate we are having today, and the endless headlines and media reports of abuses by both sides of the aisle in the last election, provide a clear answer to that question. In fact, the Senator from Kentucky and others who opposed our effort last June on the grounds that we needed more campaign spending, not less, got exactly what they wanted in the last election. They got more spending all right. 
The 1996 elections set an all-time record for campaign spending at $2.7 billion--$2.7 billion, Mr. President. Now, was democracy strengthened, as the Senator from Kentucky suggested it would be? I don't think so. Considering that the fewest percentage of Americans went to the ballot in 72 years in that election, I would say that we can lay to rest the theory that more campaign spending increases participation in our political system and is somehow good for democracy. 
The resolution before us today provides about $4.3 million for the Governmental Affairs Committee to conduct an investigation into reported illegalities stemming from just the 1996 elections. This includes abuses both in the Presidential and congressional elections. The investigation, as we have laid out here today, must conclude by December 31, and a report must be issued by the committee within 1 month after that date. 
Ultimately, I certainly will support this resolution, because I strongly believe these activities must be investigated on a bipartisan basis. That is why I have also supported an appointment of an independent counsel to investigate both Republican and Democratic abuses in the 1996 elections. I am aware that several of my colleagues originally held to the position, as the senior Senator from Ohio is pointing out, that the committee should only examine abuses in the Presidential election, but in light of the recent revelations about potential congressional campaign finance abuses in the last election, I commend the authors of this resolution for their willingness to investigate wrongdoing at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. 
I am concerned, however, that this resolution is confined to the 1996 elections. Just in the past few days, allegations have come to light about the 1992 elections and potential wrongdoing by the current Speaker of the other body, as well as a former Vice President of the United States. These 1992 allegations are as serious, in my mind, as the 1996 allegations, and they warrant a full investigation by the oversight committees. The use of the White House and the office of the Vice President for activities related to fundraising I don't think was invented in 1996. That is just my guess, but I am pretty sure it was not invented in 1996. 
Although it is imperfect, I will ultimately support the underlying resolution to allow this investigation to go forward and hope that the committee, under the strong leadership of the Senators from Tennessee and Ohio, will conduct a balanced and bipartisan investigation process. 
But we have to recognize that these investigations are only one small step forward. We have to understand that these abuses, on both sides of the aisle, were an almost inevitable byproduct of a campaign finance system that has virtually no restraints on candidate or party spending and no restraints whatsoever on the so-called soft money contributions that seem to be at the focal point of so many of these abuses. 
These abuses, as the Senators from Arizona and Tennessee predicted last June, were simply inevitable. Yes, it is illegal to raise campaign funds from the White House or from a Senate office. Yes, it is illegal to accept campaign contributions 
from nonresident foreign nationals. Now, that is clear. But let us talk about fundraising practices where the lines between what is legal and illegal and what is ethical and unethical become far more blurred. This is very, very difficult to determine whether something is simply illegal or legal. 
For example, under current law, it is viewed as legal for a corporation, a labor union or a wealthy individual to hand the President of the United States or a U.S. Senator acting on behalf of their political parties a check for $400,000. As long as the check is made out to the party and not the person accepting or even soliciting the check, it is widely viewed as legal. It is called soft money, which is unlimited campaign contributions from sources which are normally restricted in their contributing, based on the reforms that were enacted some 20 years ago. 
For example, corporations and labor unions, which are strictly forbidden from contributing directly to Federal candidates, can contribute unlimited sums of money to the national parties, which then funnel these funds into various House and Senate races. Mr. President, I don't think anyone in this body is going to be able to fool the American people on this. What this system is is a giant money laundering operation, and it is done openly. That is what it is. It is a giant money laundering operation, known as soft money. 
It is also considered legal, apparently, for elected officials to trade access for huge campaign contributions. That is probably on the legal side of the ledger. Let me give you a couple of examples. 
In 1995, the Republican National Committee promised $15,000 donors four meetings a year with House and Senate Republican leaders, as well as participation in international trade missions. That same year, the Democratic National Committee offered $10,000 donors the opportunity to participate in trade missions to Budapest, Vienna, and Paris. 
This system of exchanging access to elected officials for large campaign contributions was recently referred to by a Member of this body as `the American way,' that it is simply the American way to do things this way. Mr. President, if that is true, it is an awfully sad day for America. 
The abuses that have been uncovered in recent elections are the symptoms, not the disease. The disease is our failed campaign finance system. Nowhere is this more visible than with the virtual explosion of so-called soft money. In the 1992 elections, about $86 million was raised by the two national parties in these so-called soft money contributions. In 1994, that figure jumped to over $100 million. And then in the 1996 elections, soft money exploded, and the two parties accumulated over $263 million in soft money contributions. 
That, Mr. President, is more than a 150 percent increase in just 2 years. 
When is this body going to stand up and say that it should be illegal, clearly illegal, for anyone, whether you are from Jakarta or Janesville, WI, to make a $400,000 contribution? 
When is this body going to stand up and say that we should reform a system that reelects incumbents well over 90 percent of the time? 
When is this body going to stand up and say there is simply too much money flowing through our campaign system? And, yes, we do need--soon--comprehensive bipartisan reform. 
I just got here a little while ago, got to the floor, and heard the arguments of, yes, we are going to have the investigation and, yes, we are going to have a vote on the constitutional amendment on campaign finance reform. I am hopeful no one will be fooled. That combination of limited hearings that have to do with only illegal conduct and a vote on a constitutional amendment that will lose is simply a way to sweep this issue under the rug. That is all it is. That is a deadly combination. That would be the death of campaign finance reform, to simply pretend that a vote on a constitutional amendment, with the barriers that are involved there in a limited hearing, will somehow take care of this problem. 
Many of the people who are saying that they are concerned and want to work on this issue are the very ones that voted last year to not even put campaign finance reform on the agenda of the 104th Congress. So we ought to very carefully examine their claims that the combination of a couple days of debate on a constitutional amendment and limited hearings will do the job. If it can be accomplished, it will be a very neat trick. And it worked in the 104th Congress, but it will not work in the 105th Congress. 
Mr. President, it will not be possible to contain this issue. It will not be possible to just sweep it under the rug. 
Mr. President, make no mistake, the investigations and the issue of legislating campaign finance reform are automatically and inextricably linked to each other. Let me say, if these investigations are done right, it can help. 
An investigation that shines a spotlight on the darkest corners of our campaign finance system can be a useful endeavor so long as those who benefit the most from our current campaign finance rules are willing to turn the spotlight on themselves. 
Passage of this resolution, if done right, is a first step. But I do not believe its passage will change one bit the public's perception that their Government and the elected leaders are for sale. 
The only way we can truly begin the process of restoring the trust and faith of the American people in their elected officials is to pass meaningful, bipartisan campaign finance reform. It is my sincere hope that opportunity presents itself in the coming months. And I look forward to a thoughtful debate on the issue as well as negotiations with regard to the specifics. 
So although I will support this resolution, I will also support efforts to strengthen it by explicitly broadening its scope to include both legal and illegal fundraising activities as well as including the elections prior to 1996 where the seeds of much of this abuse were planted. 
Mr. President, what I just described was the original scope of the hearings approved by the Governmental Affairs Committee on a bipartisan, unanimous vote of 16 to 0. And those who supported the narrowing of this scope owe the American people an explanation of why we are only going to examine some of the abuses but not all of the abuses. 
In my view, many of the issues can be investigated even under the wording of the resolution before us. In other words, I think it is going to be very difficult to simply make a legal ruling that something was legal or illegal without looking at the facts. And I do think, however, though it would be preferable to restore the specific language regarding the detailed scope that was originally outlined by the Governmental Affairs Committee. Thank you, Mr. 
President. I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the answer to the question is, the distinguished Senator from Virginia must be talking about a different bill. This bill bans soft money. The labor unions in this country, I believe, spent $7 million this year on soft money. That is wiped out by the McCain-Feingold bill. 
Second, this bill added last year, and it has in this year's version, significant limitations on political action committees. I believe the unions in this country spent about $14 million on political action committees. 
Our bill says, if you want the benefit of the voluntary limits within the bill, you have to limit how much you get from political action committees to total to less than 20 percent of your total campaign contributions. 
It also takes down the amount that a political action committee can give from $5,000 to $1,000 to the individual limit. 
These are severe and real restrictions which I can assure you that the labor unions do not like. In fact, last year there was a meeting of various labor unions and business groups and women's groups and others saying they were very unhappy. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me say, in answer to the question, the Senator from Arizona and I have said in the past we are willing to look at other provisions relating to this broader issue as long as it is fair from the point of view of looking at issues of corporate giving, of share-holding money and the giving activities of other organizations that use their members' dues. That is possible. 
So we have two major limitations on unions in the bill now. And we are willing to discuss an evenhanded provision that relates to other issues. It is simply not the case----

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that is one of a variety of issues that has to do with how unions operate. There are issues of how corporations take money from shareholders, profits to use on campaigns. There are issues about how the National Rifle Association, for example, takes its members' dues and uses that for their activities. These are issues that can be considered. 
Now, I will agree with the Senator, we have not put a provision relating to all of this in our bill at this point because I think it is possible that if we try to take all of that on, it could kill campaign finance reform. It could make it very difficult for us to ban soft money and to put a voluntary limitation system on Members of Congress with incentives. 
But the Senator from Arizona and I have been very careful in saying everything is potentially on the table, and we want to negotiate. Nothing has been stopped from being considered as this bill comes forward.

Mr. FEINGOLD. A brief rejoinder on that. 
The Senator mentioned $35 million spent by the unions in the last election. As I illustrated in my remarks, our bill certainly affects at least $20 million worth of spending that unions did with regard to soft money and political action committees. And may I just point out that the amount of money spent by corporations and other interests in this country, I think, would simply dwarf the figures that are being thrown out around here. That has to be addressed as well. 
I thank the chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to expand the Line-Item Veto Act to cover one of the largest and fastest growing areas of the Federal budget, tax expenditures. I am especially pleased to be joined in offering this legislation by my good friend, Congressman Tom Barrett of Milwaukee who is spearheading this legislation in the other body. Both bills expand the Line-Item Veto Act which took effect this past January and will remain in force for the next 8 years. 
Mr. President, both Congressman Barrett and I supported the new Line-Item Veto Act that was signed into law last session. Though it isn't the whole answer to our deficit problem, I very much hope it will be part of the answer. 
However, the new Line-Item Veto Act failed to address one of the largest and fastest growing areas of Federal spending--the spending done through the Tax Code, often called tax expenditures. 
According to the Senate Budget Committee's most recent committee print on tax expenditures, prepared by the Congressional Research Service, we will spend nearly half a trillion dollars on tax expenditures during the current fiscal year. Citizens for Tax Justice estimates that over the next 7 years, we will spend $3.7 trillion on tax expenditures, and sometime in the next 2 to 3 years, the total amount spent on tax expenditures will actually surpass the total discretionary budget of the United States. 
Mr. President, despite making up a huge and growing portion of the Federal budget, tax expenditures are beyond the reach of the new Presidential line-item veto authority. As currently structured, that authority only extends to so-called limited tax benefits, defined in part to be a tax expenditure that benefits 100 or fewer taxpayers. As long as the tax attorneys can find 101st taxpayers who benefit from the proposed tax expenditure, it is beyond the reach of the new Presidential authority. 
Mr. President, it may not even be necessary for the tax attorneys to find that 101st taxpayer. If a tax expenditure gives equal treatment to all persons in the same industry or engaged in the same type of activity, it is exempt from the new Presidential authority no matter how narrow the special interest spending. 
Further, if all persons owning the same type of property, or issuing the same type of investment, receive the same treatment from a tax expenditure, that tax expenditure is similarly outside the scope of the President's new authority. 
Mr. President, there are still more exceptions that make it even harder for a 
President to trim unnecessary spending done through the tax code. For example, if any difference in the treatment of persons by a new tax expenditure is based solely on the size or form of the business or association involved, or, in the case of individuals, general demographic conditions, then the new spending cannot be touched by the President except as part of a veto of the entire piece of legislation which contains the new spending. 
By contrast, we find none of these elaborate restrictions on the new line item veto authority for spending done through the appropriations process or through entitlements. The new Presidential authority is handcuffed only for spending done through the Tax Code. 
Mr. President, this raises several problems. 
First, and foremost, it shields an enormous portion of the Federal budget from this new tool to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending. If the authority established by the Line-Item Veto Act is to have meaning, it cannot be preempted from being used to scrutinize this much spending. 
A second problem raised by the inability of the new Presidential authority to address new tax expenditures is that it creates an enormous loophole through which questionable spending can escape. We have already seen discussions of how special interest spending can be crafted to avoid the new Presidential authority. While the current Line-Item Veto Act power given the President formally covers discretionary spending and new entitlement authority, a special interest intent on enacting its pork barrel spending could readily do so by avoiding the discretionary or entitlement formats, and instead transform their pork into a tax expenditure. As we know from the elaborate limits placed on the President's ability to apply the new authority to spending through the Tax Code, most special interest pork that takes the form of a tax break is beyond the reach of the Line-Item Veto Act. 
Mr. President, no matter how powerful this new authority is with regard to discretionary spending and entitlement authority, it is virtually useless against tax expenditures, and thus invites special interests to use this avenue to deliver pork. 
A further problem with the lack of adequate Presidential review in this area is the very real potential for inequities in the implementation of the new Line-Item Veto Act authority. These inequities arise in part from the progressive structure of marginal tax rates--as income rises, higher tax rates are applied. In turn, this means that many tax expenditures are worth more to those in the higher income tax brackets than they are to families with lower incomes. 
In some instances, tax expenditures provide no benefit at all to individuals with lower incomes. 
This is not the case with entitlement and discretionary spending programs--both areas covered by the Line-Item Veto Act. The benefits of those programs often are targeted to those with lower income. 
The net effect is that the scope of the current Line-Item Veto Act covers programs that often benefit those with low and moderate income, while it is powerless with regard to programs that often benefit individuals and corporations with higher incomes. 
Mr. President, tax expenditures have another feature that makes it especially important that we extend the new Line-Item Veto Act to cover them, namely their status as a kind of super entitlement. Once enacted, a tax expenditure continues to spend money without any additional authorization or appropriation, and without any regular review. In fact, while even funding for entitlements like Medicare or Medicaid can be suspended in rare instances such as a Government shut-down, funding for a tax expenditure is never interrupted. 
Tax expenditures enjoy a status that is far above any other kind of government spending, and as such, it should receive special scrutiny. Extending the Line-Item Veto Act to cover them will provide some of that needed review. 
Mr. President, as I have noted, tax expenditures make up a huge portion of the budget. They will soon exceed the entire Federal discretionary budget. Citizens for Tax Justice reports that if all current tax expenditures were suddenly repealed, the deficit could be eliminated and income tax rates could be reduced across the board by about 25 percent. 
Clearly, tax expenditures have an enormous impact on the deficit, and we need to pursue two tracks with regard to them. First, we must cut some of the nearly half a trillion dollars in existing spending done through the tax code. Any balanced plan to eliminate the deficit over the next few years must contain cuts to spending in this area. 
And second, with so much of our budget already dedicated to this kind of spending, we must bring tax expenditures under the Line-Item Veto Act and give the President the authority to act on new spending in this area as he does in other areas. 
Our legislation does just that by eliminating the highly restrictive language with respect to tax expenditures. 
Mr. President, as with the recently enacted Line-Item Veto Act itself, this bill to extend that new authority is not the whole answer to our deficit problems, but it can be part of the answer, and I urge my colleagues to support this effort to put teeth into the new Presidential authority with respect to the tax expenditure portion of the Federal budget.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the achievement of three young women from the Milwaukee Morse Middle School. Together, Kayla Tepps, Alex Yale, and Carrie Schaffner, formed the winning team in the Regional Future Cities Competition sponsored by National Engineer's Week. They created a city plan using sophisticated computer simulation software that allowed them to analyze and measure effects of their designs on a living, changing city. The students then created a 3-dimensional model of their city to present in the competition along with their data. I commend the team's members on the quality and character of their hard work. 
I am impressed with the active role these students have taken in their education. This sort of initiative leads to citizens who take an active role in their communities. Whether that role be in the political, social, or economic arena, these young women are an example of the potential that our country's youth hold to come up with new ways, better ways, to solve our problems. These three Wisconsinites are a example to their peers that women can and do succeed in pursuing subjects and careers currently dominated by men. For this I also commend their teacher, Dave Mongin, for taking an active role in his student's careers, and their engineer-mentor, Eyad Mizian, for taking an active role in his community. They truly represent the kind of leadership we need more of in today's schools. I offer these students my sincere congratulations, I am proud that they represent the State of Wisconsin.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his kind remarks and for his excellent remarks in opposition to the balanced budget amendment. The amendment I am offering today to the balanced budget amendment will ensure that this Congress will meet its stated goal of reaching a balanced budget by the year 2002. Many people do not realize that as currently drafted, Senate Joint Resolution 1 may well forestall this goal of balancing the budget by the year 2002 well into the next century. I believe reaching a balanced budget by 2002 or earlier should be our highest priority. Thus, I am offering an amendment that will shorten the time for ratification of this amendment. 
As was noted on the floor by our colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, a few weeks ago, even if this amendment were somehow ratified at 2:10 today, tomorrow this Nation's deficit would be no smaller than it was when the amendment was adopted. The fact that this amendment in and of itself does nothing to reduce the deficit highlights one of my principal concerns with Senate Joint Resolution 1. That concern is that pursuing a constitutional amendment approach could, counter to what everyone suggests on this issue, actually delay action on the real work of achieving a balanced budget by providing what is, in effect, political cover for inaction while the States debate the question of ratification. 
Under the proposal before us, even if the Congress adopted the joint resolution this year, the implementation date, the date by which we would actually be required to balance the budget, is potentially well into the next decade. Conceivably, it could be as late as the year 2006. 
That is right within the terms of the balanced budget amendment that is being offered. This is evident on the face of the amendment itself. Section 8 of the amendment offered in Senate Joint Resolution 1 provides that the balanced budget amendment will take effect beginning with the fiscal year 2002, or within the second fiscal year beginning after its ratification, whichever is later. So there is no certainty at all with regard to the year 2002.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I may, I would like to use that time. There were interesting remarks made by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, my friend, Senator Hatch. 
I will reiterate, this is really the fish-or-cut-bait amendment. I always appreciate the eloquence of the Senator from Utah, but I notice a sort of different tone when he speaks about this amendment as opposed to the balanced budget amendment. There is sort of a lack of urgency to his tone about this. His tone suggests that whether we get this thing done by 2002 or 2006, the important thing is that we just have this balanced budget amendment on the books. That just does not seem to square with the rest of the comments I have heard from the Senator and most of the other supporters of the balanced budget amendment. 
There was no suggestion by the Senator from Utah that we could not limit this to 3 years. I appreciate his candor on that. That is something that is available to the Congress. It has not been done before, but when the limitation was put in the first place on the 7 years on the 18th amendment, it was my understanding that was not done before. So there is no literal constraint on that. 
I was also struck, Mr. President, by the Senator from Utah's statement that we really had no reason here not to adhere to convention, there is no reason not to go to 3 years or we should stick with the traditional 7 years. This entire process of balancing the budget and having an amendment to the Constitution to do it could not be more contrary to the notion of adhering to convention. We have tried to use the Constitution of this country as a very limited and narrow document for 200 years but now we are going to do accounting through the Constitution. I suggest that that is a failure to adhere to convention. 
The Senator from Utah also tried to describe this amendment as sort of a technicality, saying that whether it is 2002 or 2006, that is not the issue. We just need it in the Constitution. 
Mr. President, it flies right in the face of his excellent description of that stack of documents in front of him. The Senator from Utah is one of the taller Members of this body, if I may say so. I do not think that is in dispute. I agree that if we keep going down this road that we will be unable to see the distinguished chairman, 
perhaps even by the year 2002, because of these books that are piling up. But if we wait not until the year 2002 but to the year 2006, I think the former Senator from New Jersey may not be visible and we may have to get Senators who would be able to start in a starting line up in the NBA just to be able to be seen over these documents. The fact is, there is a difference between the year 2006 and the year 2002. 
All my amendment does, Mr. President, is guarantee that however this turns out, through a balanced budget amendment or through a bipartisan agreement to balance the budget by the year 2002, that is the date. Either way, it cannot be after that time. That is the effect of my amendment, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me say I, of course, am very candid on this point, that I do not support the balanced budget amendment for a variety of reasons, but I do recognize that there are some very serious consequences for this country if we do pass it. 
My amendments today are relevant to the situation we would face if it does go through. I am sincere in my belief that if it does pass, the process is going to be slowed down here if it is not ratified quickly by the States. That is why I offer this amendment, because sometimes things happen that you are not happy about in the Congress and the President signs it, but you would like the negative effects to be limited. 
That is the spirit in which the amendment is offered.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his kind remarks. 
I now would like to speak about an amendment that is also in the spirit of trying to make sure this balanced budget amendment works properly, in the event it goes through the Congress and is ratified by the States. 
Mr. President, regardless of our views on the balanced budget amendment, many of us would like us not only to balance the budget, but many of us would like us to establish a statutory balance that can act as a fiscal cushion against unexpected emergencies. In other words, we think we should never project a deficit, but that on occasion we may want to project something of a surplus to make sure there is money there in case there is an emergency or some other urgent spending priority that has to be dealt with, but only on a surplus basis. 
Now, Mr. President, this is not some idea I cooked up. This is what we do in Wisconsin. It is done in some form in most States. I think it would make good sense at the Federal level. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, in its current form, the proposed balanced budget amendment discourages this fiscally responsible tool. In effect, it does not really allow a surplus. It certainly does not allow a surplus to be used if one arises, except by a three-fifths vote in each house, which is a very high standard. Because outlays cannot exceed receipts in any year under the balanced budget amendment, any surplus built up to address an unexpected need would be subject to the three-fifths threshold and all the potential mischief that a supermajority requirement employs. 
Mr. President, many of us in this body have concerns with the way we currently address emergencies and other unexpected needs as they arise. I have seen a lot of that just in the 4 years I have been here dealing with various disaster and emergency legislation. Under our present budget structure, we are forced to choose between adding to the deficit and scrambling to find spending cuts or tax increases to offset the unexpected need. 
I think, and we have certainly seen this in Wisconsin, a far more fiscally responsible approach would be to appropriate a dedicated emergency fund or require a positive ending balance on which we could draw as the need arises. By budgeting for an emergency in advance, this approach would avoid deficit funding, but it would also decouple the potentially desperate need for emergency assistance from the hurried approach of emergency offsets. So a surplus fund or statutory ending balance would also address some of the concerns that have been raised by Secretary Rubin and others who have spoken about the important role that automatic economic stabilizers play in the health of the economy. 
Our committee chairman has cited Fred Bergsten, a noted economist, during the committee's markup. This is what our distinguished chairman said in citing Mr. Bergsten: `* * * a better way to go is to shoot for a yearly surplus and let that take care of truly automatic fluctuations, if there are any.' 
Mr. President, I agree with our chairman. I think balancing the budget and building up a reasonable surplus during good times to help cushion economic downturns is a better way to go. However, as I just noted, Mr. President, under the present draft, we could not establish and use such a surplus fund without violating the constitutional amendment mandate except through achieving a three-fifths majority in each house. 
Mr. President, you know that threshold presents serious problems, as many of our colleagues have noted during the course of this debate. The supermajority requirement empowers a minority to hold up a must-pass measure unless their fiscal or policy demands have been met. As some have noted, this perhaps mild form of extortion might even take the form of insisting on additional deficit spending, precisely the opposite direction intended by the supporters of the constitutional amendment. Remember, this balanced budget amendment does not guarantee that we have deficit spending, it just requires a supermajority to do so. 
Mr. President, if allowing a surplus fund might be fiscally prudent to handle the unexpected natural disaster or military conflict, I think this surplus opportunity becomes absolutely essential if we hope to fund the bulges in Social Security benefits that will occur when the baby boomers retire. 
In just a few years, we will begin to have to pay back the funds we have borrowed from the Social Security trust fund. Before that happens, Mr. President, we have to somehow rid ourselves of the addiction to those trust fund surpluses. That is how we have been masking how great our deficit is in the past, and we have to begin to balance the budget without those surpluses. That means, Mr. President, that the unified budget will have to be in surplus, but even then, if we build up a genuine surplus in unified budget to pay future retirees, the restrictions of the proposed balanced budget amendment will prevent us from using it unless we can muster a three-fifths vote of support in both bodies. 
Mr. President, right now, the Social Security trust fund is receiving more than it is paying out. Those surpluses will continue to build until the baby boomers retire, and we need to tap into those savings at that point to offset the bulge in Social Security beneficiaries. 
Mr. President, many have said this, but we have abused the Social Security surpluses by using them to mask part of our budget deficit. I don't single out one party or one branch of Government, because it has sort of been standard operating procedure for nearly 30 years. Mr. President, many of us want to stop that abuse and to work to get the budget off the Social Security surplus addiction so the funds are there for retirees as promised. 
Mr. President, again, the current balanced budget amendment draft will not let us do that. When the baby boomer retirees begin to collect Social Security and the surpluses turn negative, the balanced budget amendment does not permit us to draw upon any savings we can build up between now and then. 
Now, one approach is to explicitly exempt Social Security from the balanced budget amendment by putting the Social Security trust fund out of reach. We could then be sure that they will be available to draw down when needed. 
Some who oppose this approach argue that we can do so by statute. They note that nothing in the current draft would prevent us from taking Social Security off budget by law, as we do now, and achieve genuine balance outside of Social Security. Unfortunately, though, Mr. President, even if the rest of the budget is in true balance, the current version of the amendment still prevents the use of the trust fund savings to pay Social Security benefits, unless the rest of the budget is cut or taxes are increased. 
Mr. President, the current balanced budget draft requires cash flow to be balanced. It expressly prohibits the kind of buildup in anticipation of need that is the underpinning of the Social Security system itself. To put it in more simple terms, it is exactly like telling parents when the time comes to pay the cost of their child's education, they will not be able to use any of the savings they have built up, but will have to pay for the cost of their child's college education out of whatever their income is at that time--not one dime more. I can tell you, as a parent of four teenagers, that would be a very troubling prospect indeed. 
Mr. President, my amendment would allow us to use the savings we must build up in advance of the coming retirement bulge. Let me be clear about this. Although this is the way it is done in my home State of Wisconsin--by statute--my amendment does not require us to have a surplus. My amendment does not require us to fulfill our commitment to future retirees. Yes, Congress could still duck that commitment. But at least, Mr. President, if my amendment is adopted, Congress would be able to do the right thing by Social Security beneficiaries. Without it--if the Constitution is amended as it is currently drafted--Congress will have to find a dollar in budget cuts or tax increases for every dollar Social Security outlays exceed receipts. 
Mr. President, despite all the rhetoric about how Social Security will do quite well in what I like to call the `brave new world of the balanced budget amendment,' who can doubt that Social Security benefits will quickly go on the chopping block, if we ever get to that eventuality? 
Mr. President, this is a fundamental inequity that is built into the proposed constitutional amendment. Programs like Social Security, which require a buildup of savings to work, have to muster a three-fifths majority from both bodies. But the defense budget, special interest spending done through the Tax Code, and corporate welfare, all get a free pass. They don't have to go through this. 
So, Mr. President, to conclude, even if my amendment is adopted, it will be difficult for Social Security to compete with these other powerful interests. But at least by allowing for a 
surplus, my amendment gives it a fighting chance. 
I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Arizona. I enjoy serving with him on the Judiciary Committee. I appreciate his candor. 
Basically, those folks who advocate the constitutional amendment have said it all here. They have now said formally that if you want to get money from the Social Security trust fund surplus in the coming years, that in fact the only way to do it is by getting a supermajority, 
three-fifths of both the Senate and the other body. 
I hope the seniors of this country are listening and realize what we are talking about here. It is incredibly difficult to get three-fifths of either body on anything. It is hard enough to get over 50 votes on anything. And when you are talking about the competition with all the special interests that are represented in this community, even with a fully funded Social Security trust fund, requiring a three-fifths majority of both Houses to fully fund Social Security benefits from the trust fund has to be one of the greatest threats to Social Security that can be imagined. 
Let's be clear. I do not think anyone has successfully disputed the claim that this constitutional amendment allows the use of Social Security dollars to balance the budget. That has become very clear in this debate. What this new admission tells us is that if the Congress wants to do the right thing after we have a balanced budget amendment and wants to make sure that retirees and future retirees have the money saved for them over the years, they will not be able to do it through a majority vote. A minority in either House will be able to prevent every senior citizen in this country from getting the payments they deserve and that they paid into the system for. That is what this thing does. 
This isn't just about seniors. Yes, it is about my generation. It is about baby boomers. Perhaps that will be the first group that will be affected by this. But it is also about future generations who certainly hope, if they are required to pay into the Social Security system, that there would be a way for them to access their retirement benefits without having to persuade three-fifths of both Houses of Congress it is a good idea. You should not have to persuade three-fifths of the Congress that it is a good idea. That is your money. That is your retirement benefit. 
So, basically, our argument has been conceded here. I thank the Senator for his candor. 
Let me note that in States where they have a surplus fund, in most of those States they do not require a supermajority in order to access the surplus money. According to the National Conference of State Legislators, as of 1995, 45 States and Puerto Rico had created such funds but only about a quarter of them required a supermajority to use the fund. 
Further, let's remember that States are not faced with having to fund a program like Social Security that absolutely requires a substantial buildup of savings in advance. As drafted, the balanced budget amendment puts programs like Social Security at a tremendous disadvantage by requiring a three-fifths vote to use net savings. So why don't we learn from the experience of the States? 
The Presiding Officer was a distinguished Governor, and he and the other former Governors in this body know that it is very important sometimes to have a projected surplus for a rainy day. Apparently, the vast majority of the States have determined in their experience--which we don't have here in Washington--that you should not require a supermajority if you need to get at that money either for purposes of emergency, or here, in this case, for the very important purpose of paying retirement benefits to people who are promised those benefits for their retirement. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Let me respond to the remarks of the Senator from Arizona. He referred to the belief that we should worry about spending, what he has referred to as the `extra money' when we get to the point of the surplus. I guess the main thrust of my remarks is that I wasn't talking really about extra money. I am sure that could happen. I will address an example of that in a moment. 
What we are talking about here is a formula against money which is otherwise known as the Social Security trust fund. Are we going to start thinking about whether we are going to honor the obligations to our retirees only at the point that we have a surplus? That is what it sounds like. We get to that point, and say, `Oh, there is a bunch of money in here for Social Security. Let's see if we can get 60 votes of the Senate to hand that money out.' 
That strikes me as very different than a discussion of what we are going to do about extra money. What we are talking about here is whether we are going to basically pull the rug out from under people who paid into a system for the express purpose of providing for their retirement. There are really very few things that are more important to working people in this country. 
I do not think there has been a real response to my concern that the bar is being set higher for Social Security under this amendment than it is for other programs. That is because Social Security by its nature requires the buildup of a surplus in order to work. Such a program, in order to access those surplus funds, has to get three-fifths of both Houses, but other programs, the Defense Department, corporate welfare, and wasteful spending programs, need only obtain a simple majority as long as it is within the balance of the balanced budget amendment. 
This is very serious business. Let us finally just take the example of surplus funds that might be used for a different purpose. Let us say there is a surplus that builds up--and I think the folks on the other side of the aisle might be attracted to this--and Congress decides they expected and they would like to give the people in the country a tax cut. Maybe they decide it is not the Government's money; it is the people's money, and there is enough money in surplus to give everybody $500 of tax relief. 
Under this amendment as it is now drafted, that built up surplus could not be used to cut taxes unless you had 60 votes. And as strong as the Republican majority is in this body, you do not have 60 votes. You would need 60 votes to give the American people the benefits of that surplus in the form of a tax cut. That does not strike me as similar to the arguments I have heard about the urgency of tax cuts in the past, and I do believe that would be the effect of the proposed balanced budget amendment if we do not adopt the amendment I have suggested to allow a surplus to be used for other purposes as long as a simple majority is achieved in both Houses. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Chair. 
I think the discussion of both the issue of tax cuts and the Social Security benefits points up how serious it is to amend the Constitution in order to balance the budget. In effect, we are not going to be able to use a surplus that has been built up to give a tax cut. If we do not worry about it now and we only worry about it when there is a surplus, the problem is it is going to be in the Constitution. We are not going to be able to just fix it. We had one experience like that in this country in prohibition, and it took quite an effort to undo it. 
So, again, there appears to be a major uncertainty with regard to this. The important question is do we really want to be faced in the future years with a system set forth in the Constitution that gives us no flexibility, that requires a three-fifths majority of both Houses in order to simply access and use the Social Security trust funds? 
The other side is not denying that is what is happening. In fact, they say that is what should have to happen--and that is what our retirees of the future may face.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I rise today in support of the amendment by my colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts. I do so because it speaks directly to one of the most significant, yet still unanswered questions about this proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The issue I want to speak about today goes to the very heart and structure of our democratic system of Government, that being the role the courts will play if this amendment is adopted. 
As has often been the case during this debate on the issue of judicial enforcement, we have rarely moved the dialog beyond generalities and hypotheticals to resolve with any finality what role if any the courts will play if the balanced budget amendment becomes a part of our Constitution. 
Unless the proposed amendment is modified to make clear that the judiciary shall not assume the responsibilities of managing the financial obligation and priorities of this Nation, it could well turn over to the courts decisionmaking authority on issues such as tax rates and spending priorities, decisions which I think we all agree should remain within the purview of the Congress and the executive branch. 
As the President has said, all it takes to balance the budget is our votes and his signature. Yet, this amendment potentially wrests from Congress our ability and, in my opinion, our responsibility to make the tough choices and lays them at the foot of the judiciary. We should make it clear that unelected judges will not assume the role which is better left to those who are elected by the voters. 
In raising my concern with the potential role of the judiciary enforcing the balanced budget amendment, I want to make it clear that I do not do so out of disrespect or disregard for the courts and their very significant role in our democracy. Nor do I rise to engage in the kind of assault on the integrity of the judiciary that has become all too commonplace in recent years when a contrary decision manifests itself into a full-scale assault on the judicial system of our Nation. 
Mr. President, our system of justice is by no means foolproof. Nor does it always reach popular results. It is, however, the best system that has been devised throughout history. And this is due in large measure to its independence, to the independence of the judiciary. The Federal judges are granted life tenure so that they may be free to interpret the law without fear of retribution during the next election cycle. The independence of the judiciary is as important to our democracy as any other element, and I do not rise to question that independence or to castigate members of the judiciary. Rather, I rise because the failure to address the role of the courts in this amendment strikes at the very heart of our system of government. Our system of checks and balances between our three branches has prevented any one branch from becoming too powerful. 
This body, the legislative branch, the branch closest to the people, was given the responsibility of making the laws and controlling the purse. The executive is charged with the primary responsibility for execution of the laws and the judiciary with interpretation and enforcement of them. 
The premise that the courts shall interpret and enforce the laws has been a fundamental notion throughout our constitutional history. Although noted in the accompanying views of both the proponents and opponents in the report on this amendment, the words of Chief Justice John Marshall, in Marbury versus Madison, are worth reiteration here. 
It is, emphatically, the province and duty of the judicial department, to say what the law is. 
Mr. President, there could be little doubt that the courts of this Nation play a significant and vital role in our democracy. As was pointed out by my colleague in the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Senator Torricelli, the difference between our Constitution and those of other countries is not necessarily in the rights that it assures, but that they will be enforced by an independent judiciary. It is this structure which has served us so well for so long. 
However, that structure is also based upon the assumption that the courts will not be given the responsibility for actions which are intended to and have historically been reserved for elected officials in both the executive and legislative branches. In the context of this amendment, that assumption simply cannot be made. 
If the balanced budget amendment is added to this Nation's charter, without clarifying and limiting the role of the courts and establishing fiscal priorities for our Nation, it will constitute nothing less than a radical restructuring of our democratic system of government. In fact, the history of this amendment illustrates the significance of this issue. 
On two previous occasions, in 1994 and 1995, the text of the balanced budget amendment was modified in respect to the role of the courts: Once to limit involvement to declaratory judgments and, most recently, to allow implementing legislation to define the role of the courts. Yet, despite these facts, proponents of this amendment, the one we are to vote on next week, now argue that the best approach to this significant threshold issue is simply silence. 
They are not open to the kinds of changes that were added in the last two attempts to pass this amendment to our Constitution. 
The committee report states that it is the belief of the proponents that: 
S.J. Res. 1 strikes the right balance in terms of judicial review. By remaining silent about judicial review in the amendment itself, its authors have refused to establish congressional sanction for the Federal courts to involve themselves in fundamental macroeconomic and budgetary questions, while not undermining their equally fundamental obligation to `say what the law is . . .' 
Thus, Mr. President, it seems under a veil of silence the proponents are simply choosing not to address this issue. 
I also note that I do not believe that the courts of this Nation have historically waited for congressional sanction before addressing issues raised by the U.S. Constitution. In short, the committee report seems to be saying that Congress will not explicitly give the courts their approval to do something which, in fact, the courts may already do on their own--interpret and enforce the Constitution. To me, Mr. President, this approach is the kind of classic sidestepping of critical issues which has plagued this debate and that fosters public cynicism for this body and elected officials in general. 
In response to this concern, one can anticipate that proponents will argue that we should set aside such issues and just address them within implementing legislation. This has been standard throughout the debate--much as the balanced budget amendment allows us to forestall the tough votes needed to balance the budget, the distant promise of implementing legislation allows us to forestall answering the tough questions about this proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution. 
Mr. President, if we are going to ask the American people to amend the Constitution in a manner as unprecedented as this amendment, I believe they have a right to know exactly what the amendment will mean to them. They should have a chance to know that now, not after it has already been locked into the Constitution in a way that we cannot easily undo. 
The hollow promise that all of these issues may be resolved at some unspecified point in the distant future should not be the basis on which we choose to amend the U.S. Constitution. It is more than a bit ironic that many of the same Members of this Congress who support the balanced budget amendment on the ground that Congress lacks the discipline and responsibility to balance the budget ourselves, have little trouble asking the American people to trust that same Congress to somehow properly address the myriad of uncertainties created by this amendment through implementing legislation. 
Mr. President, if the 105th Congress is intent on adding a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution, then we better do it correctly. We should know what it means and we should address situations like judicial review now, not later. 
Furthermore, by placing the intent of the Congress into the amendment, the potential result of the Presidential veto of implementing legislation is avoided. There can be little doubt that the debate over implementing legislation will be a very protracted and difficult debate involving issues of separation of powers and enforcement, among others. What if the President vetoes implementing legislation and Congress cannot muster the two-thirds necessary to override? 
At this point, does anyone truly believe that the courts will simply sit idly by and wait for Congress and the President to reach an accord on implementing legislation? They must, Mr. President, have a duty to enforce constitutional requirements and the fact that Congress and the Executive cannot agree on legislation does not simply and suddenly negate that duty. While section 6 of the balanced budget amendment authorizes the Congress to create implementing legislation, that authority is not exclusive and does not preclude court action. 
Quite simply, Mr. President, as currently configured, this amendment does nothing to stop the courts from fulfilling their historic role of interpreting and enforcing the Constitution of this Nation. 
While the committee report seeks to silently advocate the position that the involvement of courts should be limited, many proponents of the amendment have argued for significant judicial involvement. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce testified that there is in fact a legitimate and necessary role for the courts in maintaining the integrity of the balanced budget requirement. 
This position is not ahistorical as the courts have historically played a legitimate role in maintaining the protections embodied in our Constitution. As Alan B. Morrison of Public Citizen testified before the Committee on the Judiciary:  
Does anyone believe that the First, Fourth, Fifth, Tenth or Fourteenth Amendments, to mention a few, would be respected by our governments if the Federal Judiciary were not there to back up the words with court orders? 
The notion that the role of the courts would be limited because the amendment will not spawn litigation is simply unfounded. Constitutional scholars, from Robert Bork to Kathleen Sullivan have agreed that this amendment will force the issue before the courts in myriad lawsuits. Former Judge Bork argued that the potential for thousands of cases, with inconsistent results, would be before the courts. 
Thus, what the American people are faced with is this: An amendment which is intentionally silent on the role of the courts, the looming specter of thousands of lawsuits, and a Judiciary which has historically, and in my opinion properly, played a primary role in resolving constitutional conflicts. Given these factors, is there any question that in the absence of an express limitation the courts will become hopelessly immersed in the budgetary decisions which should be left up to Congress? 
When faced with such a scenario, proponents argue that the issue of standing will preclude court intervention, despite the fact that doing so suggests that the constitutional amendment is virtually inoperative because no one would be able to go into court and have it enforced. While some argue that only a handful of parties may have standing, and still others argue for a more broad interpretation, no one can argue or be sure who, in fact, will be heard by the courts. Further, the arguments on both sides of the issue must be viewed in the context of the amendment being added to the Constitution. 
For example, while the proponents argue that the amendment does not allow for Presidential impoundment, it is conceivable that the President, backed by the new amendment, could argue he or she not only has the power to impound appropriated funds but also a constitutionally mandated obligation to do so. If such action would occur, individuals whose retirement checks are withheld or Federal employees whose salaries have been reduced by executive fiat would surely have standing to sue. What about a suit brought by Members of Congress challenging the actions of the Executive? 
Testimony received from Stuart Gerson, former Acting Attorney General and proponent of the notion that judicial intervention will be narrow, who conceded some limited form of standing may exist and that judicial review is not fully foreclosed. What about the potential for taxpayers bringing lawsuits--potentially in the State courts? 
The simple and uncontroverted fact, Mr. President, is that we do not know the answers to these questions. 
In response, the proponents argue that the balanced budget amendment strikes the proper response by remaining silent. We can continue to have hypothetical debates ad infinitum, and we will never resolve, until the courts themselves do so, what will happen when these lawsuits are filed. Until such time, this is all speculation, speculation which provides an insufficient foundation in my view on which to amend the Constitution of the United States. 
Failure to address the issue in the context of this amendment will result in three unfortunate and unnecessary results: First, unelected judges, potentially both State and Federal, will be inserted into policymaking positions for which they have no experience. Second, such a result will constitute a radical and unwise transformation of responsibility of three branches of our democratic Government. Third, this shift in power could do incalculable damage to our system of justice itself. Not only would the practical, policy driven demands burden the courts, but the potential backlash for unpopular judiciary decisions would threaten to undermine the effectiveness of the courts and risk the independence of that important branch. 
One can only assume that a court forced to make a tough if constitutionally mandated budgetary decision would no doubt feel the sting not only of angry public sentiment, but also from Members of Congress, many of whom engage in this type of rhetoric even now. Mr. President, we should make the tough choices, not the courts. 
Finally, Mr. President, it is no secret that I oppose this amendment to the Constitution for a number of reasons, many of which I have had the chance to speak about today, and also because it is unnecessary to amend the Constitution in order to balance the budget. Many have argued this amendment will instill within the Congress the character necessary to balance the budget--I disagree. Character cannot be constitutionally mandated. It can only be revealed through accepting responsibility and making the tough choices and doing it now. 
The amendment before this body potentially forestalls the enactment of the balanced budget well into the next century. In doing so, it amends our fundamental charter, and it does so in a manner that creates more questions than it resolves. This is not the way to balance the budget, nor, in my opinion, is it the way to maintain the integrity of our great Constitution. 
While we may disagree on the utility of amending the Constitution, I hope we can at least strike agreement on the particular issue of judicial review. For the reasons I and others have outlined, it is the height of foolishness to leave something as important as this unresolved. For many of my colleagues who call themselves conservatives and criticize what they believe to be judicial excess, explicitly foreclosing judicial intervention would seem to be a very simple, appropriate, and appealing solution to what is a legitimate and potentially catastrophic problem. 
Mr. President, before yielding the floor back to the senior Senator from Massachusetts, let me just say we should not leave important budgetary decisions in the uncertain hands of unelected judges. We should make them ourselves. We can ensure this result by clarifying the role of the courts in this amendment. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy amendment, and I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment allows Congress to establish a surplus fund, a tool used in many States, in a far more responsible way to address emergencies than simply deficit spending or scrambling for offsets. 
My amendment allows Congress to build up and use the savings needed to fund the bulge in Social Security benefits that will occur when the baby boomers retire. Without this amendment, there would be a three-fifths vote required in each House in order to access the Social Security fund. This is terribly important to current and future retirees, and my amendment does not require Congress to do the right thing, but at least allows Congress to live up to its commitment to the Social Security beneficiary.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by the senior Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers]. 
Over the years, Senator Bumpers has been the Senate's most consistent voice for deficit reduction, and I am pleased to join him in this effort. 
As has been described, this amendment provides a statutory alternative to the constitutional approach, and as such, it has significant advantages. 
First and foremost, the Bumpers alternative would require immediate action. 
As I have noted on several occasions, the lengthy and uncertain ratification process allows Congress to hide behind years and years of delay. 
The only enforcement mechanism explicitly provided in the proposed constitutional amendment, the supermajority voting requirements, would not kick in for years. 
If Congress acted today to pass the proposed constitutional amendment, slow ratification could delay enforcement for another 9 years--until 2006. 
Even without delays in ratification--even if the States ratified the amendment tomorrow--the constitutional amendment would have no effect until 2002 at the very earliest. 
By contrast, this alternative would require action this year. 
We would face the supermajority thresholds as part of this year's budget resolution, every year before 2002 and thereafter. 
This approach makes good sense. 
It removes the excuse for inaction by implementing budget discipline right away. 
It also does so without the troubling potential for unintended consequences inherent in the proposed constitutional amendment. 
There have been lengthy debates over the precise powers the proposed constitutional language confers on the President and the courts. 
To any disinterested observer, these issues are clearly open to different interpretation, and at the very least there is doubt as to the precise role the courts and the President will have in the brave new world of the balanced budget amendment. 
The statutory approach contains none of these risks. 
There is no unintended domino effect on the constitutional powers of the executive and judicial branches. 
In this regard, I strongly urge my colleagues who support a constitutional approach to consider the statutory alternative as a prudent first step, and I invite them to consider the Line-Item Veto Act that we passed last session as a model. 
Wisely, Congress opted to pursue a statutory approach instead of a constitutional path in that case. 
Although I would have opposed changing our Constitution to provide line-item veto authority, I supported the statutory Line-Item Veto Act crafted here by my good friend the Senator from Arizona and others. 
Opting for a statutory approach allows Congress to evaluate the new line-item veto authority carefully and to offer refinements when appropriate. 
In fact, I am pleased to have established a line-item veto watchdog group for just this purpose, and look forward to taking an active role in watching the development of this new statutory authority. 
I have also offered legislation to strengthen the Line-Item Veto Act with regard to wasteful special interest spending in the tax code. 
As we know, changes to our Constitution are not so easily refined. 
As the supporters of prohibition discovered, we can only react to the unintended consequences of a constitutional amendment by amending the Constitution again. 
Of course, supporters of the constitutional amendment are unwilling to admit there may be unintended consequences, especially with regard to the role of the courts and the President. 
They generally remain silent about those issues. 
While they are unwilling to confer specific enforcement powers explicitly to the executive or judicial branches, they also refuse to acknowledge the implied presence of enforcement powers in the proposed constitutional amendment. 
The amendment offered by my good friend from Arkansas adopts the same supermajority threshold approach used in the proposed constitutional amendment; it would take effect right away, not 9 years from now; and, it avoids the monumental uncertainties inherent in any constitutional change. 
I congratulate my good friend Senator Bumpers for offering this sensible alternative, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to support the Reid amendment. I want to commend my friend and the distinguished Senator from Nevada for offering it. 
Mr. President, Social Security is unlike any other program in the unified budget. In fact, the surpluses generated by Social Security are the principal reason that the unified budget was created in the first place. 
Social Security is, fiscally and politically, a special program, and those special traits require us to separate it out from the rest of the budget. Social Security is singular as a public contract between the people of the United States and their elected Government. 
What happened here with Social Security, Mr. President, is that the elected Government promised that if workers and their employers paid into the Social Security fund, they would be able to draw upon that fund when they retire--a simple proposition. But the singular nature of Social Security and the special regard in which it is held by the public, Mr. President, does not flow from some fleeting sense of nostalgia. Rather, Social Security has provided real help for millions of seniors. 
According to AARP, Social Security keeps 15 million beneficiaries of all ages out of poverty. Today, 13 percent of recipients rely on Social Security for all of their income; 1 in 4 count on it for at least 90 percent of their income; 3 in 5, Mr. President--60 percent--depend on it for at least half of their income. 
For those seniors, and for millions of others, the Social Security contract is very real and a vital necessity, and anything other than partitioning Social Security off from the rest of the budget risks a breach of that public contract, Mr. President. 
Beyond the issue of our moral obligation to such a contract and keeping our promise, there are critical fiscal reasons for making a special distinction in this new constitutional budget structure. 
Most obvious is the enormous temptation Social Security will provide to those who might seek to raid the trust fund to alleviate the deficit. This scenario is not hard to imagine. It is not some kind of a nightmare or a pipe dream. We already do it now. A unified budget masks the true, on-budget deficit. This is not a weakness of one party or one branch of Government. But it is a problem that we need to address, and it is a problem we need to address quickly. If we do not, the Social Security surpluses will be used to distort the true deficit picture, and it will undercut the deficit reduction that needs to be done. In fact, what will happen is we will pretend that we really have a balanced budget. But we will not because we will have used Social Security dollars to make it look in balance. 
So, Mr. President, we have to begin to rid ourselves of the addiction to the Social Security trust fund and to begin to learn how to balance the budget without it if we are to fulfill the promise we made to today's workers that the Social Security benefits would be there for them when they retire; that those benefits will be there for them when they need it. 
Some may argue that current law provides adequate protection for Social Security; or, many say, that, if the balanced budget amendment is ratified, Social Security can and will be protected though passage of implementing legislation. There are several responses to those claims. 
First, let us recall that many of those who make that argument are also the people who maintain that mere statutory mandates are insufficient to move Congress to do what it has to do. The argument, when it comes to the subject of balancing the budget, is that only constitutional authority is sufficient to engender the will necessary to reduce the deficit. 
Let's use the reasoning of these supporters. Using their reasoning, the willpower needed to resist the temptation to raid the Social Security `cookie jar' can presumably only come from a constitutional mandate, or, more specifically, a specific reference in this amendment that protects Social Security. Those who oppose giving extra constitutional protection for Social Security often suggest that there is no practical need for the protection because `Social Security will compete very well * * *' with other programs. 
I heard the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee reassure us time and again during the committee proceedings of this claim that we don't have to worry; that once we pass the balanced budget amendment Social Security is going to do very well; nothing to worry about. 
Mr. President, Social Security should not have to compete with anything. As many have noted, it is a separate program with a dedicated funding source intended to be self-funding. 
In addition, any assessment of the political potency of any particular program is going to have to be reappraised if we ever enter the brave new world of the balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, let us take a look at the current environment to get a clue as to what might happen after the balanced budget amendment is passed, ratified, and implemented. In the current environment, it isn't even Social Security that receives the most 
preferred treatment. In the last 2 years that status, the greatest preferential status, has been reserved for military budgets that receive billions more than the Pentagon even asks for. That higher status has also been reserved not for Social Security but for corporate tax loopholes which were specifically exempted from the new line-item veto authority that many of us supported and sent on to the President last year. 
What is more important, Mr. President, the proposed constitutional amendment imposes a new burden on Social Security that it doesn't even impose on other programs. Not only is Social Security not exempted, or protected, but it has the problem the way this amendment is drafted that other programs don't face. Because outlays cannot exceed receipts in any year, we are effectively barred from drawing on savings built up to fund future outlays. It is the very approach that we have to rely on to fund the expected ballooning of Social Security benefits as generations such as the baby boom generation reach older age. 
Mr. President, the surplus of Social Security revenues produced today contribute to the equivalent of a giant savings account which will have to be used to pay for the expected bulge in beneficiaries when the baby boomers begin to retire. By 2002 the combined Social Security trust fund balance will exceed $1 trillion. By 2010, the balance will exceed $2 trillion. And by the year 2020, Mr. President, that figure will approach $3 trillion. All of this money is intended for and is supposed to be for Social Security benefits. And we are going to need it. But the proposed constitutional amendment would impose a three-fifths majority requirement on that financing structure, and no statutory approach would be able to overcome the problem. It will have been enshrined in the Constitution. 
So, if we want to address the problem, if we want to be able to use that surplus fund to pay for these benefits in the future, it has to be done as part of the constitutional amendment itself. 
So, Mr. President, the bottom line on this proposed constitutional amendment is--that is right--that it does not treat all programs alike. Programs like Social Security which require a buildup of savings into the future somehow have to reach the higher standard and muster a three-fifths majority. But the defense budget, special interest spending done through the Tax Code, and corporate welfare all get a free pass in the brave new world of the balanced budget amendment. 
So, Mr. President, unless this is altered along the lines perhaps of the amendment proposed by the Senator from Nevada, the proposed constitutional amendment will not only enshrine the current practice of using Social Security surpluses to disguise the size of the budget deficit, it will actually make it nearly impossible to use those surpluses for Social Security when we need them. It will turn a bookkeeping gimmick into a $3 trillion heist. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleague to support the Reid amendment and at least give Social Security the same chance every other program has. 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I rise today in support of House Joint Res. 36 to uphold a Presidential finding regarding the provision of international family planning assistance. 
I thank the senior Senator from Vermont for his leadership on this issue. 
Let me just briefly clarify a point with regard to the remarks of the junior Senator from Arkansas, who indicated his belief that this resolution would impact the UNFPA program. My understanding is that the resolution is not related to that program at all, that the resolution in question today has to do with USAID funds. If there is any error in that regard, I would be happy to be corrected, but my understanding is that what we are dealing with here is USAID money. So the arguments concerning funding for UNFPA do not relate to the topic we are discussing today. 
Mr. President, by voting to uphold this resolution, the Senate will express agreement with the President that further delays in the disbursement of funds in the population account will cause undue hardship for the organizations that carry out U.S. international population programs. In fact, President Clinton has said that `a delay will cause serious, irreversible and unavoidable harm' to these programs. 
U.S. assistance to voluntary family planning supports a broad array of products and services for maternal and child health--including family planning education, clinical services, and birth control. These programs have proved enormously effective--not only in improving the health of hundreds of thousands of women and children, but also in reducing the pressures that rapid population growth places on food and water, on housing and education, and on forests and trees in developing countries. 
Perhaps most importantly, studies indicate that international family planning programs can have a tremendous impact on limiting the number of unintended pregnancies throughout the world, which--ultimately--greatly decreases the perceived need or demand for abortions. 
Now let me reiterate this point, because it is extremely important. This vote actually will have the effect of limiting the number of abortions conducted worldwide. 
This vote also is a referendum on how the Senate views family planning. Does the Senate support the provision of family planning services to women and men in the developing world, or does it not? 
I know that several Senators will speak today about the awful consequences that will result if we fail to uphold the Presidential certification. Each one of us will highlight some area of the world, or the provision of some service, that will suffer from a further delay in the disbursement of these funds. 
As the ranking Democrat on the Africa Subcommittee, I would like to focus on Africa, where the United States international family planning program has made a tremendous impact. 
In fiscal year 1996, United States population assistance funds were distributed in 21 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with a combined population of 426 million people. These countries are overwhelmingly poor, yet have among the highest fertility rates in the world. 
The United States population assistance program is one of the most important things that the United States Agency for International Development 
does in Africa. 
As elsewhere, USAID supports a comprehensive program of voluntary family planning and closely related health efforts in several sub-Saharan African countries. It has trained hundreds of nurses and midwives in Uganda. In Mozambique, a country whose entire infrastructure was destroyed by 17 years of civil war, USAID helps deliver family planning and maternal-child health services in four provinces with a combined population of more than 6 million people. And it contributes to the distribution of modern contraceptive products in Zimbabwe, where 42 percent of women are now demanding such products. 
Now what will happen if the resolution that we will vote on tomorrow fails? 
First, many of the nongovernmental organizations that currently administer these programs will be forced to close key activities. To give a compelling example, CARE, an NGO that has 50 years of experience helping poor families, already is considering shutting down its family planning program in Uganda because of the funding restrictions imposed by the United States Congress. After investing some $2 million of USAID funds in this program over 4 years, CARE has trained more than 1,000 community-based health workers, launched family planning services in 71 clinics, and increased the percentage of couples using contraception in the program target area from 1 percent to 10 percent. 
If this resolution fails tomorrow, CARE's network of trained volunteers will no longer be able to serve their communities to educate women and men about family planning and other health care. 
Second, even those programs that do not close their doors will be negatively affected if we delay our support. The distribution of key family planning and health products will be seriously disrupted. 
In Lusaka, the capital of Zambia and a city with one of the highest rates of HIV infection, condom distribution would have to be reduced significantly, greatly increasing the chances of a rapid spread of the HIV virus. 
In Kenya, USAID-funded programs that have spent years teaching women about health and family planning, and have helped create a demand for contraceptive services, may no longer be able to offer birth control pills or other products to the men and women who now depend on them. 
A third consequence of a negative vote tomorrow is that information campaigns on family planning and maternal and child health will also be cut back dramatically. These campaigns have been successful at reaching millions of couples worldwide, helping to educate them about birth spacing, natural family planning and other family planning methods. 
Finally, as one Member of the Senate who is careful about how and where we spend U.S. taxpayer money, I am concerned that a negative vote today will waste thousands--if not millions--of dollars in unnecessary administrative costs that will be incurred if the disbursement of funds for the international family planning program is delayed any further.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, in submitting the Sense of the Senate Resolution directing the Secretary of Agriculture to take action to delink the National Cheese Exchange from the basic formula price established by USDA under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. 
Dairy farmers have been concerned for many years about the role of the National Cheese Exchange, located in Green Bay, WI, in determining the price they receive for their milk. While the exchange has had an indirect influence on milk prices for many years, it also directly affects milk prices through USDA's basic formula price, established by regulation in 1995. For years, Wisconsin farmers have been concerned that the characteristics of the Exchange, outlined in this resolution, make it vulnerable to price manipulation. Those fears were confirmed by a March 1996 report by the University of Wisconsin Department of Agricultural Economics which found evidence supporting the allegations of manipulations. The concerns about manipulation and the influence of the exchange on milk prices nationally, were further heightened by the dramatic and unprecedented decline in cheese prices on the exchange last fall which led to a 26 percent decline in farm milk prices. 
The senior Senator from Wisconsin Senator Kohl and I have been working to address the concerns of the UW report for the last 10 months and have introduced legislation to address the short- and long-term problems associated with the Cheese Exchange. The directive of the resolution introduced by the Senator from Pennsylvania is also included in my bill S. 258, the Milk Price Discovery Improvement Act of 1997 which I introduced last week. My legislation goes beyond the directive in the resolution by seeking additional long term solutions to the lack of price discovery in milk markets and by establishing improved USDA oversight of the National Cheese Exchange. S. 256, introduced by the senior Senator from Wisconsin Senator Kohl, which I have cosponsored, would enhance the role of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in National Cheese Exchange oversight as well. 
The resolution we are introducing today, however, emphasizes the importance of quick action on this problem by the Secretary of Agriculture and I am pleased to welcome the Senator from Pennsylvania to our efforts to resolve this very difficult problem. Farmers have a right to expect that milk prices are determined fairly and without manipulation. The resolution introduced today is a step toward reducing the influence of the exchange on farm-level milk prices. 
I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and to work with us toward the enactment of S. 258 and S. 256 as well. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to use the morning business time to further the debate on the balanced budget amendment and to indicate that I oppose the proposed amendment to our Constitution. 
During the 103d Congress, Mr. President, this body wisely rejected the proposed amendment. It did so again during the 104th Congress, a Congress which, perhaps unlike any other in our recent history, seemed intent on finding different ways to amend the U.S. Constitution, actually voting on more amendments to the Constitution than any of its recent predecessors. 
Mr. President, some of us believe there are many reasons to oppose this constitutional amendment, and we have been hearing a lot of them. A number of respected authorities have raised several significant points of concern, including problems related to the role of the courts and the power it might confer on unelected judges to set our national budget policies and priorities. 
Another serious concern that we have heard a lot about and we will hear even more about is the damage this proposal could do to the Social Security Program. There may also be unintended changes to Presidential impoundment authority arising out of the constitutional amendment. 
I believe that the constitutional amendment, in addition, will lead to unnecessary and possibly dislocating restrictions on our ability to establish capital or investment budgets, to even have the kind of flexibility that States have or municipalities have when they happen to have a balanced budget requirement. 
Finally, Mr. President, I think the balanced budget amendment leads to an effective prohibition on developing a fiscally responsible budget structure that could include a surplus fund, a rainy day fund, a fund that could be tapped for emergencies, such as national disasters or military conflicts. The way it is drafted, we would not be able to plan for or project even a small surplus that could actually be used to solve an emergency. 
Mr. President, during the next several days as we consider the amendment, I, along with many others, will comment on some of those concerns in more detail as we debate amendments designed to address those defects that I have just listed. For now, Mr. President, I want to focus on the underlying assumption behind the proposed amendment, namely that without making this change to our Constitution, the Congress and the President will not balance the budget, that it just will not happen. It is a fair issue, it is a fair question, a fair premise for this whole debate. 
Mr. President, the assumption that that job will not be done by this Congress and this President is not necessarily right. We have brought the unified budget deficit down since 1992 by about 60 percent. Yet, all the rhetoric on the floor has not changed one bit. It has not changed one iota to reflect the fact that real and significant progress has been made in the past 4 years. All of the naysaying about `it can't be done, it will never be done, Congress and the President will never get together and do this,' has at least got to be questioned a little bit by the advocates of the balanced budget amendment when they look at the record of the last 4 years. We have seen several plans offered by both sides that will bring the unified budget into balance by the year 2002. We have seen that from Democrats, we have seen it from Republicans, and we have seen it in a bipartisan package. 
Mr. President, I recall when some of the Republican Members were pushing for a 7-year balanced budget by the year 2002 using CBO numbers, and the President was not sure he wanted to go with that. But, I agreed with the Republicans. I felt they were right, that we needed to have that timeframe and have a clear commitment. I still stand by that. Today we have a President and a Congress in agreement that the date we should be going for is the year 2002. 
In fact, nearly every Member of this body voted for a unified budget plan that reached balance by 2002 at some time during the 
104th Congress, and I really think working together this year, understanding that neither party is running the whole show here, that we can come together in a bipartisan package that will, in fact, finish the good work we have done and balance the budget by the year 2002. 
Mr. President, all the budget plans I mentioned, all the votes we took, all the progress we have made in the past 4 years, was done without a constitutional mandate. In fact, it was done without a constitutional amendment floating out among the States, while we wonder whether the States will ratify it or by when they will ratify it. In fact, Mr. President, I firmly believe that if we had adopted a constitutional amendment in 1993, 1994, or 1995, and sent it to the States for ratification, that many of those balanced budget plans would not have been forthcoming in this Congress, that they would not have even been proposed, because people in both Houses would have been looking to a future date when the hammer would come down, instead of believing that the hammer is coming down now, where we here have been elected to do the job now and not wait for the States to decide whether to ratify a constitutional amendment. 
Mr. President, without the ability to hide behind a lengthy ratification process, Congress in the last few years has been forced to live up to its rhetoric at least in part. A Member cannot go back home and say, `Listen, I am very eager to cut spending in Washington. I don't know exactly what we ought to cut, but once we get that balanced budget amendment ratified, then we will get back to work on it.' That excuse is not available now. People in an audience for such a Senator or Member of Congress would say back to that person, `Why don't you just do the job now? You were elected to do it now.' That is, in fact, what we were elected to do. 
Mr. President, I do not think the American public realizes that even if Congress approves the proposed amendment, it could be another 9 years--9 years--before the balanced budget mandate begins to bite. If the proposal languishes with State legislatures, we might not be forced to reach balance in 2002, but until the year 2006. The States get 7 years to ratify, and the provision calls for the amendment to really take its effect, to have its bite, 2 years after that. So it could be the year 2006 if we wait for a constitutional amendment. 
Mr. President, there is strong reason to believe the States will not act quickly. We have already heard some loud second thoughts from many State policymakers about the impact of the proposed amendment on their State and local budgets. This proposal may not, in effect, Mr. President, then be the so-called slam-dunk ratification that some people claim it will be. 
Ironically, some who voiced their support for a constitutional amendment may not really care. I do not think this is true of everyone, by any means. Some do care. Some are genuinely frustrated and turn only to this constitutional amendment alternative as a last resort. I can think of a great example, the previous Senator from Illinois, Senator Simon, who I know only turned to this alternative, I am sure, out of sheer frustration with the process. He turned to that alternative prior to the progress we made in 1992 through 1996. 
I am afraid for others who pushed this amendment, the agenda is not so much a balanced budget but some political advantage. During the debate, we will have an opportunity to see who really wants to reduce the deficit and who is a little more interested in political posturing. I am going to offer an amendment, for example, that would reduce the time for ratification from 7 years to 3 years to prevent unnecessary delay by the States and ensuring Congress does not hide behind a protracted ratification process during which Members could say, `Well, we are going to get to this balancing of the budget later, after the States get done doing their job.' 
Mr. President, if this amendment is more than just a political exercise, my proposal, my modification of going from 7 years to 3 years for ratification should sail through the U.S. Senate. 
I have to say I have some doubts about it because the proposed amendment to our Constitution is, at its core, really political. We should not be shocked by that. Congress, by its nature, is a political beast. What is disturbing, though, is the growing willingness on the part of some to place in jeopardy our Constitution in this manner to get some momentary political advantage. 
Sadly, using our Constitution as a political foil is becoming increasingly popular. The so-called balanced budget amendment is only one of many proposed changes to our Constitution. During the last Congress alone, over 130 changes were proposed to the U.S. Constitution. Many of them, I am afraid, were offered for political ends. Many of them are entirely unnecessary. In fact, I say virtually all of them are entirely unnecessary to solve the problems at which they are directed. 
One of them, an amendment to require a supermajority to raise taxes, was brought to the other body's floor solely because it was tax day, April 15, so the proponents could stand up on tax day and make some speeches about it. I am troubled by that use of the constitutional amendment process. The thought that an amendment to our Constitution could be offered because it presents the opportunity for a really timely sound bite is indefensible. Many of the advocates of a balanced budget amendment may be sincere in their support for the proposal, but their sincerity does not address the practical problems with the amendment with a fundamental flaw underlying a constitutional approach. 
The Constitution, Mr. President, will not solve our budget problems. That says it all. The Constitution cannot solve our year-to-year and day-to-day budgeting problems. It will not give us the courage or the answers we need to balance our books. 
As President Clinton said in his State of the Union Address, all that is needed to balance the budget is our vote and his signature. The President's budget is a good starting place. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Budget Committee to build on the President's budget and move beyond to reach balance, without using the Social Security surplus. We don't have to amend the Constitution to do that. 
As I noted on the Senate floor last year, for over 200 years, the Constitution has served this Nation very, very well. It is essential to the continuing development of our young Nation that the Constitution remains a statement of general principles, not a budgeting document. 
In charting a different course, one which allows the Constitution to serve as a method of addressing each difficult challenge we face in this Nation, inevitably, Mr. President, we will sacrifice the integrity of the most fundamental document of our Nation. This process will sacrifice the integrity of our Constitution. 
We must guard against the U.S. Constitution becoming what James Madison feared would be, in his words, `little more than a list of special provisos.' 
Mr. President, the Constitution remains the cornerstone of our freedom. Its power is its brilliant simplicity. The spate of constitutional amendments offered over the past few years are at odds with the fundamental notion that our Constitution establishes the framework or great outlines of our society. By seeking to use that document to address specific problems, no matter how severe, the Constitution will become something much less than it was intended to be and that it has been. 
Although our Nation faces many problems--and I think the issue of balancing the budget may be our most important problem--no problem can really be attributed purely to a constitutional deficiency. We should quell our desire to amend this great document and, instead, address the problems that confront this Nation. 
Mr. President, I suggest, after the process of the balanced budget amendment debate is over, that we get, as fast as we can, to the real work of balancing the budget and leave the Constitution alone. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. I, too, am pleased to rise in support of the legislation introduced by the Senator from Minnesota, and also by my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl. 
I was prepared to give a longer speech but I am informed that the mother-in-law of the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, has passed away, and he is not able to be here today because of that. For that reason, I simply associate my remarks with the Senator from Minnesota, and the senior Senator from Wisconsin so we can take this debate up on another day when Senator Leahy is able to respond. He is very able to respond himself. We have a strong disagreement on this issue, but I am a great friend of his and I believe he is a fine Senator and prefer at this point to wait. 
Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation introduced by the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Grams, to repeal the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The Northeast Dairy Compact was included in the 1996 farm bill during conference negotiations after it had been struck from the Senate version of the farm bill during floor consideration of the farm bill early last year. 
Mr. President, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact establishes a commission for six Northeastern States--Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut--empowered to set minimum prices for fluid milk above those established under Federal Milk Marketing Orders. Ironically, the Federal milk marketing order system already provides farmers in the designated compact region with minimum milk prices higher than those received by most other dairy farmers throughout the nation. The compact not only allows the six States to set artificially high fluid milk prices for their producers, it also allows those States to keep out lower priced milk from producers in competing States and provides processors within the region with a subsidy to export their higher priced milk to noncompact States. 
Mr. President, the arguments against this type of price-fixing scheme are numerous: It interferes with interstate commerce by erecting barriers around one region of the Nation; It provides preferential price treatment for farmers in the Northeast at the expense of farmers nationally; It encourages excess milk production in one region without establishing effective supply control which may drive down milk prices for producers throughout the country; It imposes higher costs on the millions of consumers in the Compact region; It imposes higher costs to taxpayers who pay for nutrition programs such as food stamps and the national school lunch programs which provide for milk and other dairy products in their programs; and as a price-fixing compact it is unprecedented in the history of this Nation. 
Most important to my home State of Wisconsin, Mr. President, is that the Northeast Dairy Compact exacerbates the inequities within the Federal milk marketing orders system that already discriminates against dairy farmers in Wisconsin and throughout the upper Midwest. Federal orders provide higher fluid milk prices to producers the further they are located from Eau Claire, WI, for markets east of the Rocky Mountains. 
Wisconsin farmers have complained for many years that this inherently discriminatory system provides other regions, such as the Northeast, the Southeast, and the Southwest with milk prices that encourage excess production in those regions. Of course, that excess production drives down prices throughout the Nation and results in excessive production of cheese, butter, and dry milk. Cheese and other manufactured dairy products constitute the pillar of our dairy industry in Wisconsin. Competition for the production and sale of these products by other regions spurred on by artificial incentives under milk marketing orders has eroded our markets for cheese and other products. 
Mr. President, my State of Wisconsin loses more than 1,000 dairy farms per year either through bankruptcy or attrition. The number of manufacturing plants has declined from 400 in 1985 to less than 230 in 1996. These losses are due in part, to the systematic discrimination and market distortions created by Federal dairy policies that provide artificial regional advantages that cannot be justified on any rational economic grounds. 
Mr. President, my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Grams and I are on the floor today offering this legislation because the Northeast Dairy Compact reinforces the discrimination that has so damaged the dairy industry in our States. We have fought to change Federal milk marketing orders and we will fight to prevent the Northeast Dairy Compact from ever going into effect. 
Less damaging but more insulting to Wisconsin dairy farmers than the increase in regional inequities is the inherent assumption of the compact proponents that either the financial distress of Northeast dairy farmers is worse than that experienced by farmers in other regions or that farmers in the Northeast are more important than farmers elsewhere. Either assumption is ludicrous. 
As all Senators are aware, when milk prices plummet, as they did last fall by 26 percent in 3 months, the financial pain is felt by farmers throughout the Nation, no worse and no less by any particular region. 
And yet the Northeast Compact provides price protection for dairy farmers in six States, insulating them from market conditions which noncompact farmers must confront and to which they must adjust. Compact proponents have never been able to explain how conditions in the Northeast merit greater protection from market price fluctuations than other regions of the country. The fact that there are no compelling arguments made in favor of the compact that justified special treatment for the Northeast was emphasized by a vote in the full Senate to strike the compact from the 1996 farm bill. It was the only recorded vote on approval or disapproval of the Northeast Dairy Compact--and it killed the compact in the Senate. The way in which the compact was ultimately included in the 1996 farm bill also illustrates the weak justification and the lack of support for its approval. It was never included in a House version of the farm bill and yet emerged as part of the bill after a closed door Conference negotiation. Legislation which is difficult to defend must frequently be negotiated behind closed doors rather than in the light of day. 
The 1996 farm bill provided authority to approve the compact to the Secretary of Agriculture if he found a compelling public interest for the compact in the Northeast. Congress, still unwilling to accept responsibility for what I believe to be an unjustifiable compact, delegated their authority to the Secretary. The Secretary approved the compact last August but even he, with his teams of economists and marketing specialists, was unable to come up with an economic justification for the compact. The Secretary's finding of `compelling public interest' justifying his approval of the compact was so weak and unsupported by the public record that a suit was filed by compact opponents in Federal court charging that the Secretary violated the Administrative Procedures Act. Last December, a Federal District Court judge found that, in fact, the plaintiffs in that suit were likely to prevail on their claim that the Secretary's decision was arbitrary and capricious. More recently, the same Federal judge told USDA to review the public record and determine whether in fact that compact should have been approved. 
Mr. President, the Northeast Dairy compact can't be justified because it is just plain bad policy. It is bad public policy because it increases costs to taxpayers nationally and consumers in the Northeast to benefit few. It is bad dairy policy because it exacerbates regional discrimination of existing Federal milk marketing orders by providing artificial advantages to a small group of producers at the expense of all others. And it is bad economic policy because it establishes barriers to interstate trade--barriers of the type the United States has been working hard to eliminate in international markets. 
Mr. President, Congress should never have provided Secretary Glickman with authority to approve the compact. That in my view, was an improper and potentially unconstitutional delegation of our authority and it was irresponsible. It is the role of Congress to approve interstate compacts and we irresponsibly abrogated our responsibility in this matter. It is time to make it right. 
I hope the Secretary rescinds his earlier decision to approve the compact in the additional time the courts have provided him. If he does not, I hope the courts strike down the compact both on the grounds that it violated the APA and on constitutional grounds. However, in any event, it is incumbent upon Congress to undo the mistake it made in the 1996 farm bill. Congress can and should act independently of both the administrative and judicial process to repeal the Northeast Interstate Dairy compact. As the other branches of Government are doing their jobs, we must continue to do ours. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to address an important and timely issue for the citizens of my State of Wisconsin, and for others all over our Nation--the issue of job piracy. 
Last month, officials in the State of Michigan announced a new initiative designed to lure businesses from other States into their own borders. Businesses are provided a tempting incentive to relocate there, tax-free status for 15 years, if they relocate to select regions of the State. The communications director for the Michigan Jobs Commission, Jim Tobin, was quoted in the Wisconsin State Journal as saying that the new so-called renaissance zones program `will aggressively pursue Wisconsin companies for relocation into Michigan.' Presumably, other States bordering Michigan will be targeted as well. 
I was extremely disappointed to hear that my neighboring State had chosen to blatantly target Wisconsin jobs, rather than focusing its energies on creating new jobs for its residents. In my opinion, economic development ought not be thought of as a zero-sum game. We live in an era of increasing economic interdependence, and responsible elected officials should be focusing on regional and national solutions to the crises in our States' most economically distressed areas, not on raiding each others' jobs. 
Upon hearing of the new Michigan initiative, my colleagues Senator Kohl and Congressman Tom Barrett and I requested investigations from several Federal agencies in order to ascertain whether and to what degree Federal funds are being used to finance the renaissance zones initiative. We feel strongly that our constituents' tax dollars should not have to help finance the efforts of those across State lines who attempt to steal their jobs. 
Fortunately, most Federal economic development grant programs, such as those funded by the Small Business Administration and the Economic Development Administration, currently include antipiracy language. However, this important anti-piracy provision is conspicuously absent in the Community Development Block Grant [CDBG] Program and several other small programs administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Developmen [HUD]. 
Today, Senator Kohl and I are introducing the Prohibition of Incentives for Relocation Act of 1997, a bill we have introduced previously, in both the 103d and 104th Congresses. It would simply make the CDBG, HUD special purpose grants, and HUD economic development grants consistent with other domestic economic development grant programs, by prohibiting HUD funds from being used for activities that are intended, or likely to facilitate, the closing of an industrial or commercial plant, or the substantial reduction of operations of a plant; and result in the relocation or expansion of a plant from one area to another area. Identical legislation is being introduced in the House by Representative Barrett and Representative Kleczka. 
We became aware of this problem in the way the CDBG language is currently drafted several years ago. In 1994, Briggs and Stratton, one of Wisconsin's major employers, announced that its Milwaukee plant would be closing. As a result, over 2,000 jobs at the plant were lost. The total economic impact on the community was even worse: For every four Briggs jobs lost, an estimated one additional job from a supplier or other business that relied on Briggs was lost. 
At the same time as the Milwaukee closing, Briggs and Stratton expanded two of its plants in other States. I do not dispute its right to do so. But what I find objectionable, Mr. President, is that Federal dollars, CDBG funds, were used to facilitate the transfer of these jobs from one State to another. This was, in my opinion, a completely inappropriate use of Federal funds. The Community Development Block Grant Program is designed to expand employment opportunities and economic growth, not simply move jobs from one community to another. There is no way to justify to my constituents that they are sending their tax dollars to Washington to be distributed to other States in order to attract jobs out of our State, leaving behind communities whose economic stability has been destroyed.

 Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I introduce the Milk Price Discovery Improvement Act of 1997 with my senior Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl]. Mr. President, this bill addresses longstanding farmer concerns that milk prices can be manipulated by those with the incentive and ability to do so. Those concerns were validated by a March 1996 University of Wisconsin study funded by the Department of Agriculture which concluded that the National Cheese Exchange, a cash market for cheese located in Green Bay, WI, directly and indirectly influences farm milk prices and is highly vulnerable to price manipulation by its major traders. 
Concern about trader concentration and price manipulation is not exclusive to the dairy industry, Mr. President. Two weeks ago, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, introduced the Cattle Industry Improvement Act which addressed concerns about growing concentration in the livestock industry and the lack of market information available to livestock producers. Less than 2 percent of the cattle in the U.S. are sold on markets with open and competitive bidding and the top four packing firms in this country slaughter 80 percent of all cattle. 
The unfortunate trend of increasing concentration throughout agriculture and the growing scarcity of reliable market information has placed farmers at an extreme disadvantage compared to powerful corporate traders. Mr. President, I was pleased to cosponsor the Cattle Industry Improvement Act, which seeks to prevent noncompetitive practices in the livestock industry and improve market information because I believe this trend must be stopped. 
The bill I am introducing today addresses these same alarming trends in the dairy industry and seeks to prevent manipulation of farm-level milk prices. Dairy farmers must not be held captive to a market that cannot be relied upon to provide accurate information about the value of the milk they produce. Unfortunately, farm milk prices are currently determined by such a market--the National Cheese Exchange. 
The National Cheese Exchange is the only cash market in the United States for the sale of bulk cheese. Located in Green Bay, WI, the Exchange trades cheese each Friday for half an hour. Between 1988 and 1993, only 1 percent of all bulk cheese sold nationally was traded on the NCE. During this 5-year period, eight buyers and sellers dominated much of the exchange trading, despite exchange membership of 30 to 40 companies. The top seller on the exchange accounted for 75 percent of all sales during this period. 
Thus, the exchange is not only thin with respect to the volume of cheese bought and sold, it is also thinly traded with the same small number of large firms dominating the trading activity. The opinion price on the National Cheese Exchange, and other markets with these characteristics, is easily influenced by one trade. In addition, unlike other cash markets which trade more frequently, when the price changes at the National Cheese Exchange it stays at that level until one week later at the next trading session. This infrequency of trading lends greater significance to any trading activity which alters the price of cheese. 
The existence of such a market on its own would not be a problem if it did not affect dairy farmers and others off the exchange. Unfortunately, the opinion price of the National Cheese Exchange directly and decisively affects the price that farmers throughout the Nation receive for their milk. A 1-cent change in the opinion price at the exchange generally translates into a 10-cent change in the price of milk to farmers. When prices on the exchange drop suddenly and precipitously, dairy farmers nationally lose millions of dollars in producer receipts. In the last 3 months of 1996, cheese prices on the National Cheese Exchange fell by more than 50 cents per pound, with an unprecedented price plunge of 21 cents in one trading session. As a result, as many of my colleagues are aware, milk prices fell by more than $4 per hundredweight--a 26-percent decline in income. In Wisconsin alone, this price decline has cost dairy farmers more than $165 million in lost income. 
The price decline has been extremely painful for dairy farmers still struggling with high feed bills but what has made the pain more difficult to bear is the general belief held by many dairy economists that the price fell too far too fast and could not be justified based on prevailing market conditions. Whether the price declined so drastically simply because the National Cheese Exchange is a poor indicator of market conditions or because traders intentionally drove the price down is irrelevant. The perception of farmers that the exchange price was manipulated warrants its retirement as the mover of milk prices in this country. The reality that the exchange clearly overreacted to market conditions with record-setting price declines necessitates it. 
The National Cheese Exchange has such a dramatic effect on milk prices for two reasons. First, milk prices are tied directly to the exchange opinion price through the basic formula price [BFP], calculated by USDA. The BFP determines the class III price for milk regulated under the Federal milk marketing order system. Second, even if the formal linkage did not exist, milk prices would still be dramatically affected by the exchange opinion because it is used as the benchmark in virtually all forward contracts for bulk cheese; 90 to 95 percent of bulk cheese in the United States is sold through forward contracts. In other words, virtually all cheese sold in the country is priced based on the opinion price at the Cheese Exchange. That is, at least in part, due to the lack of any alternative market information on the value of cheese. 
The combination of thin nature of the National Cheese Exchange and its influence on milk prices nationally, creates a situation in which there is both the opportunity and the incentive for price manipulation. Anyone buying or selling cheese on the National Cheese Exchange may be able to affect the price of milk throughout the country. The extensive report issued by the University of Wisconsin last year concluded that the trading patterns on the NCE suggest that lead traders use the NCE to influence exchange prices with the intent of affecting milk and cheese prices nationwide. 
Unfortunately, no viable alternative to the National Cheese Exchange currently exists for cheese price discovery. While there is a futures market for cheese and other dairy products, trading of futures contracts have been weak making the futures prices unreliable benchmarks. Furthermore, there is little or no market information on prices for off-exchange spot transactions of cheese collected by the Department of Agriculture. Secretary of Agriculture 
Dan Glickman recently announced a new cheese price series that should improve market information for off-exchange transactions. However, such information may not be adequate to supplant the role of the National Cheese Exchange. Of even greater concern is that despite its influence over milk prices nationwide and its vulnerability to manipulation, the exchange is not regulated by any State or Federal entity. 
Mr. President, farmers throughout the country are frustrated by a pricing system that can no longer guarantee that milk prices are determined competitively and without manipulation and that they believe led to the severe and unwarranted price decline last fall. They have rightfully demanded that we change the way milk prices are set by U.S. Department of Agriculture to reduce the influence of the exchange on farm-level prices. In addition, farmers have called for increased regulation of the exchange to prohibit manipulation of milk and cheese prices. 
Mr. President, that is my goal in introducing this legislation today. Farmers must not be held hostage to this market any longer. First, my legislation directs USDA to break the direct link between the basic formula price and the National Cheese Exchange. Second, it requires USDA to develop alternative sources of cheese market information so that buyers and sellers of cheese need no longer rely on the exchange as a reference price for forward contracts. Finally, my legislation will provide USDA with clear authority to prohibit noncompetitive practices on any cash market that affects the price of milk regulated under Federal milk marketing orders, including the National Cheese Exchange. By law, USDA has been charged with ensuring orderly conditions for the marketing of milk. The agency cannot meet that charge without greater authority to oversee the National Cheese Exchange and prevent those who benefit from low milk prices from driving them down. Ultimately, the solution to these problems lies in the creation of a reliable price discovery system for milk and dairy products that the dairy industry can rely on. But it will take time to develop those alternatives, and it will take time for the dairy industry to come to rely on them. Until we reach that goal, it is absolutely critical that USDA prohibit noncompetitive activities on the National Cheese Exchange. 
Mr. President, I am also pleased to be a cosponsor of the National Cheese Exchange Oversight and Improvement Act introduced by my senior Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl. This bill provides the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC] with day-to-day regulatory jurisdiction over the activities of the National Cheese Exchange. While the CFTC has some limited jurisdiction over the exchange, they do not have the authority to impose trading rules on the exchange. The new authority provided in our respective bills for USDA and CFTC to oversee the exchange should ensure farmers that until the functions of the exchange can be replaced by alternative price discovery mechanisms, we will do all we can to prevent manipulation of farm milk prices. 
Mr. President, I believe the combination of the provisions of the Milk Price Discovery Improvement Act and the National Cheese Exchange Oversight and Improvement Act will go far toward resolving some of the problems that have led to the recent milk price plunge that has cost this country's family farmers so dearly. This legislation, if passed, may also help restore the confidence of dairy farmers in our milk pricing system. 
Mr. President, there are varied and complicated reasons that the trend in American agriculture is toward fewer and larger farms and toward greater concentration in processing and manufacturing. However, I believe that Federal policies that provide competitive advantages to larger farms and subtly discriminate against smaller farmers are among them. Sanctioning pricing mechanisms, like the National Cheese Exchange, that provide unequal market power and information, and relying on them to set prices, is one such policy. Small dairy farmers are less able to withstand the lost income resulting from volatile prices caused by the National Cheese Exchange. Small cheese processors and manufacturers that dot Wisconsin's countryside also suffer from price volatility and manipulation on the exchange yet lack the ability to counteract the power of other traders. We can restore a degree of market equality by improving price discovery and by preventing those with the power to manipulate prices from doing so. That is the goal of the Milk Price Discovery Act of 1997. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, when then-Representative Paul Tsongas of Lowell, MA, was running for the U.S. Senate in 1978, a newspaper columnist referred to him rather dismissively as `an obscure first-term Congressman.' Candidate Tsongas responded quickly to correct the error, saying, `I'm an obscure second-term Congressman.' 
That was Paul Tsongas, meticulous with the facts, parrying an attack with laughter, and always keeping on course to his goal. 
Mr. President, Paul Tsongas embodied the best qualities of a public servant. Uppermost in his mind was the responsibility to make his community, his district, his State, his Nation, his world a better place than he found it. Part of that responsibility was to speak plainly the truth as he saw it, even when speaking the truth might undermine his own ambitions. 
During the 1992 Presidential campaign, for example, Senator Tsongas insisted on warning the American people, over and over, about the looming threat posed by our national deficit. He refused to embrace tax cuts, instead insisting that fiscal responsibility and prudent policy were the keys to bringing the Federal budget back into balance. 
Because we shared a commitment to deficit reduction, Senator Tsongas came to Wisconsin in 1992 to campaign for me in my Senate race. Deficit reduction was the centerpiece of my campaign effort, and, like Senator Tsongas, I took the position that massive new tax cuts would undermine our efforts to reach a balanced budget. It was heartening to me to have Senator Tsongas' support and encouragement. 
His principles of fiscal responsibility and prudent policymaking led Senator Tsongas, after ending his quest for the Presidency, to join with another former Senator, Republican Warren Rudman, to form the Concord Coalition, an organization that has become one of the leading voices for deficit reduction. 
While I did not have the opportunity to serve with Senator Tsongas, our philosophies often crossed paths. I have been proud to have had the support of the Concord Coalition on various deficit-reduction efforts, and I have been inspired by Senator Tsongas' vision, energy, courage, and dedication, both on this issue and in the practice of public policymaking generally. 
Mr. President, I had only recently begun my own career in public service when Paul Tsongas announced he would not run for re-election in 1984, because he had been diagnosed with non-Hodgin's lymphoma. He wanted, he said, to spend more time with his family. 
He endured bone-marrow transplants, a treatment that was experimental at the time, and he eventually came back, first to chair the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education, then to run for President and then to cofound the Concord Coalition. 
Even as he was working in the highest circles of American politics, he always kept close contact with his beloved hometown of Lowell, where he served on the city council in the late 1960's and where he is recognized as one of the community leaders who help revive that former mill town. 
Mr. President, in April 1963, Paul Tsongas was serving in the Peace Corps in Ethiopia, and he wrote then-Atty. Gen. Robert Kennedy, asking for help in securing a party worker's job in the upcoming national elections. In that letter, the 22-year-old Tsongas told Kennedy, `I feel confident that I have the raw material to become a successful public servant.' 
A typical understatement from Paul Tsongas, Mr. President. He will be missed. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] in introducing this legislation to repeal the Communications Decency Act [CDA]. I believe Congress made a grave mistake in enacting the CDA and it is time to correct it. 
Congress passed the CDA without taking the time to fully examine its ability to protest children and its effect on the free speech rights of Americans. As a result, the CDA has been the subject of a court challenge since the day it was signed into law. Last June, a three-judge Federal panel granted a preliminary injunction against the Federal enforcement of key provisions of the CDA finding them unconstitutional. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the first amendment challenge to the CDA on March 19, 1997. 
The Communications Decency Act, enacted as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, subjected anyone who transmitted indecent material to minors over the Internet to criminal sanctions. The commonly accepted definition of `indecency' includes mild profanity. 
I strongly opposed the CDA not only because I believe it violates our constitutionally guaranteed right to free speech, but also because I feel strongly that it fails to truly protect children from those who might seek to harm them. 
The fundamental error of CDA proponents was their attempt to apply decades-old broadcasting standards to an emerging technology that defies categorization--the Internet. While the Supreme Court has allowed speech restrictions for broadcast media, it has made clear that such restrictions do not violate the first amendment only if there is a compelling Government interest in restricting speech and the restriction is applied in the least restrictive means. It is predominantly the nature of the medium which determines whether or not a criminal prohibition on speech is the least restrictive means of meeting a compelling Government interest. in the case of a radio or television, the fact that a child might simply turn on a station and hear offensive material provides a basis for allowing an arguably tighter restriction on indecent speech. Restraints upon newspapers and other print media, which are inherently noninvasive, have been very limited. 
While the Net bears some similarities to both media, it is a unique and ever-changing communications medium. One can be a speaker, a publisher and a listener using the Internet. Currently, anyone with the know-how and the proper hardware and software can set up a Web page, become a de facto publisher, making information available to others at little cost to oneself or the consumer of that information. One can also post a message to an Internet newsgroup, an informal and often unmoderated information sharing forum, which can then be ready by anyone accessing that newsgroup. 
The promise of the Internet is its free flow of information across vast physical distances and boundaries to anyone with access to a computer and an Internet connection. The threat of the Communications Decency Act is its undeniable ability to stifle this free-flowing speech on the Net. Mr. President, 
that threat exists because Congress failed to recognize the danger of applying an overly broad indecency standard to a technology with the characteristics of the Internet. 
Out of fear of prosecution, the vagueness of the indecency standard, and an inability to control the age of those who might ultimately see the information, speakers on the Net will become silent. Those offering commercial access to the Internet will be required to restrict access to speech in order to protect themselves from criminal prosecution. 
Last year, a panel of three Federal judges came to the same conclusion: this statute cannot be enforced without violating the Constitution. The Court stated: 
. . . the Internet may fairly be regarded as a never-ending worldwide conversation. The Government may not, through the CDA, interrupt that conversation. As the most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet deserves the highest protection from government intrusion. 
I believe the Federal Court came to this conclusion because the judges took the time to study and understand the characteristics of the Net before rushing to judgement--something Congress failed to do. 
It is time to undo that mistake by repealing the Communications Decency Act. Not only does the CDA infringe on free speech rights of adults, it does not protect children from those who seek to harm them using the Internet, and it may actually impede the development of more sophisticated screening software in the marketplace. When Congress passed the CDA, there already existed filtering software which gave parents the ability to filter out objectionable content such as indecency, violence, adult topics etc. The passage of the CDA necessarily will reduce demand for such software products, which are effective in preventing children's access to such content. The CDA merely provides parents with a false sense of security that the Federal Government will somehow protect their children, so they no longer have to worry about the Internet themselves. 
And that is the irony, Mr. President. The CDA is simply not capable of protecting children on the Internet. Much Internet content originates on foreign soil, making effective enforcement of the CDA impossible. Furthermore, the dissemination of materials which we all agree are most harmful to children--obscenity and child pornography--is already illegal on the Internet and subject to hefty criminal sanctions. We should put our law enforcement resources into aggressively prosecuting these criminal violations and recognize that the Internet is merely another tool used by those seeking to harm our children. We must prosecute the crime, not demonize the medium used by the criminal. 
Mr. President, it is time to repeal the Communications Decency Act--an unconstitutional statute that fails to protect children. We owe that to all Americans and most important, we owe it to this country's children.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Mike Cannell, a dairy farmer and sustainable agriculture advocate from Cazenovia, WI who perished in a farming accident on December 2, 1996 while helping a neighbor unload corn. Mike died the same way he lived--helping others. 
While those of us fortunate enough to have known Mike will miss him terribly, he has left us a great gift: his tireless work toward restoring and sustaining an agricultural community of healthy and economically viable family farms. His support of sustainable agriculture reflected his approach to life: balance. Sustainable agriculture is an integrated system of production that provides an adequate supply of food and fiber in a manner that enhances environmental quality, makes efficient use of limited natural resources, sustains small and medium sized farms and improves the quality of life for farmers and the community. It is an agricultural system that balances the many needs of our people and our planet. 
Mike not only recognized the economic importance and the environmental benefits of a large number of small scale family farms, he recognized the ability of successfully owning and operating one's own farm to instill a sense of pride, accomplishment and satisfaction in the farmer-owner. In Mike's view, these things were at least as important as the many economic and environmental reasons to sustain small farms. In all things, especially farming, he sought balance. 
I first met Mike Cannell when I was a State senator. He, along with other dairy farmers, met with me to express concern about the development of a new dairy technology that he felt was ill-timed, unnecessary and irresponsible. That technology was Bovine Growth Hormone, a product which when injected in cows results in greater milk production. The arguments made against BGH were many: increased milk production necessarily lowers milk prices; the technology will favor large farms over smaller ones; small farms will be driven out of business; there may be indirect but harmful environmental impacts, and many more. 
But Mike's objections to BGH ran deeper. He did not believe in technology for technology's sake. He felt scientists and society's leaders were obligated to consider and recognize cultural traditions and predominant value systems of the community for which they were developing new technology. To him, the economic benefits of technology had to be weighed against the real or perceived ramifications on society. Mike didn't believe that the universities and private sector firms developing BGH had done that. He predicted the outrage that introduction of the product caused among dairy farmers and consumers in Wisconsin. To this day, many dairy products in Wisconsin are labeled as free of BGH in part, due to Mike's efforts. As usual, Mike's balanced approach was right on target. 
Mike, however, did not reject new technology on its face and in fact, embraced and doggedly promoted technologies and new practices that advanced his goal of a sustainable agricultural community consisting of small and medium sized family farms. 
Mike's approach to dairy farming was unique when he began milking cows 15 years ago. 
He was an intensive rotational grazier--a practice that many said couldn't work in Wisconsin because of our harsh winter climate. Unlike confinement dairying, rotational grazing requires fewer chemical inputs, less labor, less capital and is environmentally beneficial as well. Mike, however, viewed grazing in a broader context. Grazing was not only an environmentally friendly method of producing quality milk at reduced cost, it was also capable of supporting a family and providing a high quality of life. Mike chose to become a dairyman because of the value he place on these last two criteria. Mike, when speaking about grazing, put it in this context: `This is the real reason we live: for our families and for our communities. Any practice that promises to make us better farmers, in part, I evaluate by how much it contributes to our families and communities.' For technology to be appropriate it had to be appropriate for the farm and the community surrounding it. Again, this was Mike's balance. He supported technology and practices that promoted the goals he believed to be most important. 
Mike Cannell was an innovative leader among Wisconsin farmers, resolutely seeking solutions to the complex problems facing our dairy industry. To many farmers in Wisconsin, those problems appear insurmountable; so complicated, multifarious, and seemingly incomprehensible that one person couldn't possibly make a dent in them. Mike not only believed he could make a difference, he believed he had an obligation to use his talents to do so. 
Even more remarkable than Mike's willingness to actively intervene in agricultural problems, was Mike's concept of a solution: one which was not only achievable and effective but which was also socially and morally responsible. In a manner more effective than few others I've known, Mike was able to articulate the problems and identify solutions. He was not shy at criticizing entities he felt were standing in the way of a sustainable family farm sector. But he always went beyond criticism to suggest solutions and to actively work with the entities--including universities, local, State and Federal Government--he was criticizing to eliminate the barriers facing family farms. 
But Mike went still further. Rather than rely on others to solve all the dilemmas facing family farmers, he believed farmers also had both the ability and responsibility to help each other. And he put that into practice too. 
Mike Cannell believed so strongly in the ability of rotational grazing to reverse the dramatic losses of Wisconsin family dairy farmers in the past decade that he spent the last 10 years trying to teach other farmers how to become graziers. He is responsible for starting a grazier technology transfer discussion group on the Internet--known as a List Serve--so that dairymen could share their expertise on grazing. That group now claims more than one thousand members. He was also the founder of both regional and statewide farmer to farmer grazing networks, known as the Ocooch Graziers and Grassworks. Because of Mike Cannell, rotational grazing is no longer considered an unusual dairying practice in Wisconsin. It is fast becoming mainstream. 
Mike also took initiative to solve one of Wisconsin's most challenging farm problems--the retirement of older dairy farmers without younger farmers to replace them. The long hours, hard work, low return and often dim outlook for dairying have dissuaded many young people from entering the dairy industry. Rather than consider this an inevitable outcome, Mike took steps to encourage young people to enter dairying. While his positive attitude might have been enough to persuade young farmers that there was a future in dairy farming, to persuade the cynics he founded the School for Beginning Dairy Farmers to teach young farmers how to be successful in a difficult profession. 
Mike's contributions to the sustainable agriculture community are real and measurable and he will be remembered for them for many years. But Mike will likely be remembered more for his steady and unswerving pursuit of a way of life he loved and from which he gained great joy, his strong belief in the value of that way of life, his efforts to share his success with others, and most important, for his commitment to community and family. In Mike's view, all things in life and agriculture should be conducted with an eye toward how they contribute to community and family. It is a valuable lesson to learn. And it is the world's great loss that Mike Cannell won't be around to teach us anymore. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today the Senate votes to confirm the nomination of Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State. 
As many others will say today, this is a historic occasion, as the secretary-designate will soon become the highest ranking woman ever to serve in the United States Government. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, it was my distinct honor to approve her nomination at the committee level on Monday. And I am honored to vote for her again today on the floor of the Senate. 
Back in the 1980's, I had the pleasure of meeting the distinguished nominee in Wausau, in my home state of Wisconsin, while I was a member of the Wisconsin State Senate. At the time, I was introduced to her as the future Secretary of State. I have since been impressed at how she has excelled--in domestic politics, as well as in foreign policy--to allow her to achieve this great honor, the nomination to be the President's chief foreign policy adviser. 
In more recent days, I have observed her both in private, and at her confirmation hearing before the Foreign Relations Committee on January 8 of this year. And I was again impressed at how articulately and gracefully she responded to questions that literally spanned the globe. 
Upon confirmation, Ambassador Albright will take on a position that, in my view, is one of the most challenging positions in public service. On the one hand, she will have a tremendous opportunity to affect world events because of the leadership role that the United States plays in so many conflicts around the world. But on the other hand, she will have awesome responsibilities. 
Just a quick glance at the range and scope of the various bureaus at the State Department remind us that the job of Secretary of State is far-reaching. Not only will she be in charge of all the regional and administrative bureaus, but she will also be responsible for the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, the Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, the Bureau for International Organization Affairs, Bureau of Oceans and International Scientific Affairs and the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. 
This list underscores the fact that many of the problems that challenge us today are ones that belie traditional ways of looking at the world through regional, or even strictly political, lenses. Increasingly, we are faced with issues that transcend national borders and fly in the face of old political alliances. Concerns over drug trafficking, refugees, disease, and the environment have changed the way we define the national interest. 
Of particular interest to me is the promotion of human rights worldwide. I strongly believe that the United States has a moral responsibility to put human rights at the top of our foreign policy agenda. I also believe that--although we might disagree on the manner in which we should raise human rights concerns with other governments--Ambassador Albright agrees with my basic premise here. In my view, it is incumbent upon U.S. diplomats to incorporate our views about human rights in bilateral discussions on other issues. For example, we have many interests in Indonesia, but we must never forget that its government continues to sustain a brutal military occupation of East Timor. Similarly, concerns over human rights abuses in Tibet and over the impending transition in Hong Kong must be pillars of our many-pronged China policy. 
Ambassador Albright has, in the past, exhibited superior knowledge of human rights issues and of these other transnational problems. And, I hope she will guide the Administration to propose creative solutions to some of these problems. 
Of particular regional concern to me is the African continent, which--too often--is left at the end of the priority lists of policymakers in this country. But Africa--a continent of 48 countries south of the Sahara--supports a population of nearly 620 million people. Its land mass stretches over one quarter of the Earth's surface. 
While we often focus upon areas where crises evolve, as in Liberia or in the Great Lakes region, we also must actively support some of the successes in Africa, such as the stunning transition to majority rule in South Africa, Eritrean independence, or the fact that more than 30 democratic elections have taken place on the continent since 1989. The United States can play an important role in all these events. 
Finally, I wish to note that in addition to Ambassador Albright's many qualifications in the field of foreign policy, she also is especially prepared to work with Members of Congress. She spent nearly 2 years as the chief legislative assistant to Senator Edmund Muskie, who himself went on to be Secretary of State. She understands well the intent of the Constitution regarding the separate responsibilities and prerogatives of the legislative and executive branches of our Government. This is of particular concern to me where the deployment of American men and women to combat is involved. I trust Ambassador Albright will take the advice and consent role of the Senate seriously, and will consult fully with the Congress in all matters of troop deployment. 
Ambassador Albright never shied away from speaking frankly with us and with the American people in her previous capacity as the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations. I look forward to future open and candid dialog with her on all of these issues, and expect to work closely with her. 
Mr. President, the job of Secretary of State is indeed a challenging one. I salute President Clinton for his superb choice, for it is my view that this nominee is more-than-qualified to take on the challenges of the position under consideration. 
I also commend the honorable Senator from North Carolina for expediting the confirmation process. 
In summary, Mr. President, I am honored to cast my vote in favor of the nomination of Madeleine Korbel Albright to be Secretary of State.

Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise today to join with my colleague from Arizona [Mr. McCain] in introducing the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. 
I want to acknowledge the Democratic and Republican Senators who have agreed to join myself and the Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] as original co-sponsors in introducing this historic legislation. Those co-sponsors include the Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson], the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], the Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], the Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey], the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], the Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], the Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], the Senator from Illinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun], the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. Ford], the Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], the Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], the Senator from Georgia [Mr. Cleland], the Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson] and the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin]. 
I think it is clear Mr. President, that the few remaining pillars holding up our crumbling election system finally collapsed. According to the latest figures provided by the Federal Election Commission, congressional candidates spent a total of $742 million in the 1996 elections, a noticeable increase over the 1994 levels despite the absence of a single Senate contest in any of the largest States including California, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania, or Ohio. And that $742 million figure does not even include the record amounts of so-called `soft money' contributions raised and spent by the national political parties in the last election cycle. 
Every campaign year we are hit with these astonishing spending figures and every year we acknowledge that a new record has been set. And just when the spending and abuses seem like they cannot get any worse, they do. Last November, our campaign finance system lurched out of control, filling the headlines and airwaves with charges and countercharges about which candidates and parties were abusing our laws and loopholes the worst. Another cadre of millionaires spent vast sums of personal wealth on their campaigns, 94 percent of House and Senate challengers lost their election bids, and the smallest percentage of Americans went to the ballot box in 72 years. 
Coupled with the continued need to reduce the Federal budget deficit, there may be no more fundamentally important issue than the need to pass meaningful reform of our campaign finance system. 
The bill we are introducing today has several components, but is centered primarily on what I believe are the two cornerstones of reform. The first cornerstone is the creation of a voluntary system that offers qualified candidates an opportunity to participate in the electoral process without being compelled to raise and spend outrageous sums of money. 
This voluntary system merely says to candidates that if you agree to follow a set of ground rules, we will provide you with the tools that will not only reduce the high costs associated with campaigning, but at the same time enhance your ability to sufficiently convey your message to the voters of your State. 
What are those ground rules and benefits, Mr. President. 
First, candidates who elect to voluntarily participate in the system must agree to limit the overall amount of money they spend on their campaigns. This spending cap is based on the voting-age population in each State. For example, in my State of Wisconsin the primary spending limit would be about $1 million while the general election cap would be about $1.5 million. In a larger State such as New York, the primary limit would be about $2.7 million while the general election limit would be about $4 million. 
The second rule candidates must follow is to limit how much of their personal wealth they contribute to their campaigns. Again, this would be based on the size of each State. In Wisconsin, it would be about $150,000 and in no State would it be higher than $250,000. 
Finally, candidates must agree to raise 60 percent of their contributions from individuals within their home States. This rule is grounded in our belief that anyone wishing to receive the benefits of the bill should be able to demonstrate a strong base of support from the people they intend to represent. Moreover, candidates and officeholders will be compelled to focus their campaign and fundraising activities on the people who matter most --the voters back home. 
If candidates elect to participate in the system and follow these simple ground rules, they are entitled to certain benefits. 
The first benefit is a postage discount. Eligible candidates would be given a special postage rate, currently only available to non-profit organizations and political parties, for a number of mailings equal to two times the voting-age population of the candidate's State. 
Second, the bill provides each eligible candidate with up to 30 minutes of free television advertising time from the broadcast stations in the candidate's State and any adjoining States. 
Third, and most importantly, the bill offers eligible candidates a 50-percent discount off of the lowest unit rate for their television advertising 60 days before their general election and 30 days before the primary. Current law merely provides Federal candidates with the lowest unit rate--our bill would cut the costs of television advertising for eligible candidates almost in half. 
That, Mr. President, is the first foundation of meaningful reform, creating a voluntary system--purely voluntary--that provides candidates who agree to limit their campaign spending with the means to convey their ideas and message to the voters and also significantly reduce their campaign costs, therefore reducing the need to raise millions and millions of dollars. 
The second foundation of reform is to ban so-called `soft money,' those contributions to the national parties from corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals that are unlimited and unregulated by federal election law and yet are funneled into federal campaigns around the country. 
It was soft money, Mr. President, that garnered so much outrage in the last election. To illustrate how expansive of a loophole soft money has become, consider how much of this unregulated money the national parties have raised over the last two election cycles in which we had a presidential election. In 1992, the Republican National Committee raised $50 million in soft money while the Democratic National Committee raised $36 million. In 1996, the RNC raised $141 million while the DNC raised $122 million. Overall, soft money contributions to the two parties went from $86 million in 1992 to $263 million in 1996. That is a staggering increase. 
In the wake of the countless media reports documenting this abuse, Americans were left wondering why an individual who is limited to contributing $1,000 to a federal candidate by federal election law is somehow able to contribute $100,000 or $1 million to the Democratic or Republican National Committees. They want to understand why labor unions and corporations, which are prohibited by law from using their treasury funds to make contributions or expenditures to advocate for or against a federal candidate, are able to funnel millions and millions of their treasury dollars directly into the two national parties and indirectly into various House and Senate elections. Clearly, a ban on soft money contributions to the political parties must be a part of a serious reform proposal. 
The Supreme Court has spoken clearly on the constitutionality of limiting campaign contributions from individuals and organizations. They have upheld the statutes barring corporate and labor union direct contributions. They have upheld the statute limiting individuals to contributing $1,000 to federal candidates per election and $20,000 to national parties per year. And yet the soft money loophole has allowed interested parties to blow these limits away, leaving the average citizen who wishes to contribute $25 to their local congressman wondering just how much of a voice they have in the electoral process. 
The McCain-Feingold proposal simply bans all soft money contributions to the national parties. Individuals can still contribute to the national parties, but they will have to abide by the current law $20,000 `hard money' limit. Corporations and labor unions will also be able to contribute to the national parties, but they too will have to follow the `hard money' limits. That means they will have to contribute through their separate segregate funds, also known as PAC's, rather than using their general treasury funds, and their contributions to the national parties will be limited to $15,000 per party committee per year. 
We heard considerable debate in the last election about foreign money--both coming from foreign nationals oversees, which is clearly illegal, and from noncitizens residing in the United States, which is not. This is a problem and we have a new provision in our legislation to address this abuse. But I have always said that the problem is whether anyone should be permitted to contribute $400,000 in our election system, whether it is from Jakarta or Janesville, WI. And the soft money ban in our legislation will prohibit any future such contributions, regardless of their source. 
The legislation includes a new proposal that bars anyone who is not eligible to vote in a federal election from contributing to a federal candidate. This will affect noncitizens, minors under 18 years of age and certain convicted felons. Simply put, if our laws and Constitution do not allow an individual to participate in the political process with their ballot, there is no reason the same individual should be permitted to participate with their checkbook. 
The McCain-Feingold bill includes a number of other important provisions as well. For example, we propose a new definition of what constitutes `express advocacy' in a federal election. `Express advocacy' is the standard used to determine to what extent election activities may be limited and regulated. If a particular activity, such as an independent expenditure, is deemed to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a particular federal candidate, then that activity must be paid for with fully disclosed and limited `hard money' dollars. Labor unions, corporations and other political organizations would have to fund such activities through a PAC, comprised of voluntary, limited and disclosed contributions. 
If on the other hand, an expenditure is used for an activity that does not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a particular candidate, such as a television ad that attempts to raise important issues without advocating a candidate, then that expenditure may be funded with `soft money' dollars--undisclosed and unlimited monies, such as corporation's profits or a labor union's member dues. 
Unquestionably, the largest abuse in recent elections is the use of non-party soft money to fund huge electioneering activities under the guise that there is an absence of express advocacy. Current FEC regulations defining express advocacy are so weak that these organizations are able to channel unlimited resources into activities that are thinly veiled as `voter education' or `issue ads' when in truth they seek to directly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. 
These activities, outside the scope of federal election law, have come to dominate many House and Senate campaigns. And while political parties and outside organizations have poured unlimited resources into these `issue ads,' candidates have found their role in their own elections shockingly diminished. 
If we are to have any control of our election process, we must have a clear standard in the law that defines what sort of activities are an attempt to influence the outcome of a federal election. 
The McCain-Feingold proposal includes a new definition of what constitutes `express advocacy.' Under this proposal, the definition of `express advocacy' will include any general public communication that advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified 
candidate for federal office by using such expressions as `vote for', `support' or `defeat'. Further, any disbursement aggregating $10,000 or more for a communication that is made within 30 days of a primary election or 60 days of a general election shall be considered express advocacy if the communication refers to a clearly identified candidate and a reasonable person would understand it as advocating the election or defeat of that candidate. 
If such a communication is made outside of the 30 day period before the primary election or the 60 day period before the general election, it shall be considered express advocacy if the communication is made with the purpose of advocating the election or defeat of a candidate as shown by one or more factors including a statement or action by the person making the communication, the targeting or placement of the communication, or the use by the person making the communication of polling or other similar data relating to the candidate's campaign or election. 
This will ensure that a much larger proportion of the expenditures made by political parties and independent organizations with the intent to influence the outcome of a federal election will be covered by federal law and subject to the appropriate restrictions and disclosure requirements. 
The McCain-Feingold proposal will also protect candidates who are targeted by independent expenditures. First, the legislation requires groups who fund independent expenditures to immediately disclose those expenditures. The FEC would then be required to transmit a copy of that report to any candidate who has agreed to limit their spending and has been targeted by such an expenditure. This will give candidates advance notice that they have been targeted. The legislation also allows candidates to respond to such expenditures without these `response expenditures' counting against their overall spending limit. This will ensure that targeted candidates are not bound by the spending caps and unable to respond. And finally, the bill tightens statutory language to ensure that independent expenditures made by political parties are truly independent and not coordinated with campaigns in any way. 
The legislation also includes a ban on Political Action Committee [PAC] contributions to federal candidates. In case such a ban is held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, the legislation includes a `back-up' provision that lowers the PAC contribution limit from $5,000 to $1,000 and limits Senate candidates to accepting no more than 20% of the applicable overall spending limit in aggregate PAC contributions. 
The bipartisan bill is further helpful to challengers in that it prohibits Senators from sending out taxpayer-financed, unsolicited franked mass mailings in the calendar year of an election. Often, these mass mailings are thinly disguised `newsletters' that help to bolster an incumbent's name recognition and inform constituents of their accomplishments. Such unsolicited activity by officeholders can be unfair in an election year. 
The final major piece of this reform effort is our enhanced enforcement provisions. There is legitimate criticism that our federal election laws are not adequately enforced, and much of this problem can be directly attributed to Congress' unwillingness to provide adequate funding to what is supposed to be the government's watchdog agency, the Federal Election Commission. Regardless, there are reforms we can pass that will allow the FEC to better enforce the current laws we have on the books as well as the new laws enacted as part of this legislation. 
First and foremost is a provision that will require all federal campaigns to file their disclosure reports with the FEC electronically. Currently, this is optional and the result is a disclosure system that is marginally reliable. We need a disclosure system that is readily accessible to the public and will allow the American people to know where from and to whom the money is flowing. The bill also requires candidates to disclose the name and address of every contributor who gives more than $50 to a candidate. Currently, that threshold is only for contributions over $200 and the result is millions of dollars of undisclosed contributor information. 
Second, we allow the FEC to conduct random audits of campaigns. This will provide a mechanism to make sure candidates are complying with all of the limitations and restrictions in federal election law. 
The bill toughens penalties for `knowing and willful' violations of the law. If such a standard is met, the FEC is permitted to triple the amount of the civil penalty. We must send a message to candidates and campaigns that deliberate attempts to evade the law will be met with serious penalties. 
Mr. President, the support the McCain-Feingold proposal garnered last year was bipartisan and broad based. It was strongly supported by President Clinton, who first endorsed the McCain-Feingold proposal in his State of the Union Address almost one year ago and has recently reaffirmed his strong commitment to the legislation this year. It was endorsed by Ross Perot, Common Cause, Public Citizen, United We Stand America, the American Association of Retired Persons and some 30 other grassroots organizations. It received editorial support from over 60 newspapers nationwide. 
This legislation is also bicameral. Republican Representative Chris Shays, Democratic Representative Marty Meehan and a number of others will soon be introducing a House version of the McCain-Feingold proposal in the 105th Congress. 
Recently, the Wall Street Journal conducted a poll on this issue. They found that 92 percent of the American people believe we spend too much money on political campaigns. This is consistent with numerous other polls that have found similar results. Coupled with the troubling fact that the smallest percentage of Americans went to the ballot box in 72 years, it is clear that the American people want meaningful reform of our electoral process. It is also clear that they want less polarization in the Congress, and for Democrats and Republicans to work together and find effective solutions to our common problems. 
For years, campaign finance reform has stalled because of the inability of the two parties to join together and craft a reform proposal that was fair to both sides. We believed we have bridged those differences, and produced a proposal that calls for mutual disarmament and will lead to fair and competitive elections. 
It is my hope that the distinguished majority leader will recognize how important this issue is to the American people and our democratic system and will allow this legislation to be considered in the coming weeks. I want to thank my friend from Arizona [Mr. McCain] for his dedication to this issue.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, similar to that which I sponsored in the 104th Congress, to terminate funding for little known activities of the Tennessee Valley Authority [TVA], the TVA's nonpower programs, that are funded by appropriated funds. In fiscal year 1997, Congress appropriated a total of $106 million to support these programs. 
The TVA was created in 1933 as a government-owned corporation for the unified development of a river basin comprised of parts of seven States. Those activities included the construction of an extensive power system, for which the region is now famous, and regional development or `nonpower' programs. TVA's responsibilities in the nonpower programs include maintaining its system of dams, reservoirs and navigation facilities, and managing TVA-held lands. In addition, TVA provides recreational programs, makes economic development grants to communities, promotes public use of its land and water resources, and operates an Environmental Research Center. Only the TVA power programs are intended to be self-supporting, by relying on TVA utility customers to foot the bill. The expense of these `nonpower' programs, on the other hand, are covered by appropriated taxpayer funds. 
This legislation terminates funding for all appropriated programs of the TVA after fiscal year 2000. While I understand the role that TVA has played in our history, I also know that we face tremendous Federal budget pressure to reduce spending in many areas. I believe that TVA's discretionary funds should be on the table, and that Congress should act, in accordance with this legislation, to put the TVA appropriated programs on a glide path toward dependence on sources of funds other than appropriated funds. I think that this legislation is a reasonable phased-in approach to achieve this objective, and explicitly codifies both the fiscal year 1996 President's Budget and TVA's own recommendations regarding activities at the TVA's Environmental Research Center in Alabama. 
I am introducing this legislation to terminate TVA'S appropriated programs because there are lingering concerns, brought to light in a 1993 Congressional Budget Office [CBO] report, that nonpower program funds subsidize activities that should be paid for by non-Federal interests. When I ran for the Senate in 1992, I developed an 82+ point plan to eliminate the Federal deficit and have continued to work on the implementation of that plan since that time. That plan includes a number of elements in the natural resource area, including the termination of TVA's appropriations-funded programs. 
In its 1993 report, CBO focused on two programs: The TVA Stewardship Program and the Environmental Research Center. Stewardship activities receive the largest share of TVA's appropriated funds. The funds are used for dam repair and 
maintenance activities. According to 1995 testimony provided by TVA before the House Subcommittee on Energy and Water Appropriations, when TVA repairs a dam it pays 70 percent, on average, of repair costs with appropriated dollars and covers the remaining 30 percent with funds collected from electricity ratepayers. 
This practice of charging a portion of dam repair costs to the taxpayer, CBO highlighted, amounts to a significant subsidy. If TVA were a private utility, and it made modifications to a dam or performed routine dredging, the ratepayers would pay for all of the costs associated with that activity. 
TVA also runs an Environmental Research Center, formerly a Fertilizer Research Center, that received $15 million in funding in fiscal year 1997. The Center formerly developed and tested about 80 percent of commercial fertilizers developed in the United States, which CBO identified as a direct research cost subsidy to fertilizer companies. The measure I am introducing today phases out Federal funding for the Center by the year 2000. 
In fiscal year 1996, I successfully sponsored an amendment to cap funding for the TVA Environmental Research Center. The amendment also required the Center to examine its research program, and evaluate how it could reduce its dependence on appropriated funds. Though the funding cap was eliminated in conference on the fiscal year 1996 Energy and Water Appropriations, TVA did complete an assessment of its research program. The Center proposes to make a complete transition to competing for Federal grants by fiscal year 2000. My measure would codify such a transition. 
I have included specific language on the Environmental Research Center in this legislation because I believe that it is important certain regions do not receive earmarked preference over others in receiving scarce environmental research, natural resource management and economic development dollars from the Federal Government. In this time of tight budgets, I believe that all opportunities to decrease and supplement Federal support for projects and leverage additional private, local and State government funds should be examined and implemented when feasible. 
Again, while I understand the important role that TVA played in the development of the Tennessee Valley, many other areas of the country have become more creative in Federal and State financing arrangements to address regional concerns. Specifically, in those areas where there may be excesses within TVA, I believe we can do better to curb subsidies and eliminate the burden on taxpayers without completely eliminating the TVA, as some in the other body have suggested.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am introducing a measure that I sponsored in the 104th Congress to reduce the amount of Federal irrigation subsidies received by large agribusiness interests. I believe that reforming Federal water pricing policy by reducing subsidies is an important area to examine as a means to achieve our deficit reduction objectives. This legislation is also needed to curb fundamental abuses of reclamation law that cost the taxpayer millions of dollars every year. 
In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt proposed legislation, which came to be known as the Reclamation Act of 1902, to encourage development of family farms throughout the western United States. The idea was to provide needed water for areas that were otherwise dry and give small farms--those no larger than 160 acres--a chance, with a helping hand from the Federal Government, to establish themselves. According to a 1996 General Accounting Office report, since the passage of the Reclamation Act, the Federal Government has spent $21.8 billion to construct 133 water projects in the west which provide water for irrigation. Irrigators, and other project beneficiaries, are required under the law to repay to the Federal Government their allocated share of the costs of constructing these projects. 
However, as a result of the subsidized financing provided by the Federal Government, some of the beneficiaries of Federal water projects repay considerably less than their full share of these costs. According to the 1996 GAO report, irrigators generally receive the largest amount of Federal financial assistance. Since the initiation of the irrigation program in 1902, construction costs associated with irrigation have been repaid without interest. The GAO further found, in reviewing the Bureau of Reclamation's financial reports, that $16.9 billion, or 78 percent, of the $21.8 billion of Federal investment in water projects is considered to be reimbursable. Of the reimbursable costs, the largest share--$7.1 billion--is allocated to irrigators. As of September 30, 1994 irrigators have repaid only $941 million of the $7.1 billion they owe. GAO also found that the Bureau of Reclamation will likely shift $3.4 billion of the debt owed by irrigators to other users of the water projects for repayment. 
There are several reasons why irrigators continue to receive such significant subsidies. Under the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, Congress acted to expand the size of the farms that could receive subsidized water from 160 acres to 960 acres. The RRA of 1982 expressly prohibits farms that exceed 960 acres in size from receiving federally-subsidized water. These restrictions were added to the reclamation law to close loopholes through which Federal subsidies were flowing to large agribusinesses rather than the small family farmers that reclamation projects were 
designed to serve. Agribusinesses were expected to pay full cost for all water received on land in excess of their 960 acre entitlement. Despite the express mandate of Congress, regulations promulgated under the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 have failed to keep big agricultural water users from receiving federal subsidies. The General Accounting Office and the Inspector General of the Department of the Interior continue to find that the acreage limits established in law are circumvented through the creation of arrangements such as farming trusts. These trusts, which in total acreage will exceed the 960 acre limit, are comprised of smaller units that are not subject to the reclamation acreage cap. These smaller units are farmed under a single management agreement often through a combination of leasing and ownership. 
In a 1989 GAO report, the activities of six agribusiness trusts were fully explored. According to GAO, one 12,345 acre cotton farm (roughly 20 square miles), operating under a single partnership, was reorganized to avoid the 960 acre limitation into 15 separate land holdings through 18 partnerships, 24 corporations, and 11 trusts which were all operated as one large unit. A seventh very large trust was the sole topic of a 1990 GAO report. The Westhaven Trust is a 23,238 acre farming operation in California's Central Valley. It was formed for the benefit of 326 salaried employees of the J.G. Boswell Company. Boswell, GAO found, had taken advantage of section 214 of the RRA, which exempts from its 960 acre limit land held for beneficiaries by a trustee in a fiduciary capacity, as long as no single beneficiary's interest exceeds the law's ownership limits. The RRA, as I have mentioned, does not preclude multiple land holdings from being operated collectively under a trust as one farm while qualifying individually for federally subsidized water. Accordingly, the J.G. Boswell Company reorganized 23,238 acres it held as the Boston Ranch by selling them to the Westhaven Trust, with the land holdings attributed to each beneficiary being eligible to receive federally subsidized water. 
Before the land was sold to Westhaven Trust, the J.G. Boswell Company operated the acreage as one large farm and paid full cost for the Federal irrigation water delivered for the 18-month period ending in May 1989. When the trust bought the land, due to the loopholes in the law, the entire acreage became eligible to receive federally subsidized water because the land holdings attributed to the 326 trust beneficiaries range from 21 acres to 547 acres--all well under the 960 acre limit. 
In the six cases the GAO reviewed in 1989, owners or lessees paid a total of about $1.3 million less in 1987 for Federal water than they would have paid if their collective land holdings were considered as large farms subject to the Reclamation Act acreage limits. Had Westhaven Trust been required to pay full cost, GAO estimated in 1990, it would have paid $2 million more for its 
water. The GAO also found, in all seven of these cases, that reduced revenues are likely to continue unless Congress amends the Reclamation Act to close the loopholes allowing benefits for trusts. 
The legislation that I am introducing today combines various elements of proposals introduced during previous attempts by other Members of Congress to close loopholes in the 1982 legislation and to impose a $500,000 means test. This new approach limits the amount of subsidized irrigation water delivered to any operation in excess of the 960 acre limit which claimed $500,000 or more in gross income, as reported on their most recent IRS tax form. If the $500,000 threshold were exceeded, an income ratio would be used to determine how much of the water should be delivered to the user at the full-cost rate, and how much at the below-cost rate. For example, if a 961 acre operation earned $1 million dollars, a ratio of $500,000 (the means test value) divided by their gross income would determine the full cost rate, thus the water user would pay the full cost rate on half of their acreage and the below cost rate on the remaining half. 
This means testing proposal will be featured, for the second year in a row, in this year's 1997 Green Scissors report which is scheduled for release next month. This report is compiled by Friends of the Earth and Taxpayers for Common Sense and supported by a number of environmental and consumer groups, including the Concord Coalition, and the Progressive Policy Institute. The premise of the report is that there are a number of subsidies and projects that could be cut to both reduce the deficit and benefit the environment. This report underscores what I and many others in the Senate have long known: we must eliminate practices that can no longer be justified in light of our enormous annual deficit and national debt. The Green Scissors recommendation on means testing water subsidies indicates that if a test is successful in reducing subsidy payments to the highest grossing 10% of farms, then the Federal Government would recover between $440 million and $1.1 billion per year, or at least $2.2 billion over 5 years. 
When countless Federal programs are subjected to various types of means tests to limit benefits to those who truly need assistance, it makes little sense to continue to allow large business interests to dip into a program intended to help small entities struggling to survive. Taxpayers have legitimate concerns when they learn that their hard earned tax dollars are being expended to assist large corporate interests in select regions of the country who benefit from these loopholes, particularly in tight budgetary times. Other users of Federal water projects, such as the power recipients, should also be concerned when they learn that they will be expected to pick up the tab for a portion of the funds that irrigators were supposed 
to pay back. The Federal water program was simply never intended to benefit these large interests, and I am hopeful that legislative efforts, such as the measure I am introducing today, will prompt Congress to fully reevaluate our Federal water pricing policy. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, it is clear that the conflicting policies of the Federal Government in this area are in need of reform, and that Congress should act. Large agribusinesses should not be able to continue to soak the taxpayers, and should make their fair share of payments to the Federal Government. We should act to close these loopholes and increase the return to the Treasury from irrigators as soon as possible.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation terminating the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences [USUHS], a medical school run by the Department of Defense. The measure is one I proposed when I ran for the U.S. Senate, and was part of a larger, 82 point plan to reduce the Federal budget deficit. The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] estimates that terminating the school would save $369 million over the next six years. 
USUHS was created in 1972 to meet an expected shortage of military medical personnel. Today, however, USUHS accounts for only a small fraction of the military's new physicians, less than 12 percent in 1994 according to CBO. This contrasts dramatically with the military's scholarship program which provided over 80 percent of the military's new physicians in that year. 
Mr. President, what is even more troubling is that USUHS is also the single most costly source of new physicians for the military. CBO reports that based on figures from 1995, USUHS trained physicians cost the military $615,000 per person. By comparison, the scholarship program cost about $125,000 per person, with other sources providing new physicians at a cost of $60,000. As CBO noted in their Spending and Revenue Options publication, even adjusting for the lengthier service commitment required of USUHS trained physicians, the cost of training them is still higher than that of training physicians from other sources, an assessment shared by the Pentagon itself. Indeed, CBO's estimate of the savings generated by this measure also includes the cost of obtaining physicians from other sources. 
The other body has voted to terminate this program on several occasions, and the Vice President's National Performance Review joined others, ranging from the Grace Commission to the CBO, in raising the question of whether this medical school, which graduated its first class in 1980, should be closed because it is so much more costly than alternative sources of physicians for the military. 
Mr. President, the real issue we must address is whether USUHS is essential to the needs of today's military structure, or if we can do without this costly program. The proponents of USUHS frequently cite the higher retention rates of USUHS graduates over physicians obtained from other sources as a justification for continuation of this program, but while a greater percentage of USUHS trained physicians may remain in the military longer than those from other sources, the Pentagon indicates that the alternative sources already provide an appropriate mix of retention rates. Testimony by the Department of Defense before the Subcommittee on Force Requirements and Personnel noted that the military's scholarship program meets the retention needs of the services. 
And while USUHS only provides a small fraction of the military's new physicians, it is important to note that relying primarily on these other sources has not compromised the ability of military physicians to meet the needs of the Pentagon. According to the Office of Management and Budget, of the approximately 2,000 physicians serving in Desert Storm, only 103, about 5 percent, were USUHS trained. 
Mr. President, let me conclude by recognizing that USUHS has some dedicated supporters in the U.S. Senate, and I realize that there are legitimate arguments that those supporters have made in defense of this institution. The problem, however, is that the federal government can no longer afford to continue every program that provides some useful function. 
In the face of our staggering national debt and annual deficits, we must prioritize and eliminate programs that can no longer be sustained with limited Federal dollars, or where a more cost-effective means of fulfilling those functions can be substituted. The future of USUHS continues to be debated precisely because in these times of budget restraint it does not appear to pass the higher threshold tests which must be applied to all Federal spending programs.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my good friend the senior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] in introducing legislation to reduce the number of presidential political appointees. Specifically, the bill caps the number of political appointees at 2,000. The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] estimates this measure would save $392 million over the next 6 years. 
The bill is based on the recommendations of a number of distinguished panels, including most recently, the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on the Presidential Appointment Process. The task force findings, released last fall, are only the latest in a long line of recommendations that we reduce the number of political appointees in the executive branch. For many years, the proposal has been included in CBO's annual publication Reducing the Deficit: Spending and Revenue Options, and it was one of the central recommendations of the National Commission on the Public Service, chaired by former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker. 
Mr. President, this proposal is also consistent with the recommendations of the Vice President's National Performance Review, which called for reductions in the number of federal managers and supervisors, arguing that `over-control and micro management' not only `stifle the creativity of line managers and workers, they consume billions per year in salary, benefits, and administrative costs.' 
Those sentiments were also expressed in the 1989 report of the Volcker Commission, when it argued the growing number of presidential appointees may `actually undermine effective presidential control of the executive branch.' The Volcker Commission recommended limiting the number of political appointees to 2,000, as this legislation does. 
Mr. President, it is essential that any administration be able to implement the policies that brought it into office in the first place. Government must be responsive to the priorities of the electorate. But as the Volcker Commission noted, the great increase in the number of political appointees in recent years has not made government more effective or more responsive to political leadership. 
Between 1980 and 1992, the ranks of political appointees grew 17 percent, over three times as fast as the total number of executive branch employees and looking back to 1960 their growth is even more dramatic. In his recently published book Thickening Government: Federal Government and the Diffusion of Accountability, author Paul Light reports a startling 430 percent increase in the number of political appointees and senior 
executives in Federal Government between 1960 and 1992. 
In recommending a cap on political appointees, the Volcker Commission report noted that the large number of Presidential appointees simply cannot be managed effectively by any President or White House. This lack of control is aggravated by the often competing political agendas and constituencies that some appointees might bring with them to their new positions. Altogether, the commission argued that this lack of control and political focus `may actually dilute the President's ability to develop and enforce a coherent, coordinated program and to hold cabinet secretaries accountable.' 
The Volcker Commission also reported that the excessive number of appointees are a barrier to critical expertise, distancing the President and his principal assistants from the most experienced career officials. Though bureaucracies can certainly impede needed reforms, they can also be a source of unbiased analysis. Adding organizational layers of political appointees can restrict access to important resources, while doing nothing to reduce bureaucratic impediments. 
Author Paul Light says, `As this sediment has thickened over the decades, presidents have grown increasingly distant from the lines of government, and the front lines from them.' Light adds that `Presidential leadership, therefore, may reside in stripping government of the barriers to doing its job effectively* * *' 
Finally, the Volcker Commission also asserted that this thickening barrier of temporary appointees between the President and career officials can undermine development of a proficient civil service by discouraging talented individuals from remaining in Government service or even pursuing a career in Government in the first place. 
Mr. President, former Attorney General Elliot Richardson put it well when he noted: 
But a White House personnel assistant sees the position of deputy assistant secretary as a fourth-echelon slot. In his eyes that makes it an ideal reward for a fourth-echelon political type--a campaign advance man, or a regional political organizer. For a senior civil servant, it's irksome to see a position one has spent 20 or 30 years preparing for preempted by an outsider who doesn't know the difference between an audit exception and an authorizing bill. 
Mr. President, the report of the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on the Presidential Appointment Process identified another problem aggravated by the mushrooming number of political appointees, namely the increasingly lengthy process of filling these thousands of positions. As the task force reported, both President Bush and President Clinton 
were into their presidencies for many months before their leadership teams were fully in place. The task force noted that `on average, appointees in both administrations were confirmed more than eight months after the inauguration--one-sixth of an entire presidential term.' By contrast, the report noted that in the presidential transition of 1960, `Kennedy appointees were confirmed, on average, two and a half months after the inauguration.' 
In addition to leaving vacancies among key leadership positions in Government, the appointment process delays can have a detrimental effect on potential appointees. The Twentieth Century Fund Task Force reported that appointees can `wait for months on end in a limbo of uncertainty and awkward transition from the private to the public sector.' 
Mr. President, a story in the National Journal in November of 1993, focusing upon the delays in the Clinton administration in filling political positions, noted that in Great Britain, the transition to a new government is finished a week after it begins, once 40 or so political appointments are made. That certainly is not the case in the United States, recognizing, of course, that we have a quite different system of government from the British parliament form of government. 
Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the vast number of political appointments that are currently made creates a somewhat cumbersome process, even in the best of circumstances. The long delays and logjams created in filling these positions under the Bush and Clinton administrations simply illustrates another reason why the number of positions should be cut back. 
Mr. President, let me also stress that the problem is not simply the initial filling of a political appointment, but keeping someone in that position over time. In a recent report, the General Accounting Office reviewed a portion of these positions for the period of 1981 to 1991, and found high levels of turnover--7 appointees in 10 years for one position--as well as delays, usually of months but sometimes years, in filling vacancies. 
Mr. President, while I recognize that this legislative proposal is not likely to be popular with some in both parties, I want to stress that this effort to reduce the number of political appointees is bipartisan. The sponsorship of this bill reflects this, and the bill itself applies not only to the current Democratic administration, but to all future administrations as well, whatever their party affiliation. 
The sacrifices that deficit reduction efforts require must be spread among all of us. This measure requires us to bite the bullet and impose limitations upon political appointments that both parties may well wish to retain. The test of commitment to deficit reduction, however, is not simply to propose measures that impact someone else. 
As we move forward to implement the NPR recommendations to reduce the number of government employees, streamline agencies, and make government more responsive, we should also right size the number of political appointees, ensuring a sufficient number to implement the policies of any administration without burdening the Federal budget with unnecessary, possibly counterproductive political jobs. 
Mr. President, when I ran for the U.S. Senate in 1992, I developed an 82 point plan to reduce the Federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget. Since that time, I have continued to work toward enactment of many of the provisions of that plan and have added new provisions on a regular basis. 
The legislation I am introducing today reflects one of the points included on the original 82 point plan calling for streamlining various Federal agencies and reducing agency overhead costs. I am pleased to have this opportunity to continue to work toward implementation of the elements of the deficit reduction plan.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to eliminate percentage depletion allowances for four mined substances--asbestos, lead, mercury, and uranium--from the Federal tax code. This measure is based on language passed as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 by the other body during the 102d Congress. 
Analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation on the similar legislation that passed the House estimated that, under that bill, income to the Federal treasury from the elimination of percentage depletion allowances in just these four mined commodities would total $83 million over 5 years, $20 million in this year alone. These savings are calculated as the excess amount of federal revenues above what would be collected if depletion allowances were limited to the actual costs in capital investments. 
These four allowances are only a few of the percentage depletion allowances contained in the tax code for extracted fuel, minerals, metal and other mined commodities--with a combined value, according to 1994 estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, of $4.8 billion. 
Mr. President, unlike depreciation or cost depletion, the ability to use so-called percentage depletion allows companies to deduct far more than their actual costs. The result is a generous loophole for the company, and an expensive subsidy for the taxpayer. 
Historically, percentage depletion allowances were placed in the tax code to reduce the effective tax rates in the mineral and extraction industries far below tax rates on other industries, providing incentives to increase investment, exploration and output. However, unlike cost depletion or even accelerated depreciation, percentage depletion also makes it possible to recover more than the amount of the original investment. As noted in the Budget Committee's report on tax expenditures, this makes percentage depletion essentially a mineral production subsidy. 
There are two methods of calculating a deduction to allow a mining companies to recover the costs of their capital investment: cost depletion, and percentage depletion. Cost depletion allows for the recovery of the actual capital investment over the period which the reserve produces income. Using cost depletion, a company deducts a portion of their original capital investment minus any previous deductions, in an amount that is equal to the fraction of the remaining recoverable reserves. Under this method, the total deductions cannot exceed the original capital investment. 
However, under percentage depletion, the deduction for recovery of a company's investment is a fixed percentage of `gross income'--namely, sales revenue--from the sale of the mineral. According to the Budget Committee's summary of tax expenditures, under this method, total deductions typically exceed the capital that the company invested. 
Mr. President, given the need to reduce the deficit and balance the budget, there is just as clear a need to review the spending done through the tax code as there is to scrutinize discretionary spending and entitlement programs. All of these forms of spending must be asked to justify themselves, and be weighed against each other in seeking to reach the broader goal of a balanced budget. 
In the case of these particular tax expenditures, we must decide who should bear the costs of exploration, development, and production of natural resources: all taxpayers, or the users and producers of the resource. The current tax break provided to the users and producers of these resources increases pressure on the budget deficit, and shifts a greater tax burden onto other businesses and individuals to compensate for the special treatment provided to the few. 
Mr. President, the measure I am introducing is straightforward. It eliminates the percentage depletion allowance for asbestos, lead, mercury, and uranium while continuing to allow companies to recover reasonable cost depletion. 
Even as a production subsidy, the percentage depletion tax loophole is inefficient. As the Budget Committee summary of tax expenditures notes, it encourages excessive development of existing properties rather than the exploration of new ones. 
Moreover, Mr. President, the four commodities covered by my bill are among some of the most environmentally adverse. The percentage depletion allowance makes a mockery of conservation efforts. The subsidy effectively encourages mining regardless of the true economic value of the resource. The effects of such mines on U.S. lands, both public and private, has been significant--with tailings piles, scarred earth, toxic by-products, and disturbed habitats to prove it. 
Ironically, the more toxic the commodity, the greater the percentage depletion received by the producer. Mercury, lead, uranium, and asbestos receive the highest percentage depletion allowance, while less toxic substances receive lower rates. 
Mr. President, particularly in the case of the four commodities covered by my bill, these tax breaks create absurd contradictions in government policy. While Federal public health and environmental agencies are struggling to come to grips with a vast children's health crisis caused by lead poisoning, spending millions each year to prevent lead poisoning, test young people, and research solutions, the tax code is 
providing a subsidy for lead production--a subsidy that is not provided for the lead recycling industry. 
Asbestos, too, has posed massive public health problems, and it is indefensible that this commodity, the use of which the Federal Government will effectively ban before the year 2000, continues to receive a massive tax subsidy. 
Mr. President, the time has come for the Federal Government to get out of the business of subsidizing business in ways it can no longer afford--both financially and for the health of its citizens. This legislation is one step in that direction. 
Mr. President, in 1992, I developed an 82+ plan to eliminate the Federal deficit and have continued to work on implementation of the elements of that plan since that time. Elimination of special tax preferences for mining companies was part of that 82+ point plan. Just as we must cut direct spending programs, if we are to balance that budget, we must also curtail these special taxpayer subsidies to particular industries that can no longer be justified. 
Finally, Mr. President, in conclusion I want to pay tribute to several elected officials from Milwaukee, Mayor John Norquist and Milwaukee Alderman Michael Murphy, who have brought to my attention the incongruity of the federal government continuing to provide taxpayer subsidies for the production of toxic substances like lead while our inner cities are struggling to remove lead-based paint from older homes and buildings where children may be exposed to this hazardous material. I deeply appreciate their support and encouragement for my efforts in this area.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce three bills which attempt to rectify three different problems with domestic dairy policy. My State of Wisconsin is home to more than 26,000 dairy farmers. Over the past 4 years during the more than 288 listening sessions I've held in Wisconsin counties, I have heard from many of those dairy farmers on the issues addressed by the legislation I am introducing today. 
The first bill I am introducing today, if enacted, will be a first step towards rectifying the inequities in the Federal Milk Marketing Order system. The Federal Milk Marketing Order system, created 60 years ago, establishes minimum prices for milk paid to producers throughout various marketing areas in the United States. 
My legislation is very simple. It identifies the single most inequitable and injurious provision in the current system, and corrects it. That provision--known as single basing point pricing--is USDA's practice of basing prices for fluid milk--Class I milk--in all marketing areas east of the Rocky Mountains on the distance from Eau Claire, WI, when there is little economic justification for doing so. 
In general, the price for fluid milk increases at a rate of 21 cents per 100 miles from Eau Claire, WI. Fluid milk prices, as a result, are $2.98 cents higher in Florida than in Wisconsin, more than $2 higher in New England, and more than $1 higher in Texas. 
While this system has been around since 1937, the practice of basing fluid milk price differentials on the distance from Eau Claire was formalized in the 1960's, when arguably the Upper Midwest was the primary reserve for additional supplies of milk. The idea was to encourage local supplies of fluid milks in areas of the country that did not traditionally produce enough fluid milk to meet their own needs. At that time, this was important because our transportation infrastructure made long distance bulk shipments of milk difficult. Thus, the only way to ensure consumers a fresh local supply of fluid milk was to provide dairy farmers in those distant regions with a milk price high enough to encourage local production. Mr. President, the system worked too well. Ultimately, it has worked to the disadvantage of the Upper Midwest, and in particular, Wisconsin dairy farmers. 
The artificially inflated Class I prices have provided production incentives beyond those needed to ensure a local supply of fluid milk in some regions, leading to an increase in manufactured products in those marketing orders. Those manufactured products directly compete with Wisconsin's processed products, eroding our markets and driving national prices down. 
Under the provisions of the 1996 farm bill, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is currently undergoing an informal rulemaking process to consolidate the number of Federal Milk Marketing Orders from 32 to 10. USDA is also looking at how to set prices for milk in those consolidated orders. By statute USDA is prohibited from basing the new prices on the structure of the existing milk differentials set by the 1985 farm bill. The reforms must be completed by spring, 1999. Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman will no doubt be pressured by many supporters of the status quo to maintain the overall price structure that has discriminated against Wisconsin farmers for so many years. I will do everything I can to prevent that from happening. Wisconsin farmers need real Class I price reform that removes the artificial competitive advantages provided to other regions to other regions of the 
country and allows Upper Midwest farmers to compete on a level playing field. 
The legislation that I am introducing today identifies the one change that is absolutely necessary in any outcome--the elimination of single basing point pricing. It prohibits the Secretary of Agriculture from using distance or transportation costs from any location as the basis for pricing milk, unless significant quantities of milk are actually transported from that location into the recipient market. The Secretary will have to comply with the statutory requirement that supply and demand factors be considered as specified in the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act when setting milk prices in marketing orders. 
This legislation sends a very simple message to the Secretary of Agriculture--that among all the Class I pricing reform options from which the Secretary must choose, he should in no case select on option that either by intent or effect sets prices based on distance from a single location. I will work towards enactment of this legislation prior to the completion the proposed rule on Class I pricing reform. 
Mr. President, my next two bills address inequities to dairy producers throughout the country under the Dairy Promotion and Research Order--also known as the dairy checkoff. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Kohl today on these two very important bills. 
The National Dairy Promotion and Research Program collect roughly $225 million every year from dairy farmers each paying a mandatory 15 cents for every hundred pounds of milk they produce. The program is designed to promote dairy products to consumers and to conduct research relating to milk processing and marketing. 
While 15 cents may appear to be a small amount of money, multiplied by all the milk marketed in this country, it adds up to thousands of dollars each year for the average producer. Given the magnitude of this program, it is critical that Congress take seriously the concerns producers have about their promotion program. 
Since participation in the checkoff is mandatory and producers are not allowed refunds, Congress required that producers vote in a referendum to approve the program after it was authorized. The problem is that Congress didn't provide for a fair and equitable voting process in the original act and it's time to correct our mistake. My bill does that by eliminating a process known as bloc voting by dairy cooperatives. 
Under current law, dairy cooperatives are allowed to cast votes in producer referenda en bloc for all of their farmer-members, either in favor of or against continuation of the National Dairy Board. While individual dissenters from the cooperative's position are allowed to vote individually, many farmers and producer groups claim the process stacks the deck against those seeking reform of the program. 
Mr. President, the problem bloc voting creates is best illustrated by the results of the August 1993 producer referendum on continuation of the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board, called for by a petition of 16,000 diary farmers. In that referendum, 59 dairy cooperatives voting en bloc, cast 49,000 votes in favor of the program. Seven thousand producers from those cooperatives went against co-op policy and voted individually against continuing the program. 
While virtually all of the votes in favor of the program were cast by cooperative bloc vote, nearly 100 percent of the votes in opposition were cast by individuals. Bloc voting allows cooperatives to cast votes for every indifferent or ambivalent producer in their membership, drowning out the voices of dissenting producers. It biases the referendum in favor of the Dairy Board's supporters, whose votes should not have greater weight than the dissenters. 
The inappropriate nature of bloc voting in Dairy Board referendum is even clearer 
given that none of the 17 other commodity promotion programs allow cooperatives to bloc vote despite the existence of marketing cooperatives for many of those commodities. 
Mr. President, it is time to give dairy farmers a fair voting process for their promotion program. I urge my colleagues to support this very important legislation. 
My last bill, Mr. President, provides equity to domestic producers who have been paying into the promotion program for over 10 years while importers have gotten a free ride. Since the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board conducts generic promotion and general product research, domestic farmers and importers alike benefit from these actions. The Dairy Promotion Program Equity Act requires that all dairy product importers contribute to the Dairy Promotion Program for all dairy products imported at the same rate as domestic dairy farmers. This is not an unusual proposal, Mr. President. Many of our largest generic promotion programs in agriculture already assess importers for their fair share of the program, including programs for pork, beef, and cotton. 
This legislation is particularly important in light of the passage of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which will result in greater imports of dairy products over the next several years. An assessment of this type on importers would also be allowed under the GATT since our own milk producers are already paying the same assessment. 
We have put our own producers at a competitive disadvantage for far too long. It's high time importers paid for their fair share of the program. 
I am also pleased to be an original cosponsor of the National Dairy Promotion Board Reform Act introduced today by Senator Kohl. That bill further enhances producer representation on the National Dairy Board by providing for the direct election of National Dairy Board members, rather than appointment by the Secretary. That process will allow producers to elect members to the board that represent their views on promotion and eliminates the divisive impact of the political appointment process on the Dairy Board. Direct producer election of board members should also increase the accountability to their fellow dairy farmers. 
I believe that these bills together comprise a sound reform package for the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board by providing a stronger voice to dairy farmers. These reforms will create a stronger, more effective and more representative Dairy Board. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the proposed Senate Campaign Financing and Spending Reform Act of 1997, legislation that would provide public financing for Senate elections. 
The need for comprehensive campaign finance reform is unquestionable. Each election year continues to set new records for campaign spending by federal candidates, with 1996 campaign expenditures expected to surpass $1.6 billion. This explosion in campaign spending has alienated the American people from the election process, discouraged thousands of qualified yet underfunded candidates from seeking public office, and heightened public disgust with the ways of Washington to levels not seen since the dark days of Watergate. 
I have long believed that we need to sever the nexus between money and politics, and end as a prerequisite for elected office a candidate's ability to raise and spend millions of dollars. The most straight forward way to achieve that result is through a system of public financing. 
The legislation I am introducing today, which I also introduced at the outset of the 104th Congress, would provide qualified candidates with the means to run a credible, competitive and issue-based campaign without having to raise the average $5 million it takes to win a Senate election. 
This bill will establish voluntary spending limits based on each state's individual voting age population. With the cooperation of the candidates, this will finally curtail the skyrocketing spending that has plagued political campaigns in recent years. Just as important, these spending limits will allow members of Congress to focus on their duties and responsibilities as elected officials rather than spending substantial amounts of time raising money. For those candidates that do abide by the spending limits, there will be matching funds in the primary election for contributions under $250, once a candidate has raised 15 percent of that state's spending limit in contributions of $250 or less, half of which must come from within the candidate's state. There will be a 100 percent match for contributions under $100, and a 50 percent match for contributions between $101 and $250. 
These provisions, along with only providing matching funds for in-state contributions, will encourage candidates to focus on smaller contributions from their home states. I believe this focus upon raising money within our home states is critical. General election candidates will become eligible for public financing benefits equal to the general election spending limit for their state. 
In addition to agreeing to limit their overall campaign spending, candidates who receive the public benefits must agree to not spend more than $25,000 of their own money. 
Opponents of campaign finance reform have often suggested that voluntary spending limits are unconstitutional. That is unfounded. In fact, in the landmark Supreme Court decision in Buckley v. Valeo, the Court noted that `Congress may engage in public financing of election campaigns and may condition acceptance of public funds on an agreement by the candidate to 
abide by specified expenditure limitations. Just as a candidate may voluntarily limit the size of the contributions he chooses to accept, he may decide to forego private fundraising and accept public funding.' 
The legislation also bans so-called `soft money' that has allowed corporations, labor unions, and wealth individuals to contribute unlimited funds, up to millions of dollars, to the political parties outside the scope of Federal election law. The legislation restricts Political Action Committee (PAC) contributions to Federal candidates, prohibits lawmakers from sending out franked mass mailings during the calendar year of an election, bars lobbyists from contributing to elected officials they have lobbied in a 12-month period, and codifies a recent ruling by the Federal Election Commission that bars candidates from using campaign funds for personal purposes, such as mortgage payments, country club memberships, and vacations. 
Public financing of campaigns will give challengers a legitimate opportunity to run a competitive campaign, will allow incumbents to focus on their legislative responsibilities, and will help to extinguish public perceptions that the United States Congress is under the control of the Washington special interests. 
Public support for this sort of reform is strong. According to a recent poll by the Mellman Group, 59 percent of the American people--the highest level since Watergate--support full public financing for congressional campaigns. Just 29 percent of the American people oppose this proposal. The Mellman Group even found two out of every three self-described Republicans supported public financing. A Gallup poll found similar results, finding 64 percent overall support for a public financing system. 
And perhaps most revealing, a very recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found 92 percent of the American people simply believe too much money is spent in Federal elections. 
I have no illusions that a public financing proposal would win approval in the 105th Congress. I believe that one day those who have opposed public financing will finally get the message the voters are trying to send us and there will be wider support within the Congress for this approach to cleaning up election campaigns. 
In the meantime, I do believe there are meaningful reforms that can be considered and enacted with bipartisan support. That is why I have joined with a number of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including Senators McCain, Thompson, Wellstone and others in co-authoring the first bipartisan campaign finance reform proposal offered in a decade. 
That legislation, strongly supported by President Clinton, Common Cause, and numerous grassroots organizations and newspapers nationwide, would begin the process of fundamentally changing and reducing the role of money in our political system. It also encourages candidates to limit their campaign spending, but instead of offering direct public financing it provides substantial discounts on broadcast media and postage rates to candidates who agree to limit their overall spending, who agree to limit their own personal spending, and who agree to raise 60 percent of their campaign funds from their home States. I look forward to working with my colleagues on passing such meaningful reform, and will press for action in the first 100 days of this new Congress.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today to eliminate the current mandate on States to place liens on the homes and estates of older Medicaid beneficiaries receiving home and community-based long-term care services, and to provide more than adequate funding for that change by establishing a certificate of need process to regulate the growth of federally funded nursing home beds. 
This legislation modifies the estate recovery provisions of OBRA 93 to clarify that States may pursue recovery of the cost of Medicaid home and community-based long-term care services from the estate of beneficiaries, but that States are not required to do so. 
Mr. President, slowing the growth of rising Medicaid costs is central to easing pressure on both Federal and State budgets, and addressing the long-term care portion of those Medicaid budgets is a key to containing those costs. Meaningful reform of our long-term care system is the ultimate solution to this problem, and I will introduce long-term care reform legislation in the near future that will outline the path we need to follow--helping States provide flexible, consumer-oriented and consumer-directed home and community-based long-term care services. 
In the meantime, however, we can take a few important steps down the path toward long-term care reform by repealing the cumbersome mandate on States that they recover the cost of some services by imposing liens on the homes and estates of seniors using home and community-based long-term care services. 
Mr. President, in the past, States have had the option of recovering payments for those services from the estates of beneficiaries, but in some cases, at least, have chosen not to do so. In Wisconsin, estate recovery for home and community-based long-term care services was implemented briefly in 1991, but was terminated because of the significant problems experienced with the home and Medicaid waiver programs. Many cases were documented where individuals needing long-term care refused community-based care because of their fear of estate recovery or the placement of a lien on their homes. 
One case in southwestern Wisconsin involved an older woman who was suffering from congestive heart failure, phlebitis, severe arthritis, and who had difficulty just being able to move. She was being screened for the Medicaid version of Wisconsin's model home and community-based long-term care program, the Community Options Program, when the caseworker told her of the new law, and that a lien would be put on the estate of the program's clients. The caseworker reported that the older woman began 
to sob, and told the caseworker that she had worked hard all her life and paid taxes and could not understand why the things she had worked for so hard would be taken from her family after her death. 
When asked if she would like to receive services, the client refused. As frail as this client was, the social worker noted that she preferred to chance being on her own rather than endanger her meager estate by using Medicaid funded services. 
In northeastern Wisconsin, a 96-year-old woman was being care for by her 73-year-old widowed daughter in their home. The family was receiving some Medicaid long-term care services, including respite services for the elderly caregiver daughter, but the family discontinued all services when they heard of the new law because the older daughter needed to count on the home for security in her own old age. 
A 72-year-old man, who had 4 by-pass surgeries and was paralyzed on one side, and his 66-year-old wife, who had 3 by-pass surgeries and rheumatoid arthritis, both needed some assistance to be able to live together at home. But when Medicaid was suggested, they refused because of the new law. 
Mr. President, these examples are not unusual. Nor were many of the individuals and families who refused help protecting vast estates. For many, the estates being put at risk were modest at best. A couple in the Green Bay area of Wisconsin who lived in a mobile home and had less than $20,000 in life savings told the local benefit specialist that they would refuse Medicaid funded services rather than risk not leaving their small estate to their family members. 
Leaving even a small bequest to a loved-one is a fundamental and deeply felt need of many seniors. Even the most modest home can represent a lifetime's work, and many are willing to forego medical care they know they need to be able to leave a small legacy. 
Mr. President, while the vision of this mandate on States from inside the Washington beltway may appear simple, the estate recovery requirements are not so simple for program administrators. States, counties, and nonprofit agencies, administrators of Medicaid services, are ill-equipped to be real estate agents. 
Further, divestment concerns in the Medicaid Program, already a problem, could continue to grow as pressure to utilize existing loopholes increases with estate recovery mandated in this way. Worse, as the Coalition of Wisconsin Aging Groups has pointed out, children who feel `entitled to inheritance' might force transfers, constituting elder abuse in some cases. 
Too, Mr. President, there is a very real question of age discrimination with the estate recovery provisions of OBRA 93. Only individuals over age 55 are subject to estate recovery. Such age-based distinctions border on age discrimination and ought to be minimized. 
Mr. President, because I am committed to reducing the deficit and balancing the budget, I firmly believe we must find offsetting spending cuts to fully fund legislative proposals, even when we might disagree with the cost estimates for those proposals. For that reason, I have included provisions in this measure that have been scored by the Congressional Budget Office to more than offset the officially estimated loss in savings from the estate recovery mandate. Nevertheless, while this bill includes offsetting cuts to fund the proposed change, I also believe that the savings ascribed to the existing mandate are questionable. 
Prior to enacting estate recovery in Wisconsin, officials estimated $13.4 million a year could be recovered by the liens. Real collections fell far short. For fiscal year 1992, the State only realized a reported $1 million in collections. And for the period of January to July of 1993, even after officials lowered their estimates, only $2.2 million was realized of an expected $3.8 million in collections. 
In addition to lower than expected collections, the refusal to accept home and community-based long-term care because of the prospect of a lien on the estate could lead to the earlier and more costly need for institutional care. Such a result would not only undercut the questionable savings from the program, but would be directly contrary to the Medicaid home and community-based waiver program,which is intended precisely to keep people out of institutions and in their own homes and communities. 
The brief experience we had in Wisconsin led the State to limit estate recovery to nursing home care and related services, where, as a practical matter, the potential for estate recovery and liens on homes are much less of a barrier to services. Indeed, just as we should provide financial incentives to individuals to use more cost-effective care, so too should we consider financial disincentives for more costly alternatives. A recent study in Wisconsin showed that two Medicaid waiver programs saved $17.6 million in 1992 by providing home and community-based alternatives to institutional care. 
In that context, retaining the more expansive institutional care alternatives in the estate recovery mandate makes good sense, and my legislation would not change that portion of the law. But it does not make sense to jeopardize a program that has produced many more times the savings in lowered institutional costs than even the overly optimistic estimates suggest could be recovered from the estates of those receiving 
home and community-based long-term care. 
All in all, the estate recovery provisions of OBRA 93 are likely to produce more expensive utilization of Medicaid services, may cause an administrative nightmare for State and local government, could aggravate the divestment problem, may result in increased elder abuse, and could well constitute age discrimination. 
Though many long-term care experts maintain that mandating estate recovery for home and community-based long-term care services will only lead to increased utilization of more expensive institutional alternatives, and thus increased cost to Federal taxpayers, the CBO estimated a revenue loss of $20 million in the first year and $260 million over 5 years for this proposal. 
As I noted above, it is important to act responsibly to fund that formal cost estimate with offsetting spending cuts. The additional savings I firmly believe will be generated beyond the scored amounts would then help reduce our Federal budget deficit. This measure includes a provision that more than offsets the official scored revenue loss from eliminating the estate recovery mandate. That provision regulates the growth in the number of nursing home beds eligible for Federal funding through Medicaid, Medicare, or other Federal programs by requiring providers to obtain a certificate of need [CON] to operate additional beds. 
For any specified area, States would issue a CON only if the ratio of the number of nursing home beds to the population that is likely to need them falls below guidelines set by the State and subject to Federal approval. 
This approach allows new nursing home beds to operate where there is a demonstrated need, while limiting the potential burden on the taxpayer where no such need has been established. CBO has estimated that the proposed regulation of nursing home bed growth would generate savings of $35 million in the first year, and $625 million over 5 years, more than offsetting the CBO estimates for removing the State mandate on estate recoveries sought in this bill. The net fiscal effect of this proposal would be to generate about $15 million in savings in the first year, and $365 million over 5 years. 
Slowing the growth of nursing home beds is critical to reforming the current long-term care system. In Wisconsin, limiting nursing home bed growth has been part of the success of the long-term care reforms initiated in the early 1980's. While the rest of the country experienced a 46-percent increase in Medicaid nursing home bed use between 1980 and 1993, Wisconsin saw Medicaid nursing home bed use decline by 15 percent. 
The certificate of need provision is far more modest than the absolute cap on nursing home beds adopted in Wisconsin, and recognizes that there needs to be some flexibility to recognize the differences of long-term care services among States. It is also consistent with the kind of long-term care reform I will be proposing as separate legislation. 
Certainly, our ability to reform long-term care will depend not only on establishing a consumer-oriented, consumer-directed home and community-based services that are available to the severely disabled of all ages, but also on establishing a more balanced and cost-effective allocation of public support of long-term care services by eliminating the current bias toward institutional care. 
Mr. President, taken together, the change in the estate recovery provisions and the slowing of nursing home bed growth, these two provisions will help shift the current distorted Federal long-term care policy away from the institutional bias that currently exists and toward a more balanced approach that emphasizes home and community-based services. 
That is the direction that we will need to take if we are to achieve significant long-term care reform.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation for myself and Senator Kohl, which we offered during the 103d and 104th Congress to terminate the Extremely Low Frequency Communications System, located in Clam Lake, WI, and Republic, MI. 
This project has been opposed by residents of Wisconsin since its inception, but for years we were told that the national security considerations of the cold war outweighed our concerns about this installation in our State. As we continue our efforts to reduce the Federal budget deficit and as the Department of Defense continues to struggle to meet a tighter budget, it is clear that Project ELF should be closed down. If enacted, my legislation would save $9 to $20 million a year. 
Project ELF was developed in the late 1970's as an added protection against the Soviet naval nuclear deployment. It is an electromagnetic messenger system--otherwise known as a bell ringer--used primarily to tell a deeply submerged Trident submarine that it needs to surface to retrieve a message. Because it communicates through very primitive pulses, called phonetic-letter-spelled-out [PLSO] messages, ELF's radiowaves transmit very limited messages. 
With the end of the cold war, Project ELF becomes harder and harder to justify. Trident submarines no longer need to take that extra precaution against Soviet nuclear forces. They can now surface on a regular basis with less danger of detection or attack. They can also receive more complicated messages through very low frequency [VLF] radiowaves or lengthier messages through satellite systems, if it can be done more cheaply. 
Not only do Wisconsinites think the mission of Project ELF is unnecessary and anachronistic, but they are also concerned about possible environmental and public health hazards associated with it. While I have heard some ELF supporters say there is no apparent environmental impact of Project ELF, we can only conclude that we do not know that--in fact, we do not know much about its impact at all. 
The Navy itself had yet to conclude definitively that operating Project ELF is safe for the residents living near the site. It you are a resident in Clam Lake, that is unsettling information. For example, in 1992, a Swedish study found that children exposed to relatively weak magnetic fields from powerlines develop leukemia at almost four times the expected rate. We also know that in 1984, a U.S. district court ruling on State of Wisconsin versus Weinberger ordered Project ELF to be shut down because the Navy paid inadequate attention to the system's possible health effects and violated the National Environmental Policy Act. That decision was overturned on appeal, however, in a ruling that claimed national security interests at the time prevailed over environmental concerns. More recent studies of the impact of electromagnetic fields in general still leave unanswered questions and concerns. 
During the 103d Congress, I worked with the Senator from Georgia, Senator Nunn to include an amendment in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1994 requiring a report by the Secretary of Defense on the benefits and costs of continued operation of Project ELF. The report issued by DOD was particularly disappointing because it basically argued that because Project ELF may have a purpose during the cold war, it should continue to operate after the cold war as part of the complete complement of command and control links configured for the cold war. 
Did Project ELF play a role in helping to minimize the Soviet threat? Perhaps. Did it do so at risk to the community? Perhaps. Does it continue to play a vital security role to the Nation? No. 
Most of us in Wisconsin don't want it anymore. Many of my constituents have opposed Project ELF since its inception. Congressman David Obey has consistently sought to terminate Project ELF, and in fact, we have him to thank in part for getting ELF scaled down from the large-scale project first conceived by the Carter administration. I look forward to continue working with him on this issue in the 105th Congress. 
As we take up the budget for fiscal year 1998, the Department of Defense and the Armed Services Committee will again be searching for programs that have outlived their intended purpose. I hope they will seriously consider zeroing out the ELF transmitter system, as I propose in this bill, and save the taxpayers $9 to $20 million a year. Given both its apparently diminished strategic value and potential environmental and public health hazards, Project ELF is a perfect target for termination.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act of 1997. The 105th Congress will mark the third successive Congress that I have introduced this legislation. Very simply Mr. President, this legislation addresses the rapidly growing and, in my opinion, troubling practice of employers conditioning employment or professional advancement upon their employees willingness to submit claims of discrimination or harassment to arbitration, rather than pursuing them in the courts. In other words, employees raising claims of harassment or discrimination by their employers must submit the adjudication of those claims to arbitration, irrespective of what other remedies may exist under the laws of this Nation. 
To address the growing incidents of compulsory arbitration, the Civil Rights Procedures Protection Act of 1997 amends seven civil rights statutes to ensure that those statutes remain effective when claims of this nature arise. Specifically, this legislation affects claims raised under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1965, Section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 1977 of the Revised Statutes, the Equal Pay Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). In the context of the Federal Arbitration Act, the protections of this legislation are extended to claims of unlawful discrimination arising under State or local law and other Federal laws that prohibit job discrimination. 
Mr. President, I want to be clear that this legislation is in no way intended to bar the use of arbitration, conciliation, mediation or any other form of adjudication short of litigation in resolving these claims. I have long been and will continue to be a strong supporter of `voluntary' forms of alternative dispute resolution. The key, however, is that the practices targeted by this bill are not voluntary. Rather they are imposed upon working men and women and are mandatory. Furthermore, the ability to be promoted, or in some cases, to be hired in the first place, is often conditioned upon the employee accepting this type of mandatory arbitration. Mandatory arbitration allows employers to tell all current and prospective employees in effect, `if you want to work for us, you will have to check your rights as a working American citizen at the door.' In short, working men and women all across this country are faced with the tenuous choice of either accepting these mandatory limitations on their right to redress in the face of discrimination or placing at risk employment opportunities or professional advancement. These requirements have been referred to recently as `front door' contracts; that is, they require an employee to surrender certain rights up front in order to `get in the front door.' As a nation which values work as well as deplores discrimination, we should not allow this situation to continue. 
As I noted Mr. President, today marks the third successive Congress in which this important legislation has been introduced. Given that much of the rhetoric coming out of Washington and this body in recent months, certainly during the most recent elections, dealt with helping working families, it is my hope that this legislation will receive consideration in the coming months. The practice of mandatory arbitration should be stopped now--if people are being discriminated against, they should retain all avenues of redress provided for in the laws of this Nation. This bill will help restore integrity in relations between hard working employees and their employers, but more importantly, it will ensure that the civil rights laws which we pass, will continue to protect all Americans.

Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, on the first of January, the clock began ticking on an historic 8-year experiment. The Line-Item Veto Act became effective on that date, a law that provides the President with significant new authority to cancel discretionary spending and new entitlement spending, along with an extremely limited ability to cancel new spending done through the Tax Code. 
Though the version enacted was flawed in several ways, I supported this new authority to provide the President with some additional flexibility to eliminate inappropriate spending. I do not believe the line-item veto is the whole answer to our deficit problem, or even most of the answer, but it certainly can be part of the answer. 
A key part of the new Presidential authority is the sunset clause. Unless Congress renews this authority, it will expire. The sunset clause will put the burden on those who want to retain the authority to demonstrate the experiment has worked. 
Mr. President, though the continuing Federal budget deficits justify granting this temporary authority to the President on a trial basis, there are many extremely serious issues surrounding this proposal that merit close monitoring over the next several years. At the time I voted for the final version of this new authority last year, I announced my intention to form a line-item veto watchdog project to regularly monitor how this new law is implemented over the next 8 years, and I am pleased to take this opportunity to report on that project. 
Mr. President, joining me in this line-item veto watchdog project are a number of distinguished observers of Federal policymaking, including Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute, Stephen Moore of the CATO Institute, and Demetri Coupanis on behalf of the Concord Coalition. In addition, several individuals from my home State of Wisconsin have also agreed to participate in the project. They include State Senator Lynn Adelman, State Representative Dave Travis, and attorney Fred Wade of Madison. Each of those three individuals has a deep interest in the partial veto authority granted to Wisconsin's Governors and brings a critical perspective to the new authority given the President. 
Mr. President, though we have no prior experience at the Federal level, many in this body who have served in State government may have seen the use of line-item veto authority at the State level. Indeed, much of the support for a Federal line-item veto stems from the State experience. But few other States, if any at all, have witnessed the abuses of line-item veto authority that we have seen in Wisconsin. That abuse has been bipartisan--Governors of both parties have used Wisconsin's partial veto authority in ways it is safe to say no one anticipated when that authority was first contemplated. For example, Wisconsin's current Governor, Governor Thompson, has used the veto authority not only to rewrite entire laws, but actually to increase spending and increase taxes. 
Mr. President, given that history, the participation of Senator Adelman, Representative Travis, and attorney Wade will be invaluable in helping us monitor potential abuses of the new Presidential authority. 
Mr. President, the watchdog project will be monitoring and chronicling a number of aspects of the Presidential power--first, the actual amount of Federal spending eliminated by the President's use of the line-item veto. Reducing unnecessary spending was the central argument for this new authority, and keeping track of how much spending is eliminated will be useful in seeing how effective this new tool actually is. It may also help encourage Presidents to make sure that they are making full use of this new authority as we will attempt to track missed opportunities as well as successes. 
The watchdog project will also monitor instances where the new authority is abused by the executive branch. Some have suggested that the line-item veto could be used to coerce Members of Congress to toe the line on an administration's policies through the threat to cancel spending in home States. If a President starts misusing the line-item veto authority as a club to get votes on nominations or other policy matters, the public ought to hear about it, and our project will seek to document this kind of abuse if it takes place. 
Mr. President, the watchdog project will also look for examples of excess spending that escape scrutiny because of loopholes in the new law. Some already are speculating on the different techniques that may be attempted to avoid the reach of this new Presidential power. 
Mr. President, in this regard, I am especially concerned that the sections of the line-item veto authority that deal with tax expenditures were too narrowly drawn, and that many new special interest tax breaks could escape the line-item veto pen. Along with my good friend in the other body, Representative Tom Barrett of Milwaukee, I have introduced legislation to address this weakness in the new law, and will do so again this session. It makes no sense to provide the President with this new authority while protecting one of the fastest growing areas of spending in the Federal budget, an area that includes unjustified subsidies to some of the wealthiest individuals and corporations in the world. 
Mr. President, the watchdog group will also monitor efforts to twist the line item authority beyond its stated purpose. As I noted above, in Wisconsin, the partial veto authority has been abused by our Governors by striking out single letters in appropriation bills to create new words and new meanings to legislation. In some cases, the Wisconsin statute has been used to actually increase State spending. The new Federal law does not, on its surface, appear to allow for that kind of abuse, but our project will be monitoring that aspect of implementation of the new law as well. 
Other aspects of the new law that warrant review are also sure to present themselves as we begin its actual use later this session, and I welcome suggestions from my colleagues who are interested in this historic new law. 
It is critical that we track closely how the new authority is being used so that when it expires in 8 years, Congress and the public will have some measurable criteria by which to assess its effectiveness.
