Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning the conference report on the Columbia appropriations, fiscal year 1999. This conference report is the product of a productive debate between the Senate and House subcommittees. This is a good bill, a bipartisan bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
I want to thank my subcommittee members, Senator Boxer, the ranking member, and Senator Hutchison for their hard work and assistance in putting the Senate bill together. I would also like to thank the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the distinguished ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their guidance and support. 
Mr. President, the conference report largely ratifies the consensus budget for local funds adopted by the Mayor, the Council, and the Financial Authority. The Congress created that budget process, and it has imposed some much needed fiscal discipline on the District's budget. Instead of drowning in red ink, the budget of the Nation's Capital is now solidly in the black, with a surplus of over $300,000,000 for fiscal year 1998. 
The conference report appropriates over $372,000,000 for implementation of the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997. With the exception of the capital budget for the District court system, the conference report supports the President's budget request for implementation of the act. 
The conferees did not provide the $50,000,000 requested by the President to capitalize the National Capital Revitalization Corporation [NCRC]. The Congress has not been consulted as to either the composition of the Board of the NCRC, its duties, the scope of its activities, the relationship between the NCRC and other Federal or local agencies, the relationship between the NCRC and Congress, or the extent to which actions taken by the NCRC may conflict with previous economic incentives adopted by the Congress on behalf of the District. Despite these concerns, the President's nonemergency supplemental request included $25,000,000 to capitalize the NCRC. 
The District of Columbia was recently named the worst city in the country to raise children. The children of our Nation's Capital deserve better. Our conference report provides $7,000,000 to pay for new facilities at the Boys Town operations in the District; over $15,000,000 for public charter schools; and $200,000 for mentoring services for at-risk children. 
The conference report also provides funding for several nonprofit organizations located in the District of Columbia. These projects have broad bipartisan support and will bolster the District's downtown revitalization efforts. 
The conference report provides over $75,000,000 in Federal funds to improve public safety and repair a crumbling infrastructure in the Nation's Capital. Included in this amount is over $18,000,000 for repairs to the District's public safety facilities, including badly needed capital improvements to Metropolitan Police Department [MPD] facilities. In addition, the conference report provides the United States Park Police with $8,500,000 for a new helicopter, which will assist the MPD in meeting the District's public safety needs. In addition, the conference report appropriates $25,000 to expand the subway station next to the planned Washington Convention Center. 
Perhaps most important, the conference report includes $25,000,000 to continue the work of management reform. If there is one reason why the Nation's Capital has any hope of recovery, it is because District agencies which have been mismanaged for years are finally being reformed and restructured. The Financial Authority and the District's Chief Management Officer, Camille Barnett, are now midway through the process of cleaning up the largest agencies of the District government. While the District is making headway in reversing years of mismanagement, much work needs to be done to improve service delivery to District residents. The funds provided in this bill will go toward projects that will enhance government efficiency and service delivery, such as expanded emergency medical services and technology modernization. 
The conference report prohibits the use of Federal and local funds for the implementation of a needle exchange program; for abortion; and for a ballot initiative to legalize controlled substances. It also provides badly needed adoption reforms for the District of Columbia. 
This conference report would not have been possible without the hard work and cooperation of my friend, Congressman Charles Taylor, the chairman of the House Subcommittee on the District of Columbia. We are confident that this conference report will be supported by the Senate, the House of Representatives, and the President.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation. There are many good things about this bill. It is not perfect--but we shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. In our constitutional process, the Republican majority cannot get everything it wants and with a very liberal White House, we are forced to compromise in order to keep the Government functioning. 
The most important thing the American people need to know is that this year the Congress has balanced the budget for the first time in 30 years. Next year, in 1999, we will balance it again. Because we have stopped the growth of the Federal Government, we finally have stopped spending more than we collect, and giving the bill to our children and grandchildren to pay in the future. 
Let me discuss the many positive provisions in this bill. First, we have increased defense spending for an anti-ballistic missile defense. This involves the very core of our national security. And I should note, this is the first Congress to increase defense spending since 1985. 
We have included provisions to reduce the spread of obscene material over the Internet. Also, we have doubled the number of Customs agents to block child pornography coming in from overseas. 
In an area that I have particularly been interested in, we have attached real reforms to the IMF funding, rather than giving funds to the IMF with no strings attached as the President would have liked us to. 
We have provided funding for new teachers, but maintained local control over the hiring--and--we have prevented national Federal testing of students. 
We have included seven major proposals to fight the war on drugs. Bill Clinton has mocked the seriousness of drug use and it has showed. Drug use among teens has been on the rise during the Clinton administration. 
We are funding increases in health care research, particularly cancer research and breast cancer research. We kept our commitment from last year to dramatically increase spending in the fight against cancer. The bill also contains a requirement that requires insurance companies to cover breast reconstructive surgery for women afflicted with breast cancer. 
On the tax side, we have extended the research and development tax credit, which is important to North Carolina. 
Further, we are changing the tax laws to permit 100% deductibility of health insurance for self employed individuals. 
And this is another important point that is often overlooked by the media. This is the first Congress to cut taxes in 16 years. And in this bill, we have again reduced taxes for the self employed. 
This is in stark contrast to the Clinton tax increase of 1993, the largest in the history of the U.S. 
For North Carolina specifically, there are a number of positive provisions. We have received money for a program called LEARN North Carolina, which will provide important curriculum information to our teachers and classrooms over the Internet throughout North Carolina. 
The Congress again provided funding for the Reading Together program which has fifth graders tutoring second graders in reading--it is a truly remarkable program that has shown very positive results in increasing the reading skills of elementary students. 
The bill provides funding for the North Carolina Center for the Prevention of School Violence, in order to reduce violence in schools. 
We have provided money to save a national landmark, the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse. 
The bill will provide additional funding for the North Carolina Criminal Justice Information Network, which will help our state troopers identify criminal suspects on the spot during traffic steps. It will save the lives of our police officers. 
In order to stop crime before it happens, we have provided funding for gang resistance in troubled parts of North Carolina. 
For transportation, we have secured $10 million for light rail in the Triangle. In Charlotte, we have $3 million for the planning of light rail in that booming area of the state. 
For our farmers, unlike the White House proposal, we have made sure that North Carolina farmers can receive aid if they are hit by low prices. Also, in order to keep our farmers competitive in the global marketplace, we have provided millions in agriculture research for North Carolina. 
These are just a few of the items that have been secured for our state. 
As I said, Mr. President, this is not a perfect bill. 
We are spending too much money under the guise of `emergency' spending. Under the banner of `emergency' spending, we have funds for the Bosnian mission, the Year 2000 compliance, farm aid and embassy security funds. While we can't desert our troops in Bosnia now, we can find other spending cuts to pay for this mission, if it continues. We need funds to fix the Year 2000 problem, but we can find other cuts to offset this spending. And, we need funds to make our foreign missions more secure. I am willing to vote for these new funds now, but I can vow that I will seek spending reductions in the next year to offset them. 
For this reason, I am also introducing legislation today that would require the President to submit a budget next year identifying spending cuts so that we can pay for the twenty billion in `emergency' spending that we have spent in this bill. We must preserve the surplus for Social Security, and emergency or no emergency, we have to find cuts in government so that we do not fritter away the surplus. 
In conclusion, this bill, on balance, is a bill for a better national defense, better schools and better health care. For that reason, I plan to support it.

Yes, that is my understanding, and that is confirmed by the Report of the Conference Managers, which distinguishes between the term `provision' and the term `requirements of this provision.' And it is further my understanding that, to the extent that the section 117 establishes any `requirements`' within this so-called waiver provision, those requirements are contained only in new section (2)(A).

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate one of North Carolina's good corporate citizens for receiving two prestigious international awards this week. Nortel Networks is a global supplier of telecom and data networking solutions and has been an employer in North Carolina since 1974. They employ over 9,000 people in the Raleigh-Durham area, over 32,000 employees across the United States and approximately 80,000 people in over 150 countries. Over 40 percent of Nortel Networks' worldwide revenues are generated from their facilities in Raleigh-Durham. 
Nortel Networks' CEO John Roth received `The Emerging Markets CEO of the Year Award,' which acknowledges companies whose expansion into emerging markets has contributed significantly to the corporation and has benefitted the countries involved. This award was presented at a special event during the IMF/World Bank annual meeting this week in Washington. 
Nortel Networks was also recognized this week as `The World's Most Global Company' in the electricals sector, by the editors of Global Finance, a magazine known for its reporting of world financial matters. Other companies who have received this award in the past include IBM, Citibank, Reuters, and Avon. 
These awards are well deserved. A country's communications structures, capabilities and services--its `infostructure'--is directly linked to its standard of living. The network technologies Nortel Networks has brought to emerging markets has helped improve the standard of living for the citizens of these countries, providing them a much faster ascent into the 21st Century. Advanced network technologies promise greater opportunities to improve their education and health care, as well as expand business and employment. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating this world leader which also happens to be a stellar North Carolina corporation.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to commend a rising company in the Tarheel State and use its positive example to encourage my colleagues to recognize and support the role environmental technologies are playing in our economy. 
Micell Technologies of Raleigh has made great strides in improving carbon dioxide cleaning methods which may soon revolutionize the dry cleaning, metal finishing and textile industries. This company's environmentally friendly and energy efficient innovation, which is the result of research by a prominent professor and students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has recently earned recognition by R&D magazine as one of the top 100 innovations of 1998. 
I would also like to share a column authored by Anna Vondrak that appeared recently in the Greensboro News & Record calling for the federal government to provide more research and development funding to stimulate environmental discoveries as well as tax and other incentives for polluting, less energy efficient companies to seek alternative manufacturing processes.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am indeed honored and happy to be here this morning with my home church preacher. Bill Hawkins has been pastor of my church for 10 years now and he has made an outstanding impression and done a great job not only for the church membership but for the city that we live in as well. He has a wife and two daughters and they mean so much to me personally and to the community we live in. He is a Virginian, but we do not intend to allow him to leave. We plan to keep him in North Carolina and we are honored that he is there. He brings the youth and vigor to our church that we so much need. We are proud to have him there. 
Bill, thank you. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the agriculture appropriations conference report. 
This bill includes critical assistance for farmers. It helps all farmers, not just Midwestern grain farmers, and that is why I believe that this is the right bill. 
I urge President Clinton to withdraw his veto threat and to support this critical disaster relief bill. It is outrageous that the President is playing politics with the fate of American farmers. I was astonished to see Jacob J. Lew, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, write that the President's `senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill' unless the House and Senate craft a bill for the Midwest rather than for the whole nation. 
I find it incredible that the Clinton Administration can oppose a package that includes $4.3 billion for increased AMTA payments, weather-related crop damage relief, `multi-year' disasters, livestock assistance, and assistance for tree farmers. This is about farmers, not politics, and it is time for the White House to put policy first. 
This is a good bill for North Carolina and for all farmers. I congratulate the Committee for a job well done. 
Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Internet Tax Freedom Act. In recent years, Internet use has exploded, creating unprecedented opportunities for individuals and businesses. We must not allow a complicated patchwork of taxes to impede future opportunities. 
Growth of the Internet has presented individuals with quick access to unlimited information. With an estimated 100 million users connected by year's end, its popularity is unmistakable. 
Logically, entrepreneurs are catering to this growth through online sales. We are now seeing the online sale of books, airline tickets, and computer software. New companies are being created and old companies are adapting to provide products and services via the Internet. Companies such as Amazon.com and Dell computers are leading the way. Of course, large numbers of small businesses are focusing on Internet sales as well. Electronic Commerce generated an estimated $8 billion last year and is projected to generate over $300 billion in 2002. 
Mr. President, we must not underestimate the benefits of such growth. It leads to the creation of new businesses and jobs. And while companies that do this well will reap tremendous rewards, consumers will be the ultimate winners. They will benefit from the convenience and efficiency of electronic commerce. Furthermore, growth in Internet sales will lead to increased competition, bringing consumer choice and lower prices. I, therefore, believe it's vital that we protect this emerging industry. 
By placing a two-year moratorium on Internet access tax and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce, the Internet Tax Freedom Act is a strong step in the right direction. I understand that many businesses may not have the resources or may choose not to engage in Internet sales. This bill doesn't discriminate against these companies by creating a tax haven for their competitors. It applies only to those taxes which specifically target the Internet. It, in effect, prevents discrimination against companies engaged in Internet sales. 
Mr. President, the Internet Tax Freedom Act is a bipartisan bill which will ensure the vitality of our nation's electronic commerce. Today, I offer my full support for this commonsense legislation.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will allow Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and their affiliates to borrow from the Home Loan Bank System. 
Since the 1930's the Home Loan Bank System has provided the nation's savings institutions with advances that can be used to make home mortgages. In 1989, the System was opened up to banks and credit unions. The Home Loan Bank System is critical for homeownership in the U.S. The Bank System has nearly 7,000 members and has outstanding nearly $181 billion in housing advances. 
The membership of the system is reserved for insured institutions. My legislation, however, would permit Community Development Financial Institutions to have `non-member' borrowing status. This would allow approximately 200 CDFIs to borrow from the System, with the approval of their regional Home Loan Bank and on the same terms as all other members. 
Mr. President, this is a small, but important step toward creating more homeownership opportunities, particularly for low income individuals. CDFIs were created for the purpose of reaching out to provide housing and economic opportunity in distressed areas. My home state of North Carolina is home to more CDFIs than any other state in the United States, except for California, New York and Illinois. North Carolina has been a leader in finding new and different ways to foster economic growth and home ownership. 
Very simply, this legislation will allow CDFIs to have a source of credit to make home loans. These loans will have to meet the normal collateral requirements of any other institution that belongs to the Home Loan Bank System. Because CDFIs are chartered to target distressed communities, however, this could be an important source of credit for homeownership that might not otherwise exist. We know from experience that once an individual has a home--he or she has a stake in the community. This can help turn distressed communities into thriving communities. We have made great progress in the last few years. Welfare rolls are at their lowest point since 1969. Homeownership is at its highest level ever. We are no longer running our federal budgets in the red. Now we can begin to take new and creative steps to continue promoting economic growth and opportunity. 
I would urge my colleagues to co-sponsor and support this legislation.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to commend a former member of my staff, Patricia Hylton, who has recently been named manager of the Refuse To Be A Victim program. Trish was an invaluable member of my office, and I'm certain that she will be successful in making Refuse To Be A Victim a beneficial program for women across the country. 
While working in my office, Trish became interested in developing crime awareness and prevention programs for women. Regrettably, such efforts are needed. The statistics are frightening. Seventy-three percent of women will be victimized at some point in their lives. Seventy-three percent. One million women are stalked each year in the United States. Figures such as these call for decisive action. 
I am proud to recognize a program that empowers women with a strategy to ensure their own personal safety. Refuse To Be A Victim is a superior safety tool and thousands of women are safer because of their participation. Refuse To Be A Victim is sponsored by the National Rifle Association. The program is not, however, about firearms. Instead, Refuse To Be A Victim offers women the knowledge necessary to avoid being victimized. 
This program is taught throughout the United States an in my home state nine men and women instruct hundreds of North Carolinians each year. I'm pleased that Trish has committed herself to such a worthwhile program. And I hope that many more American women will take advantage of this exceptional learning experience.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this Sense of the Senate resolution puts the Senate on record about a transportation issue in the largest city in my State. 
The failure of this Administration to stand up for American carriers under our air services agreements with foreign governments is a serious issue. The unwillingness of this Administration to stand up for American interests undercuts our international position in critical negotiations and promotes intransigence amongst other parties to these negotiations. 
Specifically, Mr. President, this Administration has not fought to enforce the rights of American citizens, American communities, and American air carriers. 
Under the existing air services agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom, the so-called Bermuda II agreement, the United States has the right to designate a U.S. flag carrier to serve the Charlotte-London route. 
On February 20, 1998, the U.S. Department of Transportation awarded this route to US Airways. US Airways announced its plans to launch nonstop service on May 7, 1998 and to compete with British Airways' monopoly on this route. 
With its network at Charlotte, US Airways was prepared to offer convenient one-stop service to the United Kingdom from dozens of cities in North Carolina, South Carolina, and the surrounding area. 
However, the government of the United Kingdom failed to provide US Airways with commercially viable landing and take-off rights at Gatwick Airport, London's secondary airport. 
The Bermuda II agreement prohibits US Airways from serving Heathrow Airport at all. Only two U.S. carriers are allowed to serve Heathrow. I want to remind my colleagues that the British are blocking access not to the primary airport, Heathrow, but even to the secondary airport, Gatwick. 
Yes, Mr. President, the British Government refused to facilitate access to its secondary airport for a competitor to the British Airways monopoly on the Charlotte-London route.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, it saddens me that we are here again debating partial-birth abortion. I feel inadequate at this point after hearing Dr. Frist give a thorough, methodical, and definitive reason why it is such a cruel and brutal procedure that it never even should be considered. How anybody could vote to sustain a veto after hearing Dr. Frist, Senator Frist, explain the brutality and the fringe element that is doing this procedure is more than I can imagine. 
There are 125 medical centers and schools in this Nation, and not one of them teaches the procedure as a method of medicine. It is totally a fringe element, as he well says. 
I feel so inadequate here following him, who is an authority, and spent his life in medicine, and understands the medical reasons why we should not be doing it. 
But the very idea of just taking a pair of scissors and driving them into the skull of a child that is practically ready to be born, to me is horrible beyond anything we can think of--the pain to the child, and the danger to the mother. It is absolutely incomprehensible to me how anyone could vote to continue this procedure. 
It was said by Dr. Frist that it is done by a fringe element, but they are doing a lot of them. They are not even taught by medical doctors in medical schools. Yet, we are here authorizing it. 
Again, how many times will President Clinton stand in the way of the Congress and to overwhelming feelings of the people of America and veto our attempt at outlawing this horrible procedure? 
For me, this is about values, our values. It is one of the great moral questions of our time. It is a moral question. We know that late-term abortions are wrong. We know it from everything we are taught--from our religious beliefs, to our medical authorities, which we just heard. We need to summon the moral courage to draw a clear line of conscience by saying simply flat and straight out, `no more partial-birth abortions,' not just from the facts that we heard from Senator Frist, but just the overall facts. The American Medical Association says that partial-birth abortions are medically unnecessary. That one statement is true is enough to outlaw this procedure. But it actually is not even done in the medical profession. It is a fringe procedure that goes far outside the normal circles of medicine. 
Former Surgeon General Everett Koop said partial-birth abortions may harm a mother's fertility. We hear from other segments of the American medical society that it probably will harm a mother's fertility. Spiritual leaders from every segment of religion in the country--religious leaders such as Billy Graham, Pope John Paul--have spoken out on the horrible procedure that this is and how it should be eliminated from our society forever and outlawed forever. 
We are talking about taking the life of a child who can survive outside the mother's womb. We just heard Senator Frist describe it can survive, and how that life is taken by the cruel process of pushing a pair of scissors into it and expanding it and removing the brain. 
It is a horrible procedure. Both pro-life and pro-choice should be able to agree that those children deserve our law and protection. 
I am asking my colleagues--and, most importantly, President Clinton--to put values ahead of votes and end the tragedy of partial-birth abortion. 
Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, I yield any time I may have.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this fall millions of college students are returning to campus. Today I introduce legislation that will ease the financial burden for these students, and reduce the costs of student financial aid on the taxpayers. 
My bill seeks to inject some good, old-fashioned competition in the market for the purchase of college textbooks. Every student knows that the costs of textbooks can run into hundreds of dollars. It has become a major expense for most college students. My bill would bar financial aid to any university or any student attending a university that, directly or indirectly, requires students to purchase textbooks exclusively on campus. Further, the legislation would require that non-campus businesses have reasonable access to the textbook requirements of college courses, so that they too could stock textbooks and have them available to students at a more competitive price. 
Regrettably, the way aid is currently disbursed by the Department of Education is artificially raising costs for students throughout the country. There is a nationwide use of financial aid to, in effect, channel funds exclusively to college `business-like' enterprises. These funding methods prevent financial aid from being spent at small businesses attempting to compete in the campus area marketplace. 
Through the use of Department of Education-permitted `student accounts,' colleges are creating their own dominance in such areas as college bookstores. Off-campus choice is virtually unavailable, even if off-campus stores offer students a less-expensive alternative. With the development of `campus cards,' aid is even more captive to the on-campus economy. 
I raised this issue with Secretary Riley at a hearing this spring and through a subsequent letter. The Department claims such distribution of aid funds is voluntary. The Department of Education stated in its June 22nd response that off-campus businesses can accept these campus cards only if an institution `wishes to establish a business relationship with an off-campus business.' In most cases, that is not their wish. In most cases, only on-campus enterprises benefit. The Congress never intended financial aid funds--or any other funds--to be used for purposes of monopolization on college campuses. Competition in the campus-area marketplace is being restricted--and in many cases--eliminated. Students have little to no choice in shopping for books and materials. 
The net result is that students are often paying higher costs for these goods and services, like textbooks. And, the federal government, providing student aid, is paying the higher price too. 
There isn't a college student in this country that does not think that textbooks cost too much. Buying course books has become a major expense for the vast majority of students. 
Evidence shows that off-campus bookstores are generally less-expensive if students receiving financial aid had full access to them. A recent report of the National Association of College Stores (`NACS') reports that each student spends an average of $300 for new textbooks at an on-campus bookstore compared with less than $200 for textbook purchases at an off-campus bookstore. 
Additionally, another unfair practice that I have been informed about is that some institutions refuse or obstruct access by off-campus college bookstores to the titles of textbooks required by the teaching staff. This legislation addresses both of these problems. 
Further, I believe we should be taking any reasonable steps that we can to reduce the cost of attending college. A 1998 Congressional Commission on the Cost of Higher Education Report tells us that America has a `college cost crisis.' It found that 71 percent of the public believes that a four-year education is not affordable for most Americans. Clearly, people are concerned about the ever-growing costs of higher education. 
This legislation could save every student hundreds of dollars a year in college costs, if we can promote greater free market competition in the sale of college textbooks. As for financial aid, if this legislation can only save one percent of the amount that is spent on financial aid, it would approximate a $500 million savings. 
Clearly parents, students and the federal government could use this kind of financial relief. Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank Senator Hatch. 
Mr. President, I agree with Senator Dodd. I, too, have been concerned about the problem that we see as a mounting one. We ought not to be putting college students in debt, particularly at such an early stage of their life. But my concern is that this law has to be carefully crafted. I do not feel that it has been. My concern is that this has to be put together in such a way that we do not deny credit to students who might need it while they are away from home. But further, I don't want to stop or impede credit to non-college students under the age of 21. 
We have not had hearings on this. And we have not attempted to curb the credit cards through any private methods. Senator Dodd is on the Banking Committee. So am I. I would prefer to defer this, and hold hearings, and move legislation independently out of the Banking Committee, where it should begin, and then to the floor. 
I think the Senator from Connecticut has certainly identified a real and continuing problem. But I have struggled with how to legally cut off credit to college students for some time. I have noticed card solicitations at college bookstores and the marketing efforts that have been put forth that are aimed solely at young people. But why do we tell someone in the U.S. Army, who is under the age of 21, whom we without any hesitation send into harm's way to be killed, or whatever, that they can't get a credit card? This will diminish the chances of getting one, very likely. 
That is why I think we should take more time and care in crafting this proposal so that we do it right. It needs to be done, but it needs to be done right. What do you do with the people who lie on their application? These are some of the things that are going to be difficult to legislate unless we take time and do it right. 
You have to remember that while there may be only really a few credit card brands, they are offered by literally thousands and tens of thousands of institutions. All of the burden of administering this requirement is going to be absorbed by them. Those costs are going to be passed along to you know who. And that is all of us who do business with banks or use credit cards. 
Again I say, let's carefully consider this before we legislate. Let's bring it to the Banking Committee. Let's have hearings on it and at that point craft a bill that would serve the purposes and go in the direction that Senator Dodd is trying to go. I would be happy in the subcommittee that I chair to hold hearings on it just as soon as possible. It really is a problem. But we need to take our time and correct it. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the elimination of the marriage penalty tax. Our nation has recently witnessed violent assaults on children at school, an explosion of sexually explicit material on television and the Internet, and increasingly plentiful and inexpensive drugs. Now more than ever, our nation needs strong families. 
Unfortunately, our tax code encourages just the opposite. It discourages marriage and places an undue financial burden on couples, simply for being married. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 21 million married couples paid an average of $1,400 more in income taxes in 1996 than they would have if they were single. This `marriage penalty' is immoral and patently unfair. We are sending the wrong message to the American people, and it's time for Congress to take action. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support the elimination of the marriage penalty tax as the centerpiece of upcoming tax legislation.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to address the farm crisis, and it is indeed a farm crisis. Prices are at historic lows for many commodities. That fact has received much of the attention. 
Well, in North Carolina, that is just a part of the problem. My tobacco farmers also faced a direct attack on our billion-dollar tobacco crop from the White House. Further, my tobacco farmers were hit with a 17% quota cut last year, so they're facing dire times. 
The Daschle amendment is not the answer for them. Really, it is not the answer for most farmers, it just doesn't address the root issues. It will not help in the short term. It will not help in the long term. 
The Daschle amendment ignores the tobacco farmers. North Carolina tobacco farmers face the effects of drought--and hurricanes--but this amendment fails to address their problems. In fact, it's just not geared for the Southeastern farmers, but for the Midwest and West. 
My tobacco farmers can't boost their exports to relieve their crisis not because there is no foreign market, but because it is government policy to prohibit efforts to help them build export markets. All the other commodities are on the table at the trade negotiations, but it is official policy to ignore tens of thousands of tobacco farmers. That is wrong. 
We need a farm assistance plan that includes all farmers and that does not ignore North Carolinians. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Hutchinson's bill, the Truth in Employment Act. This legislation is needed to address the problem of salting abuse, which places unfair economic pressure on non-union employers and ultimately costs American taxpayers millions of dollars each year. 
In a typical salting case, union operatives gain access to a non-union workplace by obtaining employment with the company. Rather than further the interests of the company or even organize employees, their true objective is to disrupt business operations and increase costs for the non-union employer. This, of course, is achieved in a number of ways, including the filing of discrimination complaints with the National Labor Relations Board or other regulatory agencies. 
Mr. President, an overwhelming majority of these cases are dismissed by the National Labor Relations Board as frivolous and without merit. Unfortunately, employers must shoulder the enormous costs of legal expenses, delays, and lost productivity, regardless of their innocence. One such frivolous case involves Burns Electrical Contractors in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1996, a union salt gained employment with Burns Electric after lying on his application about his qualifications and his past employment. In actuality, he was on a union payroll for $65,000. Within the first week, he began disrupting business, and, after abandoning his job, he was permanently replaced. Of course, discrimination charges were soon filed with the National Labor Relations Board. 
More than two years later, the case was still not heard by the National Labor Relations Board. Burns Electric was forced to lay off workers and lost several bids on new construction projects. It incurred an estimated $250,000 in business losses and $10,000 in legal fees. Eventually, Burns Electric yielded to its attorney's advice and settled the case (it is often far less expensive for small businesses to settle than it is for them to contest the charges). Thus, the union salt was successful in disrupting operations and weakening the market share of this company, simply because its employees would not join a union. 
Unfortunately, there is no disincentive for filing such a frivolous complaint. The federal government funds the investigation and prosecution of charges. This, of course, results in a considerable tab for the American taxpayer. I am informed that 8,449 cases were dismissed and 8,595 cases were withdrawn during FY 1996, costing taxpayers $780 apiece. In the same year, 2,509 unfair labor practice charges were actually investigated and prosecuted in front of an Administrative Law Judge. The average cost for these cases is $17,500. Finally, 174 charges were appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals in FY 1996, at a cost of $42,700 each. 
As you can see, the Federal government spends millions to process, investigate, and prosecute these complaints. And because most of these charges are frivolous, taxpayers are actually funding the extortion of employers and the manipulation of government institutions. I believe it is wrong to use tax dollars to support this fraudulent and wasteful system. 
Mr. President, the solution to this problem is simple. An employer should not be required to hire any individual whose overriding purpose is to disrupt the workplace or inflict economic harm on the business. By making this clear, the Truth in Employment Act will bring fairness to our labor laws and will go a long way toward eliminating waste and fraud in government. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation and vote in favor of cloture.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, how we vote is not always clear to Americans. For the average citizen it is not easy to keep straight whether a `yea' is for or against something--whether it is a vote to pass a bill or table it. It also can be difficult to sort out where their senators stand when a particular vote covers many provisions in one `package.' Which provision was the `yea' vote for or the `no' vote against? 
But, Mr. President, the vote on cloture of the American Missile Protection Act (S. 1873) this morning is not at all one of those `confusing' votes. I can think of no vote where it can be seen more clearly exactly where each senator stands. This morning's vote was black and white. This morning's vote shows who takes the most important function of the Federal Government--national security--seriously. The Senate failed for a second time this year to invoke cloture on the bill. Forty-one Senators, all Democrats, voted against protecting American families from the greatest threat to our homeland. 
Nothing can be more frightening than the thought of an attack on our homes by another nation using nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons. Not thinking about it or pretending that it won't happen are absolutely not grownup ways to deal with this reality. 
Opponents of the American Missile Protection Act claim concern with the fact that the bill mandates deployment of a National Missile Defense system. They claim that this bill ties our hands because when we finally do develop the capability to deploy a system, there might not be a need for it. 
Might not be a need?? Let me be completely up-front. It's a myth that we have plenty of time to build a missile defense capability and hold off deployment until some potential future threat develops. The American people need to get that scenario out of their minds. The system is needed today, right now, and it is time for this Administration to get off its slow-track development program. 
Just two months ago, the Rumsfeld Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States concluded that `ballistic missiles armed with WMD payloads pose a strategic threat to the United States.' The commission did not say there might be a future threat, it said there is a present threat. Further, India and Pakistan have conducted nuclear tests, North Korea just launched a two-stage missile over Japan, and we don't know Iraq's chemical weapons capability because the inspectors have not been allowed to look. If these events do not convince my colleagues on the other side of the aisle of our need for a National Missile Defense system, what will it take to convince them? Do they actually have to see a missile strike? 
So, Mr. President, I do not take seriously this criticism that S. 1873 is flawed because it mandates deployment of a missile defense system that may not be needed. This sounds more like a smoke screen. I believe that the Democrat's real hope is to try and resuscitate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which was voided by the breakup of the Soviet Union. Getting back the ABM Treaty seems to be all consuming for some senators, and a U.S. National Missile Defense system gets in the way of their goal. 
Mr. President, after today's vote it is very clear to American families that their senators either support real national security action or are trying to convince the citizens that a paper treaty will be sufficient to protect them--there is no middle ground.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. If our esteemed Majority Leader would yield for a moment, I also would like to commend Senator Shelby and Chairman Campbell for their work in this area. Recent Congressional debates over federal regulatory programs, such as the revised particulate matter standard, and the criteria for listing new species under the Endangered Species Act, show the importance of providing the public with full access to federal research data to validate research results and gain the proper public support. The importance of this issue is also reflected in a recent court decision on environmental tobacco smoke that concluded that the Environmental Protection Agency had been selective in including research data in its overall assessment of health risks. Public access to research data would help ensure that federal rules are based on the best science possible. I too would like to commend Senator Shelby and Senator Campbell, Chairman of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, for their efforts to correct this problem.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) Program as part of the Treasury Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 1999. I am pleased to see that this legislation increases national funding from $10 million to $13 million for 1999. Gangs are a serious problem in this country. We must be proactive in finding ways to stop gang violence. 
A recent article in the Washington Post noted that nearly twice as many teenagers reported gangs in their schools in 1995 as they did in 1989. School administrators from North Carolina have found that gangs and violence go together. I believe that when we couple gangs and violence with drug use and weapons, we have a formula for disaster. 
Fortunately, programs like the GREAT program educate children about the perils of gangs and offer alternative ways to resolve conflicts rather than through violence. I would like to thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Treasury and General Government, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, for the inclusion of North Carolina counties in the GREAT program: Bladen, Cumberland, Mecklenburg, New Hanover, and Wake. I hope that more communities in North Carolina and this country will follow their lead. 
Experts may say that small involvement in the GREAT program means that there is little gang activity in the state. I believe that we should not wait until there is evidence of a gang before we bring GREAT into a school district. We must be proactive in educating our young people about the dangers of gangs. If we wait until there is a problem, then we may face a deadly situation like those faced this year by several of our nation's schools. We must act before it is too late. GREAT is a sound program which I am pleased to support.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation together with my good friend, Senator DeWine, to exempt licensed funeral directors from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
Under current law, licensed funeral directors do not meet the test for the `professionals' exemption under the Wage and Hour regulations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Consequently, they are not exempt from minimum wage and overtime requirements. Given the nature of their work--on-duty or on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year--this requirement places an economic hardship on small funeral homes and the families of licensed funeral directors. With erratic and unpredictable work hours, most licensed funeral directors would prefer the option of comp time in lieu of overtime pay in order to spend more time with their families. 
Requiring licensed funeral directors to be paid for overtime work forces small business owners to allocate revenues for that purpose, thereby inhibiting salaries and bonuses. To avoid the financial strain, some even resort to using only part-time funeral directors. 
Over the years, Congress has provided 17 exemptions to the Act. Included are such diverse exemptions as employees of amusement or recreational establishments, outside salespeople, seasonal agricultural workers, apprentices, employees of newspapers with a circulation of less than 4,000, switchboard operators of independently-owned telephone companies with fewer than 750 stations, and the more recent amendments related to criminal investigators, computer analysts, programmers, and software engineers. 
Mr. President, I strongly believe that small businesses, such as funeral homes, must be given flexibility to provide their key employees with the options for alternative overtime compensation in order for them to survive, grow, and remain the premier source of employment in our communities. 
In that regard and on behalf of your local funeral homes and their licensed funeral directors, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this amendment directs the General Accounting Office to take a close look at the health care benefit that we provide to our military dependents, retirees, and their survivors. Enough time has passed since we replaced CHAMPUS with the TRICARE program that it is now time to see whether or not we are providing a proper benefit. 
When I speak of a `proper benefit,' I use a very simple standard. I want to be sure that our men and women in uniform and their loved ones are being cared for as well as our civilian federal employees are. The Federal Employees Health Benefits program (FEHBP) provides civilian federal employees and retirees with a good health care benefit having a wide range of patient choice. It's the program that covers all of us in Congress, and my goal is to make sure that TRICARE is just as good for our military families. 
Mr. President, the FEHBP offers many different managed-care, fee-for-service, and preferred-provider plans from which to choose. If the civilian federal employee or retiree finds his or her health care plan to be inadequate, another plan of the same type can be chosen. For our military families, it is not so simple. With TRICARE, you only get a choice of one managed-care, one fee-for-service, or one preferred-provider plan. To paraphrase Henry Ford, you can pick any HMO-type plan that you want, as long as you choose TRICARE Prime. And if, for example, you are unhappy with TRICARE Prime, you either have to live with it, or go for the one fee-for-service or the one preferred-provider plan--there are no alternate managed-care plans. 
Now, I recognize that a comparison between the TRICARE plans and the FEHBP plans will have to be very subjective. The comparison should not be limited simply to objective cost factors, such as co-pays and premiums, but it must be expansive enough to consider factors such as patient satisfaction, administrative requirements, ceilings on reimbursements and timeliness of their payment, covered services, etc. This is why I want the GAO to do this study. They will be independent and can use a combination of objective analyses and subjective surveys and interviews to give us the most clear, unbiased picture. 
Of course, we would not have to worry about conducting studies or figuring out how to compare the quality of TRICARE with the FEHBP if we provided more customer choice. Ultimately, the best `study' of the quality of a product or service is its acceptance in the marketplace. For this reason, I have long favored considering Medicare subvention and making FEHBP available for military beneficiaries as well as civilians. But, with TRICARE only offering one of each type of plan and having a captive audience, there are no competitive pressures to keep providers focused on customer service, so this study is necessary. 
I am also concerned that Department of Defense policies with regard to TRICARE may be further limiting choice. The GAO should identify reasons why TRICARE Prime enrollees should have priority at Military Treatment Facilities. This decision may be effectively eliminating the TRICARE Standard and Extra options because to choose either of these options may close off treatment at a Military Treatment Facility. 
And there is another problem. Medicare-eligible military retirees, since the implementation of TRICARE are now having a very difficult time getting to see the doctor at the Military Treatment Facilities, if not facing an impossibility altogether. Let me explain. Because TRICARE Prime patients have first priority for medical treatment, retirees who wish to be served at a Military Treatment Facility have to sign up for TRICARE Prime--their choice for TRICARE Standard or Extra is effectively eliminated. But, the worst of it is that Medicare-eligible retirees are not eligible to participate in TRICARE at all. They and their Medicare-eligible dependents and survivors, if there are no appointments available at the Military Treatment Facility, are left with no military medical benefit, which we all know is contrary to the promise made to these veterans when they decided to make a career in the military. 
Mr. President, there is no reasonable explanation that I can think of that could justify a health care benefit for our men and women in uniform, their dependents, and survivors, and retirees who give and gave so much of their lives for our country, that is anything less than what we have provided for ourselves and for civil servants. My amendment will give us a clear idea whether the military medical benefit offered is truly `prime,' or even `standard,' or whether it is substandard and we need to take action.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee in a colloquy regarding the Senate's action on the Pulsed Fast Neutron Analysis (PFNA) program. On behalf of the many Senators on both sides of the aisle who support this initiative, I wish to thank you for agreeing to include an amendment to the FY 1999 DoD Appropriations bill that directs the Department of Defense (DoD) to immediately obligate all of the funds which Congress has mandated be used for a fair, and rigorous operational field demonstration of the PFNA system at a major U.S. border crossing or at a major U.S. port of entry.

It is my understanding that General Barry McCaffrey, Director of ONDCP, is willing to serve as the Executive Agent for the program next year and then assume full management control as long as the funds already appropriated by Congress are used to complete the activities planned under the FY 98 program. I expect that the Secretary of Defense and the Director of ONDCP will work together to ensure this transfer of authority and funding is carried out as expeditiously as possible.

In the light of the recent terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, our Nation's growing problem with drug smuggling and even the proliferation for weapons of mass destruction, it would be a tragedy if we did not take full advantage of the best technologies available to meet these threats. PFNA has enjoyed extraordinary success in laboratory tests, consistently detecting the presence of contraband in sealed containers well over 90 percent of the time and with false alarm rate near zero. No other technology, including X-ray, can come close to this level of detection.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. This would include space at a port of entry or border crossing where a test might be conducted. Once this is done, I hope that ONDCP and the Customs Service will provide the committee with a recommendation on the strategy to guide the possible future acquisition, deployment, and support of neutron interrogation systems, including PFNA, at land border crossings and ports of entry around the nation. I believe a useful assessment would provide: (1) a range of deployment options for the PFNA system; (2) a cost comparison between PFNA deployment options; and (3) an evaluation of how the employment of new and existing contraband detection technologies might be optimized to meet changing threats to U.S. security. 
I will consult with my colleague from Alaska and with the chairman of the Senate Treasury, Postal Appropriations Subcommittee, on what resources might be available through that subcommittee to support a continuation of the PFNA test program and the possible procurement of multiple systems in future years.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Brownback-Faircloth marriage penalty relief amendment. 
In fact this amendment is the same as the legislation I originally offered with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and many others to provide relief from the marriage penalty tax. 
Mr. President, in listening to my colleagues, I find very little opposition to the notion that couples should not be penalized with additional taxes simply because they choose to marry. 
As several members have stated, the Congressional Budget Office has determined that married couples are taxed an extra $1,400 on average more than singles. This legislation would correct that problem. 
Relief from the marriage penalty tax is an idea which enjoys broad, bipartisan support in the Senate. In fact, legislation which I offered as an amendment to the Fiscal Year 1999 Budget resolution established marriage penalty tax relief as among the highest priorities of the Senate this year. That amendment passed this body by a vote of 99 to 0. 
Clearly, there is no objection to providing this much needed relief. 
Some of my colleagues have suggested that the bill before us is not the appropriate bill to serve as a vehicle for this tax relief. In fact, the only objections I can find to this amendment are based on procedure, and not about the merits of the issue. 
I understand the concerns raised about procedure, but I would urge my colleagues to consider the injustice of this marriage penalty tax, and join me and the other sponsors of this amendment to eliminate this unfair burden. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the motion to table the Brownback-Faircloth amendment. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as you know there has been severe financial turmoil in Asia. This has lead to a dramatic increase in the trade deficit. It is my understanding that exports from Asian nations are up significantly, particularly with respect to textiles. This is an important industry to my home State of North Carolina. My principal concern is that when quotas are met, there will be an attempt to illegally ship textiles into this country through other countries, like Mexico. This is a process known as `transhipment.' As you know, the U.S. Customs Service has frontline responsibility for enforcing the laws that would bar illegal shipments into this country. We have already written our Senate report, but I would hope that in Conference you would advocate report language that would encourage the Customs Service to step up their enforcement activities in this area.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1151. Credit unions have played an important role in our financial system. They have given a helping hand and a hand-up to millions of Americans whom it otherwise would not have been available to. Nearly 70 million Americans are members of credit unions. I consider myself a strong supporter of credit unions. We have over 195 in my State, including the second largest in the Nation. Over 2 million people in North Carolina are members of credit unions. I do not believe that we should limit their access to credit, and it is the principal reason I support the credit unions in this bill. We have to protect and preserve credit unions for the future. 
Mr. President, this bill is not without controversy. This bill started out as a court case in my home State. The case went to the Supreme Court that began in North Carolina and was decided against the credit unions. 
Now, there has been a lot of heated conversation about this legislation. Some of what has been said is correct, but a large part of it has been incorrect. 
Very simply, this is what it would do. This legislation would allow multiple groups, each with their own common bond, to be part of one credit union. The Federal Credit Union Act of 1934 was unclear on this point. But beginning in 1982, the National Credit Union Administration has allowed groups to be part of a credit union. The real question is whether Congress will support the policy that has, in effect, been the law since then, since the 1980s. I have to conclude that the Congress will, but they are only going to do it with some limitations. 
Essentially, this is why we have to change the law. 
And let me say, the changing marketplace has changed the banking world too. Glass-Steagall--the bank law that separates banks and securities firms has almost no meaning in today's society. In fact, it is little adhered to. 
Mr. President, the workplace has changed dramatically since 1934. The era of working for one company, with one occupation, with one skill--for all of one's life is gone. Technology and global markets have forever changed our way of life. 
These changes mean that a one group credit union will have difficulty surviving in today's day and age. 
Banks used to not have banks outside their own States, and primarily within their own community. Banks used to be able to sell insurance in only towns of 5,000 people. Now they are limited to the United States. 
We need to update our bank laws as well--and I hope and anticipate that we can do that. 
And I have not stood in the way of the bank regulators that have had to update our laws through executive action, rather than the Congress acting. 
And I think the same view is reasonable with respect to credit unions. 
But--as I said--there should be some limitations--and there are limitations in this bill. 
Credit unions do not pay taxes. I am adamantly opposed to taxing credit unions. 
The answer to this problem is not to impose taxes on credit unions. The answer is to reduce taxes for small banks. That is why Senator Allard and I introduced legislation yesterday to make tax law changes to help community banks. 
We need to reduce regulation for small banks--that is why I will vote for Senator Shelby's amendment to remove CRA for community banks. 
We do not need to punish credit unions to help small banks--I think we should simply help small banks. 
Let me also say this. 
We have done a number of things to change and reform the credit union industry. 
This bill is not without tough provisions for the credit union industry and some of them are pretty tough provisions. 
We have limited commercial loans to be made by credit unions to 12 percent of their assets. Before now, there was no limit. And there was only a study in the House bill. 
We have required the NCUA to charter separate credit unions where possible. 
We have limited the use of geographic charter credit unions to a `defined' community--so that there cannot be abuses in the chartering of geographic credit unions. 
Finally, we have imposed prompt corrective action on credit unions--and we have essentially established minimum net worth requirements for credit unions. 
So there are many reforms to the industry that have not been discussed by the opponents of this bill. 
Mr. President, let me just say again--this is an important bill to keep credit unions going into the future and into the 21st century. 
If we don't pass this bill--it is uncertain if people can continue to join credit unions. And there is the possibility that persons could lose their right to be a member of a credit union. The district court has not yet decided how this case will be implemented. 
It is simply wrong to suggest that if we don't pass this, that given benign neglect, it will probably go away. It will not. We have to pass this bill so that current members are assured of keeping their status. 
Mr. President, I thank you and urge pass passage of the bill. But let me comment also on the two pending amendments. 
First, I support Senator Gramm's amendment. 
It makes absolutely no sense to put CRA on credit unions. Credit unions are member organizations to begin with. The very nature of credit unions is to lend to their members. To put CRA on it is redundant, and ridiculous. 
The provisions in the H.R. 1151 is redundant, as I said, and is, frankly, absurd. Anybody that has looked at it knows it. 
I strongly support Senator Gramm's amendment. We do not need CRA for credit unions. We need to reduce the burden for small banks. Every bank that I have talked to has a problem with the CRA. It is too subjective. There are too few definitive standards. Small banks spend an inordinate amount of their time and money complying with Federal law when their lending is almost totally local. 
I support Senator Shelby's amendment because CRA makes no sense for small banks. Small banks can't survive, if they don't lend in their community. That is what CRA says they need to do. But for a small bank, where else does it lend if it is not in its community? 
That was the purpose of the CRA to begin with. It simply is not today viable. To take deposits and lend in a small community is what community banks do. 
The Senator's amendment exempts 8,000 banks. But they account for only 11 percent of the assets of the industry. In fact, these 8,000-plus banks have roughly the same amount of assets as one of our North Carolina banks. It is not an unreasonable amendment. Small banks are shrinking, they are disappearing, and the more burden we put on them the less there will be. 
Just as I don't think credit unions threaten big banks, I don't think exempting small banks from CRA is a threat to the CRA. 
The Shelby amendment only exempts 11.7 percent of the assets of the banks of this country. 
As I said, we have one bank in North Carolina with roughly the same amount of assets. 
Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor.  
Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I wish to enter into a colloquy with Senator Gregg in order to emphasize the funding needs of North Carolina in regards to Pfiesteria and the expertise available to research this toxic microbe at N.C. State university. 
Pfiesteria is a toxic microbe that kills fish and causes widespread fish disease. Its toxins are known to affect many species of commercially important finfish and shellfish. 
Pfiesteria is also highly toxic to people--it causes subtle, but serious, impacts on human health. People who are exposed to toxic outbreaks of Pfiesteria, where fish are dead or filled with open bleeding sores from this creature's toxins, can be seriously hurt as well. 
Medical studies have shown that fishermen and other people whom have been exposed to these toxic outbreaks have suffered profound memory loss and learning disabilities for months afterward. Laboratory workers exposed to airborne toxins from Pfiesteria have had other health impacts that have lingered for years, suggesting the potential for some long-term, lingering health problems for people in estuaries where toxic outbreaks occur. 
Pfiesteria's toxins are extremely potent--People are hurt from these toxins if they have contact with the water, or even if they breathe the air over places where Pfiesteria is attacking fish. These toxins affect the human nervous system. They also strip the skin from fish, make deep bleeding sores, and suppress the immune system. Small amounts of the toxins can make fish very sick in three-five seconds and kill them in five minutes. 
Pfiesteria was first discovered in 1991, as a major cause of fish kills in the Albemarle--Pamlico Estuary of North Carolina. This estuary is of great importance to the commercial fishing industry of this country. It is the second largest estuary on the U.S. mainland, and it supplies half of the total area used by fish from Maine to Florida as nursery ground. Recently, Pfiesteria also affected small numbers of fish in the largest estuary on the U.S. mainland, the Chesapeake Bay. 
Pfiesteria, and its close relatives, have been confirmed in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern U.S. Toxic Pfiesteria and its close relatives are believed to be widely distributed in many warm temperate estuaries and coastal waters of the country and the world. 
Pfiesteria thrives in polluted waters that are over-enriched in nutrients from sewage and other wastes. With exponential human population growth a reality for many coastal areas of our country, more of our people are living and working near waters where these toxic outbreaks occur. 
Pfiesteria has affected the largest and second largest estuaries on the U.S. mainland with major economic impacts. Its toxic outbreaks have caused millions of dollars of damage to seafood, tourism, and other industries in coastal areas. Thus, Pfiesteria has become a high profile national issue for human health and the coastal economy. Its toxic outbreaks are expected to increase in coming years, associated with sewage and other wastes. 
Pfiesteria can have potentially devastating impacts on our fish resources. Beyond easily detected fish kills, Pfiesteria affects fish at the population level by severely impairing their reproduction, the survival of their eggs and young, and their ability to fight disease. 
Pfiesteria's impacts on human health are also serious: Imagine what it would be like to appear normal, but to have no idea of where you are, to be unable to put words into sentences, or to understand English. You have lucid moments in which you realize that something is terribly wrong; then you slide back down. As you begin to recover, you must take reading lessons to be able to read again. Imagine life style changes--that even after you are able to test normally for learning and memory, you must compensate because you have lost the ability to process information as quickly as you could before the illness occurred, and you do not recover it. Imagine not being able to strenuously exercise because when you try, you develop severe bronchitis or pneumonia. Consider what it would be like to be a fairly young, energetic person who must be on antibiotics more than a third of the year, five years after being affected . . . what it would be like to watch as increasingly potent antibiotics do not help you recover from the most recent, nearly constant illness, and to fear the prospect of reaching the point at which the most potent antibiotics no longer can help. This description characterizes the lives of several laboratory workers five to seven years following Pfiesteria toxin exposure. 
In North Carolina, Pfiesteria has poisoned and killed millions of fish nearly every year from 1991, when scientists first discovered it, to the present. Last year, its toxic outbreaks also killed about 30,000 fish in Chesapeake waters. 
Thus, the Albemarle-Pamlico, which is of such great importance to fisheries along the Atlantic Seaboard, has been hit hardest by Pfiesteria. North Carolina also has the world's foremost scientific expertise on Pfiesteria. 
Dr. JoAnn M. Burkholder is a Professor of Aquatic Botany and Marine Sciences at North Carolina State University, and a Pew Fellow. She obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in zoology from Iowa State University, a Master of Science in aquatic botany from the University of Rhode Island, and a Ph.D. in botanical limnology from Michigan State University. Dr. Burkholder's research over the past 25 years has emphasized the nutritional ecology of algae, dinoflagellates, and seagrasses, especially the effects of cultural eutrophication on algal blooms and seagrass disappearance. Since co-discovering the toxic dinoflagellate, Pfiesteria piscidia, in 1991, she has worked to characterize its complex life cycle and behavior, its stimulation by nutrient over-enrichment, and its chronic/sublethal as well as lethal impacts on commercially important finfish and shellfish in estuaries and aquaculture facilities. 
Howard Glasgow is the Director of North Carolina State University Acquatic Botany Laboratories. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Marine Biology from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. Mr. Glasgow is now finishing a Ph.D. degree in Marine Sciences from North Carolina State University. Before joining the Aquatic Botany Program at NCSU in 1990 Mr. Glasgow was President and CEO of Glasgow Electronics (North Carolina's 2nd largest electronics servicing and engineering organization) were in 1989 he was nominated Businessman of the year and appointed as a member of Who's Who In U.S. Executives. His scientific interests compliment Dr. Burkholder's, and together they have characterize Pfiesteria's complex life cycle and behavior. Including research describing Pfiesteria's responses to stimulation by nutrient over-enrichment, and its chronic/sublethal as well as lethal impacts on commercially valuable finfish and shellfish in estuaries and aquaculture facilities. 
The researchers who discovered it as a major cause of fish kills in estuaries have been working with Pfiesteria at North Carolina State University for the past decade. Nearly all of the science articles that have been published on Pfiesteria--that is, nearly all of the information available about it--has been contributed by that laboratory. 
Armed with this formidable expertise, these researchers are poised to make the most rapid and significant progress to understand and control Pfiesteria, so that our people, and our fisheries, do not continue to be seriously hurt by it. 
Despite the demonstrated expertise of this laboratory on the Pfiesteria issue, very little federal funding support has reached it. 
These researchers are well-known for their leadership role in providing information about Pfiesteria that is critically needed by coastal resource managers, policy makers, and fishermen and many other folk who utilize our estuaries. Their research laboratory is located in the heart of the area where toxic Pfiesteria outbreaks have been most severe. 
The funding would also make it possible for the most experienced researchers to determine the environmental conditions that promote toxic activity by Pfiesteria, so that its toxic production can be significantly reduced, and so that we can develop effective management strategies to discourage Pfiesteria's growth. 
This funding would make it possible to achieve rapid progress in identifying the suite of toxins that produced by Pfiesteria, so that improved tools can be developed to diagnose Pfiesteria toxin exposure in people, to ensure that seafood is safe for human consumption, and to develop medicines to reduce the impacts of Pfiesteria's toxins in people and help them recover.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. The United States has taken a firm conservation position with respect to ICCAT management recommendations. Our domestic fishermen comply with a tightly managed quota designed to rebuild this stock through international cooperation. Through efforts of the NMFS and our fishermen, we harvest only the annual amount specified for the American fishery, and we abide by the minimum swordfish size requirement of 33 lbs. Indeed, despite our harvest of less than five percent of the total Atlantic swordfish catch, the United States is working within the system to manage this resource in a sustainable fashion. 
Unfortunately, however, not all countries are playing by the rules. Several foreign nations are allowing the harvest of swordfish smaller than the American minimum legal size. Further, this `black market' swordfish often time find its way into our restaurants and fish markets, and we are effectively undermining our resource rebuilding programs and our ability to compete in the marketplace by allowing this situation to continue. 
I concur with my colleague from New Hampshire that it is time for us to reign in this illegal activity--to enforce our fishery regulations equally across the board--and protect our domestic fishermen who are operating just as we have asked them to. The intent of the Congress in the swordfish conservation initiative is to arm NMFS with the financial resources necessary to develop a program to restrict the importation of Atlantic swordfish that are below the United States minimum size. I understand NMFS is examining a number of possible management options, including dealer permits, country of origin documentation requirements, and the designation of restricted ports of entry for Atlantic swordfish to facilitate inspections. 
I encourage them to continue in their deliberations, communicate fully with our fishermen, and implement a program to address our resource and equitability concerns.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise as a co-sponsor of the Emergency Farm Financial Relief Act of 1998, which will permit farmers to receive their fiscal year 1999 Agriculture Market Transition Act (AMTA) payments at the start of the fiscal year in October of 1998 rather than the semi-annual payments in December of 1998 and September of 1999. 
This bill thus readies some $5.5 billion to help farmers cope with their current cash shortage that stems from high debts and low commodity prices. 
This is a first to address the farm crisis, and it will help some farmers with their cash flow, but there are a lot of other growers in rough straits. Therefore, this is just a first step, and we need to take more aggressive steps to open export markets to American commodities. 
This bill will not solve the farm crisis in North Carolina. In fact, because we managed to preserve the tobacco and peanut programs in the 1996 farm bill, the acceleration of AMTA contract payments will be limited, for the most part, to cotton, corn, and wheat growers. 
The fields of North Carolina, Mr. President, are dry. All the farmers are in the same dire situation, and the scope of this bill is limited, but we need to address the tobacco growers. 
I am concerned that efforts to bring the tobacco program to the Senate floor will get torn to shreds, but, certainly, the anti-tobacco crowd needs to rise above politics and realize that this is about farm families and family farms. 
In addition to cash flow assistance, farmers need aggressive leadership to boost exports, and President Clinton needs to pay attention to farmers and to use the tools we gave him--like the Export Enhancement Program--to secure foreign markets for American agricultural commodities. Farmers just can't afford this continued silence from President Clinton. Agriculture is our number one export, so, clearly, we need the White House to engage on this issue. 
Thank you, Mr. President, and I urge my colleagues to join us in support of the Emergency Farm Financial Relief Act of 1998.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, we all know that the Internet has become the tool of choice for sexual predators and child pornographers. In fact, the Senate just yesterday attempted to deal with pornography on the Internet by refining the Communications Decency Act. 
There are numerous legislative proposals to deal with this issue. 
I especially want to thank Chairman Gregg. Under his leadership in this bill, he has provided millions for the Justice Department to investigate these crimes. And his leadership on this issue is to be commended--for the method which he has handled it, and the far-reaching effect it is going to have. 
I asked the FBI what tool is it that they most need to go after sexual predators on the Internet. What would do the most good? They tell me that a legislative change that is most needed by them is administrative subpoena authority to quickly get records on sexual predators--that administrative subpoena authority would do more to expedite matters than anything else we could do. 
Mr. President, the FBI has an operation known as `Innocent Images.' The operation was created in the wake of the disappearance of a small boy in Maryland. The FBI found an elaborate operation being used to lure children over the Internet. That was its sole purpose. Thus far, the operation has net 200 indictments, 150 convictions, and 135 arrests. 
Literally every day you cannot pick up a newspaper without reading about a case of a sexual predator looking for children on the Internet. 
When the FBI testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee in March, Director Freeh said that when an agent, pretending to be a child, signed onto a `chat room' with 23 other children, 22 of the 23--23 supposed children--22 of the 23 turned out to be adults seeking improper contact with the girl, the one out of the 23. 
That is how pervasive this problem is today on the Internet. 
What the FBI needs most is an administrative subpoena authority for cases that involve a Federal violation related to sexual exploitation and abuse of children. 
They have informed my staff that this would be the most useful tool they could have in order to crack these cases. 
This would allow them to quickly access records from Internet service providers regarding a potential sexual predator using the Internet to prey on children. Without this authority, the FBI has to go through a very cumbersome process of contacting the U.S. attorney and convening a grand jury just to get this information. 
The FBI has already had this administrative subpoena authority in narcotics cases and health care fraud cases. But surprisingly they do not have it in sexual predator cases involving our children. 
I know that health care fraud is important. But it is not really more important than catching sexual predators. 
Mr. President, there is a very practical reason this is needed as well. 
The FBI task force on this issue has had to get 6,200 grand jury subpoenas for routine subscriber information off of the Internet. This would reduce the administrative burden on U.S. attorneys, and certainly on the grand jury system. Further, because of grand jury secrecy rules, this information cannot be shared with State and local law enforcement officials. So once it is acquired through a grand jury, there still are impediments to using it. 
Together with local law enforcement police, the FBI needs help to catch these people. It is very important that we move in this direction. But this is a narrow approval of the use of the administrative subpoena, so that cases involving Internet crimes on children can be solved quickly and the information obtained quickly. 
Mr. President, I strongly urge the Senate to accept this amendment. Mr. President, I understand the amendment is to be accepted. I urge its a adoption. 
Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I wish to enter into a colloquy with Senator Gregg in order to clarify a spending item in the pending Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill. 
I commend the Chairman on this bill, and for his attention to providing funding to the Graveyard of the Atlantic Museum, a public, nonprofit, educational institution, designed for Hatteras Island, one of North Carolina's Outer Bank islands. The Museum is dedicated to the preservation, advancement and presentation of the maritime history and shipwrecks of the Outer Banks, from 1524 until the present. 
Over three million tourists visit the Outer Banks each year, the vast majority of them interstate visitors. It is expected that approximately 100,000 tourists would visit the Museum, thus paying the full cost of running it, since a modest fee would be charged. 
The Museum has received federal, state, local and private funding in the past. Earlier this decade, Congress appropriated $800,000 from NOAA's construction budget towards this project. 
I wish to clarify that the bill's provision of $1,500,000 from NOAA's facilities budget to the `Outer Banks Community Foundation on the condition that these funds are matched by a non-Federal source' is intended solely to be passed through to the Museum.

<TEXT>
 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Crime Doesn't Pay Prison Act, a bill to curb the flood of frivolous prisoner lawsuits over prison conditions. 
The primary purpose of this act is to articulate an objective national standard for measuring the minimum decency of prison conditions. The Constitution does not dictate a minimum standard of living for inmates, much less an enjoyable comfortable level of living. This should be Congress' job. 
In addition to the initial goal of a national prison standard, this bill has other purposes. It would ensure that State governments are required to spend only that amount necessary to achieve the minimum standard for conditions of confinement mandated by the Constitution. It would further ensure that the Federal courts require only that prison conditions do not constitute the unnecessary infliction of pain or neglect upon inmates, such that they are deprived of the minimum civilized measure of life's basic necessities. 
Absent a national standard, convicted criminals enjoy a standard of living higher than that of the law-abiding, working poor. According to the federal government, the standard of living for the law-abiding poor is $8,000 a year. Yet for a convicted criminal, the average expenditure per prisoner amounts to an unbelievably high $23,000 a year. 
Absent a national standard, the standard of living in prison will continue to escalate. Since 1960, the average total state expenditure per inmate has increased almost twice as fast as median income, and more than twice as fast as the poverty threshold. This is unacceptable. 
Many unnecessary amenities, such as regulation softball fields, video games, and premium pay cable channels are provided to criminals, contribute to the increasing standard of living in prisons. Other amenities include expensive musical instruments for traveling `choirs,' not to mention martial arts training and boxing. Perhaps here is a primary cause of prison violence. How can one counter the violence if taxpayers' dollars are being spent on the very classes which teach and encourage it? 
Absent a national standard, criminals will continue to fight for their `right' to amenities in prison, claiming that denial of same `violates' their Eighth Amendment right against `cruel and unusual punishment.' Any violation of our Bill of Rights is, most assuredly, a vital concern and should not be tolerated. 
Nor, however, should frivolous claims which do nothing but clog our court systems and deny our citizens speedy access to justice for legitimate cases. Several actual cases demonstrate this. One includes a Utah criminal who claimed that his Eighth Amendment rights were violated when he was provided with Converse tennis shoes, rather than L.A. Gear or Reebok. Another case dealt with an Arkansas criminal who was appalled that he was given paper napkins during meals instead of cloth napkins. Yet another ludicrous example involves a Missouri criminal, who claimed cruel and unusual punishment when he was not provided with salad bars or brunches on weekends. This is absolutely preposterous. 
The benefits of this `Crime Doesn't Pay Prison' Act are extensive. As of right now, 25% of the state and federal courts' civil dockets are comprised of inmate challenges to conditions of confinement. This bill would reduce this number considerably. It also frees state Attorneys General to pursue litigation on behalf of the citizenry. 
The bill would drastically reduce the increasing cost of incarceration, allowing the money saved thereby to be used instead for the expansion of existing prisons. 
It puts an end to the injustice of convicted criminals enjoying a higher standard of living, by mere virtue of their imprisonment, than the law-abiding working poor. 
In addition to giving the prison administrators the flexibility to find that medium of good order and discipline within the prisons, perhaps most importantly, this bill would demonstrate to prisoners that criminal behavior will not be rewarded with luxuries beyond the reach of law-abiding, poor Americans. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to address the imminent wave of Year 2000 lawsuits that will flood our courts and enrich thousands of trial lawyers at the expense of American consumers. I also rise to commend President Clinton for his announcement that he will propose legislation to shield businesses from lawsuits based on information shared in efforts to solve these so-called Y2K problems. 
Based on the information that I have received, I believe that his approach is too narrow, but it is a step in the right direction. 
It is a step away from greedy trial lawyers and litigation towards creative computer programmers and solutions. 
We face the so-called millennial glitch--the Year 2000 problem--because most software programs cannot recognize dates after December 31, 1999. 
Over the past twenty years, to save computer memory that was prohibitively expensive, programmers shortened the date field in software programs to hold only the last two digits of the year. 
This glitch will cause computer systems to malfunction and to crash if these programs are not rewritten and fixed. Certainly, this is a major problem, one that has sent computer programmers scrambling for solutions. 
This is one of the most important issues before businesses, Mr. President, and the costs of Y2K compliance are estimated to be hundreds of billions of dollars. The junior Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, is to be commended for his fine work on the Year 2000 subcommittee. 
We will face computer chaos if these problems are not resolved before the clock strikes midnight on December 31, 1999. We are looking at the possibility of power outages, frozen bank accounts, even the specter of a global recession. 
Unfortunately, though, the solutions are not all clear. 
The efficient exchange of information among the involved parties--programmers, computer companies, and consumers--is critical. We will never find solutions if all parties are not free to exchange all the relevant information. 
There is, however, a major hurdle to this critical exchange of information--the trial lawyers. The trial lawyers are excited by this Year 2000 problem. 
The Gartner Group, a consulting firm, estimates that the costs of the Y2K fix will run up to $600 billion, but that the legal costs--the trial lawyer taxes--may explode to one trillion dollars. 
Yes, Mr. President, $1 trillion for litigation. 
The projected trillion dollars in legal fees is yet another `trial lawyer tax' that greedy plaintiffs' lawyers impose on the American people in the form of increased costs inevitably passed on to consumers. 
The only jobs that the trial lawyers will create with their Year 2000 lawsuits are in the Lear jet factory as the orders come rolling in from these millionaire trial lawyers. 
The trial lawyers see another problem to exploit for financial gain, another opportunity for personal enrichment at the expense of the nation. 
The justifiable fear that businesses have of these trial lawyers is actually slowing down efforts to solve these critical problems. 
The Washington Post reported that, `Many companies have resisted exchanging technical advice with one another, delaying the pace of repair work, because they fear costly litigation if the information they provide inadvertently turns out to be inaccurate.' 
So, if the Social Security checks are late and the power gets turned off because computer companies cannot share information with the Federal government, you can thank the trial lawyers and their greed. 
The headlines may proclaim that the Social Security Administration is well along in its Year 2000 progress, and it is amongst the more responsive agencies, about 90 percent of the way to getting its computers ready. 
However, Mr. President, the Treasury Department--not the Social Security Administration--prints Social Security checks. The bad news is that Treasury is amongst the least responsive federal agencies to the Y2K issue. 
I hope that trial lawyers' greed won't leave older Americans shivering in the cold on New Year's Day in the year 2000 because everyone was too afraid of being sued to work together on a solution. 
As I said, the threat of a tidal wave of expensive litigation is shutting down the exchange of information, which is essential to a resolution of this issue. Further, however, the stampede of trial lawyers to the courthouse is also contributing to a shortage of qualified staff to deal with the issue. 
Many specialized firms that could work on this issue--firms with the technical expertise to do this job--are, in fact, avoiding it because they fear that they will become the target of the trial lawyers. 
The pattern is a familiar one. Trial lawyers, many of whom sue on a contingent fee basis that guarantees them a fixed percentage of their client's award, look for the parties with the `deep pockets.' A company with deep pockets is likely to be sued even if its systems are working properly. 
It's the old `supply chain': if a supplier, partner, or customer winds up with a Year 2000 problem, then the lawsuits will likely ripple all the way through the supply chain. 
One lawyer involved in this Year 2000 litigation observed that, if the problem drives the suppliers and customers into bankruptcy, the plaintiffs are likely to sue `everyone standing around the dead body.' 
The lawyers are getting ready, Mr. President, and there have been litigation summits in California. 
In fact, Bill Lerach, known for the securities `strike suits' that prompted reform legislation, is already filing Year 2000 lawsuits. He even filed one against Symantec Corporation, the maker of the popular Norton Anti-Virus software. Symantec is a golden oldie for Mr. Lerach. He sued this company in 1994 in one of his self-described `favorite' securities lawsuits. 
This outstanding member of the plaintiffs' bar even sued the pop singers `Milli Vanilli' for lip-synching its songs. He sued on behalf of fans who felt betrayed. 
This courtroom crusader also sued Ragu for selling a `fresh Italian' salad dressing that wasn't fresh or Italian. 
This is a man who paid $64,000 in fines for breaking electoral laws and paid court fines due to his lawsuit antics. 
It's time to choose, Mr. President, between these trial lawyers and the average Americans. 
Do we stand with Mr. Lerach and his greedy band of litigators or with the regular people who just want solutions to a problem that threatens their parents' Social Security checks? 
I commend President Clinton for his proposal. I believe that we need something far more broad, but it is a first step, and I am ready to move forward. 
Let's tell the trial lawyers and their Gucci-loafered lobbyists that we stand with the American people, not the special interests. 
I'm worried about the Social Security checks getting out on time, not the court papers getting in on time. 
I want solutions, not lawsuits. I'm looking out for the American people and their interests, not the trial lawyers and the special interests. 
The trial lawyers want to turn the Year 2000 issue into a lawsuit `House of Horrors' but I'm here to deny them a building permit.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as a veteran, I rise in strong support of this amendment to restore funds for service-related medical conditions that result from tobacco use. This amendment offers a chance to reverse that cut, which the Clinton Administration proposed earlier in this process, and to reiterate our commitment to veterans. 
I voted for the transportation bill that included this cut because the bill increased North Carolina highway funds by more than $1.5 billion. I put a lot of hard work into that highway bill, and, certainly, there is not a member of the Senate more committed to a safe and efficient transportation infrastructure than I. However, after further review in the relevant committees over the past several months, this cut was exposed to some sunlight and revealed as a rush to judgment and a disservice to American veterans. 
Frankly, this episode illustrates that we need to be better attuned to veterans issues, and we need to be more cautious about the effects of these provisions. As a veteran of the United States Army and the junior Senator from North Carolina, a State that is home to some 700,000 former soldiers, I cherish opportunities to serve our veterans. For example, I set up small constituent services offices across North Carolina to best service their needs, because I know that not all veterans--certainly not those wounded in the line of duty--are as mobile as the general population. 
I urge the Senate to fulfill our commitment to American veterans. The facts are now clear. This amendment presents a clear choice. Yes or no. We stand with veterans or we do not. I choose to stand with those who served our flag and our nation in her times of need.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this is the wrong time for a debate on tobacco taxes. No one is opposed to food safety, but I'm not so enthusiastic about a plan that raises taxes on already cash-strapped tobacco farmers to pay for new USDA bureaucrats. 
Farmers all over the country are hurting, and we're pledging to help them, but this amendment will continue to hold up our work on this bill. 
We all know that this is just politics because the House will `blue slip' the bill. 
This is certainly the wrong time to make things worse for tobacco farmers--the real effect of this amendment. This is a misguided attempt to tax small farmers to pay for the Clinton Administration's new spending proposals. 
Mr. President, like farmers everywhere, tobacco farmers are hurting. The southeast is dry. We don't know how much tobacco the companies will buy. We shouldn't be passing any amendments that make their lives any tougher. This will do just that. 
So, the tobacco farmer is about to get hit--again. Like he has been throughout this tobacco debate, the farmer is forgotten. 
The farmer will get hit with lower prices for his tobacco as the companies try to hold the line on costs. 
What happened to all the talk about helping farmers, the demands for action? 
Instead, this amendment proposes to throw up another hurdle in their way, another obstacle to making the payments, in order to fund President Clinton's new spending. 
The companies will take this tax out of the price paid to the farmer. This will cost some farmers their farms. Like a lot of farmers, they are on the edge, and we certainly shouldn't pass legislation to make it worse. 
American tobacco is the most expensive in the world, and the tobacco companies may respond to higher costs with increased use of imported tobacco. 
Let me say it again: the tobacco farmer can't afford another drop in income. His production quota keeps dropping, but the loan balances keep growing. 
This amendment is an attempt to score political points. Let's not play political games at the expense of good public policy. 
Further, this amendment initiates a tax measure in the Senate. The federal budget is 1.6 trillion dollars, but this amendment would raise taxes, yet again, on small farmers to pay for more bureaucrats. 
It's wasteful and unconstitutional. 
Tax and spend. Tax and spend. 
I want to commend the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the agriculture appropriations subcommittee for their work. 
This is a critical bill for my State and includes a number of important provisions for my farmers. I am reluctant to interfere with it, but if this amendments passes, I will be forced to do so on behalf of those very farmers. 
I will personally call the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and alert him to `blue slip' this bill. 
This amendment is anti-farmer, Mr. President. We just passed a Sense of the Senate resolution declaring our intent to help farmers. We just added an amendment for disaster assistance that will aid farmers in my State. 
How we can turn around and pass an anti-farmer amendment like this today? It's not right, Mr. President. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to support this amendment. This amendment does two things. First, it limits the FHA loan limit increase to the base level. Second, it creates an equal playing field for private sector and FHA loans. 
The current FHA limit for low-cost areas is $86,000. Although it gets indexed every year to median home sale prices in that area (so that it is increased annually), many believe that the limit is too low. Some argue that you cannot build new construction for $86,000. 
Now, I thought FHA was for first-time and low and moderate income home buyers. And I didn't realize that first-time home buyers were entitled to a brand new house. I thought FHA was supposed to help with `starter homes'. But some people feel otherwise and so this amendment will leave the increase in place that raises the limit from $86,000 to almost $109,000. 
However, I feel very strongly that we should not be raising the ceiling from the current $170,000 to more than $197,000. To qualify for a mortgage of $197,000 a person must make more than $75,000 a year. Only 15% of the people in this country make salaries that high--and most of those folks already own homes through the private sector. 
I don't think when President Roosevelt created FHA back in 1934 that he intended the program to help people making $75,000 a year. I don't think he intended for the federal government to back 100% of those loans. He believed that FHA should step in where the private sector cannot. The private sector is making these loans already. There is no reason to raise the limit to almost $200,000. 
Second, the amendment establishes a more level playing field between FHA and private sector loans so that borrowers are not steered towards FHA. Currently, lenders receive huge financial incentives to make loans through FHA. 
The first incentive is that the federal government insures 100% of the loan amount. There is no risk to the lender. Total to taxpayer. In the private sector, the lender assumes some of the risk of the loan so there is a greater stake in making sure that a borrower can pay back the loan. 
Second, under FHA, the lender makes twice the amount in servicing the loan than what he makes in the private sector. A servicing fee is charged for collecting the monthly mortgage payment, escrowing real estate taxes, etc. There is no justification why lenders should get much bigger servicing fees for FHA loans. CRS said that it would have no effect on FHA loans or increasing costs on homeownership. It only goes to the profit that the servicers make. 
Until we level the playing field lenders will have every economic incentive to steer borrowers towards FHA. Remember we've already given the lender a 100% federal guarantee that the loan will be paid back. Now we are making them rich in servicing fees. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. FHA has a lot of problems already. Default rates for FHA loans are already three to four times the rate of the private sector. Unless we take steps to change the situation and deter borrowers from being steered towards FHA, things may only get worse for the program and, ultimately, the country. Join consumer groups, the National Taxpayer Union and others in supporting this amendment.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am in strong support of S. 1882, the Higher Education Act of 1998. Every young person who wishes to pursue an education beyond the first 12 years should be able to do so. This bill contains important provisions to help students pay for the rapidly rising costs of college. It will benefit millions of students across the country in their pursuit of a higher education. I will highlight just a few of the provisions in this legislation. 
First, I support the compromise reached by my colleagues in the Labor and Human Resources Committee that provides a low interest repayment rate for student loans, while still allowing a rate necessary for the uninterrupted flow of loan capital from banks. The Clinton Administration wanted to place the entire loan program under the jurisdiction of the Department of Education. I am adamantly opposed to this proposal. There is no reason nor justification to have the Federal government run a program that is being provided efficiently by the private sector. In fact, we should be doing more to have the entire program run by private lenders. 
Second, I recognize the need for good teachers are more and more educators leave the field to pursue other professions. Improving the quality of the current and future teaching force calls for the improvement of preparation programs and the enhancement of professional development activities. I support North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt's Commission Report, `What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Future,' which has a goal to provide 100,000 national accredited teachers. This bill provides the means for accomplishing that goal by providing teacher certification. 
Finally, our nation is facing an alarming increase in violence and drug use on college campuses across the country. I was a co-sponsor of a bill to require that colleges report instances of rape or assault to the student body. I am pleased that this legislation was accepted as an amendment to this bill. I also support another provision of S. 1882 that would prevent students convicted of drug use or possession from being eligible for federal aid unless they complete a rehabilitation program. Taxpayers shouldn't support the tuition of students who recklessly use illegal drugs. 
To be competitive in the global economy, America needs to provide its students with the means to better their education. I believe we must protect programs for higher education. The Higher Education Act makes college more affordable and improves the academic environment for students and teachers. The bill is a sound piece of legislation which I am pleased to support.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that will improve the single family home foreclosure process. As we all know, bankruptcies have reached an all time high. It has also recently been reported that a record number of homeowners are shifting debt from credit cards to their homes. According to some estimates, there are 500,000 foreclosures taking place annually. 
I am greatly concerned that sometime in the future we may see a greater number of foreclosures on single family homes. I hope this will not be true, but if it is, I am introducing legislation to greatly improve the process for the homeowner. 
Currently, a common practice in most States is causing tens of thousands of consumers to be treated unfairly when their homes are sold following foreclosure proceedings. 
In all but three States, when a home is sold in a foreclosure sale, a lawyer normally advertises the event in an obscure local publication and in terms that the average person would have a hard time understanding. And the sales are typically held at times and places that are not designed to encourage bidding on the home. The sale may take place on the courthouse steps or in the backroom of law firm's office. 
Because the general public is rarely aware of these sales, it is not uncommon for the lending institution and the lawyer to be the only people present. 
In the long run, it is the homeowner who is the double loser. First, the homeowner has lost his home because of an inability to meet the mortgage payments. Second, the foreclosure sale usually does not result in the home bringing fair market value and this results in the now former homeowner facing a deficiency judgment that might not have occurred if the home had been sold in a public manner by auction. 
I think this process needs to be improved. Today, I am introducing a bill that would allow the homeowner to choose to have his or her foreclosure conducted by auction, in a manner that maximizes competitive bidding, and most importantly, is open and convenient to the general public. 
Under this process, in my view, both the homeowner and the lender will benefit greatly, because the property, when sold, will generate a true fair market value. There will most likely be no deficiency judgement against homeowners, and lenders will not have to collect their losses from insolvent homeowners. 
Mr. President, my legislation has already undergone testing in three States, Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts. The first two States require a true auction, not a lawyer's secret sale, under State law, while Massachusetts uses the real auction procedures based on a court order. In all three States, the program has worked with great results and both homeowners and lenders gain from its usage. 
Nothing in this legislation will affect State law regarding any other provision of foreclosures, except that the homeowner has the right to select an auction sale. Further, my legislation provides an exemption for State laws that are substantially similar in nature. 
Mr. President, I think this is a good bill that will help consumers when they are in a dire financial condition. Consumers can take comfort in the fact that they will have the option to a full, fair, open and public sale of their home should it come to foreclosure.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am appalled that the special interests and their Senate retainers triumphed again in their efforts to extend the `trial lawyer tax' imposed on the American people. The ultimate Washington special interest--the trial lawyers--will continue to line their pockets at the expense of American consumers and small businesses. 
As you know, I continue to advocate broad civil justice reform, and this was just a start. I want to recount a recent case that underscores the need for greater reform than the bill that we considered earlier today. A group of trial lawyers filed a class action lawsuit against the Bank of Boston over credits for mortgage escrow balances. This case, however, exposes the outrageous greed that motivates these trial lawyers eager to don the cloaks of the `consumer advocate.' The 715,000 depositors each received $2.19 in back interest from the lawsuit, but the current mortgage holders footed the bill for the lawyers to the tune of $91.33 each. That's right, Mr. President, they received $2.19 but their accounts were debited $91.33 for lawyers fees. 
I also read a 1995 gasoline price-fixing case in which 19 lawyers who won a $1 judgment were actually awarded more than $2 million in lawyers' fees in an Alabama federal court. This is outrageous! 
Therefore, Mr. President, I remain committed to broad and comprehensive civil justice reform. This was a modest bill, too modest in my opinion, but it was a first step. However, as the Majority Leader said, the trial lawyers control the modern Democratic Party. There is no other explanation for the stalwart liberal opposition to the most modest reforms to help American consumers and small businesses. The trial lawyers are the most powerful and feared special interest in Washington. 
Can you imagine Senators voting against this bill for any other reason? This was the essence of modest reform. 
This bill would have prevented litigation against retailers and wholesalers unless they altered products. It would have barred damage awards if the product was misused or altered by the consumer or if the user was influenced by drugs or alcohol. It would have limited punitive damages, but its limits on punitive damages would apply only to small businesses, which it defined as companies with fewer than 25 employees or with annual revenues of less than $5 million. It would have allowed punitive damages only where there was evidence of `conscious, flagrant disregard" for safety by the manufacturer and set limits at $250,000 or twice the actual damages a person suffered. 
Not exactly radical legislation, Mr. President, just common sense reform of a system run amok. 
We need to repeal, not just cut, the `trial lawyer tax.' The tort system that costs American consumers more than $132 billion per year. This is a 125% increase over the past 10 years. In fact, between 1930 and 1994, tort costs grew four times faster than the growth rate of the economy. 
Mr. President, this tort tax costs the average American consumer $616 per year, and it establishes the trial lawyers as tax collectors. These trial lawyers often sue under a contingent fee arrangement, an arrangement that remains illegal in England due to its dubious ethical basis, so the trial lawyers are bounty hunters. 
I am just increduous that we are unable to relieve the `trial lawyer tax' and to let the American people keep more of what they earn, because it is their money, not the trial lawyers' money! The trial lawyers are the most powerful special interest in Washington and I, for one, will continue to fight for the American people. I stand with the average American, Mr. President, not the well-heeled trial lawyer lobbyists and their big campaign checks.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am happy to announce that one of North Carolina's own has been elected president of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP). As president for the 1998-1999 season, Dr. Bruce R. Canaday, Pharm.D., FASHP will lead the nation's pharmacists in developing new and innovative patient care methods. His job will also include representing pharmacists from an array of varying disciplines such as hospitals, health maintenance organizations, long-term care facilities and home health care to name just a few. 
After earning his B.S. in pharmacy from Purdue University, Dr. Canaday went on to earn his Doctor of Pharmacy degree from the University of Tennessee. Dr. Canaday's previous experience include serving as Chair of the ASHP House of Delegates and member of the Board of Directors, and as president of the North Carolina Society of Health-System Pharmacists. 
When Dr. Canaday is not teaching future pharmacists under his title--Clinical Professor--at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, he is working as Director of the Department of Pharmacotherapy for the Coastal Area Health Education Centers in Wilmington, N.C. At both the coastal centers and at UNC, Dr. Canaday's contributions to the field of pharmacy have taught pharmacy students the information necessary for delivering effective and efficient healthcare to those in need. 
Mr. President, if those credentials are not enough for my colleagues to get a good idea of all this fine North Carolinian has done and continues to do, may I add that Dr. Canaday is a board certified pharmacotherapy specialist. As a specialist, he maintains a clinical practice at New Hanover Regional Medical Center in New Hanover, Tennessee. 
I am confident, Mr. President, that Dr. Canaday will do a fine job and be a successful leader for the American Pharmacy. Good leadership is important. And I think it is especially true today because of the complexity and command that healthcare and healthcare reform has in this evolutionary age. 
Mr. President, North Carolina continues to be blessed by the outstanding achievements of its men and women. The rise of Dr. Bruce R. Canaday to president of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists is a recent example. I hope that my colleagues will join me in congratulating Dr. Canaday for his latest achievement.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to add my support to the IRS conference report. But before I do, one issue has just come to my attention that I want to mention. I have been told the IRS is challenging the charitable contribution status of funds used to purchase a special stamp, a stamp that I sponsored along with my colleagues, Senator Feinstein and Senator D'Amato, to fund breast cancer research. The IRS has now come along and challenged whether that contribution is going to be deductible or not. 
I can tell them it will be. I hope the IRS does not fight the Congress and the American people in their effort to fight breast cancer. It is a worthwhile charitable cause, and it should not even be questioned. But I want to say to the IRS, if they continue to fight the breast cancer initiative, I will offer a legislative rider to the Treasury appropriations bill that will clarify and override their objections. 
Turning to the bill before us, if ever there was an agency of the Federal Government that needed overhaul, it is the Internal Revenue Service. For years the American people have been telling the Congress that IRS was out of control, punishing taxpayers with crushing penalties and interest, and a nightmare of rules and regulations that no one understood, and that included the IRS. I held a hearing on IRS abuse in Raleigh, NC, last December. The stories I heard were absolutely heartrending. If we had not known they were true, we could not have believed them. 
I introduced legislation to create a private citizens oversight board that would rein in the IRS. I propose giving the oversight board authority to cut through that impenetrable cloak of secrecy this agency has been showing the public for years. I want the board to have access to Internal Revenue working documents. I am pleased to see that much of what had been proposed has been put into this conference report. Chairman Roth deserves tremendous credit for putting this bill together. 
The IRS reform bill will create a new oversight board of private citizens. 
The board will have authority to review the policies and practices of the IRS. It will have access to documents which were previously shielded from the public and the Congress. 
This new board will help root out the abuses that were highlighted in the hearings that I held and the equally shocking hearings that the Finance Committee held. I don't think any of us were aware of what really was going on within the IRS and its relationship with the American taxpayers. 
The bill will provide protection from excessive penalties and interest and protect the spouse from tax cheats. 
This is not the end but the beginning of fundamental reform of the IRS--reform and a change of attitude. 
Make no mistake, many in the Internal Revenue Service will not be happy with this bill, and they will either want to foot drag the changes or alter them. But let me say that one great thing has happened to the IRS, and that is the new Commissioner, Mr. Charles Rossotti. He is going to bring a breath of fresh air to a very stale-air organization. He has experience in the private sector, and he is taking this job at great personal sacrifice. He has spent a major part of his career in data processing and in the type of electronic data processing and handling that the IRS needs, but in which they are so woefully inadequate. In fact, they spent $3 billion for new equipment and found that it did not work after they had spent the money. 
As a member of the Appropriations Committee which overseas the IRS budget, I intend to watch the IRS, and I will be there closely watching to see if they follow the reforms that this bill mandates. In particular, I am going to watch the IRS union representative who was made a member of the oversight board, despite my objections, as well as the objections of Senator Roth and others. My message to the unions and to the union representative and the rest of the IRS personnel and bureaucracy is this: Do not oppose IRS reform, but accept and take it and get going with making it the law of the land. The Congress and the American people have spoken, and this agency is going to be cleaned up with or without your acquiescence. If you try to undermine these reforms, there will be more legislation and stricter legislation in future sessions of the Congress. 
In summary, let me say to the IRS personnel and its representatives and the entire IRS bureaucracy that Congress is very closely observing the actions and will be observing the actions of the IRS in how it deals with the American people. Do not oppose us, support us, and we will have a great revenue collection service. Do not go back to the old ways, but move into the new law and do it with enthusiasm. 
Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield back the remainder of my time.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this bill, and it is long overdue. In a way, this is a tax cut bill, because it will cut the `trial lawyer tax' often referred to as the `tort tax.' 
The `trial lawyer tax' is equivalent to the amount of liability insurance that people pay to protect themselves from trial lawyers. They pay it because no one is safe anymore. 
We're looking at product liability cases here, but the problem extends far beyond product liability, and I remain committed to broad civil justice reform. 
If any Senators think this narrow bill is sufficient, let me mention a few recent verdicts from the tort capital of the United States, New York City. I am convinced that Senators will think twice before they put civil justice reform on the back burner after they hear these horror stories. 
A mugger on the New York City subway who was preying on the elderly became a multimillionaire when a Manhattan jury awarded him $4.3 million for being shot as he fled from the scene of a crime. A Bronx jury gave $500,000 to a woman who broke her toe in a pothole. Another Bronx jury awarded $6 million to the family of a drunk who fell in front of a subway train after the jury found the drunk wholly without fault. Another jury in a medical malpractice case awarded $27 million to an injured patient and another $6 million to the members of his family--even though they hadn't even sued. 
Mr. President, let me return to the subject at hand, which is limited product liability reform. The tort system is really a `trial lawyer tax' that costs American consumers more than $132 billion per year. 
This is a 125 percent increase over the past 10 years. In fact, between 1930 and 1994, tort costs grew four times faster than the growth rate of the economy. 
This tort tax costs the average American consumer $616 per year. The civil justice system, in effect, deputizes the trial lawyers as tax collectors. Further, because they often sue under a contingent fee arrangement, the trial lawyers are bounty hunters. 
They all want to bag the big case--the trophy case--and raid those `deep pockets.'

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, in 1991, the Congress reformed the FDIC and mandated that the fund keep a reserve to deposit ratio of 1.25%. Fortunately, no government funds were used to keep the FDIC solvent when this was mandated in 1991. It was thought by many that it would take years for the fund to reach that level, but, enough funds flowed into the Bank Insurance Fund that this reserve level was met relatively quickly. 
What has been happening for the past few years, however, is that the Fund is generating billions in interest and is now well over the designated reserve ratio of 1.25%. The Fund can only be used to provide for losses to the insurance fund, however, because the BIF is considered on budget these excess funds are effectively being used to exaggerate the government surplus. The law envisioned a stop in the need for additional premiums once that fund hit its legal limit, but it never made provisions for excess reserves building and building year after year. 
Rather than this money piling up in the Bank Insurance Fund, I think it would be put to greater use if these funds were recycled back into the banking system, and back into our economy. 
Today, I am introducing legislation that would require that the Fund provide a refund of this excess revenue when it reaches a reserve level of 1.5%. This means that the Fund could maintain a cushion of 20% above the level that is required by law, but once that outer level is reached, the excess would have to be refunded. 
Mr. President, the Bank Insurance Fund is composed entirely of non-government funds. The money in this Fund is derived from assessments on the banking industry. The Congress chose a level at which the Fund could operate safely, and that level is being met, in fact, it is being exceeded. At the end of 1997, the Fund held nearly $28 billion. I think it is wrong, however, to use the money paid by the banking industry to earn revenue for the government and not recycle that money back into the economy. The Fund earned nearly $1.5 billion in interest last year. 
If this amount of money were put back into the economy, $1.5 billion in capital could sustain another $15 billion in loans. 
I do not know when the Fund will reach 1.5% reserve to deposit ratio. The FDIC is projecting that the reserve ratio could be anywhere between 1.36% and 1.43% by the end of this year. Clearly, my legislation means that sometime within the next two years, there will be a level reached at which this money will be put back into the economy. 
When I first came to Washington, I noticed that many believed money was simply appropriated. Actually, money has to be created. Somebody, somewhere had to do something, drive a truck, wait on a table, build a house--somebody had to create wealth. This is the point of this legislation--we need to send money back into the private sector so that it can be used to create new wealth, new jobs and new opportunities. Letting this money accumulate in Washington will not create new opportunities for the American people. That is why I am introducing this legislation, which I think is balancing the need for both a safe and sound deposit insurance fund and the need to keep dollars in banking system for new lending and new growth.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this amendment authorizes appropriations for construction of a National Guard training facility at Fort Bragg. If anyone has seen the facility that the Guard from four States is using at Fort Bragg, he would agree it is a disgrace. It is a disgrace to the Guard. It is a disgrace to the Government. It is a disgrace to the Army. In fact, the buildings are so old and so run down that they were mistaken by the XVIII Airborne Corps deputy commander as abandoned and so ordered them demolished--they were such an eyesore--until he was informed that they were the National Guard facility. 
This new training facility will be used by the National Guard and reservists and active-duty personnel from four southeastern States--North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. 
It is simply wrong to continue to train and berth our guardsmen in World War II buildings that, when they were built, it was announced that they were temporary and going to last 10 years. Now we are 50-plus years putting our National Guard into these buildings. They were temporarily constructed in 1941, to last for 10 years and then to be taken down. They are still there. We are still housing the National Guard in them. The water supply is unsafe, and they have to haul in water in buckets for the National Guard to drink. And we talk about quality of life. 
We expect much from the National Guard. We count on these troops to handle any assignment that is given to them--in war, peacekeeping, or national disasters. Yet we have put them in facilities that are a disgrace to the military. They deserve the same level of accommodations that we are building at other bases around the country. 
I was not elected to the Senate by the people of North Carolina to stand by and listen to Defense Department bureaucrats and autocratic officers. I grew up believing that this was a country in which a civilian authority controlled the military. I have gotten here and I have seen this thing we call the FYDP, or whatever it is, but it now gives the military officers the total authority to set the goals of what we do. And we simply stand by, vote for it, and raise the money. This is not a civilian-controlled military. We are a civilian nation controlled by an autocratic military. 
This is a worthy and worthwhile project. It should be funded. The National Guard does, as we expect it to, make a worthwhile and very necessary contribution to the country. They deserve to be treated better. But, instead they start talking about saving money by the military. 
If ever there was a waster of money, where spending is out of control--and we just heard from Senator Bumpers--it's the military. We have heard it over and over and over. 
This is $8.5 million to replace 50-year-old temporary buildings, and they say, `No, we can't do it; we need the money for something else.' Now, we are wasting billions of dollars in Bosnia, billions were wasted in Somalia and Haiti. If ever it was wasted, that was wasting it. They say we can't afford $8.5 million for four States' National Guards to have a decent place for encampment. 
No; the President is on his way or in China with 1,000 people with him--1,000. 
I question that he needs them, every one, when we say we can't afford $8.5 million for a National Guard barracks at Fort Bragg. 
No. We are not a civilian population controlling a military. We changed that rule, and we decided that we would be controlled by a military--a military of arrogant officers, entrenched bureaucrats that simply write out what they want and we, like little toadies, follow. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I introduce legislation entitled the `Mortgage Litigation Reform Act of 1998' to stop the filing of frivolous class action lawsuits in the mortgage lending process. At dispute in these class actions is whether the payment of a yield spread premium by a lender to another lender or a mortgage broker is a violation of RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act). 
The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, a federal statute enacted in 1974, was passed to provide consumers with meaningful disclosures about the home buying process and protect them from paying unnecessary and costly fees when buying a house. Today, the statute is confusing to consumers and no longer meets the needs of industry because of changes in technology and business affiliations. I held two hearings on RESPA and the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) last summer and found that consumer groups and the real estate and lending community agreed that there must be major overhaul of the statutes. 
One issue among these problems is whether payment of a yield spread premium is legal. HUD's own home settlement booklet indicates that a mortgage broker may be paid by a borrower, a lender or both. This would indicate to a reasonable person that the payments are legal. However, when I questioned HUD point-blank on the legality of these fees during the hearings last summer, the Department refused to give me a straight answer. Instead, the agency proposed a cumbersome and confusing rule that would have given legality to some of the fees in certain circumstances. Many of us believed that the rule if put into final form would have encouraged more frivolous litigation. 
Today, consumer and industry groups and HUD and the Federal Reserve are working on legislative recommendations to overhaul RESPA and TILA. We hope to have hearings on those recommendations later this year and pass a reform package next session. While these efforts are underway, I believe that we should pass this narrowly-tailored moratorium on class action lawsuits until the issue of yield spread premiums is clarified by HUD or by the Congress. This bill would not affect the filing of private rights of action by individual consumers so that the legality can be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis. 
I believe that much work still needs to be done on RESPA and TILA reform but this legislation will enable one of those controversial issues to be set aside for the time being.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the McCain bill, and I urge my colleagues not to revive this job-busting and budget-busting bill in committee. Like the wicked witch, it is dead, and I am delighted that its tortured life is over. I would like to reflect on this past month of debate on the tobacco bill, Mr. President, and I want to say a few words about this bill and its effects. 
Mr. President, tobacco has a long and proud heritage in North Carolina. Since Colonial times, hard-working men and women have supported their families on tobacco, whether by coaxing tobacco from the ground or by processing it into the products used by consumers across the country. 
On that note, Mr. President, I want to say a few words in defense of the people we have heard least about during this endless debate. I'm talking about the hard-working men and women of the tobacco manufacturing facilities. We hear all about Big Tobacco, Mr. President, but they're the folks who will suffer if this bill is not stopped. Many thousands of North Carolinians earn their livings in tobacco manufacturing and distribution. They work in the plants and in the warehouses, in the factories and on the loading docks, and on the interstates transporting the product. 
These are good jobs, Mr. President, good jobs with good wages and good benefits. This bill puts those working people in its cross hairs. It is no secret to the people of my State that, in their declaration of war on tobacco, President Clinton and Vice President Gore assaulted the heart of our agricultural heritage. The anti-tobacco armies and the trial lawyers created the most serious threat to face the tobacco family in many years. 
Just look at the line-up in Congress. Just look at the overwhelming support in the Democratic caucus for this bill. Democratic Senator Dick Durbin wails that tobacco is the only government-supported crop `with a body count.' Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy decries tobacco with characteristic bluster and charges the industry with `the insidious and shameful poisoning of generations of children.' If we defeat this bill, Mr. President, it will be with the help of just a couple of Democrats. Where are the defenders of the working folks? 
This is not about Big Tobacco, Mr. President, it's about hard-working men and women. The unions and I don't always agree, Mr. President, but I want to insert into the Record a statement from the North Carolina A.F.L.-C.I.O. They hit the nail on the head--this is about saving our jobs and saving our communities--and I stand with the working folks against the liberals, the trial lawyers, and the other special interests bent on destroying jobs. 
Phillip Morris and R.J. Reynolds major employers in North Carolina. I'm proud of the working men and women at these factories. They're not the most popular folks on Capitol Hill these days, but that fact just speaks volumes about the confused values up in Washington, because we should honor their hard work not try to throw them out of their jobs. And they're not the only ones who will lose their jobs. These taxes will cripple countless businesses. 
The McCain bill seeks to increase retail cigarette prices as much as $4.98 in real terms by 2004, tapering off to $3.80 by the year 2007. I am informed that this could lead to a reduction of nearly 50 percent in retail cigarette sales, along with large-scale increases in illegal smuggling activities, and that will cost American jobs. 
By 2004, the year in which the payments under the McCain proposal peak, the loss in cigarette sales will lead to devastating economic consequences, and it will be the working men and women who will feel this pain. The economic models show that the price increases--and the effects of increased foreign smuggling--could lead to job losses approaching 1,152,974 workers nationally. That is a mind-boggling number, just think of 1,152,974 disrupted lives, all those hopes and dreams thrown into doubt and chaos. These are real people, supporting real families, working in diverse businesses. They are not just tobacco manufacturing workers, but also convenience store clerks, line workers in paper mills, long distance truckers, and graphic artists in advertising agencies. 
For example, in North Carolina, it is estimated that the impact of this proposal will lead to a total loss of 48,691 direct jobs. The effect would be similar to a lay-off of this magnitude from a single employer, Mr. President, with the total impact on the community approaching 161,953 jobs. The implications of the McCain bill would be similar to laying off all of the 40,100 employees of both Burlington Industries in Greensboro and Family Dollar Stores of Charlotte. 
However, most of these jobs are in communities that do not have any other industries of comparable size, so it is highly doubtful whether displaced workers would be able to find new jobs near home. Some supporters of the tobacco bill have questioned whether this matters. They claim that displaced workers can just move to where the jobs are. Well, that's not good enough. People have roots in their communities. Any farmer will tell you that you risk killing a plant when you pull out its roots and move it. People are no different. 
And even if displaced workers can find new jobs without displacing their families and abandoning their communities, they are not likely to be able to match their current salaries and benefits. These are not wealthy people. These are working people. They simply cannot afford to lose a significant portion of their income. 
We can reduce underage tobacco use. But we won't do it by punishing the innocent and honorable men and women who work in the tobacco industry. And we won't do it by destroying the economic engine that has supported their communities for generations. Mr. President, the men and women who work in the tobacco industry and the people who depend upon them deserve our respect and support. They have earned it. Please join with me in giving it to them.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, the McCain bill is dead, and I say good riddance. It was nothing more than a massive tax increase on working Americans to fund an expansion of the Federal government. However, I suspect that we will revisit the tobacco issue, and I want to ensure that my colleagues remain aware of a critical issue to the people of my State. I'm talking about thousands of tobacco farm families. These are people who depend on tobacco farming for their livelihood and who share a long and proud heritage. 
Mr. President, my farmers are hurting, and we're losing more and more of them every year. The tobacco quota continues to drop, but not their credit payments, so they're getting squeezed to the limits. Some of them are well past their limits and were forced off their farms. 
I believe that we will face the tobacco issue again next year. Certainly, whether or not we do a small and far less expensive youth access bill without a tax increase at the end of this year, we will return to the so-called tobacco settlement next year. If we return to this bill next year--not in a politically charged atmosphere just five months from Election Day--it will be far easier to manage this process and to come up with a reasonable bill that addresses the needs of all parties. That means farmers, and that is a critical point, because they are the folks on the front line and under fire in this war on tobacco. 
We need to address this issue in a calm and reasonable atmosphere, not this hysteria, and I look forward to that debate. The men and women of the tobacco family need some certainty. If the Democrats want to continue their war against tobacco--and I want to point out that just two Democrats voted to kill the McCain bill--I say `protect the farmers' because they are the innocent victims of this unfair assault. This is indeed an unparalleled assault on their crop. 
The farmers need help--and a settlement bill must include this help--in order to restructure their debt to a manageable level. A long-term payment scheme will not service their debt because tobacco production will continue to drop. These farmers fear that the creditors will call the loans and the fire sales that follow will depress land and equipment prices. They can't sustain this assault by their own government. 
I want to be sure that the next generation of farmers have opportunities to grow tobacco, and I will fight to make sure that they have those tools, because they are the future of our nation. They grow our food. In Sampson County, North Carolina, where I live, you see the slogan `Support agriculture or try used food,' and that sums it up. We cannot let our farmers suffer. We will not let our farmers suffer. 
I look forward to this debate--I hope it will be a reasonable one rather than a tax-and-spend bonanza--and I look forward to the effort to prepare our farmers for the future. 
Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I do not have an amendment. I simply want to discuss very briefly an issue that I may later offer an amendment on to this legislation, and it is an issue that I understand you are also interested in, Mr. President. It is concerning the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The Chairwoman of the Commission, Brooksley Born, is attempting to reverse the current policy at the CFTC that Congress directed over 5 years ago. 
Mr. President, the issue is this. We have a $28 trillion swaps market in the United States. The vast majority of these swaps are privately negotiated contracts. They are not traded on any exchange; they are privately negotiated contracts. The business has grown rapidly in the last few years. It has become an important financial tool for institutions to hedge their risks. But, clearly, it is not a trading issue, this is a--it is redundant to say--privately traded issue. These are swaps between those companies. 
Yet, the CFTC now has under review a `concept release'--a good bureaucratic term--a `concept release' to regulate these privately negotiated instruments. Essentially, the CFTC wants to vastly broaden its regulatory authority over a multitrillion-dollar market. The problem is that these are negotiations, again, between private firms. Furthermore, if one of the parties in the contract is a bank, these products are regulated by the bank regulators. And we do not need a dual regulation. 
The result of the CFTC action will be that a trillion-dollar industry will, very simply, be driven out of this country. It will be driven overseas. 
In case anyone thinks that this is just my opinion, in a move that I have rarely seen in Washington--we certainly haven't been seeing lately--in an incredible move, Chairman Greenspan, Secretary Rubin, and Secretary Arthur Levitt issued a joint statement saying they have `grave concerns' with what is being proposed to be done by Ms. Born. 
How often do you see the three principal financial regulators of the country come together to express grave concern over an issue and rebuke another financial regulator? You simply do not see it happen. They are concerned, and the potential for great loss to this country is just tantamount to it happening. 
The Treasury Department has even gone to such lengths as to formally send legislation to the Congress to stop this potential regulation. It is the Treasury Department under Secretary Rubin, and they may even go to such lengths to stop it. 
I want to, if I may, Mr. President, read a joint statement. This statement was issued by Mr. Rubin, Mr. Greenspan, and Mr. Levitt. 
On May 7, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (`CFTC') issued a concept release on over-the-counter derivatives. We have grave concerns about this action and its possible consequences. The OTC derivatives market is a large and important global market. We seriously question the scope of the CFTC's jurisdiction in this area, and we are very concerned about reports that the CFTC's action may increase the legal uncertainty concerning certain types of OTC derivatives. 
The concept release raises important public policy issues that should be dealt with the entire regulatory community working with Congress, and we are prepared to pursue, as appropriate, legislation that would provide greater certainty concerning the legal status of OTC derivatives. 
Furthermore, Chairman Jim Leach of the House Banking Committee has introduced similar legislation. 
To me, the agreement of this number of people on one issue is unprecedented. We need to wake up and realize that we have a rogue regulator--I know of no nicer way to put it--at the CFTC that is threatening to drive a trillion-dollar business out of the United States. 
My amendment, if I introduce it, would simply state that no final rule on this can be promulgated during fiscal year 1999. This is the amendment that I have contemplated. 
Mr. President, this is a very complex subject. We do not need to rush to judgment. It needs thorough and careful review. It is not the type of thing that attracts a lot of attention on the Senate or the House floor. As we said, it is not a subject that is easily understood. But even for those who do not understand it, Secretary Rubin, Chairman Greenspan, and Secretary Levitt all agree with House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach that it is a dangerous direction that Ms. Born is heading and one that we should not be going in. 
It is simply time for us to stop and give us a year to review the implications of what she is talking about. And, further, the CFTC is up for reauthorization next year anyway. If it needs to be done, that would be the time to do it, and we could address it at that time. 
Mr. President, I thank you. I look forward to working with you on this program. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee regarding the role of warehouseman in the tobacco debate. There are 356 tobacco quota warehouses in eleven states. For over 60 years tobacco auction warehouses have played a role in the federal government's tobacco program. By law, warehousemen collect specified fees, supervise inspections, keep records and otherwise act on behalf of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
In 1935, the Tobacco Inspection Act was passed under the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee to designate approved auction warehouses and to protect growers by providing standards of classification and inspection of tobacco. In fact, from the onset of North America's tobacco commerce in 1619 successive governments have used tobacco warehouses as the primary channel for regulating the leaf tobacco trade. According to Professor Allan C. Fisher, Jr., between 1619 and 1731, various colonial governments in North America passed a total of eight legislative acts pertaining to tobacco warehouses. In effect, these laws made tobacco warehouses the agents of government for ensuring that the inspection and sale of leaf tobacco remained fair to growers. 
Even now, by law, warehousemen collect specified fees, supervise inspections, keep records and otherwise act on behalf of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Supreme Court, in a 1939 case upholding the inspection law, state that warehousemen and auctioneers act as agents for growers and the government. 
In summary, tobacco warehouses were established by and are regulated by the federal government. Therefore, assistance to warehousemen is a necessary component of any legislative action that effects federal tobacco policy.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I appreciate the Chairman's recognition of the importance of warehousemen and his efforts to include them in this amendment. The Senator is correct. Tobacco warehouses have no other business than operating as agents for the growers and the government. They are as integrally tied to the tobacco program as are farmers and quota holders. 
For these reasons I believe that comprehensive tobacco legislation must provide compensation for tobacco warehousemen--and that such compensation should be specific, certain and equitable. 
By the term `specific,' I mean that the legislation should denote warehousemen as individuals who shall rightfully receive a measure of compensation, just as it provides for a measure of compensation for growers and quota holders. 
By the term `certain,' I mean that the legislation should provide for a procedure to ensure that such compensation is a definite Federal responsibility calculated by Federal authority according to factors that Congress establishes in the statute. 
By the term `equitable,' I mean that the compensation should be based upon an appreciation for a warehouseman's equity investment in his business and that the formula for determining the appropriate compensation should be related to the volumes of tobacco that each warehouse has historically handled. 
It is essential that three elements are thoroughly addressed. It is my judgment that the managers' amendment in its current form falls short in meeting these criteria. 
My question to the distinguished Chairman is this: will you work with me and other Senators, as the legislative progress continues, to ensure that warehousemen are not left out of my comprehensive tobacco legislation?

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote to kill this bill. It is no more than a massive $577 billion tax increase on working class Americans. Almost one trillion dollars in taxes and penalties to fund the largest expansion of government in years. Almost one trillion dollars to throw tens of thousand of North Carolina factory workers out of their jobs. Almost one trillion dollars to throw tens of thousands of farm families off their land. 
Back in 1993, we denounced the Clinton tax increase, the largest tax increase in world history. Today, some of us seem interested in passing this tobacco tax bill, the second largest tax increase in world history. 
I would like to compare the two bills. 
The 1993 tax increase was for `fighting deficits.' The 1998 tax increase is for `fighting teen smoking.' 
The 1993 tax increase totaled 240 billion dollars over the first 5 years. The 1998 tax increase totals $103 billion over five years. 
The 1993 tax increase paid for a massive increase in new spending. The 1998 tax increase pays for a massive increase in new spending. 
The 1993 tax increase was progressive. The 1998 tax increase is regressive. 
The 1993 tax increase targeted `those who succeeded in the decade of greed.' The 1998 tax increase targets smokers--mostly working class Americans. 
The 1993 tax increase was done in the name of `the children.' The 1998 tax increase is in the name of `the children.' 
The 1993 tax increase enlarged the Washington bureaucracy. The 1998 tax increase enlarges the Washington bureaucracy. 
The 1993 tax increase taxed the American people. The 1998 tax increase taxes the American people, not the tobacco companies. 
It literally requires the tobacco companies to pass on the entire tax increase to the American people--mostly blue collar people. Those earning less than $40,000 per year will pay sixty-one percent of these new taxes. 
It will raise taxes on the one-pack-a-day smoker by $1015 per year. That's a fifty percent federal tax increase on those earning less than ten thousand dollars per year. Those earning more than $75,000 will pay less than one percent more from this tax increase. 
We should all be deeply concerned about the `tax and spend' approach that the bill takes to resolving a social problem. The bill reaches right into the pockets of hard-working low- and middle-income adults who have every right to smoke if they choose. And, it takes their hard-earned dollars to create yet more federal programs and to pay trial lawyers billions of dollars. At least the Senate saw the light on my efforts to cap these fees. 
We're literally grabbing money from the poorest Americans to buy trial lawyers more than Lear jets. Pure greed, Mr. President, pure greed. 
To what end are we taxing the American people here? It is unclear whether price increases really have the effect of getting kids to stop smoking or to prevent them from starting. 
And what is the real motivation here? If it really were to cut smoking, we wouldn't phase in the tax, we would drop it right at once. But we're not doing that because the tax-and-spenders want the revenues. I know they're not doing it for the tobacco companies. 
We all know that this isn't about smoking--it's about money. 
The consequences are irrelevant. Facing huge profit margins, a new industry will crop up bringing cigarettes into the country tax-free. It will be boom time for smugglers. 
Just consider how much smuggling already occurs. Ten percent of the cigarettes consumed in America today are smuggled from low cigarette-tax states to high-tax states. 
Just ask the Canadian border patrol about the smuggling that occurred in 1993 when the Canadian cigarette excise exceeded the U.S. excise by as much as $3.50 per pack. 
Increased smuggling means that not only is the additional tax not paid, but the existing federal excise of 24 cents per pack would also be avoided, as would the state excises. 
Organized crime must be absolutely licking its chops at the prospect of smuggling a legal product into the country and then using its existing distribution networks to sell it. One thing's for sure--the market demand for small planes in about to jump sky high. 
The effect of smuggling is to create two classes of smokers--those who smoke only legal cigarettes and those who smoke smuggled cigarettes. Those who smoke smuggled cigarettes will see a decline in price since these cigarettes will escape the existing federal and state taxes. 
Thus, if smokers respond to price changes, smokers of smuggled cigarettes will smoke more, while smokers of legal cigarettes will smoke less. Netting these changes out will be interesting, but it must be done to develop a reasonable revenue estimate. 
Then there are the jobs that will be lost in the industry all along the production and legal distribution chain. 
This means reduced income and payroll tax receipts to the Federal government. The official figures do not include these revenue losses, of course, because that would require 
a level of dynamic analysis the estimators are unwilling to try, but the revenue losses will be real nonetheless. 
Another element thus far ignored is that the cigarette tax increase will reduce projected federal budget surpluses through its effect on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI includes cigarettes on a tax-inclusive basis. 
A per pack tax hike of $1.10 will cause an estimated one-time and permanent increase in the CPI of just under four-tenths of a percentage point. A higher CPI automatically increases federal outlays because many programs, like Social Security, are indexed to the CPI. 
Phasing the tax hike in over five years as described in the McCain bill, the Tax Foundation calculates that federal outlays will rise by almost $11 billion over the next five years and by over $29 billion over the next ten years. Similarly, many tax provisions are indexed to the CPI, like the personal exemption, the standard deduction, and the tax brackets. 
An increase in the CPI reduces tax receipts for a given amount of gross income. The Tax Foundation estimates that the cigarette-tax induced increase in the CPI would reduce federal income tax receipts by about $8 billion over the next five years, and by almost $19 billion over the next ten years. 
Combined with the spending increases, the cigarette tax hike would reduce future budget surpluses by almost $19 billion over the next five years by over $48 billion over the next ten years. 
I know that lots of people in this town are jubilant at the prospect of this legislation passing. The plaintiffs' lawyers would become fabulously wealthy; the public health community would get all of its favorite projects generously funded; and, of course, the bureaucrats will get write volumes of new rules. 
The ones who won't be so happy are the working class families who have been targeted to pay for it all. 
In short, the McCain bill, through its highly regressive tax provisions, inflicts enormous costs on lower- and middle-income families. Let me put this regressive tax in concrete terms. The increased excise tax payments under the McCain bill are projected to total some $577 billion over the next 25 years. This is without the `look back' penalties that will add hundreds of billions of dollars to the package. 
Where are the cries about regressive taxes? We're all so used to the long speeches about taxes on the poor. Or is that argument just used for convenience? This is the largest tax increase on the poor in years--if not in all time! 
It is estimated that, based on projections of the actual increases in the prices of tobacco products, the true cost over the next 25 years will be in the range of $380 billion for families earning less than $30,000 per year. 
It will be more than $735 billion for families earning less than $75,000 a year. 
These are truly staggering numbers. 
After all, 98.5% of cigarettes are legally purchased by adult smokers, and therefore higher excise taxes will unfairly (and regressively) penalize adult consumers who choose to smoke. 
So, we're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes to try to stop 1.5 percent of tobacco users from illegally buying tobacco. Why not just impose penalties on children who try to purchase tobacco? Well, I suppose, because it wouldn't be a jackpot for trial lawyers and Washington bureaucrats. The fact that it might help the children is irrelevant. 
Mr. President, I, for one, was not elected to sock the American taxpayer with more taxes. If teens are really our target, we owe it to the taxpayer to first explore other non-price measures to combat youth smoking. 
Turning to the bill's reliance on new government programs, I find it highly ironic that we are here debating a bill that will increase the size of the federal bureaucracy when this Congress is supposedly committed to reducing the federal government. 
We also need to think long and hard about the bill's Orwellian approach--giving the federal government more power to look over our shoulders regarding the personal choices we make. 
I urge my colleagues to learn from experience. Too many times in the past, Washington has raised taxes in the name of one feel-good social program or another. 
This legislation is going to result in a massive price increase for the entire smoking population, including the 98 percent of legal adult smokers. I think it is important that my colleagues are aware of all the facts before they vote on it. 
We should be concerned that the McCain bill will set a terrible precedent that will haunt us for years to come. If we begin to use the tax code as a coercive means of social engineering, then I submit that there is no end in sight. 
Today, smokers will be asked to pay a huge share of their income to the federal government and tomorrow, who will be next? 
We were supposedly sent here to see to it that the tax and spend era of big government ends. I'm not sure we're holding up our end of the bargain when we propose to pass legislation along the lines of the bill we're debating today. 
This bill perpetuates a tax and spend mentality that our constituents have rejected. It sets us sliding down the slippery slope. It is a bad bill, Mr. President, and we need to move on to other matters.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am shocked that the Senate rejected two prior attempts to limit these attorneys' fees, and I am amazed that we are here to debate whether a four thousand dollar per hour cap is enough for the trial lawyers. 
Over the past few days, a number of constituents asked me how we could possibly condone paying these lawyers more than 250 dollars per hour, which was the rate in my original amendment. 
Where I come from, Mr. President, 250 dollars is an incredible amount of money. That is a weekly wage for a lot of working people. These are the same working people, I might add, whose taxes we are raising to pay these lawyers' fees. This bill is an unparalleled transfer of wealth from the poor to the super-rich. 
My constituents were upset about 250 dollar per hour and 1000 per hour payments to lawyers, but I explained that the Texas lawyers expect to make ninety-two thousand dollars per hour, and my constituents enthusiastically agreed that these caps were better than ninety-two thousand dollars per hour. The Texas lawyers have already been paid ninety million dollars and expect more than two-point-two billion dollars more. 
In fact, the Attorney General of Texas is so intent on paying them their two-point-three billion dollars in fees that he filed a lawsuit against the Governor because the Governor tried to intervene on behalf of the taxpayers who will foot the bill. Yes, the taxpayers, because the Attorney General admitted to the New York Times on May 27 that part of the attorneys' fees will come from the Federal Government. 
It is a betrayal of the American people, the taxpayers, to raise their taxes to pay lawyers four thousand dollars per hour. That's more than most families make in a month. That is outrageous. Working Americans--people scraping to pay the mortgage--being asked to pay for more luxury houses and yachts for billionaire trial lawyers. It's an abuse of the taxpayers. Yes, the taxpayers, that's what the Texas Attorney General said. 
It is important to note that this is a cap, not a flat fee, so few lawyers should expect to be paid at the top end of these categories. The amendment limits the number of cases that fall within the top category to just a handful. That is a critical distinction, Mr. President, and one that makes this amendment more attractive to those of us shocked by these numbers. 
However, as the Senate rejected my previous two amendments to limit fees, I have no alternative but to vote for these higher dollar numbers. These outrageous numbers are testament to the strength of the ultimate Washington special interest, the special interest most inclined to put personal interest above national interest, the trial lawyers. 
Mr. President, I will vote for this amendment, but I do so only because some limitation is better than no limitation on these predatory and, I might add, unethical attorneys' fees payments.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to limit attorneys' fees in this tobacco settlement to $1000 per hour, and I am joined by the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, and the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell. 
The tobacco legislation is about public health--not the enrichment of trial lawyers--and I believe that this is more than ample compensation for these lawyers. 
I offered a fee limitation amendment last month at $250 per hour, and I considered that excessive, but I was reluctant to lose votes from those inclined to believe otherwise. I believe that passage of a fees limitation amendment is a legislative imperative, Mr. President, but I am a realist. It is the obligation of this Senator to set aside personal reservations and sentiments and to offer an amendment that will pass the Senate and restrain the trial lawyers from their plunder of the Treasury. 
I thought that $250 per hour was an inordinate reward for these trial lawyers and favored a far lower limitation, but I can count votes, and I regret that passage requires a higher cap. The trial lawyers are the ultimate Washington special interest, Mr. President, and these courtroom predators marshaled all their forces against the Faircloth cap and indeed forced another vote on this issue. 
The Federal government cannot put its imprimatur on legislation that diverts billions from the taxpayers to pay trial lawyers. Mr. President, this is the legislative process of the Senate, not `Wheel of Fortune' for trial lawyers. 
If the Congress fails to enact fee limitations, Mr. President, trial lawyers will collect from $3 billion to $15 billion per year in fees. The state Medicaid suits will yield $1 billion to $3 billion per year, and, the lawyers will be further enriched through their contingency fees from individual smoker cases, from which they will reap between $2 billion and $12 billion per year. 
In fact, if the Congress fails to enact fee limitations, trial lawyers stand to collect at least $100 billion over the next 25 years. This $100 billion sum exceeds the annual gross domestic product of 24 States and 98 foreign countries. 
The failure to replace the arbitration provision in the McCain bill with a fees limitation provision, if the Senate were so blind, would constitute acquiescence to the most blatant and insidious special interest legislation since the Senate convened in 1789. 
This is a $100 billion payoff for the ultimate special interest. This is the Washington special interest that leads the pack in its passion for personal interest over national interest. 
The trial lawyers, Mr. President, will not bloat their stock portfolios at the expense of taxpayers across this nation. This tobacco legislation is, in essence, the fruit of an extortion pact. The Congress cannot reward this legal vigilantism. The Senate is not for sale. 
The four state cases that settled portend a dreadful abuse of the taxpayers and underscore the imperative of federal fee limitations. Judge Harold Cohen of the Florida circuit court estimated that their fees of $2.8 billion were, in fact, equivalent to $185,186 per hour. The five trial lawyers about to share $2.3 billion in Texas will collect, in effect, close to $92,000 per hour. 
Who are these modern Sir William Blackstones? 
Who are these latter day Clarence Darrows and William Jennings Bryans? 
I discovered that Hugh Rodham, the President's brother in law, is amongst their ranks. It is estimated that he will collect $50 million as a Castano group lawyer. Mr. President, permit me to read two newspaper reports of his contributions to these lawsuits.  
And just for good measure, the state of Florida has hired Hugh Rodham (Hillary Clinton's brother) to be a part of their litigation team, despite his complete lack of experience in these types of cases.' Knoxville News-Sentinel, July 20, 1997. 
Hugh Rodham `spen[t] the last hours of the talks in a corner reading a paperback by Jack Higgins, `Drink with the Devil.' Washington Post, June 23, 1997. 
Mr. President, I also wish to address some misinformation about the Faircloth cap, and I believe that I can rebut all the arguments made against the amendment last month. 
Mr. President, it was said on this floor last month that my amendment was unprecedented, but this is not the case. The Federal government often sets professional fees. 
Medicare and Medicaid, for example, limit physicians' fees for professional services. These doctors contribute far more to public health than the trial lawyers, but the Congress decided to limit their fees, so I find it remarkable that Senators will argue to exempt lawyers from policies intended to protect the taxpayers. 
There are numerous federal laws that set attorneys' fees. The Equal Access to Justice Act sets fees at $125 per hour in civil rights cases. The Internal Revenue Code sets fees at $110 per hour in successful taxpayer cases. The Criminal Justice Act sets fees at $75 per hour. Certainly, Mr. President, these are not uncharted waters. 
These statutes restrict fees awards against the United States to protect the taxpayers. The taxpayers, after all, pay the expenses of the United States. Dan Morales, the Attorney General of Texas, admitted that the taxpayers will pay part of the attorneys' $2.3 billion share of the Texas settlement. The principle is the same, Mr. President, and these fee limitations protect the taxpayers. 
There are countless other federal provisions that limit attorneys' fees--from the Veterans' Benefits Act to the Trading with the Enemy Act--and preempt contingency fee contracts to impose 
restrictions on the lawyers' share of the recovery. 
These statutes serve, in effect, to protect clients from their lawyers. 
The taxpayers deserve the same protections, Mr. President, and these arguments about an unprecedented fees limitation are specious and unfounded. The McCain bill addresses attorneys' fees provisions through its flawed arbitration clause, so, clearly, reasonable limitations on fees are within the scope of this legislation. 
Mr. President, several members pointed to the arbitration clause in the bill as an alternative to the fees cap, but the arbitration clause is really a `trial lawyers' bill of rights' rather than a protection for American taxpayers. Their argument that the arbitration clause will alleviate concerns about excessive attorneys' fees is, in fact, a concession that the fee contracts are excessive and merit review. 
The Congress of the United States cannot shunt that obligation to a panel of unnamed arbitrators. 
The arbitration clause in this bill is a one-way street that permits lawyers--but not their clients--to compel arbitration of attorneys' fees disputes. In effect, the lawyers can compel the States to participate in binding arbitration, and the outcome cannot be appealed. 
If arbitration is indeed the exclusive remedy for fee disputes, it locks in these fees because the lawyers will not object to the billion dollar contingent fee arrangements, and the States are not empowered to challenge the fees under the arbitration clause in the bill. The lawyers can just file court papers to pursue enforcement of their contract. 
If arbitration is an exclusive remedy, however, it is a clear violation of both the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial and state sovereign immunity provisions. These are serious and indeed insurmountable constitutional hurdles. 
If arbitration is not an exclusive remedy, the clause purports to let trial lawyers choose between arbitration and litigation, but it forces their clients--taxpayers and tobacco users--into expensive and protracted litigation battles. 
The language in the bill authorizes the arbitration panel to award attorneys' fees and expenses for `legal services' that `in whole or in part resulted in or created a model for programs' in the bill. The bill thus appears to authorize fees for attorneys who played no role in the underlying litigation that gave rise to the bill. 
This bill incorporates elements of many--if not most--of the tobacco control programs that the public health groups advocated in recent years. The panel thus stands to draw fee and expense applications from the armies of lawyers and legal assistants that provided public agencies and private organizations with advice about tobacco control measures over the years. 
Mr. President, let us not underestimate the creative spirit of the plaintiffs' bar, because I assure you that this flood of fee petitions will indeed materialize under this provision. 
Finally, the arbitration mechanism applies to fee and expense disputes related to litigation `affected by' this Act. In light of the broad scope of this bill, it is possible that this mechanism will be invoked not only in tobacco and health cases, but in other cases that involve tobacco manufacturers. 
It is not impossible that pure commercial cases will come within the scope of the arbitration mechanism to the extent that these cases are `affected by' the tobacco legislation. Certainly, Mr. President, billboard owners with abrogated contracts and other parties `affected by' the settlement appear to fall within the broad scope of this provision. 
I heard a lot of rhetoric last month about the constitutionality of this fee limitation. However, despite the specious arguments of the plaintiffs' bar, the Faircloth cap is constitutional. The Supreme Court precedents are clear that Congress can upset economic expectations as part of a comprehensive regulatory scheme. In fact, I heard members praise the bill last month because its regulations are so pervasive and its reach so broad, so the legislative history will support my arguments. 
Mr. President, Federal courts have routinely upheld laws that abrogate past contracts, so long as those laws possess a rational basis. It is certainly rational to regulate fees as part of a broad regulatory package to ensure that an equitable amount of finite resources will be available to protect the national public health and welfare and to compensate those who suffer from tobacco-related diseases. 
This bill will force tobacco companies to abrogate contracts with a range of parties--from retailers to advertisers--but, curiously, I do not see hand-wringing about the abrogation of those contracts. 
It is a ludicrous constitutional proposition to suggest that private parties can enter into contracts in order to preempt congressional actions. 
Further, Mr. President, this bill minimizes the risks in tobacco litigation. The McCain bill makes it far easier for the lawyers to win their cases against the tobacco companies. This new courtroom landscape compels the Congress to revisit these fee arrangements that date to a different and distant era of tobacco litigation. 
The McCain bill establishes unprecedented evidentiary presumptions that reverse the traditional burdens of proof on two critical issues--nicotine addition and disease causation--and thus relieve trial lawyers of litigation expenses for these complex issues. 
The McCain bill also establishes a tobacco document repository, which will curtail--if not eliminate--the need for the discovery process. The discovery process is long and intensive, so the McCain bill, in effect, relieves lawyers of the most expensive element of the litigation, which is 
often cited as the justification for their enormous fees. 
Indeed, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee stated that, `[O]nce we establish this document repository, it should be easier to prove cases that can go to jury and, I think, increase the chances of jury awards * * *. It would be easier to recover * * *. [A]ttorneys today will have everything going for them because of the tobacco settlement.' 
It is manifest that this bill will ease their burden in the courtroom, Mr. President, so it defies common sense to assume that the Congress will permit fees predicated upon a dramatically different legal position. 
These lawyers are officers of the court, Mr. President, so they are fiduciaries. These arguments about the sanctity of contract are thus specious because there are different rules applicable to attorneys' fees. Mr. President, to argue otherwise is, in effect, to advocate the repeal of the canons of ethics. 
The common law tradition, which we uphold today, enshrines a quid pro quo that offers lawyers monopolistic access to the courts but that requires reasonable fees to preclude exploitation of clients. 
The old rules of the Model Code stated that `clearly excessive' fees were unethical and unenforceable. The old rules imposed a standing obligation--from the execution of the fee agreement to the remittance of the fee--to conform the fee to fiduciary principles. The more recent Model Rules, in fact, strengthened this limitation and replaced the prohibition on `clearly excessive' fees with a ban on `unreasonable fees.' Mr. President, if there is some semblance of ontological certitude to the definition of `reasonable,' then the Senate will enact this amendment to amend these contingent fee contracts. 
These lawyers stand to collect unimaginable rewards--billions of dollars--without commensurate risk. These fees and the underlying contingency fee contracts are thus unreasonable under any appropriate standard. 
The most logical standard, of course, is to look to comparable work. The payments to the defense lawyers--those lawyers who analyzed and contested the same issues--are thus the most appropriate standard. It is clear that the proposed caps in this amendment far exceeds the fees for defense lawyers. 
I summarize my position as comparable pay for comparable work. 
The contingency fee structure of these contracts further deepens this ethical morass. The contingency fee arrangement earmarks a percentage of the judgment to the lawyer without limitation. These funds are, quite simply, diverted from the victim to the lawyer. 
Consequently, ethicists point out that contingency fees compel a heightened scrutiny because these arrangements thus benefit the lawyer at the expense of his client. Indeed, reductions of the lawyers' fees accrue to the benefit of the client, and that balance compels the Congress to weigh in on behalf of the clients. Mr. President, those clients are injured smokers and the taxpayers of the United States, and they deserve our support. 
Mr. President, this amendment is fair, and it is consistent with the rest of this bill. The trial bar argues that a fees cap violates free market principles. It was, however, their submission of the proposed tobacco settlement to Congress for review and approval that removed the agreement from the free market and brought it into the legislative process. 
The Congress cannot condone billion-dollar payments to a small band of trial lawyers for minimal efforts. Some of these lawyers copied court papers from other state lawsuits and filed these documents in elaborate productions choreographed for the television news. This is the essence of `jackpot justice.' 
The trial bar cannot expect Congress to enact broad and detailed legislation to regulate tobacco and, yet, believe that their component of the bill is sacrosanct and above congressional review. 
Mr. President, despite vehement protestations last month, it is incontrovertible that this bill uses taxpayer dollars to pay off trial lawyers. This use of taxpayer dollars is an unacceptable diversion of public funds. The Attorney General of Texas conceded to the New York Times on May 27, 1998 that federal funds will be used for part of the $2.3 billion payment for lawyers' fees. 
Indeed, Mr. President, the bill permits the use of revenues from the National Tobacco Trust Fund to pay trial lawyers' fees. In fact, 40 percent of Trust Fund revenues are sent to the States for Medicare expenses, but half of this sum is untethered. There is a finite pot of resources from the tobacco companies, so the billions of dollars that will flow to trial lawyers under the McCain bill will be available for state public health initiatives if Congress passes the Faircloth Cap. 
In response to some of the other concerns voiced on the floor last month, I made some changes, which I am confident will alleviate the concerns of some Senators. 
This version of my amendment eliminates the reports to the Judiciary Committees, and it simply permits the judge assigned to the tobacco case to determine fees. Judges routinely review petitions for attorneys' fees and expenses, so this will not present any difficulties, and I am confident that it is the most prudent route for resolution of these fee disputes. 
Mr. President, a spokesman for Public Citizen, the group founded by Ralph Nader, conceded that, `My gut feeling is that these fees are very, very difficult to justify.' 
The United States Senate represents the taxpayers, not the trial lawyers, and this amendment is a litmus test of our commitment to the taxpayers. The breadth of support for this amendment reaches across the spectrum because these jackpot fees offend our sense of justice. 
The Congress cannot permit the ultimate Washington special interest--the trial lawyers--to dictate this legislation and to reap unimaginable rewards and riches. The Congress cannot endorse an extortion pact foisted upon the American public--and the Congress--by a pack of legal predators. The Congress cannot tax the poorest Americans--those least able to shoulder additional taxes--in order to shower golden dragoons upon trial lawyers. 
I want to touch on one quick thing because I am ready to close. 
If this bill passes, 70 percent of the largest tax in history is going to be paid by people making less than $35,000 a year. If anybody can tell me that it is unfair to restrict the attorneys to $1,000 an hour when the people who are paying this tax make less than $35,000 a year, 70 percent of it is going to be paid by people making less than $35,000 a year. No one can tell me that it is not right to restrict the attorney fees to $1,000 an hour. 
The Congress cannot tax the poorest Americans, those least able to shoulder additional taxes, in order to shower this tremendous amount of money upon the trial lawyers of the Nation. 
I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Coverdell's and Senator Craig's amendment. These two Senators have focused attention on a critical issue for the next generation of Americans. 
We are here today to discuss the McCain bill, which seeks to combat teen smoking. Now, I doubt whether anyone in this Chamber would argue with the notion that teen smoking and use of tobacco products should be curtailed. But I want to focus our attention on the fact that there are other arguably more serious problems that our young people are facing today and seem to be turning a blind eye to. 
I have been told for months that this antitobacco effort is aimed at one goal and one goal only. That is, making sure our children don't smoke and stop if they have started. If the real motivation for this bill were, in fact, to address the problems facing our young people, then someone please tell me why we are not here today addressing other serious problems that teenage Americans are facing--even more serious problems, problems that impact their life in a more direct manner. Why are we not dealing with the problem of teenage drug use which has been on the rise in recent years? Why are we not dealing with the frightening problem of juvenile violence, which is a throwoff from drug use? Why are we not dealing with the problem of teen drinking, with alcohol-related fatalities on the rise around American college campuses and high schools? 
Teenage drug use today leads to ruined lives and overdose deaths every single day in this country. Underage alcohol drinking leads to drunken-driving fatalities every single day in this country. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported two-thirds of eighth graders have experimented with alcohol and 28 percent have been drunk at least once. Two-thirds of eighth graders have been drunk at least once. 
A recent study by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse says that the earlier people start drinking, the more likely they are to become alcoholics and addicted. 
Let's put this in the proper perspective. We are debating a $1 trillion bill that is aimed at preventing children from starting to smoke. 
Yet, how many billions of dollars are we proposing to combat those other ills that plague our children, which are, in my opinion, more direct and more immediate? 
I would like to focus today on the biggest of these problems now facing America's young people, which is the crisis of illegal drugs. While tobacco use by teenagers is a problem, illegal drug use by teenagers is much more than a problem, it is a crisis. And if our mandate is to protect our Nation's children, then we must not ignore our illicit drug crisis. I believe we should take this opportunity to address the problem of the illegal drug crisis in America. 
Illegal drugs and drug-related crimes are ripping apart the fiber of families and communities, weighing down our education and health care systems, overburdening the resources of law enforcement, prosecutors, courts, and prisons. Drugs are literally changing the nature of the country our children and grandchildren will inherit. It is a crisis. 
Drugs are altering the very definition of what it means to be a child in this country today. They alter the experiences that children have in school, and they are altering children's perception of the world around them. 
Drugs are now a pervasive part of what it means to grow up as an adolescent in this country. If you are not a teenager who engages in drug use, you will be one who will be confronted by others who are drug users and presented with the temptation. 
I do not think anyone in this Chamber, as much as they might dislike tobacco use, could stand up with a straight face and say the same things about the evils of smoking cigarettes that I have just said about drug use. Drug use is a problem of an entirely different magnitude, and it is unbelievable to me that we are not addressing that problem today. 
Let's look at the hard numbers that demonstrate the recent rise in illegal drug use among teenagers while Congress has continued to ignore the problem--and we have ignored it. 
Surveys released recently have uniformly shown that drug use is on the rise by our young people. Among eighth graders--now, these are really children--the proportion using illegal drugs in the prior 12 months has increased by 56 percent since 1992. Now, these are children. Overall teenage drug use has doubled since 1992. One-half of 17-year-olds now say they could buy marijuana within an hour. 
Marijuana-related emergency room incidents rose 32 percent last year as a direct result of higher drug impurities and marijuana laced with PCP. 
The Drug Abuse Warning Network has data that says that heroin-related emergency room episodes increased a whopping 27 percent in 1997. Now, these are heroin-related episodes among teenagers--up 27 percent in 1 year. Cocaine-related episodes increased by 21 percent. We are not talking about the population as a whole; we are talking about teenagers. 
And between 1993 and 1994, the number of overall drug-related incidents rose by 17 percent for individuals between the ages of 12 and 17--12 years old. 
In 1993, one out of three juveniles detained by police were under the influence of illicit drugs at the time of their offense, and this is according to statistics from the U.S. Justice Department. This represents a 25 percent increase in crimes committed by young people--teenagers. 
It is plain to see that the Clinton administration has been asleep at the wheel on the illegal drug problem. The President is focusing much more of their time and energy on the use of tobacco. 
Just look at what the administration's Office of National Drug Control Policy has said about tobacco use by teens versus illegal drugs by teens. The drug control strategy of this administration is laid out in so-called performance measures of effectiveness. That is a very high-sounding thing we are going to do. But in this document, the administration discloses that they have more ambitious goals about lowering teenage smoking and tobacco use than they do about lowering teenage drug use. 
They state that their goals are to reduce youth tobacco consumption by 25 percent by 2002 and by 55 percent in 2007. Now, for drug use, they hope to get down about 20 percent by 2002, which is 5 percent less than tobacco, and 50 percent by 2007--again, 5 percent less than tobacco. So it is clear in black and white that the administration's 10-year national drug control strategy is focused on tobacco and not on drugs. 
While this President is busy taking on tobacco, a National Guard counterdrug program has been decreased by $32 million since 1997. This is the very program that helps local sheriffs, who simply cannot afford to own helicopters, planes, and the pilots to go with them. They are fighting drugs on a local level. 
With the President's approach, total smoking will not decrease at all; the children will be smoking marijuana and not tobacco. This administration cares more about tobacco use than it does about illegal drugs. In my opinion, this is a serious misplacement of priorities. 
Let me emphasize that I don't even have faith that what the McCain bill proposes to do--supposedly in the name of reducing 
teenage tobacco use--will even work. It rests on the twin pillars of an advertising ban and a price increase in order to accomplish a decrease in teen tobacco use. 
They propose doing away with tobacco advertising, and the sponsors argue that all these flashy, colorful tobacco ads cause kids to smoke. Well, there has never been, as far as I know, an ad for illegal drugs or marijuana in this country; yet, the youth of the Nation are using it more and more every day. They seem to have found out about it without it being advertised. 
Secondly, the McCain bill proposes to raise the price of tobacco products drastically, from roughly $2 to $5 for a pack of cigarettes, and that the youth of this country, the teenagers, are price sensitive. They think that raising the price would cause these teenagers to stop smoking. What it will do is provoke, quickly and surely, a massive black market so that schoolchildren will be able to buy smuggled cigarettes out of the back of a truck. 
I have some more news. If they think raising the price of a pack of cigarettes will slow down cigarette smoking, why hasn't drug use been totally eliminated? The price of marijuana and cocaine on the black market is astronomical. 
Therefore, the two pillars upon which the McCain bill rests its attack on teen smoking--an ad ban and a high price--are already in place with respect to illegal drugs. What have they done there? Not anything. 
Instead of focusing on these flawed approaches to fighting the problem of teen smoking, we should be looking at legislation that proposes new and innovative approaches to fight the crisis of illegal drug use by our Nation's young people. The hard facts show that there is no mission more vital to our Nation's future than doing more to protect our children and teenagers from the ravages of illegal drugs. 
Let's not ignore this problem because it is more politically popular these days to be against tobacco and to talk about it. This tobacco bill is nothing more than a smokescreen to hide the fact that the Clinton administration has been out to lunch on the drug war for 6 years. 
It starts from the top. The President joked about his own use of drugs. But drugs are no laughing matter, and they are destroying hundreds of thousands of young people in this country. They are the scourge of the schools and playgrounds. This amendment is about the safety and health of the next generation. It is about the future of this country. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and the remainder of any time I might have.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senators from Michigan and Delaware. I will stay within the 6 minutes. 
Madam President, I strongly support H.R. 2709. I come to the floor, however, rather worried about the administration's decision last week to waive sanctions against a French energy company that is doing a massive billion-dollar oil deal with Iran. The President's decision to waive imposed sanctions on the French energy company was done under the guise of national security. I have to wonder, and we all wonder, whose national security is he referring to when he chooses to waive the sanctions? Certainly, it is not the national security interests of the United States for Iran to improve its oil-exporting capability so that it can turn around and then use the same money to fund missile development. I certainly can't believe it is in the best interests of the State of Israel to have Iran improving its foreign cash reserves for the very same reasons. 
Iran is improving its cash reserves, and they are improving their missile technology. Just in January of this year, the CIA told the Senate that Iran would be able to target ballistic missiles at Israel much sooner than the 10 years that we had previously been led to believe. So, therefore, I have to conclude that he made this decision in the national interest of France and Russia. I think that is a very poor reason to make a decision of this magnitude. 
Here we go again. We are passing a good bill to impose sanctions on individuals who transfer missile technology to Iran. But section 105 of the bill permits a waiver based on the national security interests of the United States. The part that concerns me is the waiver. I am concerned about how the President has interpreted this in the other Iranian sanction bills. I think there should be no waiver. I do not trust the President's decision on waivers. Given that Israel was the only sovereign state, outside Kuwait, that was attacked by Iraq during the gulf war as they were attacked by missiles, I think there should be language in this bill and in the Iranian-Libyan section that mandates consultation with Israel before we choose to waive any sanctions for missile production or oil production. I think we owe it to our friends--the true friends in the Mideast--the Israelis. 
I hope that such legislation wouldn't be necessary and that the President would be more frugal in his actions. 
So I plan to introduce this as freestanding legislation. I hope we could consider this sometime in the very near future. We should be consulting with Israel before making decisions affecting their interests, just as much so, and more so, than we should be with Russia and France. Israel is a country that is most threatened by missile production by rogue states like Iran and Libya. 
I know there are some who think the Iranian regime is moderating itself. I personally don't think they are. But even if they are, I don't think that we should be lulled into a sense that we have turned the corner in our relations with Iran. They only respect the United States for its power. They simply laugh at us when we are weak. They take the President's waiver as a sign of weakness--not as a gesture of improved relations. 
The Mideast is still an extremely volatile area. The United States is at its best when we stand behind our true ally, the Israelis, as they have been our true ally. They have been our sea anchor in a turbulent part of the world. We should negotiate from a position of strength--not when we accommodate murderers and terrorists who pretend to be government figures. We should be supporting our true ally in the Mideast. 
Again, I strongly support the legislation. 
I yield the remainder of the time, and I thank the Senator from Delaware.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of a charitable contribution worthy of note. Lymphatic filariasis is a terrible disease that our citizens are not likely to see here in the United States, but it is one of the World's most disabling and disfiguring diseases. It affects people in 73 countries, mainly in tropical and subtropical areas of India, Africa, Asia and South America. 
The disease is caused by a parasite, carried by mosquitoes. Efforts to eliminate mosquitoes have not been successful in these regions, and the result is an endless cycle of infection for human hosts. 
The World Health Organization has embarked on a campaign to stop this dread disease. Lymphatic filariasis infects 76 million people world wide. The parasitic worms, often only the size of a thread, live in humans by lodging in the lymphatic system. They live for up to six years, producing millions of microscopic larvae that circulate in the blood. When symptoms appear, they can be devastating. Kidney damage and painful swelling of the extremities are typical examples of the suffering endured by these victims. 
The best previous defense against this disease was the administration of a single dose of two drugs, diethlycarbamazine of DEC and ivermectin. But when these drugs are administered at the same time with another drug, albendazole, the treatment is much more effective. Albendazole additionally kills hookworm, a very severe problem, especially in Africa. 
Earlier this year, the World Health Organization's Division of Tropical Diseases announced a program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. The cornerstone of this eradication program rests on the most generous charitable contribution in history. SmithKline Beecham, one of the world's leading healthcare companies, announced that they will provide their drug albendazole free of charge for the WHO effort. In addition to the drug donation, they are providing significant financial support to WHO to help implement the eradication program. 
Yesterday, SmithKline Beecham testified before the House Committee on International Relations during a hearing on the Eradication and Elimination of Six Infectious Diseases. Dr. David Heymann, WHO's Director of Emerging and Communicable Diseases was also testifying. Dr. Heymann has been a great resource and help to me as I've learned about the growing problem of global viral and bacterial epidemics. 
The hearing was worth noting, because it featured the contributions of many in the private sector to eradicate disease. Rotary International has made great progress in their effort to eliminate polio around the world. Merck & Co. has very generously, provided their drug Mectizan for the control of River Blindness, another filarial parasitic disease. 
Another tireless worker on behalf of World Health, and someone who played a major role in both the Merck and SmithKline Beecham donations, is former President Jimmy Carter. He deserves our thanks and recognition for his efforts.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, while we may all agree that teenagers should not be smoking, this bill goes well beyond reaching that goal. 
We should all be deeply concerned about the `tax and spend' approach that the bill takes to resolving a social problem. The bill reaches right into the pockets of hard-working low- and middle-income adults who, even tobacco's most staunch critics acknowledge, have every right to smoke if they so choose. 
And, it takes their hard-earned dollars to create yet more federal programs and to pay trial lawyers billions of dollars. We're literally grabbing money from the poorest Americans to buy trial lawyers more Learjets. 
To what end? There appears to be uncertainty as to whether price increases really have the effect of getting kids to stop smoking or to never start in the first place. 
And what is the real motivation here? If it were really to cut smoking, we wouldn't phase it in, we would drop it right at once. But we're not doing that because the tax-and-spenders want the revenues. I know they're not doing it for the tobacco companies. 
We all know that this isn't about smoking--it's about money. 
What unpopular product or industry is next--now that we, our nation's lawmakers, have decided that `and justice for all' really doesn't mean what it says. 
First, let's discuss the taxes imposed by the bill. Lots of people are jubilant at the prospect of this legislation passing. The plaintiffs' lawyers would become fabulously wealthy; the public health community would get all of its favorite projects generously funded; and, of course, the bureaucrats will get write volumes of new rules. 
The ones who won't be so happy are the working class families who have been targeted to pay for it all. 
In short, the McCain bill, through its highly regressive tax provisions, inflicts enormous costs on lower- and middle-income families. Let me put this regressivity problem in concrete terms. The increased excise tax payments under the McCain bill are projected to exceed $690 billion over the next 25 years. 
Based on analyses by the Joint Committee on Taxation, families with incomes less than $30,000 a year will wind up paying roughly 43 percent of these taxes. In other words, under the bill, families earning less than $30,000 a year will have to pay roughly $300 billion in new taxes over the next 25 years. 
This amounts to more than the total income taxes that these families are expected to pay over the same period of time. 
The numbers are even more striking if we look at families earning less than $75,000 a year. Other experts have estimated that families in this category will pay more than 83 percent of all the tobacco excise taxes, which means that families earning less than $75,000 a year will, as a group, pay more than $570 billion in new excise taxes as a result of the McCain bill. 
Where are the cries about regressive taxes? We're all so used to the long speeches about taxes on the poor. Or is that argument just used for convenience? This is the largest tax increase on the poor in years--if not in all time! 
It gets even worse. The numbers I just cited only take into account the excise taxes imposed by the bill. The reality is that the increases in the prices of tobacco products resulting from this bill will be substantially greater in magnitude. This is because of the look-back payments and the increased sales taxes as well as wholesaler and retailer margins that will be tacked on to any excise taxes. 
It is estimated that, based on projections of the actual increases in the prices of tobacco products, the true cost over the next 25 years will be more in the range of $380 billion for families earning less than $30,000 a year. it will be more than $735 billion for families earning less than $75,000 a year. 
These are truly staggering numbers. To put them in perspective, it is projected that once the new excise taxes under the McCain bill are fully phased in, the annual cost to the family of a smoker earning less than $30,000 a year will be $875. 
For a smoker's family earning less than $75,000 a year, the cost on average will be more than $950 each year. Now, a figure of $875 or $950 a year may not sound like much to these plaintiffs' lawyers who are expecting to get hundreds of millions of dollars. But I can assure you that this money means a lot to families trying to get by on $30,000 a year, or even on $75,000 a year. 
If this doesn't persuade you, let's hear from the experts on Wall Street. As noted by Morgan Stanley analyst, David Adelman: `98.5 percent of cigarettes are legally purchased by adult smokers, and therefore higher excise taxes will unfairly (and regressively) penalize adult consumers who choose to smoke.' 
So, we're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes to try to stop 1.5 percent of tobacco users from illegally buying tobacco. Why not just impose penalties on children who try to purchase tobacco? Well, I suppose, because it wouldn't be a jackpot for trial lawyers and Washington bureaucrats. The fact that it might help the children is irrelevant. 
Mr. President, I, for one, was not elected to sock the American taxpayer with more taxes. If teens are really our target, we owe it to the taxpayer to first explore other non-price measures to combat youth smoking. 
At a minimum, we need to explore whether there are ways to rebate these increased taxes back to the adult smokers who paid them--rather than using these regressive taxes to fund huge new government programs. 
Turning to the bill's disturbing reliance on new government programs, I find it highly ironic that we are here debating a bill that will increase the size of the federal bureaucracy when this is the Congress that is supposedly committed to reducing federal government bloat. 
The bill takes over half a trillion dollars in tobacco funds to fund new social programs or enlarge existing programs. 
We also need to think long and hard about the bill's Orwellian approach--giving the federal government more power to look over our shoulders regarding the personal choices we make. 
I'd like to take this opportunity to read into the Record a few excerpts from recent articles, articulating these concerns:  
Most Americans may not like smoking, but that doesn't necessarily mean they favor a big-spending nanny state. Yet if President Clinton and his supporters are allowed to succeed with this tobacco pact, the same extortionist tactics will undoubtedly be applied to other `sins.' Just imagine how much government could `do' by slapping a health tax on Big Macs and Budweiser. 
That's from the Detroit News, on April 24, 1998. 
I urge my colleagues to learn from experience. Too many times in the past, Washington has raised taxes in the name of one feel-good social program or another. The American people have consistently indicated that they are tired of that practice. 
We on the Republican side of the aisle were supposedly sent here to see to it that the tax and spend era of big government ceases to exist. I'm not so sure we're holding up our end of the bargain when we propose to pass legislation along the lines of the bill we're debating today. 
As I raised earlier in my remarks, we appear to be forging blindly into a tax and spend approach to combating youth smoking, even though it is highly speculative that higher prices will even have this desired effect. 
This legislation is going to result in a massive price increase for the entire smoking population, including the 98 percent of legal adult smokers. I think it is important that my colleagues are aware of all the facts before they vote on it.

The tax is on cigarettes and cigarettes are smoked by generally people with incomes of less than $40,000 to $50,000 a year. They are going to pay 70 percent of this tax. We are going to buy Lear jets for attorneys out of the working people of this country because 70 percent of this money we are going to pay to these attorneys comes from people making less than $40,000 a year. And how anybody can justify paying an attorney $100,000-plus an hour, and taking it out of the pockets of people making less than $40,000 a year, I don't know.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
We have had a lot of conversation today about limiting attorneys' fees, that this would be a new thing, that the Federal Government should never get into limiting the fees that these magnificent saviors of society, the trial lawyers, have done for us. 
We limit attorneys' fees to every other attorney under the Equal Access to Justice Act. We limit to $125 attorney fees against the Federal Government in civil rights cases. Now, maybe they are less important than the tobacco case, but they only get $125 an hour. 
The Criminal Justice Act has a cap in most criminal cases of $75 an hour, and the Internal Revenue Code limits to $110 an hour a cap for winning parties in tax cases. And here we are talking about $88,000 an hour in Texas, and this is a fixed, done deal. This is not a guess--$88,000 an hour. 
I just had to think what that meant. A trial lawyer makes more in an hour and a half than a U.S. Senator makes in a year. Now, maybe he is worth more, according to the testimony we have heard, but in an hour and a half, a Texas trial lawyer makes almost exactly the same amount of money that we pay a U.S. Senator for a full year's work. And they are saying, `No, you cannot cap these great people, they have saved society.' Time after time we hear what they have done to save mankind. Well, I don't think they are saving mankind. They are saving their own kind, and that is exactly what they are working on. 
We go back to what they are worth. I don't see how anybody can justify this. They say we are setting fees. We set fees on doctors of all types--anesthesiologists. For all doctors, we set fees. We set hospital rates. We set lawyer's fees. But yet, when it comes to these exorbitant, ridiculous fees that the American taxpayers are paying--and I repeat that 70 percent of this tax that is being collected and given to these attorneys is coming from people making less than $40,000 a year. Extrapolated, that is about 26 minutes' work for a Texas trial lawyer.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. We have been on this now for several hours, and we have come down to two things: Should we abrogate contracts or not? They say they are contracts with these attorneys, they have made these contracts. Well, maybe they have. But we are writing 750 pages of law abrogating contracts that the tobacco companies have written with advertising agencies, every condition conceivable. It is 750 pages of abrogating contracts. 
Now, if anyone can sit here and tell me that they believe that $88,000 an hour, which is the established fee on the Texas attorneys, is a reasonable fee, now, this is being paid by taxpayers' dollars; we are collecting this money from the working people. Seventy percent, as has been said by Senator Gramm and many others, 70 percent of it is coming from people making less than $40,000 a year. 
This is Federal tax dollars. It might not have started out to have been Federal tax dollars, but that is what it has become when we tax cigarettes and put the tax on these people. 
When I look at the reality, as I believe was mentioned by Senator Gramm, when a Texas lawyer makes in 3 hours more than the President makes in a year, and a Texas lawyer makes more in an hour and a half than a U.S. Senator makes in a year, there is something wrong with the system. We might not be that good, but we aren't that bad.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am offering this important amendment because we cannot allow this tobacco bill to turn into `Wheel of Fortune' for trial lawyers. That is why my amendment caps attorney fees at $250 per hour. 
Under the current bill, trial lawyers will get some $4 billion per year. Billion--with a `b'. And this is a conservative estimate--assuming a 15 percent contingent fee. The Medicaid cases will generate $1.2 billion per year. The tort cases will yield some $2.8 billion per year.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. So, Mr. President, who are these `superman' lawyers who deserve to be paid more than 20,000 times the salary of a working American? 
Well, one of them is Hugh Rodham, the President's brother-in-law. He is on line to get $50 million as a Castano group lawyer. Let me tell you about the hard work that he has done to get this big fee. Let me tell you about his background that made him so important to this group of trial lawyers. 
Well, actually, let me just read a couple of quotes from major newspapers to describe his work. 
`And just for good measure, the state of Florida has hired Hugh Rodham (Hillary Clinton's brother) to be a part of their litigation team, despite his complete lack of experience in these types of cases.' That's from the Knoxville News-Sentinel on July 20, 1997. 
Here is another choice description of the fifty-million-dollar man and his invaluable work. 
Hugh Rodham `spen[t] the last hours of the June 20th settlement talks in a corner reading a paperback by Jack Higgins, `Drink with the Devil.' That's from the Washington Post on June 23, 1997. 
Mr. President, I don't believe that this amendment needs much more justification than that. Fifty million dollars to sit there reading a book. 
But, if that isn't enough, let me talk about the Texas trial lawyers. These fine lawyers will get $88,000 per hour. This means $88 million per lawyer. What more can I say? 
Well, here's something. The money will be paid from money that was supposed to go for Medicare. Who do we pay--the sick and elderly or the greedy lawyers? 
Mr. President, there is a major political force at work behind the scenes in this tobacco legislative effort. I'm not talking about so-called `big tobacco.' What I'm talking about is the trial lawyers. 
They negotiate settlements in the millions of dollars, and they take fees in the millions of dollars, dwarfing what their clients get. They also stand to be the biggest winners if the tobacco settlement is enacted--a fact that appears to have become obscured in this debate. 
Now, with this national tobacco litigation settlement before us, we're not just talking about millions of dollars, or tens of millions of dollars, or even hundreds of millions of dollars. 
We are talking about tens of billions--with a `b'--of dollars that will be transferred from the pockets of average smokers in this country into the coffers of a handful of trial lawyers. 
I have read published reports that the trial lawyers are estimating that they will make upwards of $15 billion to $20 billion. That is hard to fathom. 
To illustrate, in the two biggest individual State settlements that have taken place so far, take a wild guess at what the major issue of controversy has been? 
For those of you who have not been paying attention, it has been attorneys' fees for the private plaintiffs' attorneys who were brought in to help the states sue the tobacco companies. 
In the State of Texas, for example, their $15 billion settlement is tied up because the Texas trial lawyers demanded over $2.3 billion for their work. These demands are ridiculous, and if we approve the McCain bill, we will be approving such billion dollar deals for these trial lawyers. 
Yes, the McCain bill provides the option for attorneys to use an arbitration panel to determine reasonable fees, but what attorney would be foolish enough to seek reasonable fees if they can get $2.8 billion. And, what is considered `reasonable' in this climate? 
It is ironic that these trial lawyers were brought in by the various States to pursue claims on behalf of the taxpayers in those States. 
That is, they have been brought in to stand in the shoes of our State governments and their taxpayers. But I ask you: who ultimately will be the greatest beneficiaries--the taxpayers or the lawyers? Experience has already provided us with an answer. 
We should not forget how the deck has been stacked with respect to these State lawsuits. It was only when State governments decided to use their weight, leverage, and resources to go toe-to-toe with the tobacco companies that these companies decided to settle the cases. 
States legislatures have even changed the laws mid-stream and retroactively to tilt the balance in their favor. 
The most recent example of this was in April when the Maryland General Assembly voted to change the law to permit the State of Maryland to seek compensation for taxpayer money paid for smoking-related illnesses. 
They first sued the companies, then realized winning the lawsuit perhaps was not going to be quite as easy as they first thought. They then went to the Maryland legislature and had the law changed retroactively so that their lawsuit against tobacco companies would be considerably easier. 
You can be sure that the Maryland plaintiffs' attorneys who stand to have a huge pay day as a result of this lawsuit were closely involved in lobbying the legislature on changing the liability law. 
I'm not saying that the attorneys' should not be reasonably compensated for the hours and energy they have spent in helping the States reach these settlements. 
All I am saying is that it is outrageous to say that a group of plaintiffs' attorneys should be allowed to enrich themselves under the guise of claims on behalf of taxpayers. These are the same taxpayers on whose back the spending in the McCain bill will fall. 
Let's also look at how this relates to our past debates over tort reform. The motivation behind national tort reform is that our system of justice has been distorted by a group of trial lawyers who caused the litigation explosion in this country. 
At a minimum, it is highly ironic that we are now talking about passing a national tobacco settlement bill that will handsomely reward the very same trial lawyers who have so badly corrupted our justice system. 
None of us should turn a blind eye to the fact that the debate on tobacco settlement legislation, under the guise of protecting youth, is really a debate about the pot of gold that potentially awaits the trial bar. 
And that's not to mention the `tax and spenders' who want to fund a host of social programs unrelated to tobacco. Not only are we standing here debating a huge tax increase on working men and women, we are simultaneously opening a can of worms. 
We're talking about sanctioning a handful of attorneys' attempts to enrich themselves at the expense of the clients--in this case, taxpayers--they purport to represent. I urge all my colleagues to give this serious thought. 
This tobacco bill is not a lottery. This is not `jackpot justice' for trial lawyers. The trial lawyers are playing `Wheel of Fortune' with the taxpayers money and it must be stopped. 
I urge you to support my amendment.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I take the floor today to discuss the sorry state of affairs that we find in Indonesia. The latest reports are that nearly 400 people have died in the past week of rioting and looting. 
Despite the crumbling of this nation, there is a stony silence from the Clinton administration. We have heard nothing. The administration apparently has no policy in place to deal 
with the instability in Indonesia. Yet, in my opinion, administrative policies were largely responsible for many of today's problems in Indonesia. We created the problem, and we are not doing anything about it. 
First, during this administration, investments in Indonesia have soared. Lending to Indonesia during the last 4 years by U.S. banks was larger than to other major nations in Europe. It was too much money chasing too few worthwhile investments. So the money began to chase investments that were not worthwhile. The administration encouraged it and promoted it and had close ties to Indonesian conglomerates, the Lippo Group being a leading candidate. 
Of course, this gold rush could not sustain itself. Vast amounts of money and weak investments always come home to you. And the bottom dropped out in Indonesia. 
Rather than take responsibility for these problems and take a leadership role in handling the financial crisis in Asia, the answer of this administration has been to delegate the problems to the International Monetary Fund. 
The IMF has bungled, from day one, the handling of the Indonesian crisis. From the closing of the banks on, from the day it went in, it has created a greater crisis. 
We never should have turned over international economic and foreign policy to a group of 2,000 silk-suited bureaucrats that have little if any success to show for the billions and billions of American taxpayers' dollars that they have wasted throughout the world. 
The panic began when IMF imposed their austerity measures. They have driven the Indonesian currency down to record low levels. Is it any wonder that riots have begun to break out in the streets and that 400 people have been killed when the currency is worth 300 percent less than it was a year ago? 
In fact, the riots began to take hold when the government raised the cost of fuel and electricity, as mandated by the IMF. 
Now, I repeat, the riots began to take hold when the government raised the cost of fuel and electricity as mandated by the IMF, the people we sent to bring calm and common sense to Indonesia. Another brilliant recommendation from the IMF, for a country finding itself plunged into poverty, was to raise the price of fuel and electricity. 
This is, again, another reason why the IMF is the last institution we need to provide funding to in order to solve the world's economic problems. Their record of solving world economic problems could not be worse. In fact, I would like for someone to point out a world economic problem that they solved. The numbers they have made worse are far greater than those they have helped. 
The only upturn in the Indonesian currency came when a currency board was suggested to stabilize monetary policy and there was a slight uptick in the value of the currency. But this idea was immediately smothered with pressure from the United States, this administration, and the IMF, that they could not have a currency board. Now we have a full-blown crisis in Indonesia. And the President is in Europe this week, and his aides are saying very little to nothing. 
I think it is incumbent on this country to take a leadership role and solve this problem that we had a large hand in creating. It can only get worse. There can only be more bloodshed, and we have no idea what kind of leadership will arise from the streets of Jakarta. We have no idea. It is time for the administration to stop sitting on the sidelines and get engaged in either easing the economic problem or making plans for a transition from the Soeharto regime. The IMF has done enough damage. Now the United States has to take a leadership role in the financial and political affairs of this country. 
It cannot--and I repeat, it cannot--be left up to the IMF anymore. It has proven its inability to function. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on S. 1873, the American Missile Protection Act of 1998. The bill is simple and its purpose can be stated very easily by reciting Section 3 in its entirety. `It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).' 
Everyone knows that it is necessary to first vote to stop endless debate on a bill when a filibuster has been threatened, then, after cloture, we can have limited debate followed by a vote on the bill itself. From this morning's vote, it can be seen that more than 40 percent of my colleagues feel that it should be the policy of the United States to keep our citizens exposed to the risks of a ballistic missile attack. 
Mr. President, I know that the Cold War is over. Unfortunately, although some would like to believe otherwise, this does not mean that we are one happy world, where all countries are working in mutual cooperation. It is no time for the United States to let down its guard or to cease doing everything possible to maintain our national security. 
The nuclear testing in India this week should shake some sense into those calling for the U.S. to disarm itself of our nuclear deterrent capability, as if that would set an example to the rest of the world. We cannot `uninvent' nuclear weapons everywhere in the world. Therefore, we must do the next best thing--prepare our best defense. 
During the Cold War standoff with the Soviet Union, we operated under a system known as MAD, for Mutually Assured Destruction. No country, back then, would attack us with a nuclear weapon because there was full realization that it would face certain annihilation because we could and would retaliate in kind, and with greater strength. MAD was never a completely risk-free strategy, though. We had to rely on the hope that other governments would act responsibly and not put their citizens in the path of a direct, retaliatory missile hit. This was the best we could do back then. MAD has outlived its usefulness today because we have the capability to protect ourselves better--we now have the ability to develop defensive technologies that can give us a system that will knock out a ballistic missile before it can land on one of our cities. 
It should be clear to everyone that in today's more complicated world the threat of a ballistic missile attack is not confined to a couple of superpowers; there is a greater risk than ever before of a launch against the U.S., either by accident or design, from any of a number of so-called `rogue' nations. And, with the additional risk that chemical or biological weapons can be launched using the same ballistic missile technology as is used for nuclear weapons delivery, the threat is more widespread and we must defend against it. 
Without National Missile Defense, there is a greater risk that an incident, even one involving chemical or biological weapons, could escalate into full scale nuclear war. If we must stick with a MAD strategy, we will have to retaliate once we identify a ballistic missile launch at the U.S. It would be much better to eliminate those missiles with a defensive system, and then determine what most appropriate response, diplomatic or military, we would undertake. 
Ignoring that National Missile Defense can keep us from an escalating nuclear war, critics of the American Missile Protection Act, through twisted logic, say that if the U.S. builds a defensive capability, this will drive the world closer to a nuclear war. Their argument goes something like this--if we can defend against a ballistic missile attack, there is nothing that will stop us from striking another country first because we no longer have to worry about retaliation. As incredible as it may sound, they say that a National Missile Defense is actually an act of aggression. 
In order to buy into such an argument, however, you have to first assume that the United States has been standing by, waiting to take over the world with its nuclear defensive arsenal, but the Soviet bear kept us in our cage. You would have to believe that Americans have been so intent on spreading democracy around the world that we would attack any country that would not adopt our free system of government and force democracy upon its peoples. 
No, Mr. President, building a National Missile Defense is not an act of aggression that would free us up to launch an unprovoked attack on other countries. It is an act of common sense in a dangerous world.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I have few superlatives that I can claim as a Member of the Senate, but one of them is that I have spent 52 years in active agriculture, farming, and in all phases of it. I would be hard pressed to find the crop or the livestock interest that I have not, at one time or another, been involved in. 
North Carolina is home to some of the most productive and largest farms in the Nation and the finest agricultural research universities, by far, in the Nation. I don't think that I play second fiddle to any Senator in support for reauthorization of the agricultural extension bill. It is critical to the farmers of this country and to the universities and the ag research universities. But the bill also makes important reforms to the Crop Insurance Program that will benefit farmers and taxpayers. Planting season is here, and we need to get it settled, and I am ready and anxious to do it. 
However, despite what I have just said, let me add, I don't play second fiddle to any Senator in my support of real welfare reform. Workfare, not welfare, was the platform I ran on for the Senate in 1992. The 1996 welfare reform bill, although watered down, was a real accomplishment for the 104th Congress. I preferred the first two bills that were vetoed by the President, but the third was still a good bill. That is why I am so disturbed that we are gutting the welfare reform and doing it in an agricultural research bill. 
This bill restores food stamps for 250,000 immigrants. We sit here and say very nicely, `But it doesn't amount to much; it is only 2 years on to 5, so let the 2 years go.' Will next year be at 10? In the following session of Congress, do we go to infinity? That is the reason we have a $5.5 trillion debt today, because 2 years wasn't very much, but 3 would be fine, and we kept going. 
In effect, it says, 
Welcome to America. Come on, you don't have to be productive. You know when you leave where you are and come to this country that you are going to be eligible for food stamps for 7 years, and by the time you get settled in, we will change the law where you will be eligible and you won't ever have to work because we will feed you. 
We already restored SI payments. Now we are throwing food stamps for another $80 million. 
We also said that the welfare reform bill ended welfare as we know it. Unfortunately, this agricultural research bill is welfare reform as we did it. These changes to the welfare reform law come at the insistence of President Clinton. He vetoed the first two welfare reform bills, and he has succeeded in rewriting the one that he signed. If he was going to start trying to rewrite it before the ink dried on it, he never should have signed it. 
I want the agricultural research bill without the food stamp provision to pass. Nobody is more in support of agricultural research and the whole agricultural bill than I am. It is critical to North Carolina, but the food stamp provision is a another step toward reversal of the welfare reform bill. 
Mr. President, the Statue of Liberty holds a torch of freedom, not a book of food stamps and a lifetime right to not to have to work. That is the flag we are waving to people coming into this country: `Sit down, relax, you are home free.' The Senator from Texas is doing the right thing, and I am proud to support him. I thank the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to ask everyone to take a moment to look at the most important stamp ever issued in our history, and that is the one we have the painting of here on the easel. I joined the U.S. Postal Service in unveiling this stamp in Chapel Hill, NC, yesterday, the day after Mother's Day, as my colleague, Senator Feinstein, did the day before in Los Angeles, CA. 
For the first time in U.S. history, the public will be able to play a more direct role in funding medical research and setting research priorities because of this stamp. 
This may look like a regular first-class postage stamp, but it is not. It is a semi-postal stamp, the first of its kind ever issued in this country. It took an Act of Congress to create it, and we did just that. It was done to raise money for breast cancer research. 
Incidentally, the United States is the only Nation around the world that has not issued semi-postal stamps before, but this stamp is different because part of the proceeds of this stamp will go directly to the NIH and the Department of Defense to pay for breast cancer research. 
My colleague from California, Dianne Feinstein, introduced this legislation here in the Senate as Congressman Vic Fazio did in the House of Representatives. While popular, the bill needed a vehicle to get it passed. I decided that if the Post Office could sell a Bugs Bunny stamp, they could sell a stamp to raise money for breast cancer research. I was able to add the proposal to an appropriations bill, and, along with the support of the majority of my colleagues here in the Senate and the House, the stamp now is born and in existence. 
The Postal Service was not excited about doing this stamp, and they were concerned that other groups sponsoring other diseases would be pushing for a similar stamp. I find no problem with that. I just cosponsored a bill introduced by Senator Snowe and Senator Burns that would create a semi-postal stamp to raise money for prostate cancer research. I think this is a great way to let the public play a much larger role in helping fund medical research, and the effort should be encouraged. In fact, the Postal Service Board of Governors met today and selected an old friend and fellow North Carolinian, Bill Henderson, to serve as the next Postmaster General. Let me be the first to congratulate an old friend. 
I have asked each member of the Postal Service Board to contribute an additional amount to this effort by turning over what would normally be collected for administrative costs to the cancer research fund. In other words, all of the gross money would go to cancer research. This is especially important in light of the fact that the Postal Rate Commission has just recommended that we raise the price of a first-class stamp by 1 cent. 
If only 20 percent of first-class stamp buyers decide to buy this postal stamp--only 20 percent, one-fifth--we will raise $120 million annually. That is the same amount of funding increase we fought for in last year's budget for the National Cancer Institute. The stamp will be sold for 40 cents when it goes on sale in August. The difference in price from 32 cents or 33 cents required to send a first-class letter, either the 7 cents or 8 cents, will go directly to the NIH and the Department of Defense for their breast cancer research studies. 
If I could turn this into a `Home Shopping Channel' for a moment and address all the folks who may be watching: Please, I ask that they themselves buy and urge their friends to buy the stamp when it goes on sale this August. It is a wonderful gift, and when so giving it, when you make a gift, No. 1, you are sure the gift will be used, and you encourage the recipients of the gift to in turn buy the stamp themselves after the gift supply has been exhausted. 
There may be some confusion because about a year ago the post office released a breast cancer awareness stamp. This was a nice gesture, but it provided no money. This stamp will raise money for all the women and families afflicted by this dread disease. Let's prove the post office wrong and make the sale of this stamp a record-setting event. 
I thank all my colleagues, and especially Senator Feinstein, for their help in making this semi-postal stamp a reality. I urge you to join with the Postal Service, corporate sponsors, and breast cancer groups to plan events to launch the sale of this stamp completely around the country and in all the States. It has to be a success. 
I thank the Chair, and I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to support the efforts of my good friend Senator D'Amato in his efforts to assure that women who need surgery for breast cancer will be able to do so in the hospital if that's what they desire. 
I'm disturbed by the recent trend that takes choice away from patients and their doctors in the name of cost savings. 
There are some things we just can't sacrifice. Patient's rights to seek care from specialty doctors and have access to cherished healers is a basic right we need to protect. 
Breast cancer is a traumatic enough experience for a woman and her family to suffer through. These families need our help in gaining as much support from our medical care system as they can get to bring them through this terrible time in their lives. 
This bill is simple. It simply guarantees a woman's right to a proper length of time in the hospital following her surgery. It guarantees the right to have a complete reconstruction of her breast to restore her body and sense of self-esteem. 
The bill gives every person diagnosed with cancer the right to a second opinion, and would direct the HMO to pay for this second opinion. Also, the bill directs HMO's to pay for a specialist even if that doctor happens to be outside the plan. 
Lastly, and most importantly, this bill prohibits HMO's from paying doctors to reduce or limit their patient care. 
This is managed care's dirty little secret. They pay doctors to limit the time spent with their patients and pay doctors not to provide care. 
I've heard from many, many, many constituents and doctors who are frustrated with this situation. If a doctor needs to spend time with a patient--time essential to healing--if a woman needs to be supported as she decides what to do for her breast cancer, I say give them all the time they need! 
I rise to support Senator D'Amato's bill today. We need to support our doctors and our women and their families.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in recognition of the National Peace Officers' Memorial Day and to pay tribute to the 305 officers of the law who lost their lives in the line of duty during the past year. I want to recognize specifically the six officers in North Carolina who put community safety ahead of their own lives. These six individuals approached the job valiantly. Their courage is inspiring, and their commitment to duty provides the kind of example so desperately needed in today's society. 
I would, of course, be remiss if I did not mention the families of the officers I now recognize. I extend my heartfelt gratitude and deepest admiration for those who everyday watch and support their husbands, wives, parents, and children on the front line of crime fighting. Their sacrifice is beyond measure, and we are forever indebted to these brave men and women. 
I call to the attention of Congress the names and survivors of North Carolina's six fallen officers and ask that my colleagues join me in saluting these courageous individuals. 
Sergeant William Earl Godwin who served with the Morrisville Police Department. Sergeant Godwin's survivors include his wife, Allison, and their daughter, Mercedes. 
Detective Paul Andrew Hale who served with the Raleigh Police Department. Detective Hale's survivors include his wife, Connie, and their daughters, Jessica and Stephanie. 
Chief of Police Willard Wayne Hathaway who served with the Sharpsburg Police Department Among Chief Hathaway's survivors is his son, Shaun. 
Corporal David Walter Hathcock who served with the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office. Corporal Hathcock's survivors include his wife, Barbara, and his sons, Phillip, Daniel, and Kevin. 
Sergeant Lloyd Edward Lowry who served with the North Carolina Highway Patrol. Sergeant Lowry's survivors include his wife, Dixie, his daughters, Lori and Melissa, and his grandchildren, Dustin, Brooke, and Nolan. 
Officer Mark Allen Swaney who served with the Davidson Police Department. Officer Swaney is survived by his parents, Larry and Glenda. 
Mr. President, every North Carolinian mourns the loss of our six peace officers. I am privileged to convey the State's resounding and unanimous sentiment of appreciation, and our continuing respect for the skills, bravery, and dedication of our law enforcement officers.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Reverend Ted B. Combs who recently stepped down as Pastor of the Oak Ridge Baptist Church. For 27 years, Reverend Combs faithfully led his congregation and selflessly gave to his community. His wife, Doris, and he have dedicated their lives to the service of God. 
Oak Ridge Baptist Church is located in Wilkes County, North Carolina, in the western part of the state. Reverend Combs was born and raised in these parts not far from the church that he would one day pastor. He has been an integral part of the community since attending the local high school, Mountain View. As an adult in Wilkes County, Reverend Combs has served the community in numerous positions including board member of the Wilkes County Nursing Home and honorary member of Mountain View Ruritan. 
The greatest testament, however, to Reverend Combs' stature in and respect among the community is given through those that live there. Wilkes County has a population of a little more than 60,000 citizens, and one would be hard pressed to find anyone who didn't speak kindly of Reverend Combs. His work in Wilkes County has touched the lives of so many. 
I'm proud to recognize the achievement of Reverend Ted B. Combs before the United States Senate and privileged to call him a fellow North Carolinian.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today corrects a flaw in an otherwise fine bill that was offered by Senator Roth, and that is to reform the Internal Revenue Service. And no organization ever needed reforming more. 
My amendment, which is supported by Chairman Roth, would remove the union representative for the IRS employees from the oversight board established by this reform bill. 
The reason for establishing the oversight board was that the union was out of control. That is very simply the reason we did not put it up there, that it is composed of private citizens--the oversight board--and not to be run by the union and the IRS bureaucracy. That is the problem we have been facing. 
If ever there was a case of hiring Willie Sutton to guard the bank, when we put a union representative on the board that is exactly what we have done. 
I just want to take a minute--and I will do it quickly--to explain why it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the IRS Oversight Board to accomplish its intended task of reforming the IRS as long as you have a union representative on the board. 
Mr. President, it was said in hearings last fall again and again, and last week, where we heard shocking and terrible testimony about abuses of taxpayers at the hands of IRS employees. These have been well documented, and the American people are outraged at what they have seen. I hear it on a daily basis. 
The American people are calling and telling the Congress that the IRS is an agency out of control and it must be reined in. Control must be established. And several of my colleagues, I have heard, have come up with the same thing. 
An oversight board, if it is truly a private citizen oversight board, could go a long way to rooting out the problems that are plaguing the IRS and will ultimately destroy it if they are not corrected. 
But the same employees who have been abusing taxpayers are certainly not going to like changes proposed by the oversight board, because it is going to change the way they have been doing business, and they do not want to change the way they have been doing business. That is the reason we are creating the oversight board, to change the way that the IRS union has been operating. 
Can you imagine what would happen if any decision which was opposed by the union IRS employees could be vetoed by the representative of the union? In effect, that is what we will have if a union representative is appointed a member of the board. You are going to negate the effects of the board. 
Some have suggested that unless a union representative is a member of the board, there will be no one to persuade the employees to go along with the reforms. All I can say is that anybody who says that has never run a business. 
I think that is the most foolish argument I have ever heard. I do not think IRS reform should be held hostage to what the union members like. 
If employees resist reform, and we have heard time after time in hearings about the abuses of these employees, then those employees should be removed from the IRS. We should not put the new oversight board in the position of begging the IRS employees, through their union, to agree to a change. If that is the way we are going to do it, there will be no change. It will be business as usual. 
Furthermore, it is common sense that the union representative should not be in a position to argue the case of the employees who pay his salary. I cannot think of anything more ludicrous than putting in an oversight board and then putting on it the man who works for the people who have created the abuses that the oversight board is intended to correct. It goes round and round. The union representative would be voting on issues which affect his own pocketbook--a clear conflict of interest. 
As Senator Sessions and Senator Thompson have already pointed out, putting the union representative on the oversight board does not just violate common sense, it violates Federal criminal law. Whether those laws are waived or not, we should not go down the road of disregarding criminal laws that are inconvenient for one person. We are waiving criminal laws because one person, a union representative, wants them waived. 
Let me share with my colleagues what the Office of Government Ethics had to say on the matter of including the IRS employee union representative on the oversight board. In a letter to the Senate Finance Committee, Chairman Roth and the ranking member, Senator Moynihan, dated March 27, the Office of Government Ethics said the following: `We recommended that the IRS reform bill not include an individual who is a representative of an organization,' which represents a substantial number of the IRS employees. 
Now, that is a nice way of saying don't put the union boss on the board. If you do, you might as well not create the board. 
The Office of Government Ethics, in another letter to the majority leader, dated May 1, 1998, said that putting the union representative on the oversight board is, `Fundamentally at odds with the concept that government decisions should be made by those who are acting for the public interest and not those acting for a private interest.' The private interest being referred to is the IRS employees union. So it is clear that the union representative will be in a position of violating criminal laws concerning conflict of interest if he or she serves on the oversight board, unless those criminal statutes are waived, and that is what we just did. 
Some of my colleagues who support including the IRS employee union representative on the board have tried to fix it by waiving the criminal laws, but we should not have waived a criminal law for one union representative. Both the Senior Executives Association and the Office of Government Ethics recommended removing the union boss rather than removing the waiver. I agree. 
On April 9, 1998, the Senior Executives Association, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization which represents career executives throughout the Federal Government, wrote to me to express their serious concerns about including an IRS employee union representative on the oversight board. The Senior Executives believe as long as the union representative is on the board, it will be impossible for IRS managers, the Commissioners, and the oversight board, and even the President, to implement the personnel reforms affecting IRS employees. In other words, as long as their `boss man' is sitting on the board, he isn't going to do anything to allow any reform. He will, in effect, veto the actions of the board. 
To quote the Senior Executives Association: `The inclusion of the union representative on the IRS Oversight Board threatens the ability of IRS management to manage and control the IRS workforce.' 
It would seem to me the last thing that Congress should do is make IRS employees even less accountable for their actions than they currently are. That would be hard to do. 
In summary of my amendment, take some good advice of the Office of Government Ethics and the Senior Executives Association and remove the union representative from the oversight board. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. 
Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Safe Highways Act. 
This bill authorizes $20 million per year over the next five years for enforcement activities to prevent unsafe foreign trucks from rolling across our borders under NAFTA. This bill will fund inspections at our borders to keep these Mexican and Canadian trucks off our roads unless they meet our tough truck safety standards. Our standards are higher than in Mexico and Canada, and, certainly, I do not want these trucks rumbling down our roads and threatening the safety of our families. 
Mexican trucks are already permitted to operate in limited areas in the United States and, in fact, they have been doing so for two decades. We can enforce these standards at the border, but it will take training and an increased effort to handle the additional traffic from NAFTA, so we need to step up and put this money aside. These foreign trucks will soon roam more of our roads under NAFTA. We need to be ready. This is literally a matter of life and death for American families who share the road with these trucks.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing the Improved Military Medical Plan Act, IMMPACT for short, to ensure that military retirees and their families will continue to be given proper medical care. This past May 1, the Defense Department implemented its new health care program, known as TRICARE, in two more regions of the country, including in North Carolina. As the number of TRICARE enrollees increases and as the Military Health Services System is downsized, military retirees will have an even harder time finding space available at military facilities. 
Effectively, those military retirees over 65 are left with no military medical benefit, since they are unlikely to get into military facilities. 
Mr. President, this is a far cry from the promise that our government made to these retirees when they put in a full career in uniform risking their lives for our freedom. They were promised medical care for life, and everyone believed that it would be at base medical facilities. It just is not right to renege on that promise after all that these men and women have done for our country. 
We can and must do better. IMMPACT will allow Medicare-eligible military retirees, their dependents, and their survivors to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. It will also provide a very strong incentive for the Department of Defense to ensure that TRICARE is offering active duty personnel and younger retirees and their families a medical benefit equivalent to the federal civilian program. 
IMMPACT sets up a three-year demonstration. Ideally, the demonstration would be conducted on a nationwide basis, but I realize that such a broadly geographical demonstration could be difficult to manage. So the bill directs the Administration to have as expansive a demonstration as practicable, as long as at least six sites around the country are selected. 
The IMMPACT demonstration is simple. Medicare-eligible retirees of the uniformed services as well as their dependents and survivors at the selected demonstration sites will be able to apply for enrollment in the health care plans of the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. Every year, the Administration will report to Congress on the value of this health care option, how many eligible beneficiaries want to enroll, how much the demonstration is costing, how it compares to other health care options available to the beneficiaries, to name just a few of the metrics. 
The IMMPACT demonstration is only open to Medicare-eligible retirees. But, as I mentioned earlier, IMMPACT provides strong incentives for the Department of Defense to make TRICARE as comprehensive as FEHBP. The fine men and women now serving in the Armed Services and those who went before them deserve to be treated at least as well as civilian federal employee and retirees. 
This is very important to me. We have all heard of, or even experienced, health care plans where `cost' is a more important factor than `service.' Two health care plans could appear equivalent on the surface--their premiums could be about the same, they could have many locations for treatment, etc. But, if one plan is more bureaucratic than another, or it delays payments to doctors, or it is too tight on the definition of what is a `reasonable and customary charge,' eventually, the best doctors are going to drop out. In the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, civilian employees and retirees can opt out of a bad plan because they have a choice of many plans. But, in TRICARE, there is no real choice. There are no competitive pressures to keep TRICARE equivalent to the better civilian plans. 
IMMPACT will fix that. Within six months after the passage of IMMPACT, the Administration must submit a report to Congress that sets forth a plan to enhance TRICARE, if necessary, so that it is at least as comprehensive as the plans used by civilian federal employees and retirees. 
IMMPACT is independent of other demonstration programs. Some may argue that IMMPACT is not needed because we are running a Medicare Subvention demonstration. But, there is no reason why IMMPACT should wait for that program to be completed and evaluated. In fact, I want IMMPACT to be offered to the same retirees that could chose the Medicare Subvention plan. In this manner, we will have some clear market signals about the value of each of these options within the same customer community. 
At the end of the IMMPACT demonstration program, the Administration will advise the Congress of the need to extend the eligibility of participation in the Federal Employees Health Benefits program, first nationwide to all Medicare-eligible retirees, and then to all retirees or active duty personnel, if TRICARE proves to be inferior to the civilian health care benefit. 
Mr. President, some may complain that this program will increase the Defense Department's cost of delivering medical benefits. Perhaps it will. But, I think our military men and women and their families deserve a better health care program than they are being offered now. Clearly, if we can find the money to fund our extravagances in the arts and entertainment, we can find funding for medical care for those who have been willing to risk their own lives in defense of our liberty and freedom. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support IMMPACT.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, we talk a lot around here about innovation, competitiveness and global leadership. The vast majority of us agree that these values are important and worthy of concern. 
Those of us who see the inherent limitations of government know that promoting innovation and U.S. economic competitiveness is largely about getting government out of the way and letting the free market work its will. 
Unfortunately, playing out today is yet another episode of government doing things to business rather than getting out of the way. Microsoft Corporation, one of America's most successful companies, has come under attack by the Clinton Justice Department at the urging of its competitors. 
The Justice Department's newly aggressive Antitrust Division is waging a slick, media-intensive antitrust campaign against Microsoft. The Justice Department claims to be acting in the name of promoting competition despite the fact that the computer industry is the most dynamic, open and competitive business sector the U.S. has ever witnessed. Prices are falling, innovation is thriving and consumers are empowered as never before. 
But in their wisdom, Clinton antitrust lawyers and bureaucrats have decided that the heavy hand of government will improve innovation and help consumers. 
Frankly, I am fearful that this is the government's first attempt to begin regulating America's high tech industry. In my opinion, this would be a disaster. 
Despite the artful and high-minded rhetoric coming from Clinton Antitrust lawyers and their few industry cheerleaders, it is inconceivable to me that government regulation will improve innovation and consumer welfare. 
And it is clear that the computer industry agrees. On April 30, 1998, for example, twenty-six computer companies wrote to Joel Klein, the Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust Division, expressing their `strongest possible concern' about the effect on the U.S. economy of the government's campaign against Microsoft. The companies who signed the letter ranged from such industry leaders as Intel Corporation, Compaq Computer Corporation and Dell Computer Corporation, to smaller companies such as Insight Enterprises, Inc. of Tempe, Arizona and Elsinore Technologies, Inc. of Raleigh, North Carolina. 
I am concerned that, in addition to threatening the freedom to innovate and consumer choice, this aggressive pursuit of Microsoft may threaten U.S. global leadership in the software and computer industry. When Congress crafted the antitrust laws, the world was a different place. Most markets were not global. Capital was not mobile. Our focus was largely domestic. In today's economy we must concern ourselves with the global implications of policy decisions. 
I respect that within clear and narrow limits, basic antitrust laws are necessary to preserve free markets. But from where I sit, the track record of the Antitrust Division is hardly stellar. 
For example, in 1969 the Justice Department opened a case against IBM that lasted 13 years. But by the time the government dropped the case, IBM had experienced a serious erosion of its market share at the hands of new computer startup companies, including--ironically--Microsoft. The marketplace and consumers had their say, not government. 
Mr. President, is this an outcome we want for Microsoft? Is the idea to sap Microsoft's vitality through litigation so that its competitors, whether domestic or foreign can play catch-up? 
Another case involved the Schwinn Bicycle Company. Once a proud and successful American manufacturer of bicycles, it found itself the subject of an antitrust prosecution in 1967. The case opened the door to foreign companies, and a weakened Schwinn ultimately declared bankruptcy in 1992. Again, is this the model for Microsoft? 
Business historian Alfred D. Chandler attributes an antitrust consent decree against RCA as precipitating the decline of the U.S. electronics industry. The subsequent rise of the Japanese electronics industry is now well known. 
The push to regulate the software industry under the guise of antitrust law should concern us all. It is government regulation by any other name; and like the cases above, will prove shortsighted. Who can take comfort in the thought of a federal judge deciding which features will go into software products? We have tried this before and no one should welcome a repeat. 
America is the leader in software and computer innovation because government has stayed out of the way. The creative process and innovative genius marked by the software industry is fragile. The heavy hand of government regulation, whether direct or at the hands of antitrust lawyers and judges, threatens the innovations of tomorrow and the U.S. global leadership of today. 
Mr. President, somewhere today, there is a 22 year old, working in his garage on a new product. Ten years from now--he or she may be America's richest individual. We don't know. But what I do know is that I don't want to deny him or her the right to be creative. To start a company and to give the big companies a run for their money. But if we go down the road of regulating this industry, I am certain that we will call to a close a very prosperous era for the U.S. I don't think we want our vibrant economy washed away because some people at the Justice Department had nothing else better to do with their time.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning Section 10007, a general provision included in the conference report for the emergency supplemental appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. My amendment is a technical amendment clarifying that the terms of the contract recently signed by the new Police Chief for the District of Columbia are valid and not in conflict with existing law. The new Police Chief, Charles Ramsey, was unanimously approved for the job by the D.C. Council, the Mayor, the D.C. Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority (the Control Board) and the Mayor's Citizens Advisory Panel. The employment contract, which called for Chief Ramsey to report to the Control Board, was signed by the Mayor without objection on April 21, 1998. An April 23, 1998 legal opinion written by the District of Columbia Corporation Counsel challenges the legality of the contract. This opinion has created a potential crisis of uncertainty over who Chief Ramsey will report to and threatens to sidetrack the Chief as he begins to clean house at a very troubled department. My amendment simply states that the Chief's April 21, 1998 contract is valid. It also makes clear that, so long as the Control Board--which Congress created--exists, all future Chiefs of Police will work under the same reporting conditions as Chief Ramsey. This amendment is imperative if we are to support the Control Board, Chief Ramsey, and the citizens of the District of Columbia, who deserve a police department that can protect them on the streets and in their neighborhoods.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to explain my support of Senator Gorton's amendment to the Coverdell A+ Accounts legislation. I was pleased to support the Gorton amendment because it returns the decision making authority over our children's education to parents, teachers, and locally elected school boards. After more than 30 years of top down control, it is clear that the hundreds of federal education programs and one size fits all policies from Washington, D.C. are not working. 
The Gorton Amendment allows each state to choose from one of three options: to have federal funds sent directly to local school districts minus federal regulations; to have funds sent to the state education authority without federal regulations; or to continue to receive federal funds under the current system of categorical programs. Any changes to the current system are not mandated by the federal government--but are left to the discretion of the states. 
I believe this is a wonderful opportunity to send money directly to local school districts free from the excessive mandates and regulations imposed on our schools from the Department of Education. I want it clearly understood, though, that this does not affect my support for the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards. I support the National Board and support further funding for its initiatives. 
The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) seeks to establish high and rigorous standards for teachers. It is leading the way in making teaching a profession dedicated to student learning and to upholding high standards for professional performance. Teachers are role models for our students and our communities. Interestingly enough, they are the ones leading the way in establishing and implementing the National Board certification. 
I fully support the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and hope that this body will support it for the sake of our young people. It is children in their care that are the beneficiaries of teacher improvement.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I note that all 100 Senators have joined me as cosponsors of this resolution. 
This resolution is to honor a truly great American and a great North Carolinian, former Senator Terry Sanford, a man I knew since I was about 18, 19 years old. In fact, I joined him in managing the campaign for a candidate for Governor, a man named Kerr Scott, and with that election we changed the direction of politics in North Carolina. 
We had a long friendship. As I say, it began with that campaign, and we went through many political campaigns together. He had a remarkable life. He managed two or three senatorial campaigns on which I had the pleasure of working with him. 
Prior to that, Terry Sanford graduated from the University of North Carolina in the late thirties. During World War II, he was an FBI agent in the early part of the war, in the very beginning, but being an FBI agent was not exciting enough for Terry Sanford. He chose to join the 82nd Airborne and became an officer and a paratrooper. He was involved in five different battles during World War II, and he won the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. 
Terry Sanford was always a paratrooper. He was ready to go for it. He was ready to jump into the middle of whatever might be happening. 
As I mentioned earlier, he managed and ran some political campaigns, but he was also a State legislator and took great interest when he was a State legislator in developing the Port of Wilmington, NC, and established the ports authority for North Carolina. 
He ran for Governor and won. He was Governor from 1961 through 1965, and never did a man have greater vision for a State than Terry Sanford had for our State. He was a leader in education, but not just education in the sense of teaching young people to read and write and the fundamentals of education. He certainly did that and promoted that. But far more, he promoted a school of excellence for those children who were far more gifted. Then he established a school of the arts, which now exists in Winston-Salem, NC, and is one of the foremost training and teaching institutions in the country for young people who are entering the arts from dancing to moviemaking. This school is there because of him. 
Although he did not technically start the community college system, he did more than any Governor we have had since or before to promote the community college system in North Carolina with 59 campuses. He really brought it to fruition. 
Again, although he did not start, technically, the Research Triangle Park, he and his administration were deeply involved in bringing it about and setting it on the path it has taken. 
I mentioned he was a lawyer for many, many years and started a couple of very prestigious law firms. After his tenure as Governor, he became president of Duke University and served there for some 15 years. It was a great school, a great university when he went there, but the changes, the improvements, the expenditures, the endowment, the doubling of the medical center all transpired and took place under the leadership of Terry Sanford as president of Duke. It became an internationally recognized university under his tenure. 
He came to the U.S. Senate and left an admirable record here with many initiatives that he sought and worked toward. One of them is something we are still working on today, and that is to ensure the future and fiscal stability of Social Security. 
Senator Sanford was married to Margaret Rose, his wife of 55 years. They had two children, Terry, Jr., and a daughter Betsy. 
North Carolina and the Nation are better places today for all of us to live in because of men like Terry Sanford and because of Terry Sanford and his vision and tenacity to carry it forward. The country will miss him, the State will miss him and I will miss him as a friend. 
Mr. President, I believe I said this, but I will note that all 100 Senators have joined me in cosponsoring this resolution. 
Are there any other Senators wishing to speak?

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would provide nearly $5 billion in federal loans for school modernization and construction. 
Mr. President, this legislation would transfer $5 billion from the Exchange Stabilization Fund at the Treasury Department to the Department of Education and create an Education Modernization Fund. 
The legislation would create a new account called the `Education Modernization Fund' that would be used to offer low interest, long term, loans to states for the purpose of building and modernizing elementary and secondary schools. The loans would be used for school districts with fast growing elementary and secondary student populations. 
The GAO has estimated that one-third of all schools, housing 14 million students are in need of repair. In my home state of North Carolina--36% of schools report that they have at least one inadequate building. Fully 90% of schools report that they have some construction needs. The state estimates that $3.5 to $10 million is needed for school repair needs. North Carolina has one of the fastest growing student populations. 
The purpose of my legislation Mr. President is very simple. We have a slush fund at the Treasury Department called the `Exchange Stabilization Fund.' This fund is under the personal control of the Secretary of the Treasury. He can do whatever he wants with it. Over the past four years--he has used it to supplement international bailouts, which I think is very wrong. 
He loaned $12 billion to Mexico. I have to ask, why not $12 billion for schools if New Mexico? 
He has promised Indonesia $3 billion. Why not funds for schools in Indiana? 
He has promised South Korea $5 billion. Why not $5 billion for South Carolina? 
We have our priorities backwards with this Administration. 
The ESF has all been used without any Congressional approval or authorization. Further, the fund has more than $30 billion available to it. 
I think it is time that we transfer a small part of this money and put it to good use by using it for school construction. 
Additionally, Mr. President, in my opinion this plan is far better that the Democrat alternative that is being offered today, the one offered by Senator Moseley-Braun. 
The Moseley-Braun formula is skewed so that much of the money will go to the larger cities and low income communities--whether or not there is a need for new schools. My plan is formulated for student population growth. For example, under the Coverdell, Republican bill--Rockingham County, North Carolina would be the first school district eligible for school construction bonds because of student growth. 
But under the Democrats' plan, my state would receive less than its fair share. For example, North Carolina ranks 11th in national population, and Massachusetts, ranks 13th, but under the Moseley-Braun bill, Massachusetts would receive $20 million more in funds. Louisiana which ranks 22nd in population would receive nearly $90 million more than North Carolina. Of course, its no surprise that New York, California and Illinois, under their plan, receive nearly 25% of all the money. 
The Democrats alternative would also put the Department of Education in charge of school districts. The DOE would have to approve any school construction plans. Schools that receive the federal benefit would have to meet certain curriculum standards and have federal mandates about graduation and employment rates. 
Finally, in order to finance the government's school construction, it wipes out the increased IRA savings for education. There is no more starker contrast between two visions of education: parents being allowed to keep their money for their children's education --or the federal government taking it to enhance the power of the Department of Education. 
In my view the solution is simple, we don't need to rob parents of their savings for education to pay for school construction--we need to take the foreign aid slush fund from the Treasury Department and put it to worthy domestic uses, like school construction.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks about legislation to reform the Internal Revenue Service. 
Mr. President, April 15 is just around the corner, and I would guess that sometime between now and then, many a taxpayer will curse the IRS, and quite probably the Congress, too, for the tax bill they face. The American people are taxed too much, and they are due for some tax relief this year. 
Even figuring out how much tax to pay has become a nightmare. At 17,000 pages, the tax code and regulations are so complicated that no one but a few tax attorneys and accountants who make their living off that tangle of laws can ever hope to understand it, let alone the average working family. 
Mr. President, it looks increasingly like the Senate will fail to pass legislation to reform the IRS before adjourning at the end of this week for Easter recess. I am deeply disappointed that we appear unlikely to pass such legislation before April 15. Last week, I asked the Senate leadership to pass IRS reform legislation before April 15. In just a moment, I will describe some of the features I think should be included in such a bill. 
The American people deserve an IRS Reform bill as soon as possible. Last December, I held a hearing in Raleigh, North Carolina on IRS abuse of taxpayers. I was shocked at some of the stories I heard. In response, I introduced legislation to create an all private citizen oversight board for the IRS. My bill would give the oversight panel the authority to delve into the auditing and collections practices of the IRS which have lead to well documented abuse of taxpayers. The board would also have oversight of IRS procurement practices. That should help ensure that we never see the IRS waste another $4 billion, as it did trying to develop a failed computer system. 
Why is the Senate about to recess without having passed an IRS reform bill? In the crazy world of Washington, D.C., it seems that when the Congress tries to stop the IRS from improperly collecting taxes, budget rules require that the `loss' of revenue be offset with more taxes, making it almost impossible to clean house at the IRS. And so the Senate has now been diverted over the question of how to `pay' for an IRS reform bill, and which tax increases are least objectionable to use for that purpose. 
The referee in such matters is the Joint Committee on Taxation. The accountants and tax experts at this committee review all tax proposals, and make a determination as to which measures result in a loss of revenue, and which are revenue neutral. 
No matter what the green eye shade experts say, it just seems wrong to ask the American people to pay for IRS reform. IRS reform legislation should not impose new taxes. Fortunately, there are a great many good ideas for reforming the IRS which even the Joint Committee on Taxation staff have said can be enacted without the need for new taxes. 
First among these is the creation of an IRS oversight board, such as the one I have proposed in my own IRS reform legislation, S. 1555. There are a number such reforms which can be implemented without any need for offsetting revenues, including: a requirement that IRS agents explain taxpayers' right to them in interviews; low-income taxpayer clinics; archiving IRS records so that Congress can delve into the inner workings of the agency; cataloging complaints of IRS employee misconduct; prohibiting the IRS from seizing taxpayers' homes in small deficiency cases, among others. One idea that would impose no additional cost, but which I am sure would make a big difference for frustrated taxpayers who struggle to find a person to talk to in within the massive IRS bureaucracy: require that all IRS notices must contain the name and telephone number of an IRS employee to contact. 
In fact, of the 75 separate reforms currently being considered by the Senate Committee on Finance, over 50 are revenue neutral, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. At a minimum, these reforms should be considered as soon as possible. If any revenues are needed to pay for additional reform, I suggest that Congress look first to the IRS's own budget before turning to the American people. 
For those who worry that the IRS will not have enough resources to collect taxes, it is worth noting that the IRS budget has grown by a whopping 71 percent in real terms since 1981. Many working families haven't been so fortunate. Simply freezing the IRS budget at 1998 levels would generate an additional $500 million in savings, which could be applied to offset more costly IRS reforms. That would also help make it clear that Congress considers taxpayers to be at least as important as the IRS bureaucracy.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I wish to offer a few remarks to make clear my vote on the Conrad amendment. I don't want to see a potential tobacco settlement degenerate into just a piggy bank for the Clinton Administration's plans to expand social programs. Certainly, the revenues need to go to health care, but I will not let the Senate forget about tobacco farmers. I voted for this amendment today because it included the tobacco farmers, and the Smith amendment does not. I do not want my vote to imply an endorsement of other programs in this amendment, however, and I do not want to see public health programs turned into politicized slush funds. I think that this scenario poses a real danger. However, I want to see the Senate on record in support of farmers, and this amendment recognizes the need to protect them from the impact of tobacco legislation.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I rise to speak on the Hutchison-Faircloth marriage tax elimination amendment. It is cosponsored by a number of Senators: Senator Domenici, Senator Inhofe, Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas, and Senator Gramm of Texas. 
Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Domenici for the tremendous help on the issue he has given us on the elimination of the marriage tax in this budget resolution. What this amendment says is very simple, that it is the sense of the Senate that eliminating the marriage penalty tax should be one of the highest priorities for tax relief this year. 
The Congressional Budget Office has reported that in 1996, 21 million American couples paid an average of $1,400 more in income tax simply because they were married. The marriage penalty, as it is sometimes called, comes about as a result of the way the Tax Code is written. It needs to be rewritten so that couples who chose to marry do not get a hefty tax bill for choosing to make that decision. 
We should be encouraging couples to marry, not handing them a $1,400 tax bill. I introduced this legislation along with Senator Hutchison to correct this problem. The majority leader, Senator Trent Lott, has also been tremendously supportive. Senator Hutchison, Senator Lott, and I recently pledged on Valentine's Day that we would work to remove this burdensome tax known as the marriage penalty. I think that it is a reasonable goal. We are a step closer today with the budget resolution. I urge support for the amendment, and I yield back any time.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating National Public Health Week during the week of April 6 through April 12. I believe that this years theme, `healthy people in healthy communities' says it all. It should be the goal of every single one of us of help focus public attention on major health issues in our communities, and the contributions our public health professionals play in addressing our health and safety needs. 
Established by Congress in 1995, public health week affords us an opportunity to learn and to teach others about public health success stories like the elimination of small pox and polio and improvements in childhood immunization. Few people know that it was public health that successfully waged the war to reduce lead from paint, fluoridate drinking water and protect people from gasoline vapor, thus giving our children a brighter future and gaining a 30-year increase in life expectancy in the 20th century. 
Incidence of heart disease and stroke have dramatically declined through public health community-wide education initiatives. As someone who represents people who live in the buckle of the stroke belt in the United States, I was pleased to learn that 2 million American deaths from heart disease and stroke have been prevented in the past thirty years through public health prevention programs. 
I urge my colleagues to take a moment during spring recess to participate in public health activities in their states. In years past, North Carolinians have organized health fairs in churches and community centers, and sponsored `healthy eating' cooking contests to commemorate the week. I urge all Americans to take the time to evaluate their own personal health consciousness. 
As we approach the millennium, threats of biological and viral epidemics plague our communities like never before. Our public health departments and professionals serve as our first line of defense against the growing threat of infectious disease and bioterrorism. With less than 40 percent of our health departments able to communicate by computer with CDC, it is our obligation to provide public health with the manpower, training, and equipment needed to fight these growing threats. 
Our U.S. Public Health Service will celebrate their 200th anniversary this summer, and the 50th anniversary of the World Health Organization. Let us be the Congress that is known for making the health of our citizens our No. 1 priority. 
Mr. President, it is my honor and privilege to submit to you today a Senate resolution to recognize the contributions of public health and prevention services to our nation in an effort to celebrate National Public Health Week.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am delighted to accept the amendment from Senator Gregg. It is a good amendment. The States have a burden complying with this law, and I have no problem with using $1 billion of the $5 billion we are proposing so the States can meet the law. 
Again, these are loans to the States which, in my opinion, is much better than loans to Korea, Mexico, Indonesia, and others, the likes of which we have been giving it to.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, what this amendment is about is very simple. As I have said many times, if we can provide $18 billion for the IMF without any budget impact at all, I think we can certainly waive the Budget Act, if it comes to that, to provide $5 billion for school construction. I don't think it violates the Budget Act. 
The ESF at Treasury loans out money. This is what it does. This is what the new fund will do. The only difference is that this money, I propose, will be loaned to the school systems throughout this Nation to rebuild the schools rather than to overseas ventures. 
The reason I offer this amendment is this appropriations bill went from a $2 billion emergency bill yesterday to an $18 billion international bailout today. I am concerned about the priorities of some of my colleagues in this body. We are spending money in a supplemental for operations in Bosnia--a supplemental. Is there anyone who seriously thought that the President was going to remove the troops in June of 1998, as we committed he would? Why did we ever think he would keep that promise? We have no plans to leave Bosnia. There is no plan to leave Bosnia. We could well be there on into infinity. As long as we put up money, we will be there. 
Second, we are spending money for operations in the Persian Gulf, $1 billion already, to back up a U.N. resolution. Yet, the administration says that we haven't paid our dues to the United Nations. Well, if they will pay us for the Persian Gulf operation, we will give them a check for the United Nations. 
Third, we are providing $18 billion for the IMF--$18 billion. I am as opposed as a man can be to sending our money--and they were identified by the majority leader in this body as Socialists--I am opposed to sending our money to silk-suited dilettantes to spread around the world like it was holy water and theirs to do with as they see fit. This is not what our money should go for. These are not my priorities. These are the priorities of the Clinton administration, to send the money to the IMF while they flit around the country on a diet of champagne and caviar at the expense of the American taxpayer. 
I am tired of and not going to go along with the Tom Sawyer trick of us painting the fences for the administration, and that is, very frankly, what we have done. We have catered to and 
gone along, one behind the other. 
I have priorities that I think need pushing. I think it is far more important to rebuild the schoolhouses and school buildings in North Carolina than it is to spend the money around the world for international bailouts. There is no end to them. 
Just to take 1 minute on this international bailout, if the Secretary of the Treasury Rubin and the administration will come forth and say this is the last $18 billion, then I might think more kindly of it, but they wouldn't begin to tell you that, because they know they are going to be back before the year is out for $28 billion more. They have already planned it. 
I don't work for President Clinton, thank goodness. I work for the people of North Carolina. Very simply, if we can afford to make loans to Mexico, Korea, and Indonesia from the Exchange Stabilization Fund, then we can afford to make loans to the States for school construction and modernization. 
According to the Congressional Research Service, this Exchange Stabilization Fund had over $30 billion at the end of 1997. This has become a giant slush fund in the Treasury Department. They do their dead-level best to keep the fund a secret, because it is under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Treasury, and, as I say, they flit around and pass it out. I think it is time for the Congress to stand up and say where it goes and when it goes and spend the money for domestic purposes, whether the Treasury likes it or not. 
I thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, North Carolina suffered a great tragedy last Friday. In less than a moment, without any time for warning, two communities in Rockingham County were hit by powerful tornadoes that left two dead, nearly 30 injured, and indescribable destruction in their wakes. 
The good people of Stoneville and Mayodan have pulled together and have already set about the difficult job of picking up the pieces and rebuilding their communities. Homes and businesses are being put back together. Roads, fields, and streams are being cleared of trees and debris. 
Speaking for the state and Rockingham County, Mr. President, we are thankful for the federal disaster declaration, which came so quickly, and permitted the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and all the agencies and volunteer organizations to come to the scene so soon after disaster struck. And I have confidence that appropriate federal aid will continue.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank Senator McConnell. 
I do not support the IMF compromise because I think it is incredibly weak. I did not support IMF funding out of the committee, and I think it is absolutely sinful to support $14 billion more to go to the IMF. It is everything but an emergency. It probably isn't even needed. In fact, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan said there was just the remote possibility of it ever being needed. The IMF is the problem; it is not the cure. Once people realize that, I think they will be in less of a hurry to give them $90 billion. 
Further, this has no possibility of ending our international economic problems. There will be other bailouts. The IMF has created a safety net for international lenders. We have put together a corporate welfare project, the likes of which we have never in this world seen. We have privatized the profit, and we have socialized the losses. We are asking today for $18 billion for Asia. Well, it sounds fine. Why don't we go ahead and ask for $40 billion so we can be ready for Russia in 6 months? We might as well have it in reserve. 
We do not want to do anything that would inconvenience Mr. Camdessus, who flies around the country in leased jets with 2,000 economists--2,000. On October 25, 1997, his 2,000 economists said that South Korea was an excellent country in superb financial shape, a banking system to really be emulated by the rest of the world, a governance of a country you couldn't improve upon. And before the ink dried on the report, the whole thing was in chaos. If he had had 3,000, he might have done better. 
We have said three things had to be done before they could get the money: 
They had to comply with international trade agreements that the countries have already signed. One thing. 
Two, ensure no crony capitalism; 
Three, ensure that foreign borrowers, i.e., U.S. borrowers, were not going to be discriminated against. 
How tough would it be for each country to comply with those rules before they get an IMF loan? Obviously, way too tough because we have now weakened the language. The new language says that G-7 countries will require a public commitment. Will somebody tell me what requiring a public commitment means? If 
it gets weaker than that, it couldn't run off the table. 
Anybody who votes for this amendment is voting for corporate welfare of the highest order; we are voting for international banking welfare of the highest order; we are saying to any lending institution anywhere in the world, `Lend anybody anything, 20 percent, 30 percent, whatever rate you can get, and the American taxpayer will bail you out.' That is simply what we are doing here. It is the ultimate in bad business, it is the ultimate in foolishness, but we are determined to do it. I intend to vote against it. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back my time.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this amendment would transfer $5 billion from the Exchange Stabilization Fund at the Treasury Department to the Department of Education. There would be a new account established, the Education Stabilization Fund. This fund would be used to offer low-interest, long-term loans to States for the purpose of building and modernizing elementary and secondary schools. 
The GAO has estimated that one-third of all schools, housing 14 million students, are in need of repair. In my home State of North Carolina, 36 percent of schools report they have at least one inadequate building, 90 percent of the schools report that they have construction needs up from $3.5 million to $10 million. We have a fast-growing student population, and many, many students are housed in trailers--literally hundreds of thousands are housed in trailers. 
The purpose of this amendment is very simple. We have a slush fund at the Treasury Department called the Exchange Stabilization Fund. This fund is under the personal control of the Secretary of the Treasury. He can do whatever he wants with it. I think this is totally wrong. What has the Secretary done with the fund? Over the last 4 years, he has used it to supplement international bailouts, which was never the original intent for the funds. He loaned Mexico $12 billion. He promised Indonesia--which the Senator from Washington was just talking about--$3 billion. He has promised South Korea $5 billion, and everything indicates that Korea is going to call for the money quickly. He has done all of this without any congressional approval or authorization. 
This fund has over $30 billion available in it. It seems to be only common sense that if we can lend to Indonesia $3 billion, $5 billion to Korea, $12 billion to Mexico, and who knows where in the future it will be going, without any advice or consent from the Congress, then we can provide loans for school construction. I don't see how we can do otherwise. 
The President had wanted $20 billion in new tax-free bonds. But with this amendment, we can start immediately with $5 billion in loans to schools. This would be loans, and it would have no budget impact. This is not an outlay; it's a revolving loan fund. 
I urge all my colleagues to support the amendment. Mr. President, if we can provide $18 billion for the IMF, we can provide $5 billion for our schools. 
I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment, with the time for the vote to be determined by the manager of the bill.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I come before you today to introduce legislation that should be of interest to all senior citizens in the U.S. 
Mr. President, I must share with you my shock and outrage when I learned of a recently proposed rule by the Clinton Administration that eliminates the requirement of a real anesthesiologist during surgery for Medicare and Medicaid patients. 
The legislation I am introducing today would stop the Administration from imposing such on rule on our nation's senior population. 
At a time when President Clinton is seeking to expand Medicare coverage for more Americans, why is he quietly moving to lessen the standard of care for our senior citizens? This Administration is proposing a change that will permit non-physicians to evaluate patient health and administer anesthesia to a population at the greatest risk for complications. 
Not long ago, the President stood before Congress and stated that `Medical decisions should be made by medical doctors' and that `every American deserves quality care.' I totally agree with the President on these important points. 
But it's not good enough to simply say this--actions have to speak louder than words. This is one of the reasons I am introducing this bill. 
Mr. President, our elderly are our most vulnerable population. We established Medicare because of the cost of health care for the elderly. But Medicare doesn't have to be second class care. I think it is sinful to lower the quality of care for our seniors. 
Furthermore, this Administration won't even allow seniors that want to pay for their own health costs to do so--without forcing the doctor out of Medicare. So our seniors have little choice, but to be treated under the guidelines of Medicare. 
Now I am 70 years old, but to other Senators this will involve their mothers and fathers. To the younger generation, this will involve the treatment of their grandparents. 
I have to ask, do you really want to send your mother or father, or grandparents in for a critical operation and have the anesthesia administered by a non-doctor? 
Does the same standard apply to senior government officials? I would assume the President had a doctor administer his anesthesia. When I asked HHS Secretary Shalala whether she would choose a nurse or doctor to administer the anesthesia, when pressed she said she would ask her doctor! 
Here we go again, one standard for Washington officials--another for everyone else. I think that is wrong. 
Mr. President, I want to make an important point. This is not about diminishing the important role that nurses play an important role in the health care system. They play a valuable, great role. But on this one issue, I feel that the practice of Anesthesiology is simply too important to the any medical procedure to be left to those that are not trained extensively in this field. Anesthesia is the most important part of any operation, particularly for the elderly. 
Nurse anesthetists are non-physician providers who normally complete a two or three-year training technique-oriented training program after nursing school. Anesthesiologists are physicians who, after taking a pre-med curriculum in college, complete four years of medical school and a four-year anesthesiology residency program. 
We value the need for greater education in society, and here we are ignoring the importance of extensive education. All the rhetoric in Washington these days is about the importance of education. But if the Administration has its way, further education in the field will be deemed worthless. 
Mr. President, for three decades, Medicare and Medicaid patients have benefitted from an attending anesthesiologist. To my knowledge, there is no clinical study that can provide justification for eliminating the physician supervision requirement. 81% of senior citizens oppose the President's rule. And you can count me in that group. 
It is my understanding that there is no difference in cost if this rule is implemented. The reimbursement is the same to the doctor or the nurse. Furthermore, the number of patient deaths involving anesthesia has dramatically declined since the 1950's because we have a greater number of anesthesiologists in practice. We have made great strides in this field. Why would it make sense to radically change the rules at a time when we are so successful? It just doesn't make any sense. 
Mr. President, the bottom line is that senior citizens don't want this rule, there is no difference in cost and there is no evidence that warrants such a change. I simply cannot stand by and watch the President put the lives of senior citizens all across this country in a potentially dangerous situation. Thank you, Mr. President. I urge all the members to support this legislation.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, thank you. I thank Senator Hutchison. 
Mr. President, I want to join the Senator from Texas in thanking the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for including a repeal of the marriage penalty tax in the budget resolution which was unveiled today. 
Mr. President, Senator Hutchison, Senator Connie Mack, and I have sponsored legislation to remove this unfair tax. It penalizes couples simply because they get married. Because of the hard work of Chairman Domenici and the Budget Committee, we are making progress in getting rid of this tax. The majority leader, Senator Lott, has also been tremendously supportive. Senator Hutchison, Senator Lott, and I recently pledged on Valentine's Day that we would work to have this tax burden removed by Valentine's Day next year. 
I think it is a reasonable goal and a step closer with today's budget resolution. What better use of money could we have, what better use than to give tax relief to a young couple getting married? The Congressional Budget Office has determined that 21 million married couples pay an average of $1,400 in extra income tax each year because they chose to get married. The Tax Code in its simplest form should encourage people to get married and not leave them with a heavy tax bill because they did get married. I look forward to working with Senator Hutchison, from Texas, on eliminating this tax. 
Mr. President, the Republican Congress needs to return to its core values. We need to reduce taxes and get on with the job of helping American families and especially young American families that are just starting out. The American families are working and saving to send their children to college. They are trying to save for their own retirement and, in many cases, to look after elderly parents. In spite of all this, today we have a higher tax burden on them than ever before. We are still taking 38 percent of a family's income. People have to work until May 7 of each year before they begin working for themselves. We need to reduce taxes. The Budget Committee has taken a step in the right direction by proposing $30 billion in tax cuts. As I repeat, what better way to spend the money? We need the marriage penalty relief and we need it before next year. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address the growing threats of viral epidemics and bioterrorism in our nation. I have serious concerns that one of our nation's first lines of defense, the CDC, may not have adequate resources to address these increasingly serious problems. 
Scientists meeting at the International Conference on Emerging Infectious Disease in Atlanta last week concluded we were only slightly better prepared today to handle a biologic attack than we were in 1991 at the start of Desert Storm, and we were totally ill-prepared then! While the U.S. military prepares to vaccinate our troops against anthrax, there is currently no national plan to protect civilians from this deadly virus. 
Ironically, the day after the International Infectious Disease conference, a business located in Phoenix was threatened with a bioterrorism attack involving an envelope supposedly soaked with the deadly anthrax virus, sending ten employees to the hospital. This comes on the heels of an earlier FBI arrest of two men in Las Vegas who claimed to have anthrax in their possession. 
This growing threat is real, and not limited to germs used in war. The first recorded case of bioterrorism occurred in 1984, when members of a religious cult in Oregon deliberately contaminated local salad bars with the salmonella bacteria, causing 751 cases of fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain. Their goal had been to incapacitate voters so they could sway a local election. 
More recently, we've seen many diseases we thought we'd conquered reappearing in more virulent forms. Since December, 26 Texans have died and hundreds fallen ill from an outbreak of an invasive Group A streptococcus bacteria. In Milwaukee, contaminated drinking water sickened 400,000 citizens and sent 4,000 to the hospital with over 50 deaths. 
Mr. President, I voiced my concern that the Centers for Disease Control does not have the resources necessary to fight these wars with Secretary Shalala at the Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee hearing last week, and have asked that the Subcommittee Chairman, my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter join me in holding a hearing on the agency's role and abilities to meet these growing threats. 
Let me take a few moments now to share my concern with my colleagues by asking a question: What do bioterrorism, natural and manmade disasters, contaminated food and water supplies, and epidemics have in common? The answer may come as a surprise--the lynchpin to combating any of these life-threatening situations are the 3,000 state, county and local health departments in this country, working in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control. 
Most people would be shocked to learn that the very network that is supposed to play a role in providing a first line of defense against these threats--the 3,000 health departments scattered across the United States--are in most cases not computer linked with the command center, CDC. Only 40 percent of our health departments are on-line today. The remainder need computer hardware, training and manpower to be able to connect. Local health departments also need laboratory capability to be able to test the agents suspected of causing a threat--presently these samples have to be shipped off-site to be tested, wasting valuable response time. 
The warning signs are there. Were this a military operation, with the enemy amassing on our borders, we would have no hesitation nor would we question the need for additional resources. We should do nothing less when lives are threatened by disease. CDC forms a triage with state and local health departments and other important governmental agencies to combat disease and biologic threats. 
While CDC has become well known world-wide as the `disease detectives,' the public and many of my colleagues are probably unaware of the work they perform with their law enforcement, military and intelligence agency colleagues in the biologic and chemical warfare arena. CDC's Epidemiologic Intelligence Service school produces highly trained epidemiologists from these agencies to deal with these deadly, newly emerging threats. Every state should have at least one graduate from the Epidemiologic Intelligence Service School--currently, less than half have someone with these skills. 
Additionally, CDC's National Center for Infectious Diseases, the Public Health Practice Program Office and the National Center for Environmental Health also play key roles in ensuring the preparedness of the public health response. 
The legislation I'm introducing today is simple. It asks that the Centers for Disease Control report to Congress within sixty days in regard to their resources and readiness to respond to the growing threats of viral epidemics, biologic and chemical threats. I intend to focus on this when we discuss this at a future hearing, and am looking forward to learning how we can improve our ability to address this growing threat. 
Unfortunately, our public health departments are operating under severe constraints with about one-third lacking even the most basic technology for communications or access to advanced training. One thing is certain, not one link in our public health defense can operate in a vacuum because disease knows no political or geographic boundaries. 
In the days ahead as we set our priorities for appropriations and budget, it is time, and past time, that we place a priority on investing in local public health department infrastructure. Otherwise, we may find that the cost of our neglect is more than any of us are willing to pay.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, yesterday, an American hero was honored by his grateful countrymen. Air Force Colonel Paul Underwood, formerly stationed at Seymour Johnson AFB in Goldsboro, North Carolina, was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery after having been shot down more than 30 years ago during his 22nd combat mission over Vietnam. 
He was first listed as `Missing In Action' for 12 years before being officially declared deceased. But, it was only recently that his remains were recovered and brought home for a military funeral with full honors. 
Col. Underwood answered the call of duty when our country was most in need, not just once, but three times. He served in World War II, the Korean Conflict, and finally in Vietnam. He went unquestioningly wherever he was needed. 
To the family and friends of Col. Underwood, I extend my deepest sympathy on this solemn occasion. Col. Underwood gave his life in the service of his country. His wife, Gloria, his children and grandchildren, and his dearest friends have all suffered the great loss that has followed Col. Underwood's selfless sacrifice in the defense of the freedom that all of us enjoy.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, on Friday, March 13, the Senate considered a resolution calling for an international criminal tribunal to indict and prosecute Saddam Hussein for his crimes against humanity. Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent for the vote due to the passing of a dear friend in North Carolina, but I would like the record to reflect that I would have strongly supported this resolution. 
I commend Senator Lott for his efforts to bring this resolution before the Senate. It is needed. Saddam Hussein is a remorseless murderer with absolutely no regard for the well-being of his people, the welfare of his nation, and the value of world peace. 
Seven years ago, Saddam Hussein recklessly sacrificed international stability with his invasion of Kuwait. Since then, he has continually threatened the security of the world's people. Time and again, he has demonstrated his willingness to build, store and possibly deploy chemical and biological weapons. His actions have led to two decades of suffering among his neighbors and his people, and for his crimes he should be tried and punished. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that diplomatic resolution was brought to our most recent clash with Iraq, and I hope that it will last. But, in the end, this fragile agreement is nothing more than a renewal of broken accords from the past. It is by no means unreasonable to believe that Saddam Hussein will again return to his lying ways. We must remain vigilant and prepare for that time.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act. Last year, this body was instrumental in providing key incentives for students who want to go to school to improve their lives and build job skills. The Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credits, as adopted in the Taxpayer Relief Act, give financial assistance to young and old who want to attend a community college, university or trade school. 
Unfortunately, the legislation also contained a provision requiring these institutions to comply with burdensome reporting procedures such as issuing annual reports to students and the Internal Revenue Service. Preliminary analysis shows the reporting requirements will cost the 6,000 institutions of higher learning in America more than $125 million combined to implement and tens of millions of dollars annually to maintain. 
The Higher Education Reporting Relief Act would repeal the Taxpayer Relief Act requirements that higher education institutions collect and report information on all eligible students to the Internal Revenue Service. In lieu of these extensive reporting requirements, taxpayers would be allowed to claim the tax credits on their income tax forms, similar to the way other tax deductions are now reported. 
Let's not let this tremendous accomplishment for education be overshadowed by burdensome paperwork. Please join Senators Collins, DeWine, and me in supporting the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, it is a distinct pleasure for me this morning to introduce our guest Chaplain and to say a few words about him, a fellow North Carolinian and really the State's most distinguished minister, Dr. David Burr. 
It is also an honor to welcome his son and my colleague, Congressman Richard Burr, who has also become a leader in the Congress of this country. He serves the fifth district of North Carolina, which is pretty much centered on Winston-Salem. We welcome Congressman Burr and his family. 
Dr. Burr was educated at the University of Wisconsin and Princeton Theological Seminary. He received a Doctor of Divinity from Davidson College. In 1963, Dr. Burr came to Winston-Salem, NC, where he began and continued a long career serving the people of Forsyth County, and I mean all the people of Forsyth County, not just those limited to his First Presbyterian Church. He was pastor of the First Presbyterian Church in Winston-Salem for over 25 years, but his ministry went far beyond the church in which he was the assigned minister. He 
was literally Forsyth County's minister. 
He is widely respected in North Carolina, and it is a distinct honor for me to welcome him to the Senate and it is an honor for all of us to have him here. Dr. Burr, we thank you for all you have meant to North Carolina. Thank you.  
Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to today introduce the `American Priorities Act.' 
First, and most importantly, this bill corrects a serious imbalance in our national priorities by transferring one-third of the enforcement agents at the Internal Revenue Service to the Drug Enforcement Agency, by January 1, 1999. 
Second, and by the same time, the bill establishes a cabinet level department to marshall the resources necessary to adequately fight a real war on drugs. By so doing we would affirm our resolve to the American people and those abroad that this is a war we intend to win. 
Over the last 5 years, drug use, which slowed in the later 1980's and early 1990's, has increased with a vengeance. Particularly hard-hit have been our children. Schools are not safe; children are born addicted to crack and other hard drugs which are now cheap and plentiful in most of our nation; and drug-related violent crime is soaring. 
Most troubling of all has been the creation of a class of violent, drug-addicted youth predators who terrorize our citizens with almost irrational and depraved violent crimes, from carjackings in shopping malls, to drive-by shooting on city streets, to gang-related violence in schools. 
Yet what is the Administration's reaction? It claims that the so-called `war on drugs' cannot be easily won, that it will take 10 or more years to even begin to control the drug trade. 
Such a piecemeal application of resources is not a recipe for victory. We need a bold and dramatic shift in federal resources to end the drug scourge once and for all. If this is to be a true war on drugs, then we need a Desert Storm, not a Vietnam. 
The IRS has over 100,000 employees, 46,000 of whom are enforcement officials. Recent Congressional oversight has revealed that the agency has excess enforcement resources, which are not serving the public interest. 
Instead, these excess resources are often engaged in the bullying of law-abiding Americans. And it's no wonder. With over 100,000 employees, 46,000 of which are enforcement agents, the IRS is running out of legitimate things to do. 
By contrast, the DEA, which is at the forefront of stemming the drug trade, has only 8,500 personnel, half of whom are special agents. If the war on drugs is to be won, we need to radically reallocate our national resources, and I would suggest that moving 1/3 of the IRS enforcement agents to the DEA is a good first step. 
Further, as a member of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, I plan to offer a version of this bill as a rider to this year's budget. 
Mr. President, it is high time that the federal government started investing drug dealers as intensely as the IRS investigates American taxpayers.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to create a national commission of nonlawyers--nonlawyers, to study legal reform. Nonlawyers, just regular people with a 2-year mandate to offer common sense proposals to reform the legal system. While I stand here, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America are holding their winter convention. It is not a week of hard work on behalf of the American people. No, they are at the Grand Wailea Resort & Spa, in Maui, HI. They are spending a week in the sun learning how to sue more people for more things. They are learning how to throw more American workers out of a job. They are learning how to take a 40 percent share of more lawsuits against small businesses. They are learning how to run the cost of doing business through the roof. 
I have not been to this resort but I am sure that it is not a bare-bones rooming house. First-class flights to a five-star resort--that's what you get, and can afford, when you sue people for a living and take 40 percent of it. 
Let me say a few words about my legal reform commission. This will not be a typical Washington commission; it will be made up entirely of nonlawyers. The legal system is overrun with abuses and we need fundamental reform. I want to see what a panel of average Americans who are not lawyers trained to split legal hairs, but think in common sense, will do with legal reform. We have heard all the stories about the $2.8 million award against the lady who spilled the McDonald's coffee. We have heard about a $4 million verdict because a BMW automobile was repainted. These are well known because they are outrageous. The coffee verdict was cut to $480,000 and the BMW verdict was reduced to $50,000. But the fact that millions of dollars were awarded and hundreds of thousands of dollars upheld in these outrageous cases simply highlights the problem. 
Let me mention a few cases that did not get the same attention. A Pennsylvania man was fixing his barn roof and tried to get an extra lift by putting his ladder on top of a pile of frozen manure. When the manure thawed, the man fell and he sued the ladder manufacturer. 
Why? Because the ladder company did not warn him that manure would not withstand the weight of a ladder. Crazy? Sure, but a jury found the ladder maker negligent and awarded the man $330,000. This is the out-of-control, ridiculous problem that we are facing. 
A teenager in New Hampshire tried to slam dunk--I think that is where you push the ball through the hoop--a basketball. He lost two teeth when he hit the net. He sued the net manufacturer. The company was forced to settle the case for $50,000 because they were afraid of a tort system run out of control. 
These are the types of things that we simply have to stop. With these kinds of lawsuits and 40 percent of it, you can afford to be in Hawaii. 
A lumberjack was killed when a 4,000-pound redwood tree fell on him. It was a tragedy, of course, but was it a lawsuit? His family sued the hard-hat maker. The trial lawyer argued that the hard hat was defective because it could not prevent damage from a 4,000-pound falling redwood tree. 
Can you imagine how thick a hat would have to be to stand up under a 4,000-pound falling redwood tree? You couldn't put it on your head. You couldn't stand up with it on. But the company wound up paying $650,000 in a ludicrous suit. A hard hat was never intended to protect you from a falling redwood tree. More of the same type of thing. 
I assume some of the people who are vacationing in Hawaii received 40 percent of the $650,000.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I believe we need campaign finance reform, but the McCain-Feingold amendment is not the right approach at this time. I will say that I am disappointed that many of the people advocating reform are defending people who couldn't live under the laws we already have. Perhaps the best reform that we can make immediately would be for candidates to live within the laws we have now. Clearly this Administration did not do this in 1996. 
I am disturbed by two provisions. First, the naked attempt to muzzle the free speech of citizens who want to advocate on behalf of a candidate. This `reform' would limit the free speech of all American citizens. I hardly see that as being `reform.' We put too many limits on our citizens now, we cannot restrict their right to participate in the political process. 
Second, this bill does nothing to stop the loophole that unions have exploited for years to advocate their political positions. It does nothing to stop the practice of labor unions taking the dues from hard working citizens and spending millions of dollars on ads to defeat candidates. Why is it that the people who advocate reform will not permit union members to keep their well-earned money and spend it as they wish? Why do they oppose a separate, voluntary means for using the dues of union members? Regrettably, the answer is that the so-called reform advocates want to keep the liberal ads coming in waves, and cut off the political speech of others. I cannot support that under any circumstances. 
And what happens when we make reforms? Look at the results of the 1974 law. The reforms limited personal contributions from individuals, yet it spawned PAC's and soft money. On public financing, the taxpayers were to pay for the campaigns of those running for President--so that they would be beyond reproach. Yet by 1996, the President and the Vice President spent untold hours raising soft money by the millions. From appearing at Buddhist Temples to renting out the Lincoln Bedroom, to making phone calls from the Oval Office, the 1974 reforms became a mockery at the hands of this Administration. For them to be calling for campaign finance reform is like a horse thief galloping down the street warning citizens to lock their barns. It simply doesn't pass the straight face test. 
III conceived, reforms can make the system worse and that is why I cannot support McCain-Feingold. If we want real reforms, we will do the following: limit soft money; equalize PAC and individual contribution at $2500; speed disclosure to the public; tighten the ban on contributions by non-citizens; and, stop the abuses by unions taking dues for political purposes. Finally, we should pass the ultimate reform: term limits. 
These kinds of reforms would improve the system, empower the individual, stop some of the most flagrant abuses taking place now and expand more opportunities for citizen legislators to serve. This is the kind of approach we need.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to speak on reauthorization of the highway bill. I respectfully urge the Majority Leader to take up Senate Bill 1173--ISTEA--now. Let's not delay its consideration into the spring. 
The State's highway programs are already operating under a temporary funding extension. I believe that further delaying consideration of S. 1173 will add more uncertainty to the States' highway construction. 
As I mentioned, before this body adjourned last November, we passed a temporary extension of the highway bill, after repeated attempts to begin debate on the bill failed. 
It now appears that floor consideration of S. 1173 may be delayed until after the Senate considers the Fiscal Year 1999 Budget Resolution. 
I am second to no Member in my commitment to a balanced federal budget. However, I believe that we must also follow through on our commitment to quality infrastructure, and these two objectives are by no means mutually exclusive. 
The current funding extension expires on March 31. That means that all federal highway funds will be cut off on May 1. Clearly, prompt action on ISTEA is critical to maintaining the flow of federal highway dollars. 
Unlike delays last fall, however, these spring delays for ISTEA will occur in the middle of construction season. This will compound the disruptive effects of this halt on highway projects--and the jobs they support--around the country. 
In the northern States, it is critical that construction funding flows at this time of year. The window for road construction work in many areas is limited by weather factors during the winter months. 
Many states, including my own, have highway construction projects underway that are designed to reduce traffic congestion. This congestion worsens air quality, causes `road rage,' increases wear and tear on vehicles, wastes fuel, and robs American businesses and families of valuable time. 
Cutting off crucial federal funds for these projects undermines State efforts to deal with their congestion problems. 
It is very unfortunate that highway fatalities continue to rise. By Federal Highway Administration estimates, poor road maintenance may contribute to as many as 30 percent of fatal accidents, resulting in thousands of deaths per year. Safety-related highway work faces stoppage if we delay consideration of ISTEA. 
In fact, in North Carolina, 300 million dollars in safety projects may be delayed if federal funds are not approved. 
I want to emphasize that these funds come from gas taxes collected every time Americans pull up to the pump. This `user fee' arrangement is supposed to ensure that these taxes pay for improving their highways. 
Mr. President, 31 1/2 billion dollars in gas taxes are collected each year, of which about 20 billion dollars actually goes towards highways. Even as we delay consideration of S. 1173, Americans pay their gas taxes in the belief that much-needed highway improvements will be funded. 
Looking at the legislative calendar between now and May 1, when federal highway funds will dry up, there are 41 legislative days including Mondays and Fridays. 
Even after we debate and pass a bill in the Senate, we have a conference report to complete. 
Other issues are sure to be considered here, including potential military conflict with Iraq, IRS restructuring, campaign finance reform, and the budget resolution. That will take us well into April at best. 
If we do not act on S. 1173 now, a lapse in federal highway funding is a virtual certainty. The presence of other important matters on the calendar only increases the importance of bringing up the Highway bill. 
This is our obligation. It is our obligation to the millions of motorists who pay gas taxes, and the contractors, subcontractors and employees working on highway projects.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about attorney fees and the proposed Senate bill, S. 1570. The Public Health Funds Preservation Act, which is better known as the Tobacco Settlement Act, limits attorney's fees, and only if there is a tobacco settlement. It limits their fees, the bill that I have introduced, to $125 per hour plus court-approved expenses. This is not something that we came upon. This is the same rate that Congress set for lawyer fees in suits filed against the Federal Government. So this is an accepted and nationally known attorney fee, $125 an hour. 
For trial lawyers, this debate is not about public health, it is about private greed. It is about creating instant billionaires. It is about using the public funds to create instant billionaire trial lawyers. It's a huge pot of money, billions of dollars, and it is wanted to fund frivolous lawsuits far into the 21st century. As long as you pay lawyers, you will have lawsuits. At the rate these are being paid, we will have lawsuits into infinity. 
Let me mention a few cases that reveal the real motive of the trial lawyers. This is a typical example of how this group works. The trial lawyers negotiated a $349 million settlement with the tobacco companies in the so-called `flight attendants case.' 
These were flight attendants who said they had been affected by secondary smoke. They won the $349 million: $300 million went to a new research foundation, and the lawyers took $49 million. Not one dime did a single flight attendant get because of the lawyers in the suit--not a dime. The entire amount went to lawyers and the research foundation. It is clear what happened--lawyers, $49 million; clients, $0, and that is the way the score usually turns out. 
The litigation machine grinds on and on, long after settlements. More lawsuits, more billable hours and more attorney's fees. It goes on into infinity. 
The flight attendants' own lawyers sold them out for a quick buck--$49 million to be exact. 
This is not an isolated case. The Texas Attorney General agreed to pay lawyers close to $2.2 billion, 15 percent of the settlement that Texas was able to negotiate with the tobacco companies--$2.2 billion to the lawyers. 
The lawyers involved in the settlement of the Florida suit claimed $2.8 billion, 25 percent of the entire settlement. The settlement was $11.3 billion, the lawyers want $2.8 billion. 
The judge in the Florida case said that their demands were `unconscionable.' Certainly they are. They are unreasonable. But that didn't stop the trial lawyers. They were not going to let a judge stand between them and $2.8 billion. They could see the red meat. That didn't stop the trial lawyers. They filed a lien to prevent the State from collecting its first $750 million payment until they were paid. If they couldn't get the big money for themselves, neither did they want the children of the State of Florida to have it. 
One Mississippi lawyer is busy lining up a $1.39 billion payment. He admits that he spent at most $10 million on the case. This lawyer says that the fee might seem a little obscene. These fees have simply gotten out of control. 
Mr. President, this is a pillaging spree and nothing more. These trial lawyers rival Genghis Khan or any other raider that ever went after a pile of money. 
The trial lawyers are intent on plundering. They are now stealing from the public health trust. That is exactly what they are doing if this Tobacco Settlement Act comes about. They are simply stealing from the trust that we will be putting up for the public health and for the children. After all, some of them have already filed liens to prevent the public health payments until they have been paid. 
Mr. President, I say it is time to stop. This bill will do that. The tobacco settlement is a settlement to ensure medical care and future help of people who might have been affected by tobacco. It is not a lottery for trial lawyers. My bill makes sure the focus stays on children and not on lawyers. The trial lawyers want to play `Wheel of Fortune' with our money. Well, I say, no, it is not their money. Let's stop the scrambling for dollars and the greed. Public health versus private greed--let's get on with the public health part of it and put some restraints on the private greed. That is where we should draw the line. 
Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.  
Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, President Clinton's nomination for the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, Judge Ann Aiken, came before this body this afternoon. Mr. President, I was unavoidably absent for the vote, but I would like the record to reflect that I would have voted `no.' 
I commend my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Mike Enzi, for closely scrutinizing this nomination and reporting to us some alarming rulings on the part of Judge Aiken which illustrate flaws in her judicial philosophy. For example, as Senator Enzi has noted, Judge Aiken, while a Oregon state court judge, sentenced a 26-year-old man convicted of the first degree rape of a 5-year-old girl to a mere ninety days in jail. Ninety days? A petty thief gets more than ninety days. This man raped a little girl. According to local papers, Judge Aiken justified her minimal sentence by citing a lack of treatment programs for sex offenders in Oregon's state prisons. 
Mr. President, this case, along with a history of similar rulings, reveals a grave misunderstanding in Judge Aiken's judicial outlook and a proclivity to side with criminals. Once again, the President has offered this body a judicial nominee more interested in defending the rights of criminals than protecting those of victims. How much longer will he continue to nominate Federal judges who ignore the safety and well-being of our communities?

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing S. 1555, the `Internal Revenue Service Oversight, Restructuring and Tax Code Elimination Act of 1997.' This legislation establishes an oversight board composed of private citizens to review the policies and practices of our nation's tax collection agency. The measure also eliminates the existing tax code by December 31, 2000, and eliminates the Internal Revenue Service by the end of the Year 2000 fiscal year. 
Mr. President, the American people have been telling this Congress that all is not right at the Internal Revenue Service, and it is time for the Congress to do something about it. Of course, no one enjoys paying their taxes, but the American people voluntarily comply with the tax code to a degree that is the envy of governments around the world. They do so because they want to do what is right. They deserve to be treated fairly, and they deserve a tax system that supports working families, not one that punishes them. 
This past September, the Senate Committee on Finance held hearings in which taxpayers described the many abuses they have suffered at the hands of the Internal Revenue Service. The general theme of those hearings was an agency which has become arrogant and unresponsive to the American people, ruining businesses and causing considerable suffering to the men and women who were unlucky enough to be the focus of IRS scrutiny. For most Americans, those hearings were an all too familiar reflection of a painful episode in their own lives. 
Mr. President, something must be done about the Internal Revenue Service and the massive Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Our tax code is incomprehensible to all but a few tax attorneys who make their living off of the current chaos created by our tax laws. What is worse, the agency charged with enforcing our tax laws has developed procedures to target their auditing efforts at middle class taxpayers. 
The time has come to get rid of the I.R.S., get rid of our nightmarish tax code, and create an oversight board composed entirely of citizens from outside of the I.R.S. to keep watch over that agency until the date when it ceases to exist. 
To carry out those objectives, I have introduced S. 1555, the Internal Revenue Service Oversight, Restructuring and Tax Code Elimination Act of 1997. This legislation establishes an oversight board composed of nine members, each of whom are from the private sector, and at least one of whom must be an owner or manager of a small business. This oversight board will be responsible for reviewing the policies and practices of the Internal Revenue Service. 
Among the specific areas the board will oversee are the agency's auditing procedures and collections practices, as well as the agency's procurement policies for information technology. Procurement at the I.R.S. has resulted in outrageous waste and misuse of taxpayer funds, such as the decision to spend nearly $4 billion to develop a new computer system, which officials now concede has been a complete failure. 
Creating an oversight board to rein in the IRS is just the first step. S. 1555 also calls for the tax code to be terminated as of December 31, 2000, with exceptions for 
Social Security and Railroad Retirement. 
My bill sets out several guidelines for the structure of a new tax code. The new code should apply a low rate to all Americans; require a supermajority of both Houses of Congress to raise taxes; provide tax relief for working Americans; protect the rights of taxpayers and reduce tax collection abuses; eliminate the bias against savings and investment; promote economic growth and job creation; encourage rather than penalize marriage and families; protect the integrity of Social Security and Medicare; and provide for a taxpayer-friendly collections process to replace the Internal Revenue Service. 
Mr. President, it is time to get rid of the I.R.S. and the massive and incomprehensible tax code in favor of a fairer, simpler system. I firmly believe that we will never be rid of our tax code until Congress sets out a specific deadline for its elimination. That is what my bill does. We should begin the national debate now over the form a new tax code should take. I have laid out a series of guidelines in this legislation for the new tax code. Without the current tax code, there is no need for the I.R.S., and it is my view that this agency is too entrenched in its bureaucratic ways to be reformed. It should simply be eliminated. Until the I.R.S. is gone, an oversight board is badly needed to protect the interests of the taxpayers, and act as a watchdog over this unaccountable agency. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. 
Mr. President, several times during this session, the Securities Subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee has held hearings on the issue of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) accounting standards for derivatives and other instruments. 
The hearings have demonstrated that there is great concern in the banking industry, and virtually every industry, about the FASB standards as they are presently written. 
In particular, there are concerns that the FASB will finalize these standards by the end of this year, without re-exposing its draft for further public comment. FASB has received hundreds of comment letters expressing concern about the new standards. Yet, the comments appear to go unheeded. In particular, there is concern in the banking industry that the standards are not taking into account the unique nature of banks. Even Alan Greenspan has taken the unusual step of expressing his concern to the FASB. 
The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors said in his letter that `FASB's planned approach would not improve the financial reporting of derivatives activities and would constrain prudent risk management practices.' 
Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of Generally Accepted Accounting Princples. I strongly believe that these standards should be set by the private sector. I am concerned, however, that the FASB, a private organization, is working too closely with the SEC, and therefore, is ignoring the concerns raised by bank regulators. In effect, this is not so much a dispute of a private body defying the wishes of an industry--but it is a dispute between two parts of our Government over how best to proceed on accounting for risk on the balance sheet. The FASB appears to be ignoring the concerns of the bank regulators, and by doing so, needlessly complicating disclosure to investors. Investors and analysts right now are fully capable of reviewing the balance sheets of depository institutions and determining who is well run and who is not. 
The Securities Subcommittee issued a report this year in which it stated that `by focusing on derivatives risk exposure in isolation from the risk faced by companies, (the FASB proposals) are prone to present investors a distorted and misleading picture of company conditions and activities.' 
In my view, the new standards will throw a wrench into the present accounting rules that will only serve to confuse investors. It is highly ironic that financial institutions, the principal users of accounting information in order to make credit decisions, find the new standards confusing and cumbersome. 
For this reason I feel compelled to introduce legislation that would provide the banking regulatory agencies with the authority to reject the standards if they find that the new standards will not accurately reflect assets, liabilities and earnings. Further, the regulators could refuse to adopt the standards if the new rules would serve to diminish the use of the risk management techniques, thus, actually reducing safety and soundness in the operation of an insured depository institution. 
I think this is an appropriate solution to this problem. I have great faith that the banking regulators, the primary users of financial information from banks, can make the best determination if these standards are appropriate. Thank you Mr. President.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Department of Veterans Affairs Employment Discrimination Act. This legislation offers an effective and expeditious method for filing and processing sexual harassment and employment discrimination claims within the Department. 
Over a year ago, the problem of sexual harassment with Veterans Affairs Department was brought to my attention by a case of widespread abuse at the VA Medical Center in Fayetteville, NC. Regrettably, this situation involved the director of the facility who was also the man responsible for handling complaints filed against him. Not surprisingly, claims of sexual harassment made against the director went nowhere, and he continued his reprehensible behavior without fear of being caught. 
The legislation I introduced with my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, and my colleague from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, is a constructive measure that would prevent such a blatant abuse of authority from occurring again. This bill will create the Office of Employment Discrimination Complaint Adjudication [OEDCA] with a director who would report only to the Secretary or Deputy Secretary of VA. Centralizing authority within the OEDCA will restore a large amount of accountability to currently flawed system. 
Mr. President, it is imperative that Congress provide the thousands of employees of the Veterans Affairs Department with a system they can rely upon to judiciously resolve employment discrimination claims. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation to prevent an incident such as the one that occurred in my State from happening again.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as the 105th Congress draws to a close, we are finally, at last, about to complete action on the District of Columbia appropriations bill. The amendment before the Senate incorporates the conference report to the Commerce, Justice, State spending bill and the Foreign Operations spending bill, together with an amendment in the nature of a substitute to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. 
I would like to speak very briefly to the provisions of the District of Columbia portion of this omnibus package. First of all, the ranking member of the District of Columbia subcommittee, Barbara Boxer, and I have ironed out all of our differences and we now have the bill that should have the support of the House and the administration. 
At the moment, the District of Columbia is being funded on a temporary basis through a continuing resolution. It is critical that we pass this amendment as soon as possible because the Congress has yet to pass a District of Columbia rescue package and the management reform plan, which we enacted in August. Passage of this bill will ensure that that work goes forward to restructure the city's finances and impose some much-needed management reforms on the city and its various agencies. 
The amendment being offered in the nature of a substitute to the District of Columbia appropriations bill will provide funding of $8 million for management reforms, and these reforms are already under way. But without passage of this bill, the reform program will simply fall apart. 
Mr. President, this amendment is very similar to the District of Columbia appropriations bill that has been pending before the Senate for several weeks. This amendment reflects the work of the Congress, city officials, and the financial control board to bring about a balanced District budget. This budget is balanced 1 year ahead of the schedule set by the Congress in 1995 when it created the financial control board to rescue the city from insolvency and incompetence. 
To reach consensus on how to balance the budget, the control board and the elected city council first rejected several of the proposed budgets. This budget is a more conservative approach. This amendment actually cuts most city agencies, with a few exceptions, such as public safety. The focus of this bill is to balance the budget and reform the city's management problems. 
It is a good bill and I urge its support by my colleagues. I want to especially thank the ranking member, Senator Barbara Boxer, and Kay Bailey Hutchison for their hard work on the Appropriations Committee. I want to thank the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, for their help and guidance in the past several months. I also wish to take a moment to thank Mary Beth Nethercutt, Jim Hyland, Dave Landers, of my staff, Jay Kimmit, and the rest of the minority staff for their help on this bill. 
Mr. President, I yield the balance of my time.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleagues on the Banking Committee for their tireless efforts to craft this piece of legislation so that the final bill can enjoy such broad bipartisan support. The Banking Committee has passed positive legislation to protect consumers and give them new rights for canceling private mortgage insurance. 
Private mortgage insurance has been a great tool to increase homeownership. But there have been too many cases where people had trouble canceling the insurance long after it was needed. This bill gives consumers the opportunity to cancel their private mortgage insurance at 20-percent equity and requires automatic cancellation at 22-percent equity. S. 318 requires that homebuyers be informed about their right to cancel private mortgage insurance. It creates a national standard for cancellation that is clear and simple for consumers to understand. I believe it is a winner for all kinds of consumers. 
When S. 318 was first introduced about 9 months ago many on the committee could not support it. It created unnecessary government mandates and controls on the entire mortgage industry by setting a bright line rule for cancellation. As a result, S. 318 as introduced, would have increased the cost of obtaining a low downpayment mortgage and would have put homeownership out of the reach for many families. 
The version that was reported out of the committee, by a 16-to-1 vote on October 23, still provides consumers with important rights, but eliminates the Federal Government's role in the marketplace so that industry can continue to create innovative products for future homebuyers. Further, the bill provides meaningful limitations on class action lawsuits without stripping consumers of their enforcement mechanisms in the bill. 
I believe that S. 318, as written today, is a good bill for consumers everywhere. Mortgage insurance is a valuable financial tool that allows people to get into homes years sooner than they would otherwise. But I do not want anyone to pay for it longer than it is needed. This bill gives consumers that protection.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, last week, the Treasury Department announced that it planned to use $3 billion from the exchange stabilization fund for a bailout of Indonesia. This fund was established in the 1930's to protect the U.S. dollar. It was not designed to be the personal piggy bank of the Secretary of the Treasury to bail out other countries whenever he desires. 
The legislation I am introducing would require that, when this fund is used to be part of an international bailout in excess of $250 million, such use would require congressional approval. 
Using this fund for Indonesia is the same procedure that was used to bypass the Congress for the bailout of Mexico. At the time we were told that the emergency bailout of Mexico was needed because they were our neighbor, friend, and that economic instability would spill thousands of immigrants into the United States. 
I find no such rationale for Indonesia. In fact, what is occurring is that we are seeing a tidal wave of bailouts coming our way from Asia. 
Apparently, the need for the bailouts is greater than the resources of the IMF. This is the reason the United States has had to resort to taking money from our own reserves to bail out Indonesia. 
In fact, the tidal wave has already started. The Philippines in July for $1 billion. Thailand for $16 billion in September. Now comes Indonesia for $23 billion in November. The price tag keeps getting bigger and we don't know where it is going to stop. The Treasury Secretary tried to keep us out of the first two bailouts--but the price tag is getting too big--now direct United States dollars are being called upon for the Asian bailouts. 
This week Business Week is suggesting the price tag is as high as $100 billion. Who is next? South Korea, Malaysia? Perhaps China and Japan--whose banks are holding billions in bad loans? 
What is really outrageous about this situation is that these are the very same countries that we have been running massive trade deficits for years. 
With Thailand we have a $4.6 billion trade deficit. Indonesia a $4 billion deficit. Philippines a $2 billion deficit. South Korea a $1 billion trade deficit--and China and Japan are off the charts. 
These are the same countries that have kept out U.S. imports with phony trade rules and insider deals. These are the same countries that have closed banking systems. 
Indonesia, in particular, was so flush with cash apparently, that they could afford to funnel millions in campaign contributions to influence U.S. elections--and here we are, the United States, bailing them out. Is it any wonder that the average American worker has no faith that the Federal Government in Washington cares about him or her. 
We have got people living paycheck to paycheck in this country. We don't need to bail out foreign ministers, foreign banks and securities firms, and rich Wall Street bankers that lent too much money to developing nations. 
The average American has to tell half his life story just to get a mortgage loan--and yet Wall Street is loaning billions to these Asian countries on the nod of some foreign finance minister. 
Now the bill for the bailout is being handed to the U.S. taxpayer. I find it deplorable. The auto plant worker, the secretary, the small town banker--all are being asked to turn over their tax dollars so we can ship them to Asia. 
I think President Clinton and Robert Rubin need to realize that Wall Street and Indonesia did not elect them--the people of the United States did, and that is who they own their loyalties to. They need to remember that. 
Mr. President, I can promise you that in the next session of Congress--this will not continue. I plan to subject every foreign bailout dollar to congressional approval. This legislation is the first step in that process.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of legislation being introduced by Senator Helms--the two Senators from Ohio--that would establish a National Commission to oversee the 100th anniversary of the first flight. 
Mr. President, on a cold, windy December morning in 1903, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, the Wright brothers changed the history of the world. Orville Wright flew for just 12 seconds--but it was the first manned flight. 
Today, many people take for granted what was accomplished by the Wright brothers that day, but at the time it was a historic achievement. Man had been thinking of flight for thousand of years--and yet the Wright brothers, here in the United States, were the first to do it. 
The development of flight grew rapidly. A little over a decade later, airplanes were used in the battles of World War I. Two decades after the 12-second first flight--Charles Lindbergh flew over the Atlantic. 
And of course, in 1962, in just a half century after the first 12-second flight, our distinguished colleague John Glenn was the first man to fly around the world in space. Seven years after that, we landed a man on the Moon. 
It is hard to believe that all of this has taken place in the span of less than 100 years. 
This is why the centennial anniversary of first flight is so significant to us, the sponsors of this legislation. 
The Commission will coordinate the plans for the celebration. The Wright brothers were from Ohio, of course, where they ran a bicycle shop. The State of North Carolina's license plates bear the slogan `First in Flight'--so we are especially proud of this achievement in my State. To these two States, the celebration is important. 
But much more than that, I think the anniversary should be used to inspire students to learn more about the history of flight. Hopefully, it will remind people that this is a great nation inventors--and that American ingenuity has made us the greatest country in the history of the world. Finally, it should remind our citizens that America is a land of opportunity and freedom--where anyone's imagination can change the world. This is an entrepreneurial spirit that we must keep alive. 
I want to thank Senator Helms and Senators Glenn and DeWine for joining together today to introduce this legislation. I hope that the Senate will take it up soon.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I would like to clarify the intent of the Commerce Committee's ISTEA transportation safety amendment as it relates to State one-call--call-before-you-dig--programs.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I have received a number of calls and letters from North Carolina contractors concerned about this bill and its inclusion in ISTEA. As the leader knows, these companies are overwhelmingly small businesses, and they provide a large number of jobs for people in our States. However, when they think of the Federal Government and its regulators, they think of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Their experience with OSHA has not been good. The contractors are definitely not interested in seeing a toehold established for further regulation of this type under the guise of one-call notification. Can the leader tell me that the provisions we are talking about here will not be converted into a Federal regulatory program effecting small business?

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank leader for that assurance. 
Among the minimum standards required for a one-call notification program to be eligible for Federal assistance is the requirement for `appropriate participation' by all excavators and underground facility operators. `Appropriate participation' would be determined based on the `risks to public safety, the environment, excavators and vital public services.' 
Contractors who visited my office see this as a loophole that could actually weaken State programs. The contractors are very concerned that the Federal Government would declare some situations to be low risk, and this would in turn encourage facility operators to seek exemptions from one-call requirements because their participation would be deemed no longer `appropriate'.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, in the past few years, I have been shocked by the number of crimes I have read about that are connected to the Internet. 
This was a problem that did not even exist just a few years ago, but now it has become very prevalent. 
What is happening is that sex offenders and pedophiles are using the Internet to recruit children. 
I think I have a solution that can help this situation. 
Today, I am introducing legislation that would prevent a convicted sex offender from having an Internet account. Under my bill, the on-line service provider would be barred from providing an account to anyone who is a sexually violent predator or who has registered under Megan's law. 
I do not think this would be difficult to enforce, because convicted sex offenders are already on a data base. 
A background check on that data base could keep them offline. 
Mr. President, we all know that proper parental supervision is the best defense against this type of crime, but I am finding that some parents aren't as computer literate as their children and it is almost impossible to watch children every minute of every day. 
In my view, it is time to pull the plug on sex offenders and take them offline. 
Mr. President, as I said, this problem has been growing year by year. It has grown to the point where the FBI has set up a special task force to track down computer sex offenders. 
In 1993, the FBI formed a task force known as Innocent Images. 
It was created after a 10-year-old boy was declared missing in Maryland. Unfortunately, he has never been found. But the FBI did come across two neighbors who have an elaborate computer network--where they were recruiting young victims over the Internet. The key suspect is in jail, but has never told the police anything about the disappearance. 
This is what one agent said about the program: 
Generally we would come across people trying to trade (illicit pictures) within five to ten minutes . . . It was like coming across a person at every street corner trying to sell you crack. 
Just 2 weeks ago, the Washington Post reported on a man that had contacted over 100 underage girls via a computer. He was arrested and received 2 years in jail. I have no doubt, he will be back on the Internet when he gets out of jail. My bill is designed to stop him again. 
The task force has conducted over 330 searches that have resulted in 200 indictments and 150 convictions. Another 135 have been arrested. 
If we do not stop sex offenders on the Internet, I believe the number of crimes will grow. 
Tragically, just a few weeks ago, an 11-year-old boy was murdered in New Jersey by a teenager who himself had been molested by a man he met on the Internet. The man was a twice convicted sex offender. 
We have got to stop this activity and stop it now. 
Mr. President, there will be critics who call this unconstitutional. They can certainly tie themselves up in knots about the legalities, but my main concern is for the safety of our children. 
I think we have ample precedent for doing something like this. First, we have Megan's Law that requires registration of sex offenders. Second, the Supreme Court, in Kansas versus Hendricks, upheld a State statute that kept a sexual predator committed in a State mental institution, after his criminal sentence had run. I think it is clear that for sexual predators--they do not enjoy the rights that all of us enjoy. There is a difference. 
More simply put, is this any different than denying a felon the right to own a gun. Is it different than barring a habitual drunk driver from having a driver's license? 
The Internet is the new weapon of the sexual predator. It is their key to invading our homes. 
We have to send a clear message that the Internet will not become the favored tool of the pedophile. Instead of roaming the streets, the sex offenders of the 1990's are roaming chat rooms and the Internet looking for victims. 
This legislation will put a stop to that. 
I hope that we can have hearings on this bill and that we can consider it next session.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, on October 28 the President of the People's Republic of China will begin an official state visit to this country. Jiang Zemin is coming. It is reported, as a gift to him, the Clinton administration will applaud China's policy on weapons proliferation. 
As a reward for China's responsible behavior, President Clinton and Vice President Gore plan to willingly, without reservation, share our most sensitive nuclear technology with China. 
There is something very suspicious about this drastic shift in U.S. foreign policy. I cannot understand why the administration would negotiate this kind of deal? 
Hasn't the CIA told us that China serves as the weapons clearinghouse of the world? Why in the world would President Clinton seek to abandon a longstanding Federal law that has prohibited American corporations from selling nuclear technology to Communist China. 
It appears this is payback time. 
Senator Thompso9n and the Governmental Affairs Committee have spent the last few months searching for why China would funnel illegal contributions into American political campaigns. Perhaps the pieces of the puzzle are starting to come together. 
Clearly, the Chinese Government wants the best American technology for both military and commercial use. China wants both nuclear weapons and nuclear powerplants. 
Apparently, President Clinton And vice President Gore are convinced that the best American nuclear technology is none too good for Beijing. 
Now I understand that there are some very good American companies which stand to make billions from this deal. Certainly the foreign policy establishment is excited about all of the new lobbying and consulting possibilities. But aren't there some far more important factors to be considered? 
Let me remind the Clinton administration that its own Central Intelligence Agency concluded in July that the People's Republic of China had become the most significant supplier of nuclear and chemical weapons technology to foreign countries. 
Let me remind the Clinton administration that the People's Republic of China sold chemical weapons materials to Iran and missiles and ring magnets used to process uranium to Pakistan. 
Let me remind the Clinton administration that the People's Republic of China has a long history of misrepresenting the use of American technology it buys and then reselling it to other nations, often terrorist countries like Iran. 
Mr. President, selling nuclear technology to the Chinese is a terrible idea. Even worse, however, is the thought that Americans are paying for it too. 
Since 1989, the Peoples Republic of China and various businesses connected to the Chinese Government have issued nearly $7 billion in bonds denominated in United States dollars. 
China itself has issued some $2.7 billion in such bonds. 
The Chinese International Trading and Investment Co., Chaired by Wang Jung, reportedly connected to the Chinese Army, has issued $800 million in bonds in the United States during the past few years. 
If Mr. Jung's name sounds familiar--its because he was at the White House having coffee with the President on February 6, 1996. What a delightful man for a tea party. 
It was also discovered that Mr. Jung's other company, Poly Technologies, was responsible for smuggling AK-47's to Los Angeles gangs. 
This is the man that was at the tea party. 
The Bank of China has also issued some $80 million in dollar denominated bonds in the United States. This is the same bank that wired money to Charlie Trie on a regular basis. 
Mr. President, my greatest concern is that American mutual funds and pension funds will end up owning these bonds. Where else is there for them to go except to mutual funds and pension funds? To say that these bonds are risky is putting a nice face on them. If these companies default, they will stick the American taxpayer with the bill on the Chinese bonds. 
Today, I am introducing legislation that will require the SEC to establish an office of national security that will routinely report to the Congress on security offerings by foreign governments and companies. This will also require the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to annually review America's pension funds and report on the number of foreign securities being held. 
It is time that Congress and the American public start paying attention to this quiet financial invasion. We need to pay attention to what is in America's retirement funds because we know who will pick up the deficit. 
Already, it has been reported that the Arkansas State Teachers' Retirement Fund is holding roughly 40 percent of its assets in Pacific rim entities, several of which are Chinese. 
If so, this is a tragedy for people who worked all their lives and are counting on that pension for their retirement peace of mind, when in reality it might not happen. 
Mr. President, maybe this administration thinks the American people don't care about China's activities. Maybe I'm wrong, but I believe the American people do care. They know the Chinese people are oppressed by a Communist government that uses capitalism when it is convenient to further their death grip on political power. 
They know that China engages in unfair trading practices which result in a $50 billion trade deficit with the American people on an annual basis. They know that China oppresses their people and flagrantly violates human rights. They know China uses slave labor to make products for sale. They know that China sells the internal organs of executed prisoners on the black market. They know China infringes patents by selling pirated copies of American products. They know the People's Liberation Army is buying businesses in the United States as fronts for their secretive dealings. They know China persecutes Christians and religious believers. 
I say to President Clinton and Vice President Gore that the American people do care. And remember that while the People's Republic of China may have supported their reelection campaigns, they do not support the freedom campaign of their own people. 
Selling highly sensitive nuclear technology to China is a bad idea with extremely dangerous consequences. Permitting the invasion of our capital markets is another bad idea with worse potential consequences. 
I also believe that allowing China to own ports on both ends of the Panama Canal is another bad idea, from whence they could dominate the canal and will bring dangerous consequences to our national security. 
The Clinton administration and this Congress will face a difficult decision between two very strong competing forces--money and morality. I hope they decide to do what is in the best interests of the American people, not their foreign campaign donors that have all fled the country.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to make several comments on the extension of the provision of section 245(I) which is in the continuing resolution we passed today. 
This provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act allowed foreign nationals to adjust their status while remaining in this country after either entering the United States illegally or remaining in this country after their visa expired and they became illegal. 
Either way, these individuals have entered this country without having respect for our laws or have remained here because of little or no respect for our laws. 
On August 22, 1996, this body passed legislation to attempt to enforce stricter penalties against those foreign nationals that arrive in the United States illegally or remain hidden in the workforce illegally after their visas expire. The law we passed required illegal aliens to leave this country and go through the proper channels of immigration from their homeland or remain here and be subject to a 3- or 10-year bar from reentry into our country. 
The Illegal Immigration Act of 1996 calls for a mandatory 3-year bar against that illegal alien from entering this country if he or she has remained illegally in this country for 180 days after April 1, 1997. 
If he or she remains here for 1 year after April 1, 1997, that bar is 10 years. 
It appears in just over 1 year from passing this legislation and just at the time the 180 day timeframe kicks in--now this body is attempting to provide a loophole for illegal aliens to remain in this country with little or no consequence. 
I am opposed to this extension. And I will not vote for any legislation that permanently extends the cut off period. What we are doing is rewarding illegal behavior. 
I sometimes wonder why we have immigration laws that we do not enforce? 
Our immigration policy in this country is a mess. We don't have a policy, because if we make one we make exceptions to it almost immediately. Here we are 1 year later and we are providing extensions already. When is this kind of legislating going to stop? 
For as little as $1,000, someone can remain in this country illegally. This is a small price to pay to enable someone with little regard for our laws to remain in this great country. 
Mr. President, what kind of signal does it send to hardworking, law-abiding Americans--that you can come to this country illegally and stay here illegally, for as little as $1,000. 
I think we send the signal that anybody can come to the United States at anytime and stay here for as long as they want. 
Maybe I have the answer to the respect for our laws that some noncitizens have. I have also received information from the Bureau of Prisons that in the Federal prison system approximately 26.6 percent of the Federal inmates are not U.S. citizens as of June 1997. To take care of these prisoners is costing U.S. taxpayers $687 million a year. 
By the U.S. Congress extending the ability to adjust status to persons that have little regard for our laws with such little consequence, we are only condoning illegal actions and opening the door to further crime. 
Illegal immigrants have put a burden on our Federal system which we cannot sustain and remain solvent. This is wrong. We as a country cannot continue to fix the errors of illegal immigrants. They should be held accountable for their actions. 
Mr. President, it is a privilege to be in this great country. We must request all residents, whether citizens or noncitizens, of the United States adhere to our laws. And our message should be consistent. 
For these reasons, I am strongly opposed to the extension of 245(I) that is in the continuing resolution. I am further opposed to any effort to make permanent changes to this law that would weaken our immigration policy.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of this bill, the LEAF Act. I want to thank Senator Ford for the hard work and the leadership role he has taken over his years in the Senate on this bill and in support of the tobacco industry as a whole and, especially, the farmers involved in it. 
There has been a lot of talk on this floor about farmers. Everyone is against tobacco, but they are for farmers. Everyone pledges to help the farmers. This bill is a blueprint for that help. This plan offers assistance to the tobacco community across North Carolina, Kentucky, and the entire producing area, including Virginia, South Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee. These people are the men and women in tobacco fields and cigarette factories and their communities. 
There are 18,000 tobacco farmers in North Carolina and thousands more throughout the Southeast. The farmers of my State collect more than $1 billion in receipts each year from tobacco alone. That is a big number, but it is spread over many small farms. Everyone in Washington talks about the small farmer, the family farm, but North Carolina is the State of small farms. The average farm size in North Carolina is just 159 acres, one-third of the national average, which is 469 acres. It is difficult at best to make a living on a small farm. Tobacco kept these people alive on small farming operations over the last 60 years. Tobacco produces roughly $1,200 an acre in net profit. There isn't anything else they can plant that comes close to this, even remotely close. Tobacco keeps the family farm together, and, Mr. President, it keeps the family on the farm. That is why we are here with this bill and the reason I am here this morning. 
The impact of this proposed tobacco settlement would throw thousands of small farmers off their land and immediately into bankruptcy. It is up to us to step up and to help them through this transition. 
I have talked about farmers so far and only farmers, but the economic impact of tobacco and this proposed settlement is not limited to farmers. There are 20,000 working people in factories across North Carolina manufacturing tobacco products. They pay mortgages, buy groceries and struggle to meet tuition bills. They are simply middle-class American people. However, tobacco is their livelihood, and Congress has set its sights on destroying their livelihood. That is simply what has happened here. 
The entire tobacco sector employs 100,000 people in North Carolina. That is $7 billion in business in the State. It is 8 percent of the work force and represents a lot of families. I am here to attempt to stand up for these people. 
Next year the Congress will take up an agreement that deals a real blow to the livelihood of these thousands of people. Tobacco production is expected to drop significantly under the proposed agreement. The farmers and factory workers are in the cross hairs of the tobacco settlement, and whether the antitobacco crowd is aiming at them or not, they are the ones who are going to be hit. This bill tells them that Congress will try to lessen the effects on the innocent parties, the hard-working men and women in the tobacco fields and on the factory floor. 
Senator Ford explained these transition payments to farmers. The Freedom to Farm Act moved farmers to an unregulated market and included substantial transition payments to assist them through this change. However, there was nothing in that bill designed to cut production of corn, wheat or any other crop. This proposed tobacco settlement takes aim at this crop, however, so the transition payments are a necessity. 
The amount of money in this bill for the farmers and factory workers is modest compared to the amount of money that others seeking from the settlement. Somewhere in the neighborhood of $28 billion would be involved in Senator Ford's bill. Now, it might interest you to know that the hundreds of trial lawyers involved in this potential settlement expect to receive up to $45 billion, almost two times as much as we are asking for the more than 150,000 people effected by this settlement. 
The farmers face a situation where the Government will target their crop and cut its production. We need the transition money. How many people, farmers or not, could stand a quick reduction of 30 percent of their income due to the intended actions of the Federal Government? That is simply what we are talking about here--reducing the tobacco farmer's income by 30 percent. This bill is about the future of communities and literally big sections of our State. The bill includes farm opportunity scholarships to allow the farmers and their children additional educational opportunities. It also provides for rural development to enable these communities to survive the transition. This bill tells farmers that Congress is not leaving them without any options for the future. It tells them the rhetoric against tobacco is not really against them. At this moment they believe that it is and have every reason to think so. 
This bill is a chance to back up all the rhetoric about being against tobacco but for farmers. If we are for farmers, we will pass this bill. I hope my colleagues will join me, Senator Ford, Senator McConnell, and Senator Helms in support of this bill.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill cosponsored by my esteemed colleague, Senator Moynihan. This bill will close a loophole in the law and provide a safeguard for American citizens overseas. Last year, Congress amended the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to provide a remedy in U.S. courts to American citizens who are victims of acts of torture and terrorism perpetrated by terrorist nations. 
The bill I am introducing today would broaden these antiterrorism provisions and send a forceful message to other foreign despots around the world that the United States will not tolerate the abuse of human rights of its citizens. 
Last year's legislation took an important step to deal with the criminal act of terrorism and related human rights protections, however, because it targeted only those countries on the State Department's terrorist list, there is no available remedy for Americans under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act when governments of countries not on the torture list brutalize U.S. citizens. 
Granted, only a few renegade countries not on the terrorist list systematically engage in torture. But our legislation will put these tyrants on notice that the United States will not let a legal technicality stand in the way of an American citizen bringing suit in the United States against his or her tormentor. These ruthless acts shall be judged by a court of law and, ultimately, by the opinions of mankind. 
Mr. President, I urge Congress to close this loophole. To some it may seem like a small detail and the circumstances for such an incident may seem improbable, but I have first hand knowledge of two incidents of systematic torture, one of which involved a constituent from North Carolina living outside the protection of U.S. borders. 
Mr. Scott Nelson was working in Saudi Arabia in 1984 as a systems engineer at King Faisal Specialist Hospital. In the course of his inspection duties, Mr. Nelson discovered a severe health hazard involving the valves that delivered oxygen during various medical procedures. He immediately reported the irregularities to his supervisors, and recommended corrective action be taken. 
To his surprise, Mr. Nelson found his warnings blatantly ignored. After taking this to the highest managerial level of the hospital, he was summoned to a hospital office, arrested, imprisoned, and ultimately interrogated. When he arrived in the interrogation room, Saudi officials shackled Mr. Nelson and ultimately tortured him, causing lifelong disabilities. 
Mr Nelson was thrown into a rat infested cell where he was denied food, water, and sleep for days. At some point, Mr. Nelson was presented a document in Arabic and ordered to sign it. Under a Saudi threat to arrest Mr. Nelson's wife and child, he signed the document. 
At no time during his 39-day detention was Scott Nelson informed of any charges or given the due process right of having his situation brought before a court or tribunal. 
After 39 days of this most horrible experience, Mr. Nelson was released. He immediately returned to the United States in grave need of medical treatment and surgery to his left knee. Since that time, he has had five additional surgical procedures. 
Additionally, Mr. Nelson has been diagnosed with diffuse nerve injury and posttraumatic stress disorder with symptoms rated as catastrophic. Eight physicians and psychologists who have examined Scott are unanimous in their judgment that the severe physical and psychological injuries from which he suffers are entirely consistent with his allegations of torture. 
Mr. President, had this torture taken place in Iraq, Libya, North Korea, or any of the nations the State Department has designated as `terrorist' states, he would be entitled to seek damages in a United States court. Because Saudi Arabia, like so many other countries, is not officially considered a terrorist nation by our State Department, there is no remedy for American citizens to seek legal redress for injuries resulting from torture. 
Mr. President, Scott Nelson has suffered enough. It is time for his government to provide him with a vehicle for relief. The legislation I present today is a simple and indisputable proposition: The United States shall not tolerate any country in the world to violate the basic rights of her citizens. I believe this is legislation that everyone in this body can support without hesitation.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation that will eliminate the marriage penalty tax. This is similar to legislation in the House, H.R. 2456, which has 218 cosponsors, including the Speaker of the House. 
According to the Joint Economic Committee, in 1996, more than 23 million married couples paid a marriage penalty, totaling an extra $28 billion in taxes. This would mean the average couple is paying $1,200 more in income taxes simply because they are married. I think it is time to change the tax code so that we do not punish people simply for being married. 
From 1913 to 1969, the federal income tax treated married couples either just as well as or better than if they were single. Since then, married couples have had to pay a marriage penalty. This is even more ironic if you consider that the number of married couples where both work has increased dramatically. Finally, the tax increase in 1993 made the problem worse by raising the tax rates. 
This legislation is supported by Americans for Tax Reform and the National Taxpayers Unions. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Hutchinson and Mack, making a total of 35 Senators that are original cosponsors. 
I would hope that we could end this penalty against marriage. Marriage should be cherished, not punished by the Federal Government. I would urge other Senators to cosponsor this bill, and I would hope that we could take up this legislation as soon as possible.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am introducing this bill today to authorize the Department of Transportation to convey the Coast Guard station, Ocracoke, NC, to the State of North Carolina, when the Coast Guard determines that it no longer needs to keep the facility. 
This station is located on the southern end of Ocracoke Island, adjacent to the wharf where the ferries to and from Swan Quarter and Cedar Island dock. It is vital that these limited ferry facilities are expanded to meet the ever-growing demands of more and more traffic, and this Coast Guard station is ideal for this purpose. Since the port at Ocracoke is the southern termination of State highway 12 on the Outer Banks, these ferries are the only way to get residents and tourists across Pamlico Sound in the event of the need to evacuate when hurricanes threaten. The only other way off this stretch of the Outer Banks is the bridge at Roanoke Island, which is more than 75 miles to the north of Ocracoke. 
The State also plans to use this surplus Coast Guard facility for educational purposes. While the ferry division has a need for the grounds and a portion of the station buildings, the remaining spaces can be used for coastal environmental study. Of course the Coast Guard will continue to have access to the docking facilities to any extent needed. 
Mr. President, with the safety of the residents and of all our guests that visit the Outer Banks uppermost in my mind, I urge timely consideration and passage of this bill.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, there is in this country a need for campaign reform. Something could well be done but the approach from the Clinton-Gore administration is in no way a sincere effort. It is a gossamer facade at reform. In reality, it is nothing more than an attempt to divert people's attention from the flagrant abuses of the campaign finance laws already on the books--laws they have broken on a regular basis. 
It takes absolute unmitigated gall for President Clinton and Vice President Gore to talk about campaign finance reform when they cannot and have not obeyed the existing laws. For the President and Vice President to be talking about campaign finance reform, it would be similar to Jesse James leading a crusade for stricter bank robbery laws. They both remind me of two people that have stolen your horses and go flying down the road by your house saying `lock your barn, lock your barn.' They have gotten the horses and gone. 
The truth is that this is a first step in a liberal effort to get the American taxpayer to pay for political campaigns. It would be a massive mistake to take the electoral process away from the private sector and turn it into another Federal Government bureaucracy. And that is exactly what this bill would do. What they are hoping to do is to make campaigns a public bureaucracy paid for by the taxpayers whether they want to or not. When they talk about campaign finance reform, there is one thing they have in mind: Getting their hands into the public till to pay for their political campaigns. 
If you want to see how well public financing works, you can just look at the 1996 Presidential campaign. Have you ever seen a more flagrant disregard for the laws of this country than happened in that? President Clinton and Vice President Gore didn't need to raise money from Buddhist monks, Asian temples, international arms dealers, and the Chinese Government because their general election campaign was already paid for by the American taxpayers. But, no, they were so greedy they had to go everywhere and hunt every illegal contribution they could find. 
They wonder why fewer and fewer Americans are checking off the contribution box for the President's election fund on their tax forms. Why check it off? Simply make a trip to the Buddhist temple and fund your own campaign. 
The private sector works. If people want to support a candidate with their contributions, they will. But don't force the taxpayers to fund the ideological campaigns of candidates they don't support. And that is exactly where we are heading. 
Mr. President, as I said, there is a need for campaign finance reform. I have supported several specific items which I believe could help bring some balance to the system. Indexing contributions would be one. Another is to make sure that workers have an option whether they want to support the union political activities or not. One of the most important things is to protect their paycheck. We need faster and fuller disclosure of contributions, and if we really wanted to do something for campaign finance reform we could go with term limits, if we were really serious about controlling it. 
Most importantly, politicians should start obeying the campaign finance laws that are already on the books. Why should we start passing more reform laws when in the past campaign we saw the President and the Vice President break the ones that were there day in and day out. And I am tired of the `everybody did it' excuse that we are hearing out of this administration. Even if that were true, it is time for the President to muster the intestinal fortitude on his own and stop doing it. There is no excuse for him to do it because somebody--they were saying this morning in the hearing--20 years ago did it. He should be responsible for himself. 
It is already illegal to accept contributions from foreign countries. Why do we not enforce the existing law rather than going for new ones? Mr. President, we need real campaign finance reform but spare us the moral outrage coming from President Clinton and Vice President Gore. We have enough cynicism in politics as it is now. It is time to end it. It is time for the President and Vice President to take responsibility for their personal actions. 
Mr. President, I thank you and I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning the fiscal year 1998 Treasury appropriations conference report. First, I would like to thank the chairman of the Senate Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee, and my good friend, Senator Campbell. He and his staff have been most gracious in working with me on a range of issues of concern to North Carolina, including funding in the budget of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms for two new data acquisition stations [DAS] for the Cumberland County sheriff's office and the Guilford County sheriff's office. These two stations will allow law enforcement in both western and eastern North Carolina access to sophisticated technology to examine bullets and bullet fragments found at crime scenes. These DAS stations will be powerful crime-fighting tools, and I want to thank the chairman for helping to make this possible. 
I also want to thank the chairman for his inclusion of language I requested to repeal section 1555 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act [FASA]. As many of my colleagues in the Senate know, this language was originally passed in 1994 without any hearings, and without any debate in Congress. 
It was intended to give State and local governments access to the General Services Administration [GSA] purchasing schedule. GSA sells everything from office supplies to cars and law enforcement equipment. 
The problem is this--if every State and local government purchases their supplies directly through the Federal Government, thousands of small businesses who currently provide those supplies will go out of business. 
Section 1555 has not yet been implemented--a temporary moratorium was enacted in 1995, and most recently extended until the end of this session of Congress as part of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1997. 
If section 1555 were not repealed, most businesses would no longer be able to sell products to their local governments, but would be driven out by unfair competition. Perhaps a select few would be included in the General Services Administration's purchasing schedules, but heaven help the small business man or woman who must come to Washington, DC, for permission every time he or she wants to sell office supplies to their local city council or county commission. Tragically, this is the kind of result that section 1555 would bring about, and it would devastate small businesses across the country. 
I have heard from numerous small business men and women who regard this provision to be a potential disaster, were it ever to be implemented. Thankfully, it will not be, now that language to repeal this statute has been included in this conference report. Section 1555 should never be implemented, it should be repealed as soon as possible. I strongly support the repeal language included in the bill.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues are aware, I introduced a bill earlier this session, along with Senator Kyl and numerous other Senators, on occupancy standards. The State Housing Protection Act transfers authority to set occupancy standards from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to the States. Occupancy standards was an issue in last year's conference of the public housing bill. I rise today to urge the members of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs to address occupancy standards again this year when the public housing reform bill goes to conference. 
The State Housing Protection Act does not address privately owned dwellings, only rental dwellings. Under the Fair Housing Act, private property owners are permitted to set occupancy standards that limit the number of persons who may rent an apartment dwelling, if the standards are reasonable. At present, there is no clear guidance in this area, and there is controversy over what is a reasonable standard. 
Following passage of the Fair Housing Act in 1988, some activists brought lawsuits against housing providers, charging that two persons per bedroom standards discriminated against families. Housing providers persuasively argued to HUD that consistently applied two persons per bedroom standards do not discriminate against families. So, in order to give housing providers a safe harbor from inappropriate legal challenges, in 1991, HUD issued guidance which indicated that two persons per bedroom would be presumed to be a generally reasonable standard by HUD, and housing providers would generally not be sued by HUD for discrimination if they used that standard. 
Housing providers, of course, were not precluded in the guidance from exceeding that standard. Private housing providers adjusted to that guidance and relied on it when adopting occupancy policies for their rental units. HUD's own handbooks for public and assisted housing also established that standard. HUD itself adhered more strictly to that guidance until the Clinton administration arrived. 
In 1995, HUD issued and then quickly retracted a new guidance that would have required housing providers to allow as many as 8 to 10 people in a two bedroom apartment and 12 to 15 in a three bedroom apartment--if the housing providers didn't want to be sued for discrimination by HUD. HUD realized that the 1995 guidance was unworkable and put back in place the 1991 two person per bedroom guidance. However, there have been a number of court decisions overturning HUD's actions in this area. So there is still a void and no clarity as to how it is being interpreted by HUD or whether it will be changed again by HUD in line with the 1995 attempt. 
Housing providers need certainty in their establishment of such fundamental business judgments as occupancy standards. Nobody likes to be sued for discrimination, but you especially don't like when you don't know the rules that are being used by the Government. Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee have acknowledged the need for clarity and have promised to work with me in conference on this issue.

<TEXT>
Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the fiscal year 1998 District of Columbia appropriations bill to the Senate. 
This budget is the first I have had the opportunity to present to the Senate since becoming the chairman of the District of Columbia Appropriations Subcommittee. This is essentially a clean bill, with no new policy riders. 
I am very pleased that this budget was reported favorably by the full Appropriations Committee by a vote of 27 to 1. This is a bipartisan bill, and a bill that reflects the consensus of both the Financial Control Board established by Congress and the city's elected leadership. 
This budget of $4.2 billion is a smaller budget than last year's $5.1 billion budget for two reasons. 
First, the Federal Government is providing the city with fewer Federal dollars. This past July, Congress enacted landmark legislation restructuring the city's budget, transferring some city functions to the Federal Government, and in exchange, cutting the Federal payment to the District. 
That legislation also added some important management reforms at my urging. I'll have more to say about these structural changes and management reforms in a moment. 
Second, this is a smaller budget because it is the first balanced budget submitted to the Congress by city officials since 1993. That one proved very unbalanced. This one will be balanced. 
As many of my colleagues know, the law enacted by Congress in 1995 creating a Financial Control Board included a timetable requiring the city of Washington, DC to submit a balanced budget to Congress by next year. 
Fortunately, the Control Board and the D.C. Council managed to agree on enough spending cuts to submit a balanced budget to Congress 1 year ahead of schedule. That is essentially the budget before the Senate today. 
This balanced budget cuts roughly $85 million from last year's operating budget, not to mention a reduction of over $500 million in the direct Federal contribution to the city, from $712 million last year down to $190 million this year. 
Most agencies in the District of Columbia government have been cut. One exception is the police department, which received a modest increase reflecting a citywide effort--and I might say a nationwide effort--to crack down on crime within the city. 
Perhaps the most important point is that both the Control Board and the D.C. Council have agreed to these cuts. 
The Control Board and the D.C. Council worked together to craft a consensus budget. That consensus has been incorporated into this bill. 
I do not think it is necessary for the U.S. Senate to revisit every spending decision that has been agreed upon by both the council and the control board, especially since we have achieved a balanced budget 1 year ahead of time. 
Such decisions are long overdue even if it took some prodding from the Congress to get. I think it is the responsibility of the Senate to ratify those decisions once they have been made. 
In addition to being the first balanced budget in several years, this budget pays for many of the structural changes and management reforms, including the District of Columbia Revitalization Act, signed into law on August 5, 1997. 
For example, the Revitalization Act transferred the city's prison system, the courts, and a huge unfunded pension liability of $5 billion to the Federal Government. In exchange, the Congress will no longer provide an annual Federal payment of $660 million or a $52 million annual payment on the pension liability. Instead, this bill provides a one-time Federal contribution of $190 million as authorized by the Revitalization Act. Of that $190 million, the bill directs that $30 million be applied to pay down on the city's debt. 
The Revitalization Act has been called a rescue plan for the District of Columbia. I feel strongly that any rescue plan must first rescue the city from terrible mismanagement, waste, and unresponsive and irresponsible local government. 
I insisted that the rescue plan, and the majority leader with me insisted that the rescue plan include the Management Reform Act of 1997 to begin the process of cleaning house in each of the major city agencies. 
The Management Reform Act authorized the control board to hire professional consultants to conduct a top-to-bottom review of nine major city agencies to map out a plan for improving the quality of services. 
This District of Columbia appropriations bill provides $8 million to pay for the consultants to go into the various city agencies. 
The structural changes in the Revitalization Act provide the city with a one-time windfall of $200 million. I am pleased that the mayor, the council, and the Control Board agreed that this windfall should not be used for a spending spree and that none of the funds should go toward increasing the operating costs of the city. 
Of the $200 million available, $160 million will be applied to pay down the city's accumulated deficit. The remaining $40 million will be used to make infrastructure repairs and the management changes and productivity improvements suggested by the management consultants. The infrastructure of the city is in dire need of much improvement. 
The Management Reform Act also called for the immediate dismissal of the heads of nine major city agencies and called on the Mayor to either nominate new officials or renominate the current officials to head each of the agencies, with each nomination subject to the consent and approval of the Control Board. In other words, a final decision rests with the Control Board. 
In order to preserve the checks and balances between the executive and the legislative branches and the District of Columbia, section 133 of this appropriations bill makes clear that the D.C. Council does have official responsibility for confirming the Mayor's nominations to head those agencies. But then again, I reiterate, the final decision rests with the Control Board. 
Some Members expressed concern to me that funding for the homeless may be reduced by a consequence of this very tight budget. Section 146 of the bill directs the District government to maintain homeless services at the same level for fiscal year 1998 as the level for fiscal year 1997. I think this can be accomplished in a 
manner that is consistent with the spending restraints needed to maintain a balanced budget. 
Perhaps no issue received more attention in recent weeks than the inability of the District's public schools to open on time. It was a local and a national embarrassment. As the new chairman of the D.C. subcommittee, I am going to make sure that such a delay does not happen again. 
Section 147 of this bill directs the Control Board and General Becton, the CEO of the D.C. public schools, to report to the House and Senate appropriations and authorizing committees for the District of Columbia no later than April 1, 1998, of any and all necessary measures to ensure that the schools open on time in the fall of 1998. 
Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on the subcommittee, Senator Boxer, the ranking member, and Senator Hutchison of Texas. 
I also thank the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, Senator Stevens, and our distinguished ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their leadership and assistance on this bill. 
In summary, as I said, this is a consensus bill and the first balanced budget the District has seen in some time. This one truly is balanced. This bill funds the tough medicine of management reforms as well as restructuring of courts and corrections enacted by the Congress and signed into law by the President. It is a good bill and it is a bipartisan bill. 
With that, Mr. President, I yield to our ranking member, my good friend, Senator Boxer.  
Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with Chairman Gorton about Newfound Gap Road in western North Carolina. The National Park Service is responsible for the maintenance of this road, which runs through Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and it is the major route for many residents of the area. The road reaches elevations of 5,000 feet, so there is substantial snowfall in the winter, and I am concerned about the snowfall removal effort from the NPS. The road was closed on 42 days over the 1995-96 winter, and it was closed on 13 days over the 1996-97 winter, but the last winter was exceptionally mild. The NPS pledged increased efforts, but I am unaware of real changes in their methods, and I am concerned about prospects for this winter. Is the chairman aware of these problems?

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I am pleased to hear that the Committee understands the importance of this issue. The NPS expects to spend a lot of money for personnel costs, but I don't see evidence of a real commitment to increased maintenance of Newfound Gap Road. The NPS produced a plan last year to answer our concerns, but it was a superficial document that offered little encouragement, so I am glad to hear the chairman state that he expects NPS to be more responsive. This is important to the community, and I hear support for these people, but the NPS will need to take concrete steps to resolve this issue. The NPS cannot use salt on this road because of environmental concerns, so it needs to look at new equipment such as motorgraders, but I do not hear much about that. Robert Stanton, the new NPS director, told me that he is eager to work with us. He is a good man, and I am confident that he will make some changes, but the NPS budget plan for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park concerns me.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about this amendment, which will probably sail through the Senate. I spoke to my colleagues, and I know that we don't have the votes now, but we will revisit this issue in the global settlement. 
It is quite easy to come down to the Senate floor and rail about the tobacco companies. Well, Mr. President, let me say something about those tobacco companies. Mr. President, those companies employ more than 20,000 people in North Carolina, and those jobs are in jeopardy if we tax the tobacco companies into bankruptcy. 
These are hard-working men and women punching the timeclock every day. They are raising families on these wages, paying mortgages, just trying to get by. These jobs represent a payroll of more than $1 billion. They are good jobs, well-paying jobs, and I will not be part of this attack on their livelihoods. 
This is just another attack on tobacco carefully staged for the television cameras. This is a personal attack on tobacco farmers. The companies are the front this time. Just a subterfuge for yet another attack on the farmers and another potential source of revenues. In fact, they're ready to spend money we don't even have, and I think that this is the height of irresponsibility. 
I hope that my colleagues will resist the lure of easy political points.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, it is, indeed, a special privilege for me today to welcome as our guest chaplain, Dr. Clarence Newsome. 
Before I get into the other distinguished things about Dr. Newsome, I would like to mention that he is a native North Carolinian, born in Ahoskie, NC, and spent 18 years at one of our premier universities, Duke University, not only as a professor, but as a football player and a great leader of that university. 
He is now dean of the Howard University School of Divinity. Dr. Newsome is a distinguished clergyman, an impelling preacher, and a very visionary educator. He is known throughout the Nation as one of the most insightful and sensitive thinkers on religion, culture, and social issues of our time. Dr. Newsome continues to play a major role in the strategic development of Howard University. 
His presence with us today is an opportunity for the Senate to affirm the crucial and important contribution of Howard University to the city of Washington, to the District of Columbia, and to our Nation and world as a whole, being one of the leading producers of diplomats throughout the world. 
I welcome Dr. Clarence Newsome.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I want to announce that this morning, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of Senator Sessions' second-degree amendment to Senator Durbin's amendment, concerning the tobacco agreement, to S. 1061, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. As Members are aware, the Senate has been able to dispose of all but a very few amendments remaining in order to the bill. Therefore, the cooperation of all Members will be appreciated in the scheduling of time agreements and floor action on amendments. Members can anticipate rollcall votes throughout today's session of the Senate as we attempt to complete action on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Alabama. I cannot think of any better method of cutting to the crux of this whole tobacco settlement than the amendment that he has offered. We talk about here, on a regular basis, doing something for children, for the health care of children, for their better care, and looking after children. And I strongly support these initiatives. 
Knowing the generous, caring, and giving nature of the trial attorneys, I have no doubt that they would all be in strong support of the amendment of the Senator from Alabama if they were here to vote on it. Knowing of the eleemosynary history of trial attorneys, I know if they were here, they would join us in strong support of Senator Sessions' bill. 
So I just say that this is a wonderful opportunity to make a major contribution to the caring for children's health and their well-being in this country. I commend again the Senator from Alabama for bringing it to this body's attention. I stand in strong support of it. 
I say again, knowing the nature of the trial attorneys of this country, that if they were here and knowing that they had the opportunity to make this strong contribution to the children of this country rather than it going into attorneys' fees, that they would stand in strong support of the amendment of the Senator from Alabama also. 
I thank you, Mr. President, and I thank Senator Sessions.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, my amendment will directly help students and teachers in this country. It is an amendment that simply requires accountability of our spending at the Department of Education. This amendment will require the Secretary of Education to certify that 95 percent of the amount we appropriate in this bill goes directly to students and teachers. If the Secretary cannot certify that 95 percent of our spending directly benefits students and teachers, then the Secretary must certify what percentage is being spent. 
Mr. President, the Department of Education will spend $31 billion in 1998. The Department is receiving an increase of nearly $3 billion in funding for 1998. No one is a stronger supporter of education than I am, but education has, and hopefully will be, a local issue. So I would hope that the role of a Federal Department of Education is to provide additional funds for students and teachers, not bureaucrats. 
I think we need to fire bureaucrats, and feed teachers! 
The Department will spend $400 million on management alone. My concern is the Department is rife with wasteful programs. For example, there is $4 million for the John F. Kennedy Center for Performing Arts. There is money for education of prisoners in Hawaii and money to study waste disposal in Hawaii. There is $15 million for education of juveniles in prison. More than $64 million will be spent on just research. These are just a few examples. 
Most people think the Department is spending money on teachers and students alone. But we know this is not true. This amendment will for the first time require the Department of Education to tell the American people just how much is being spent by the Federal Government on teachers and students, not bureaucrats and wasteful programs.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I heard some good words about a provision of the tax bill from the folks back home during August recess, and I want to pass on their comments. 
The subject was income averaging for farmers. The tax bill restored this important financial management tool. I commend Senator Shelby and Senator Burns for their fine leadership on this bill. 
The American farmer is the most efficient food producer in the world. The average farmer grows food and fiber for close to 130 people. The people of the United States thus enjoy the most plentiful and affordable food supply in the world. 
However, the American farmer faces numerous obstacles, from unpredictable weather to natural disasters, from outbreaks of insects and disease to excessive Government regulations. 
As a farmer for more than 50 years, I know that there is one constant in farming, and that is unpredictability. 
For many years, the American farmer was permitted to average his income over a 2-year period, and this brought some predictability to their Federal income taxes. It meant that farmers were allowed to moderate the tax effects of the natural boom and bust cycle that is so familiar to many farmers. 
The 1986 Tax Reform Act, however, abolished income averaging for farmers. The tax bill reduced the number of tax brackets and cut the top rate to 28 percent. Of course, just 7 years later, the number of brackets jumped and the top rate soared to 39.6 percent. 
Further, the American farmer faced another major change, the 1996 farm bill. The new farm bill abolished the traditional price deficiency payments--the price supports that guaranteed a certain farm income--and it set the farm programs on a market-oriented path. 
The increased exposure of the farmer to the risks of the markets and the risks of the elements, coupled with tax rates that approach 40 percent, underscore the need to restore income averaging. 
It is difficult for the small farmer to create a farm business plan that can anticipate the surges and dives in income that are part of farm life. It is tough to plan for tax management due to the uncertainties of farm operations. 
The farmer struggles to pay his bills, much less save, in a bad year, and he faces high tax rates in his good years. As a result, compared to people who earn stable incomes, farmers pay taxes at a higher cumulative rate. 
Mr. President, the farmer is the backbone of this Nation, and he keeps us fed. He is essential to our Nation and to the health of rural communities. 
The current Tax Code and regulatory requirements are burdens that plague North Carolina farmers and all American farmers and ranchers. 
The Tax Code needs to reflect their contributions to our health and our balance of trade. This provision will be a real help for farmers and farm communities across this Nation. It will save American farmers more than $150 million, and, more important, it will save some farms and the families who work them from financial ruin in the rough years inherent in agriculture. 
That's good for farmers and good for America.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am compelled to vote against H.R. 2015. This legislation will put us on a track to reduce the deficit. It will save us more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years. It puts binding caps on spending increases, so that a super majority will have to vote to increase spending. The bill continues the pay-as-you-go provisions of past budget deals, so that any new spending has to be offset by other spending reductions. It seeks to make Medicare solvent for the next 10 years and creates a National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare to address the long term solvency of Medicare. 
Regrettably, while all of the aforementioned is positive, there are significant drawbacks in this bill. 
First and foremost, the legislation raises taxes on tobacco by 15 cents a pack. When I was elected, I said I would never vote for a tax increase and I never have. This is a clear and punitive tax increase on tobacco. If we needed this revenue to reduce the deficit, rather than raising taxes, we could have cut more wasteful and unnecessary spending. We should have done that. 
Second, while the bill puts us on a path to deficit reduction, it raises the debt ceiling which allows the Treasury to go $450 billion deeper in debt than we already are. I think that being $5 trillion in debt is shameful enough. We do not need to raise the debt ceiling. 
Third, Mr. President, this legislation weakens last year's welfare law. When I ran for the Senate, I said that I wanted workfare, not welfare. Last year, we passed landmark legislation to end the welfare system as we know it in the United States. But it became clear soon after the bill was signed into law that the President was not committed to welfare reform. Just weeks after the bill was signed by the President, he went to the Democratic Convention in Chicago and promised to undo it next year. This bill weakens the work requirements. It builds in more flexibility to the work program. In Washington, flexibility is a code word for weakening, and that is what we have done to the work requirements for food stamp recipients. 
Not only have we weakened the welfare law, but we have restored $11 billion in welfare benefits for noncitizens. We seemed to have forgotten that welfare was and is a failure. Putting more people on welfare doesn't help society. But that is what we have done in this bill. We have increased the welfare roles, and we have added people who are not even American citizens. The very fact that non-citizens are receiving welfare is testimony to a system that has gotten out of control. Welfare is also prone to great fraud. Why else would we have to clarify that a noncitizen who is receiving welfare from the U.S. Government must actually be residing in the United States. Can you imagine that we would be paying welfare to people who are not even living in the United States. 
Mr. President, we have also created a new program regarding welfare. We are spending $3 billion to put welfare recipients to work. Welfare reform was supposed to save money and now we are spending money to reform welfare. Again, this kind of backward logic only seems to work in Washington. I am supportive of helping move welfare recipients to work--but another Government jobs program is not what we need. 
Mr. President, as I said, there are many good aspects to the bill, but it violates the fundamental promises I made to the people of North Carolina when I ran for the Senate regarding welfare and taxes. I will not break my word to the people that supported me in 1992, and I will not vote for this bill.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the tax bill, H.R. 2014. 
Mr. President, this is a major tax cut for the American people--more than $90 billion in tax relief. 
This is the largest tax cut for the American people since 1981. 
In terms of education, the provisions are very significant. My legislative priority for this year has been a tax credit for community college students of any age to improve their job skills. On the first day of this Congress, I introduced S. 50, a bill to provide a $1,500 tax credit for community college students. Technology has brought about rapid change in the workplace, and the need to update one's skills on a daily basis is critical. I think the community college system is the best job training program we have in this country. North Carolina has been a leader in education and in job growth. There is a strong link between the two. The tax bill will provide a 100-percent tax credit for the first $1,000 of expenses for attending a community college or the first 2 years of college. It will provide a 50-percent credit for of the next $1,000. In sum, it's a $1,500 tax credit for all of America's community college students. I was a strong supporter of this provision, and I am pleased it has been retained and improved. 
The legislation also provides an interest deduction for student loans. Under the bill, State prepaid tuition plans will receive tax-free treatment. And, the bill permits penalty free withdrawals from IRA's for education expenses. All of these provisions will improve our education system without spending more money on bureaucrats or Government programs. 
For families, the bill has significant tax relief. We have provided a $500 tax credit for children under the age of 17. For a family of four making $30,000--this is a 50-percent tax cut. For a family of four making $50,000, this is a 21-percent tax cut. 
Mr. President, this is major tax relief for America's working families. For too many years, these families, working men and women have been the backbone of America, going to work every day, paying the mortgage, raising families, and paying their taxes and their debts. The Government has put a greater and greater tax burden on them every year. This tax relief is long overdue. In fact, it's 16 years overdue. Their last tax cut was 1981. There have been plenty of tax increases in the intervening years. 
Mr. President, there are a number of other positive items in this tax bill. For example, the bill: Cuts capital gains taxes; cuts the capital gains on the sale of one's home; provides greater estate tax relief, particularly for small family-owned businesses and farms; accelerates the phasein of self-employed health insurance tax deduction; and provides a more generous IRA for at-home spouses. 
Mr. President, we should not lose sight of the fact that the Republicans have now controlled Congress for 3 years. We have finally overcome the President's opposition and cut taxes. In 1993, President Clinton passed the largest tax increase in American history. To me, this is a stark contrast in philosophy. If the Senate was not in Republican hands, we would be debating the size of the tax hike, not the tax cut. Although the White House has at times tried to blur the differences, it should not be lost on the American public that wasteful Government spending is going down, and taxes are being cut for the first time in years. 
The battle for greater tax relief does not end here. The Tax Code has to be simplified dramatically. Overall tax rates are too high. Americans are working until May just to pay taxes. We need to set a protection into law that not more than 25 percent of one's wages can be taken in taxes. 
I can assure the Senate and my constituents in North Carolina that I will continue my work for greater tax relief. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I am pleased to support this bill.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, Jim Gaupp was a fine American whose life touched many people. He was devoted to his family, and committed to his community. The following is an excerpt from the program at Jim's funeral, held at the Pinecrest Presbyterian Church in Hendersonville, NC: 
Psalm 121 
I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help. 
My help cometh from the Lord, which made heaven and earth. 
He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; he that keepeth thee will not slumber. 
Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep. 
The Lord is thy keeper: the Lord is thy shade upon thy right hand. 
The sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night. 
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil; he shall preserve thy soul. 
The Lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth, and even for evermore. 
James Louis Gaupp was born in Elk City, OK. In time, Jim moved to Columbus, OH, where he worked for Williams & Co., the metals warehouse. During his 47 years with Williams, Jim worked his way through the ranks and retired as a district manager and vice president. Jim Gaupp's commitment was to be a `Christian businessman and father.' 
In Columbus, OH, Jim Gaupp was very active in community service. He was very active in his church, in the chamber of commerce, and in the Kiwanis Club. 
Jim and Betty Gaupp moved to Hendersonville in 1982, and quickly became vital parts of the Pinecrest Church. At Pinecrest, Jim served as an elder, Sunday school teacher, and faithful member. 
In the Kiwanis Club of Hendersonville, Jim Gaupp was faithful; 51 years of perfect attendance at various Kiwanis Clubs was a record attained by Jim. 
Jim Gaupp was an outstanding Christian gentleman. Jim was an ardent student of the Bible--entrusting large portions of Scripture to memory. Jim was a great man of prayer. As much as anything else, Jim Gaupp was a great example and model for the sake of Christ in our midst. In many ways, Jim Gaupp will be missed. 
Jim Gaupp is survived by his devoted wife, Betty, two daughters, one son, and several grandchildren. 
Jim's life was an example to all, and he deserves a great deal of recognition. He has enriched our lives with his many contributions to our community. Jim will certainly be missed.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment that calls for a halt to all locality pay increases for all employees of the Department of Veterans Affairs that have been transferred due to their perpetration of sexual harassment. Let me explain why this amendment is necessary. 
Over a year ago to date, the Veterans Department undertook an investigation into the allegations of sexual harassment, misconduct, and unprofessional behavior on the part of Jerome Calhoun, who was Director of the VA Medical Center in Fayetteville, NC. 
In September 1996, the Office of the Inspector General of the Veterans Department issued a report confirming the allegations of sexual harassment, as well as a pattern of inappropriate and abusive behavior toward Department employees. 
In most organizations today this kind of behavior would not be tolerated. Jerome Calhoun would have been fired. Unfortunately, this is not the way things work at the Veterans Department. At the Veterans Department this kind of deplorable behavior gets you a comfortable settlement. 
Here are the facts: For his intolerable behavior, Mr. Calhoun was given a pay raise, bringing his already generous salary to $106,000. He was transferred to sunny Bay Pines, FL, a locale of his own choosing, and he was given the position of special assistant which is standard Government lingo for having no specific responsibilities. Quite frankly, I look at this settlement and I ask myself, where is the punishment? In the private sector this would be considered a promotion. 
Mr. President, on behalf of the 200,000 employees of the Veterans Department, I ask this body to do what Department officials have neglected. Jerome Calhoun must not be allowed make such an incredible mockery of the system.

<TEXT>
Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator Feinstein's amendment. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this amendment. 
In May of this year, Senator Feinstein introduced this bill, S. 726. The bill creates a new stamp that costs 1 cent more than whatever the regular price stamp might be. The additional revenue is to be used to directly fund research efforts for breast cancer. 
As I am sure we all know, breast cancer is the leading cause of death for women between the ages of 15 and 54. There are 2.6 million women today in America with breast cancer and an estimated 1 million are yet to be diagnosed. If only 10 percent of the first-class stamps use the option for an additional penny--currently it would be a 33-cent stamp, but that might change--but, if only 10 percent use the option of an additional penny above, $60 million would be raised for breast cancer annually. This would represent a 10 percent increase in the research funds available for this disease that is devastating so much of our population. 
I frankly believe the idea will be popular and will generate even greater funding than we anticipate. It is used pretty much around the world, except in Britain and the United States, this method of raising money for worthwhile causes. 
In my opinion, the new stamp provides a great opportunity to increase the research, and the proceeds come directly from the American people on a voluntary basis, not from tax money. Some have questioned what kind of precedent we are setting. I think the answer is that it is none. It is going to require an act of Congress and the support of the American people. If the program is successful, I suppose there will be people attempting to emulate it, but that is a decision for Congress to make at the time and on the issue involved. As I said, it is not a novel approach; it has been used around the world before this. 
Further, I think the people who do not think this will be popular are absolutely wrong. This measure, I think, will be extremely popular. It will raise a lot of money. I have discussed it with numerous people, and all have told me that they felt it was a worthwhile idea and would be worthwhile. I thank Senator Feinstein for introducing the amendment. 
I think the Senate needs to go on record in favor of this and let the American people decide if it is going to succeed or not. If it does, we know we will have been right. If it does not succeed, we will not have set a precedent for other stamps. But first and foremost, it is an idea well worth trying, and I think we need to give it an opportunity. 
I am aware that the post office has concerns. But every day I read the post office wants to expand its line of business. Every day, they are going into new business, new things, and to these I do not object. But I just noticed the other day they were selling neckties in the post office. I don't see why, with the vast new interest and new things they are going into, they could possibly have a problem with printing this new stamp. The cost of the stamp for distribution will be taken out before any money becomes available for research. This idea is merely a logical extension of selling stamps. I strongly urge Members to support it and urge you to vote for the Feinstein amendment. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that requires all Federal agencies to remove computer games from Government computers. 
On June 9 of this year, I introduced S. 885, the Responsive Government Act, together with Senators Hagel, Shelby, Stevens, and Hutchinson of Arkansas. The Responsive Government Act includes several provisions to help restore the confidence of the American people in the Federal Government. One of its provisions concerns the use of computer games on Government computers. I am again offering it today. 
It is absolutely ludicrous that the taxpayers are paying people to play computer games. The computers are bought and paid for by the American taxpayers for work and not for fun, and they are footing the bill for the job, the office and everything. To be using it for pleasure is simply not in keeping with the way we should be running the Government. 
The Federal Government did spend close to $20 billion last year on computers, equipment and support services. These systems are designed and purchased to increase productivity, not to provide games and ability to pass time while Federal employees are drawing wages. However, many of these computers are delivered already equipped with so-called games which reduce workers' efficiency and productivity. This legislation would prohibit the Federal Government from purchasing computers with preloaded game programs. These games, of course, do nothing but decrease productivity. 
In fact, a private sector survey found that workers spent an average of 5 1/2 hours per week playing computer games and other nonrelated tasks related to computer games. This translates into an annual loss of $10 billion in productivity. 
Clearly, these games do not stay on the computers and go unused. In fact, many of the games now come equipped with a `boss key' which is a device that lets a worker strike a single key and transform the computer scene from a game to a spread sheet, a false spread sheet but a spread sheet. The soul purpose of the device is to hide unproductive behavior from supervisors. If you are playing the game and you suspect that anybody is coming, you just hit a key and it looks like you are working. 
There is no reason for the Federal Government to buy computers with programs designed to divert employees' attention from their jobs. This is just simply common sense. 
My amendment does provide a waiver in cases where a cost-benefit analysis finds it is more costly to purchase new computer equipment without games than with them. But these cost-benefit reports must be transmitted to the Congress. I think it is a reasonable safeguard for the unusual cases that cannot be anticipated by the Congress. 
This is something that has already been done in selected Government agencies. Governor George Allen of Virginia and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich ordered workers to delete these game programs from their computers. I commend them for the action. It is time to implement such a policy throughout the Federal Government. 
I thank the chairman for accepting this amendment. I understand it has been accepted by the managers of the bill on both sides, and I very much appreciate the support and help of Senator Campbell and Senator Kohl. 
Mr. President, I yield any remaining time.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to commend Senator Domenici on an excellent bill. We all realize that he and his staff have been overwhelmed by requests for this bill, in particular by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers project requests. I think I speak for all of us when I say that he has done an excellent job balancing out the requests. No one received all he or she requested, but I believe we have all been treated fairly. 
In this vein, I want to comment on a very worthy project from Charlotte, NC, which was not able to be included in the bill, the Mecklenburg County streambank stabilization and restoration project. 
I am informed that the House has allotted $1 million for this very worthy project. When we go to conference, I look forward to working with Senator Domenici to ensure that the House appropriation for this matter remains in the final bill. The project is a good one, and seeks innovative methods of addressing problems of degradation of streams, pollution of surface waters, and flood protection. It also enjoys widespread support in the Charlotte area.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this amendment authorizes appropriations of $7,000,000 for a project called multitechnology integration in mixed-mode electronics. It is a project that will help give the United States a military advantage over our potential adversaries because it will support the development of technologies far superior to the off-the-shelf technologies that are becoming available to all nations on the global markets. 
As technologies are developed and commercialized, they become more standardized, mass produced, and widely available. We need to move beyond this cycle and find unique ways to integrate technologies into products that offer superior performance and are not available off-the-shelf. 
This appropriation increase is offset by a reduction in the Army's procurement appropriation for purchasing special equipment for user testing. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am today introducing the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging Establishment Act. 
This legislation would consolidate imaging research activities that are currently dispersed throughout the National Institutes of Health under a single administrative structure. This consolidation is needed to ensure that the American taxpayer receives the maximum possible return on our investment in critical new medical technologies. My legislation does not authorize any new spending; instead, it restructures existing programs in order to increase efficiency, provide greater accountability, and improve the process of setting priorities and allocating valuable resources for research. It also establishes a mechanism to coordinate the imaging research that is currently funded--without an overall plan--by federal agencies outside NIH. 
The NIH is a national treasure, but it is organized to support research into specific diseases and organ systems. Its structure is less well suited to a technology that cuts across these lines and is applicable to virtually all diseases and organs. This legislation will create a research infrastructure at NIH to develop the imaging technologies of the 21st century. Based on the remarkable record of imaging innovations in the past 25 years, breakthroughs in the coming years will allow physicians to detect, diagnose, and treat disease more effectively, less invasively, and less expensively. Nearly every American who needs health care services will benefit from this proposal. 
I urge my colleagues to join in this effort to meet the scientific and budgetary challenges we face in medical research.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment on behalf of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in my home state of North Carolina. 
In 1982, the Congress passed legislation to allow Indian tribes to issue tax exempt bonds, just like other units of government. The legislation recognized the rights of the tribes and confirmed their parallel rights to States, counties, and cities. 
The 1982 act thus acknowledged just what most of us knew: that Indian tribes are legitimate units of government with wide-ranging responsibilities. 
Using the act, the Cherokee Indians in my State issued $31 million in tax-exempt bonds to purchase the Carolina Mirror Co. The tribal leadership viewed the purchase of Carolina Mirror Co. as a means to promote jobs and economic development for their tribe and its members. The Cherokee have faced some tough times over the years. The Carolina Mirror Co. purchase was a way to invest in the future of their tribe and their people. 
Carolina Mirror today is the largest manufacturer of mirrors in the Nation. It employees over 500 people. It is an economic engine. It produces jobs and hope for a people that have seen little of both over the years. 
In 1986, however, the Congress passed new legislation that narrowed the interpretation of the original 1982 act. It changed the act so that tax-exempt bonds could only be used to finance `essential government functions.' 
Mr. President, as you know, interest rates are at historically low levels. I know that not enough of us have ever been in business and met a payroll, as I have for the past 50 years. Well, interest rates are the difference between profitability and bankruptcy, between jobs for the community and a lock on the factory gate. Needless to say, the Cherokees are eager to take advantage of lower interest rates and to refinance these bonds. 
The interest rate on these bonds is so high that the Carolina Mirror Co. literally spends almost all of its profits on interest payments. This is devastating for the company. 
When the company attempted to reissue the bonds, however, some IRS bureaucrat stepped away from the water cooler long enough to say `no.' The great minds at the IRS ruled that a refinancing constituted a reissuance and stopped the tribe from its plans to refinance these high interest bonds. 
By reissuing bonds at a lower rate, the company could save nearly a million dollars a year, but the IRS does not look at the situation. The 500 jobs do not matter. The investment of the Cherokees in the company does not matter. No, all that matters is that we follow the mindless dictate of an unelected, unaccountable bureaucrat holed up in a Federal office building waiting for the 4 o'clock vanpool back to the suburbs. The outside world is irrelevant. The real jobs of real people are irrelevant. 
The amendment that I offer today is a technical bill to allow Indian tribes to refinance tax-exempt bonds issued on or before October 13, 1997. This bill has a very narrow application. In fact, I introduced this bill last year as S. 1676. The Joint Committee on Taxation said last year--and again this year--that this bill will have a `negligible effect on budget receipts.' 
Let's do the right thing for the Cherokees. Let's tell the IRS that American jobs matter and the Congress stands behind the working men and women of this country. 
I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the tobacco tax in this revenue bill. I am also troubled by this amendment to further increase tobacco tax. Make no mistake, these are flat-tax increases, plain and simple. This is no extension or loophole closure, it is a tax increase. That is what it is. 
I didn't think that we were here to raise taxes on American families. I didn't think we were here for that purpose, but, obviously, that is what we have done. 
The tobacco tax is the most regressive tax on the books today. We will drive up taxes on the working people more than anything, up to $100 or more per year. 
The people who earn $30,000 a year pay 1.2 percent of the income tax in this country, but the people who earn $30,000 a year pay 47.2 percent of the tobacco tax. It is the most regressive tax on the books. 
I find it a bit odd that some of the big tobacco tax supporters are the same people preaching the need for greater equality in the tax relief package. You just cannot have it both ways. 
Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, is your talk about tax fairness anything more than talk? Is it airy persiflage, or do you mean what you are saying? Would you come to the floor to defeat a tax increase on the common man who smokes? 
This bill raises tobacco taxes by 20 cents a pack. The Durbin amendment would raise taxes by 10 cents a pack. This will hurt the 18,000 tobacco farmers in North Carolina and thousands more throughout the Southeast. It will cost them, literally, their jobs and their livelihood. Sure, it will let politicians tell the news media that we really took a shot at `Big Tobacco.' Well, `Big Tobacco' can look after itself, but the people who are growing it, the farmers, who they are really taking a shot at, cannot. The companies will not be bothered by this. The people who are going to be hurt are farmers, families, and communities. 
It will hurt the 77,000 working people in North Carolina who grow tobacco and manufacture cigarettes. Just the tobacco sales bring in over $1 billion in cash receipts to the farmers of my State. The entire tobacco sector employs 150,000 people. It is a $7 billion business in North Carolina alone. 
These are the fundamental core people of this State--hard-working men, women, and their families. Can you imagine the joy that they expressed when I went home and told them that they were going to be thrown out of business but that we had cut the cost of international air travel? Tobacco pays the mortgages, the grocery bills, and sends the children to college. These people don't do international air travel. Tobacco builds and has built the hospitals, it builds the churches, and it builds entire towns and communities. 
So, Mr. President, you be the judge. Is to say the tobacco tax is about politics not correct? 
The other side points to this tax and says this is about children's health insurance. They say it is about underage smoking, and they say it is about changing people's behavior. 
But it is not about children's health insurance. The settlement that the tobacco industry just signed clearly addresses this issue. There is $18.5 billion over 6 years for children's health insurance in the settlement that is now working its way through the process. The tobacco companies have already signed on the dotted line that they will pay into a fund for children's health insurance. There is already $16 billion in the bill for children's health insurance, and now we are going to vote another $8 billion for children's health insurance when the President only asked for $8 billion in the original bill and said that would be enough. Now we are going to $24 billion, and he only asked for $8 billion. I have never known him to ask for too little. 
It is not about underage smoking. The industry just agreed to a sweeping package of changes to prevent underage smoking. The agreement virtually bans all advertising. The industry even agreed to massive fines if underage smoking did not drop drastically over the next 8 years. I don't know how they are going to stop people from smoking, but that we will have to work on when it gets here. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, if this were it, the bill would include favors for a variety of special interests. The liquor tax would get special breaks, even skydiving would get a special break. No, no one ever caused an accident on the road after a night of smoking, and I never heard anyone being attacked after a cigarette binge. 
My point is, this bill isn't about public health, it is 
about the easy politics of attacking tobacco. The politics may be easy for Senators outside the Southeast, and particularly North Carolina, but this point reaches beyond politics. It reaches to the men and women in North Carolina and throughout the Southeast, hard-working people wondering why the U.S. Congress and their elected representatives are determined to throw them out of business and out of a job. 
Everyone in Washington talks about the small farmer. We hear it daily. North Carolina is made up of small farms. The size of an average U.S. farm is over 450 acres, and in North Carolina, it is around 150 acres. We are small farms. 
Tobacco pays the bills. An acre of tobacco will yield roughly $1,200 a year in net profit. Nothing else compares, and there really isn't anything else they can grow that begins to fit into the pattern and growth and lifestyle of the area. 
Tobacco keeps eastern North Carolina and Southeastern United States farmers on the land, and that is the simple bottom truth line. Tobacco keeps the family on the family farm. Washington politicians are driving families off the farm just to score political points back home. 
I want every Senator to understand what this tobacco tax means to real people. These farmers have names. They are good people. They are sending their children to school, and they are being driven out of a job to score political points. I hope that all Senators think about the people and the jobs that they are destroying when they next take a vote on a tobacco tax. 
And another question, who is next on the hit list from the tax increase crowd? Tobacco today, tomorrow who knows what product they have decided to tax out of existence. I hope my colleagues will vote against any other tax increase. It is time to stand up for the people who are in the business working for families. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I don't know of a lot more that can be said on the subject. It has been very adequately and eloquently addressed by the two Senators from Kentucky. But we talk about equity and we talk about fairness, but the truth of it is that is not even in the vernacular of what we are saying here tonight. What we are doing is very simply this--I said it yesterday, I think, or the day before--they said it was a historic session. Yes, it is a historic session. We are destroying an industry that has served this country for 300-plus years, and we are simply wiping it out. 
Now, when you go to the 77,000 workers in North Carolina and say to them, your job is gone, your industry is gone, but the good news is that international air travel is cheaper for you--most of them haven't been out of the county. So that is what we are saying here. 
I don't doubt that the real interest here is to reduce and enable people to deduct their health insurance. I didn't notice that it was proposed to be paid for by any 10-cents-a-bushel tax on corn. And they go back to Illinois and Missouri and explain to the corn farmers there that we really have done you a great favor. No, it is on tobacco, which has been the whipping boy. Anybody in the Senate or in the Congress in the last year or two that had an ax that needed to be ground, they have come to the tobacco industry to grind it for them. That is very simply what happened. This is a source of money for whatever eleemosynary or good feeling or cause we have. This is a source of money. 
As has been said earlier, enough is enough. I hope colleagues in the Senate will recognize that this has gone far enough. It breaks a budget agreement, and it is time to stop it. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to speak on education, particularly vocational education. 
This past January, I introduced, with Senator Craig, S. 50, which provides a $1,500 tax credit for students at vocational and technical schools and community colleges. S. 50, today, has the support of 11 other Members, including the majority leader. 
Recently, the tax credit for vocational training found a place in Senator Roth's budget reconciliation package. 
The provision provides a 75-percent tax credit for up to $2,000 in expenses at a community college. Now, for the average student spending around $1,500 in annual tuition and books, that amounts to a $1,125 tax credit. I would like to thank Senator Roth for his support of vocational training in the budget package. 
Under the House budget package, a student would only receive a 50-percent credit for up to $3,000. That amounts to $1,500 for a 4-year student. But for community college students, who are generally of a lower income and are holding jobs while they are in school, it would only amount to $750 or less. I think it is fortunate that the Senate recognizes this and is going to allow a 75-percent tax credit for up to $2,000. 
I believe that we should give every adult American the opportunity to obtain the training needed to find employment. In fact, we are demanding that they work, so it is incumbent upon us to give them the opportunity to be trained to work. Most any job that a person would look at today requires some training, and the community college is the place to do it. This tax credit will enable the students to go. 
A tax credit for community college students will encourage workers in all age brackets to pursue an education beyond high school without incurring the expensive cost of attending a 4-year college. By improving the training and skills of our workers, we will create a better job climate and a better manufacturing and technological society. 
As State commerce secretary for North Carolina, I was able to bring more than 500,000 jobs into the State, and practically all of them required additional training or retraining. By strengthening the community college system and offering custom training for workers in a specific skill for the last 8 years, North Carolina has been among the top three States in new plant locations. We have been able to develop a film industry that brings $2.5 billion a year to my State. The answer to economic growth is to be able to train people, and the community college system is the only entity I have ever seen that could really train them and put them on the job. 
As we begin to see the impact of the changes made to welfare in the last Congress, more and more people are going to be taken off welfare and they must work, and we must train them if they are going to work. 
Many people who go to the community colleges are going back for retraining. They are not studying to get an entirely new degree. People are expected to keep up with new technology, and industry is demanding that they do. The tax credit will allow these individuals to receive training so they can quickly return to the work force. 
Again, I want to thank Senator Roth for his support, as well as the 11 Senators that have helped me to bring this bill to this point. I certainly hope we will retain the 75-percent credit as the package moves through the process and through the conference. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, I take the floor today to congratulate the Central Intelligence Agency and the FBI for their efforts in capturing the terrorist who killed two CIA officers in 1993. 
Many thought when Aimal Kansi disappeared into Pakistan in 1993 that he would never be caught. I believe that our men and women who played a role in his capture deserve our thanks for the brave effort they went through to catch him. 
Another critical question that I do not think has been answered is why was Mr. Kansi ever allowed in this country in the first place? 
Why was he here to begin with? He came here in 1991, apparently well educated, as a Pakistani immigrant. He came here on a business visa. Supposedly, he came here for 1 month. He used false names and passports, and then the INS gave him a 1-year work visa. Of course, the plan was that he wanted to stay here forever. There was never any doubt about what he wanted. He wanted to be here permanently. A year later, he applied for political asylum. The political asylum issue has been abused to a greater degree than anything I can think of. The Clinton administration has made an absolute mockery of the words `political asylum.' There are almost 100,000 applications for political asylum each year. 
Now, here is the scandal. When someone has applied for political asylum, they cannot be deported. When you apply for political asylum, you cannot be deported. This application is a complete ruse for people to stay in this country illegally. These people can stay here for years. Now, one of the reasons this man sought asylum--if you can get this--and talk about stupidity on the part of this country--is that he is part of a militant group in Pakistan that opposes United States policies. That is the reason he needed asylum, so he could stay in this country. 
Mr. Kansi apparently moved about frequently. He worked at gas stations and as a courier in Virginia. Madam President, why do we need people coming into this country to work at a gasoline station and as a courier? Is this something we really need to grant a work visa for? 
Our immigration policies are simply out of control. We have hit a record number of immigrants coming into the country. In fact, so many are coming in that people with criminal records are getting by like they were moving through a sieve. We are filling the country with anybody with any excuse or reason who wants to come. People like Mr. Kansi are getting in by lying, false records, or whatever they want to present. They wind up here one way or another and we simply refuse to send them out. 
Our immigration policies are out of control and people are coming without being examined, without being checked. They are here. The World Trade Center bombing is an example. The shooting at the Empire State Building is another. The CIA killing in 1993 is another. All of these acts were committed by people that were willingly let into this country. How many instances does it take like this before we have the common sense to change the immigration laws that we are letting wreck this country? 
I think we need to take a hard look at the laws and determine if we are letting people into this country that are prone to commit terrorist acts against the Nation once they get here. 
One of the basic problems, of course, with immigration is that we have a more-than-generous welfare system--more than generous. People are coming into this country not to work, but to sit down. They are coming here to become part of our welfare system, not to become part of our work force. When we attempted to change our welfare laws and cut off cash assistance to noncitizens, the Congress got frightened, and we decided it was being too harsh not to give cash money to noncitizens. How cruel could we be not to hand out cash to an illegal noncitizen? We have perpetrated an immigration system that is out of control. 
Madam President, we know that there are many people who want to be Americans. Many people want to come here and make a contribution to the United States. We have a long history of immigration. We are all descendents of immigrants from somewhere at one time, except Native Americans. But somewhere we have gone wrong. At one point, people came to this country to work and to labor and be a part of it. But now they come to be a part of charity. I think we began to go wrong when we lost common sense in our immigration policies. 
Madam President, I think the problem began when we lost common sense altogether in the Government, and particularly with the welfare programs supporting the things that these people were coming for. Why should we give noncitizens welfare? Why should the Federal Government punish a county or town if they don't print documents in languages other than English? Madam President, we do that. 
Why do we have pages and pages of legislative language just to define the word `work.' I think anybody that has done a day's work would not need 14 pages of legalese language to describe it. Madam President, again, I want to thank the agents with the CIA and the FBI that played a role in bringing this man back to the United States. They represent what is best about the country. But the immigration laws that allowed Mr. Kansi to get into this country and to stay here represent the worst. 
I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to tell my colleagues about a very special individual I met recently. Cody Groce is an active, healthy, intelligent 5-year-old from Elkin, NC, who plans on becoming a doctor when he grows up. His story seems like that of any young man, however, Cody is special because he was born with a serious birth defect. 
During a prenatal care visit Brenda Groce, Cody's mother, was told that the baby she was carrying had life-threatening urinary problems. At birth, Cody was admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit and had surgery to save his kidneys and his life. 
Cody is now healthy and busy sharing his story with people across the country as the National Ambassador for the March of Dimes. I met Cody in March when he came to visit my office to tell me about his story and this important legislation. 
There are 150,000 children, like Cody, that are born every year with a serious birth defect. And it is because of these children that we must pass S. 419, the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997. 
This legislation establishes a national, State-based, birth defects surveillance, research and prevention system to help us to find the causes of birth defects like Cody's and prevent them. Birth defects surveillance programs can count the number of babies born with birth defects and identify communities and/or populations with higher risks. In addition, this legislation develops education and prevention programs for birth defects with known causes. 
So, I ask my colleagues help my friend Cody and others like him by voting for S. 419, the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today that would modify the mandatory EBT legislation that was passed in 1996. 
Mr. President, in 1996, the Congress amended the Federal Financial Management Act of 1994--as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 1996, Public Law 104-134--to require that all Federal payments after January 1, 1999, be made by electronic funds transfer. 
The legislation I am introducing today would provide an exemption from that requirement for Social Security and veterans benefits, except that a recipient may send written notification to the agency head authorizing that such payments be made electronically. Thus, the legislation makes it optional for the vast majority of Federal beneficiaries, particularly retirees. 
This would affect nearly 20 million Social Security recipients who still receive their check through the mail. Also, nearly 40 percent of veterans benefits are still by mail. 
Mr. President, I have found that many retirees are unaware of this requirement, and do not desire to have their checks electronically deposited. 
Mr. President, these are not welfare checks. The Government should not force retirees to accept this mandate. 
In fact, AARP testified before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee last year, stating that `AARP believes that direct deposit of federal payments should remain optional for current payment recipients.' Further, AARP has found that Social Security recipients receiving checks by mail were clustered in a handful of States, including my home State of North Carolina. 
Mr. President, many people worked all of their lives for these benefits. They have the right to receive them. Many people served their country for these benefits. The very notion that they will be told where their benefits are being sent is abhorrent. Further, it has even been suggested that benefits could be withheld if persons do not choose a bank to receive a check. 
Mr. President, this is wrong. I am not opposed to direct deposit, but I am opposed to it being forced on people. I would urge the Senate to act soon on this legislation.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the American Farm Heritage and Small Business Preservation Act, and I am joined by the senior Senator from North Carolina. The act excludes the first $1.5 million of estate and gift assets from taxation, and it carries an effective date of January 1, 1998. 
The act will relieve the tax burden that befalls farmers and small businessmen upon the death of the proprietor. There is truth in the old axiom that farmers `live like paupers and die like kings,' and, in fact, the IRS reports that farmers face estate taxes six times more often than other Americans. 
There are numerous estate and gift tax relief bills in the congressional hopper. However, I favor a straightforward approach, and, rather than require some form of participation in the business operation for a fixed period of time--and thus permit the IRS to establish nebulous and complicated regulations--the American Farm Heritage and Small Business Preservation Act proposes a simple $1.5 million exclusion for all estates. 
The estate tax encourages the demise of the family farm and forces heirs to mortgage their agricultural heritage to the IRS. The estate tax is not a threat to just large farmers: some 20 percent of farms that report annual sales over $50,000 will trigger inheritance taxes. Indeed, the nature of a farm operation--75 percent of farm assets are nonliquid--complicates the difficulties inherent in the payment of estate taxes for farm families, and the financial structure of a farm thus further contributes to this erosion of our agricultural heritage. The average annual return on farm assets is just 4 percent, and the addition of mortgage obligations reduces the return to a mere 0.5 percent, so it is almost impossible for the next generation to continue to farm the family land. 
As metropolitan areas continue to grow and encroach upon the farms that sit outside these areas, the value of the farms increases, and it drives up the estate tax burden. This pattern forces heirs to sell the farmland to developers rather than continue their agricultural heritage. Further, the Agriculture Department estimates that 500,000 farmers will retire over the next two decades. The failure of the Congress to reduce the impact of estate taxes thus threatens the continued operation of almost one-quarter of the farms in the United States. 
I am thus committed to estate tax relief for American families. The IRS is a tax collection agency, not a board of directors, and Washington does not deserve a windfall from every funeral.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Responsive Government Act, and I am joined by the junior Senator from Nebraska, the senior Senator from Alabama, and the junior Senator from Arkansas. 
The Responsive Government Act proposes six simple, but important, reforms to make the Federal work force more responsive to the American people and their concerns. 
First, the Responsive Government Act will require all Federal agencies to include the telephone number of the writer on all official correspondence. 
Too often, people receive letters from Federal agencies that have a return address, but no telephone number. In today's busy world, not everyone has time to write a letter to respond to the reams of mail from Federal bureaucrats. 
Mr. President, there are few businesses that would send out a letter without a telephone number, and the Government should not be unaccountable to its customers. 
The act also requires Federal offices to provide a person--not an automated computer system--to answer the main telephone number at service-oriented offices. 
The Federal Government is here to serve the taxpayers. These Federal agencies should not greet taxpayers with a voice-mail system to screen their calls. 
Mr. President, the taxpayers are entitled to a voice on the other end of the line to assist them, not a machine that tells them to leave a message. 
The Responsive Government Act also requires Federal agencies to answer the telephones until 5 p.m. Too often, Mr. President, I hear constituents tell me that they just can't get Federal agencies to pick up the phone after 4. This just is not right. The Federal Government is too large, and, unfortunately, that means that citizens are forced into frequent contacts with Federal agencies. It should not be impossible to get in touch with Federal employees. 
It should be as easy to get in touch with them as with businesses. The Act also requires Federal agencies to publish their principal telephone numbers in the local directories. 
Of course, the blue pages list many Federal agencies, but not all of them. This is an important distinction. We need complete disclosure, Mr. President, and all agencies need to publish their numbers for the benefit of the public. 
These agencies also need to attempt to locate service-oriented offices in areas with sufficient parking. 
Too often, new agency offices are located in areas with limited public parking. There is often room for employee parking, but not for the public, and that cannot continue. 
Finally, Mr. President, the Responsive Government Act requires all Federal agencies to remove computer games from all Federal Government computers. 
These computers are for work, not fun, and the taxpayers are footing the bill for fun on the job. 
The Federal Government spent close to $20 billion last year on computer equipment and support services. These systems increase productivity in most cases. 
However, many of these computers are delivered already equipped with game programs, which reduce workers' efficiency and productivity. 
This legislation will prohibit the Federal Government from purchasing computers with preloaded game programs. 
These games, of course, decrease the productivity of Federal employees. 
In fact, a private-sector survey found that workers spent an average of 5.1 hours per week playing games and other non-job-related tasks on their computers. This translates into an annual $10 billion loss in productivity. 
Clearly, then, these games do not go unused. 
In fact, many of these games now come equipped with a boss key. 
This device lets the worker strike a single keystroke and transform the computer screen from the game to a false spreadsheet. The sole purpose of this device is to hide unproductive behavior from supervisors. 
Mr. President, there is no reason for the Federal Government to buy computers with programs designed to divert employees' attention from their jobs. 
This is a commonsense reform. 
Governor George Allen of Virginia and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich ordered workers to delete these game programs. I commend them for their actions. 
I ran for the Senate in 1992 because I wanted to bring some common sense--and private-sector experience--to Washington. 
I want to see a Federal Government that is responsive to the citizens. This bill addresses practices that would ruin private-sector businesses. 
There is no reason that Government should be less accountable to its customers.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, I take the floor to rise to discuss a serious issue, and my concern is this. The ink isn't even dry on this budget agreement and I have heard nothing, yesterday and today, but rumors that there are plans to change radically and have a major tax increase put into this agreement. Specifically, there is much talk, and it is far beyond rumor, of increasing the tobacco tax from 21 cents to 50 cents per pack, which would raise $15 to $30 billion a year. 
The problem is, of course, the tax cut in the budget plan is too small. But that is not news to anybody; it was always too small. The Republicans wanted to cut taxes by $188 billion. We now have a net tax cut of $50 billion, and that is to cover several initiatives such as capital gains, estate tax, and child credit. As I view choices, we should live by the budget agreement we passed in the Senate, and the one we want to pass. Now, if we can't do that, if there is some reason we cannot do that--and we want to cut taxes further, which I agree to--then there is a simple choice that it would be a wonderful thing if this body could learn--to cut spending, to spend less money. That is a wonderful alternative that we need to know about. Not every time we are short of money, raise taxes. 
If there is intent on the part of some of those who are having this discussion to change the budget agreement, I wonder why we are even having a budget resolution. What else are we going to change? Are we going to expand the deficit? Are we going to expand spending? Apparently we are. Is a deal not a deal? We either agree not to raise taxes any farther or we do not agree, and it looks like we do not agree. But I think it is an outrage that it is even under consideration at this point in the negotiations. 
When I came to the Senate I said I would never vote for a tax increase. I never have and I never will. We have plenty of money. We are spending it in too many places. 
We do not need a tax increase. Taxes are already too high. The average American works until mid-May to pay his or her taxes now. One-third of the money the average citizen earns goes to pay taxes. A tax increase of any kind is the last thing the working men and women of this country need now. What they truly need is a tax cut. 
But we say we are going after the tobacco industry, which really doesn't count, but when we drive the tobacco industry into bankruptcy, what product do we want to attack next? To each Senator, what product from your State will we decide to drive into bankruptcy? This is a Government that has an insatiable appetite for tax money--money of any kind, borrowed, taxes, there is never enough. 
The net tax cut in the budget resolution is only 1 percent of revenues over the next 5 years, a pretty minuscule amount. It is hardly a windfall. Yet, here we are before we even get the resolution passed and we are considering raising taxes. 
Again, I have to ask, what is the budget agreement for? Why do we even call it an agreement, if we fully intend to come back and rewrite it in the Finance Committee? Why debate it and argue over it on this floor when the real decision is going to be made in the Finance Committee? It is a waste of our time. 
The agreement is not worth the paper it is written on if we are going to haul it over into the Finance Committee and they are going to make the decision. 
Madam President, I can give every assurance that if the Finance Committee intends to raise taxes beyond what is called for in the budget resolution, passing this bill is going to be extremely difficult. I will say now, we are heading into dangerous territory in raising taxes. There is not support for it, even if it is on tobacco. This isn't a case of reading anybody's lips. We don't have to read lips. We can read the budget resolution. We don't need new taxes. I will forcefully oppose any kind of effort to increase them. Frankly, given that this is going on and has been for 2 days, I think the Senate is wasting its time on a budget resolution that will be rendered meaningless within a week. 
I thank you, Madam President, and I yield back any time I might have remaining. 
Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my good friend, colleague, and neighbor, Strom Thurmond. 
Mr. President, I cannot say much that has not already been said about Senator Thurmond. When I think about the life of Strom Thurmond, his life is literally a chapter of American history. 
Strom was born in 1902. This was the year before the Wright brothers did their first flight. He has lived through four wars, and was a war hero in one of them--World War II. He was at Normandy in June of 1944 when we liberated Europe. 
A funny and personal note, quickly: After I came to the Senate, Strom said to me on the floor one day, `What year were you born?' I told him I was born in 1928, which made me pretty old. He looked at me and said, `That was a good year. That was the year I was county superintendent of education.' So I felt young again. 
I congratulate him as the longest serving Senator in the history of the United States. I can think of no one more fitting than Strom Thurmond to hold this honor. He has devoted his entire adult life to serving the people of the United States and the people of South Carolina. 
He first became a State senator in 1933, which was a pretty long time ago. And he served as Governor from 1947 until 1951. He ran for President, and was a lot closer to being elected than most people realized. But, more appropriately, they elected him to the Senate in 1954 as a write-in candidate--so far as I know, the only write-in candidate ever elected to the Senate. And they have reelected him ever since, as both Democrat and Republican. 
As his neighbor from North Carolina, I say to all South Carolinians that they should be proud, and I know they are proud of Senator Thurmond. 
Senator Thurmond is a man of deep faith, and he truly has the courage of his convictions. In his long career, I have never heard anybody question his integrity or his dedication to public service. In this day and age of attack politics, Strom Thurmond is forever the gentleman. His manner should be a role model for aspiring politicians and Senators. 
Further, I can think of no one in the Senate who I would rather have as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He is a veteran, he is a war hero, and he is a man of unwavering integrity and commitment to the causes he believes in. And one of those principal causes is a strong national defense. He is a man of principles, and one of those principles, I again repeat, is a strong national defense. It is the one identifying characteristic, if no other, of Strom Thurmond. 
I know that he will not let anyone ever weaken the national defense system as long as he is chairman. And I hope he remains chairman for a long time to come. 
Mr. President, I thank Strom Thurmond for his service, and as a nation we thank Strom Thurmond for his service. Our veterans and men in uniform throughout the country are aware of what he has done, what he represents, and he still has the strong support of them. 
I look forward to continuing to serve with Senator Thurmond far into the future. 
I thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I reluctantly have to rise in opposition to this balanced budget agreement. 
Mr. President, this agreement will balance the budget in 5 years. But, we are already $5 trillion in debt. We can't wait 5 years. We can't go deeper into debt, just to spend more on domestic programs. 
In the last 40 years, the Government has grown too big--it is time for our national debt to get smaller. In fact, this budget could actually be balanced by the year 2000 rather than 2002, and still provide tax relief for working families, were it not for the first 3 years of higher spending which the President insisted upon. I want to commend my colleagues who negotiated with the President, and I have no doubt it was difficult to persuade the President to agree to a budget that ever achieves balance. But I simply cannot support the spending increases and tax increases in this budget. 
If this budget resolution is enacted, spending will grow--that's right, grow--by $267 billion over 5 years, rising from $1.622 trillion this year to $1.692 trillion in 1998, $1.753 trillion in 1999, $1.809 trillion in 2001, and $1.889 trillion in 2002. Under this budget deal, deficits will grow next year alone by 35 percent, from $67.2 billion to $90.4 billion. In fact, deficits will be above this year's level for each of the next 3 years. This budget deal allows spending to balloon over the next 3 years, and it does not begin to control spending until the year 2001, which of course will be after the end of the President's second term. 
In fact this agreement will actually produce the largest increase in social spending in the last 15 years. 
While we're spending at records levels, the agreement gives little in the way of tax relief. And much of the tax relief that is provided is really robbing Peter to pay Paul. The agreement includes a gross tax cut of $135 billion, but let's take another look at that so-called tax cut. If you look elsewhere in the agreement, you'll see that it actually includes $50 billion in new tax increases, including $34 billion in tax increases from the airport and airway trust fund tax. 
In addition, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will adjust the Consumer Price Index downward by 0.25 percent. That's another $6 billion in tax increases. In other words we are cutting taxes with one hand, and raising them with another, so the Government can keep spending and deficits can keep growing. 
Most of the deficit reduction in this bill comes not from tough choices and policy changes that control Government spending, but from rosey-scenario assumptions made by economists. We are assuming that economic growth will be strong enough, and inflation will be low enough that all the hard choices will be taken care off for us. In fact, 99 cents out of every dollar of deficit reduction in this bill is simply assumed. As my good friend, Senator Gramm has noted, only 1 cent out of every dollar, or $3 billion out of $350 billion, comes from changes in public policy. 
Congress and the President should tell the American people the hard truth about the Nation's deficit. A balanced budget requires hard choices. It cannot be achieved simply by wishing it away. 
Even though I cannot support this budget agreement, I must note that this is perhaps the best agreement that could be achieved, considering that we have been negotiating with a President who is dedicated to increasing the size of the Federal Government. 
In fact, I find it very instructive to compare this budget agreement with the budget produced in 1993, when the President and a Democratic Congress unveiled their own budget plan. That 1993 budget raised taxes by $241 billion, provided absolutely no net tax relief, and never achieved balance, but continued deficit spending as far as the eye could see. The Clinton budget of 1993 provided spending reductions of $193 billion, as against a net total of $241 billion of tax increases. The current balanced budget agreement of 1997 provides $320 billion of spending reductions, and gives the American people a net total of $85 billion in tax relief. 
Without the current balanced budget agreement, it is likely that the Federal Government would face another Government shutdown. This agreement should prevent that from happening. 
Is this a perfect agreement? No, it is not. Unfortunately, no agreement which attempts to reconcile a philosophy of tax and spend Government growth with one of tax relief and fiscal restraint is likely to be perfect. Perhaps it is the best that can be achieved under this President. 
Although it is perhaps the best that Congress can get from this President, the Nation deserves much better, and for that reason I plan to vote against the budget agreement. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to voice strong opposition to this amendment because it simply is another tax on the American family. It is a tax increase, Mr. President, nothing more. 
This is a $30 billion solution to a far less expensive problem. The budget agreement already sets aside $16 billion over 5 years for children's health insurance. That will extend coverage to 5 million uninsured children. 
Further, there are 3 million children that are now covered under Medicaid who, quite simply, have not yet been signed up. There are estimates of 2 million more uninsured children, and, of course, they can be covered for far less than $30 billion. Consequently, Mr. President, this $30 billion tax package is nothing more than an old-fashioned tax increase. 
We sit here and we hear it is a great opportunity. 
However, Mr. President, has there ever been a tax increase that was not an opportunity to further gouge the working people of this country? Sure, it is always good politics to give a speech about tobacco, and the cameras love it. But this vote is not about tobacco, Mr. President, it is about a tax increase. It is not about children, Mr. President, it is about another tax increase on the American people. 
I remember sitting in the House Chamber at President Clinton's State of the Union Address in 1995. He said that `the era of big Government is over.' The President campaigned for a middle-class tax cut in 1992 and 1996. 
I recall that we insisted that Government live within its means. I remember that the people wanted less Government, not more. That is what the election was about. We told them we would balance the budget and cut taxes. 
Mr. President, nobody campaigned on a $30 billion tax increase, but we did campaign to cut taxes. The President did, too. This tax increase would reduce the net tax cut to $55 billion. That is not the tax cut that we promised the American people. We promised to do better, and we can do better. The American people deserve better than a watered down tax cut. We give with one hand and we take with the other. 
This $30 billion tax increase is not the sole cost to the American people of this bill. No, Mr. President, the costs go farther. Tobacco is used in the calculation of the Consumer Price Index. Since the tax will increase the cost of tobacco, the Consumer Price Index will rise, too. A portion of the Federal budget is based upon the Consumer Price Index. This will have an impact of $4 billion over 5 years. This is $1.4 billion over 5 years in lost Federal tax revenue, lost revenue, and another $2.6 billion over 5 years in increased expenditures due to the CPI rise. 
This is a plan that attaches a $30 billion tax increase to an unfunded mandate no less. It will force additional costs upon the States. Not only will it cost the States more money, it is going to dry up one of their major sources of revenue, tobacco tax revenues. This $30 billion tax increase will reduce sales, and that drop will reduce the tax revenues to the States by $6.5 billion. 
The first bill we passed in 1995 was the Unfunded Mandate Reform Act. It passed the Senate with 86 votes. But this is simply an unfunded mandate coming around the backside disguised as something else. 
It is like all of these new programs that come out of Washington. At first the Federal Government picks up a major portion of it. However, when the costs of the new program rise, the States will be responsible for the ever-growing difference between the Federal Government share and the program costs. 
The entire proposal is just another unfunded mandate, a new law thrust upon the States, and one not paid for in Washington. 
This amendment places more than 30 new mandates on participating States. Thirty new mandates. It requires all State plans to be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services. This means more big Government, more bureaucracy. If States fund abortions through their Medicaid Program, for example, this will force them to pay for abortions for teenagers that come in under this new program. The States cannot set up two different sets of benefits. 
Like every other Federal program, the costs will go through the roof, and the taxpayers will be left holding the bag to pay the bill. 
Why? So we can run back home and tell people we stood up against tobacco. We will not go back and tell them that we levied a $30 billion new tax on them and drove some farmers from the land. We were strong. We stood up against tobacco. 
But this is the type of unfunded mandate that we were supposed to stop with S. 1 in 1995. But just 2 years after we passed it, here we go around the back to pass another mandate on the States. And that is simply what this is. 
Mr. President, I also hear some grumbling about the small tax cuts in this budget package. I think the tax cuts are too small for working families, of course, but some of the grumbling comes from Senators who are concerned about the `distribution' of the tax cut. Mr. President, the cigarette tax is the most regressive tax on the Federal books. 
Families making under $30,000 per year earn 16 percent of the national family income. They pay slightly over 1 percent of the Federal income taxes. But they pay 47 percent of the tobacco excise tax. This bill increase taxes on families making less than $30,000. We are going to increase their taxes by $230 a year. 
If we were thinking about putting a tax increase on families making less than $30,000 a year from any other source than tobacco, the Senate would rise up in righteous revolution. Yet, under the guise of getting the tobacco farmers, so many of them acquiesced. 
These taxes are so regressive that high- and low-income families pay almost exactly the same amount of tax rather than the same rate of tax. 
This is the most regressive tax on the books. I find it odd that some of the biggest supporters are the same people preaching equity in the tax relief package. If ever there was an inequitable tax, this is it, but I don't hear their complaints. 
Mr. President, we have a plan that raises taxes by $30 billion, and changes the Consumer Price Index to result in $1.4 billion in lost Federal revenues, and $2.6 billion in increased Federal spending. It reduces State tax revenues by $6.5 billion, and it wipes out 30,000 jobs, which means hardship and pain for families across the South. 
So, in an attempt to insure 2 million children, we are looking at a $40 billion package. 
I support efforts to bring coverage to these children, but this is not the right approach, and the taxpayers deserve a seat at the table here. 
I ran for the Senate and promised the people of my State that I would not vote for any tax increase under any circumstances at any time for anything. I intend to live by my commitment and to oppose this massive tax increase and assault on North Carolina farm families with all the strength within me. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on education. I usually don't agree with the President on policy. However, this is one occasion where I do agree. The President in this year's State of the Union Address, proposed that billions be spent on education in his `Call to Action for American Education.' One of the principles in this plan is his hope scholarship proposal. President Clinton proposes 2 years of a $1,500-a-year for college tuition, enough to pay for the typical community college. 
I agree that we should give every adult American the opportunity to obtain the first 2 years of higher education. On January 21, I introduced S. 50 which provides for a $1,500-a-year tax credit for students attending two-year schools. S. 50 has the cosponsorship of the majority leader, Senator Lott, and Senators Connie Mack, Lary Craig, Harry Reid and Jim Jeffords. Just last week, at the Republican National Committee annual dinner, House Speaker Newt Gingrich listed vocational training as one of the four top priorities for our budget resolution.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to now speak very briefly on Senator Gramm's amendment. 
I think he has just reached to the heart of Government spending, and he did it very succinctly. There is $76 billion more that the President discovered he needed because by some mathematical manipulation we decided we had $76 billion more to spend. We discovered $76 billion; we spend $76 billion. Now, if we had discovered $176 billion, guess how much the President would have needed? $176 billion. 
I just want to say that I strongly support the amendment of the Senator from Texas. I intend to speak on it further later. But I at this moment enthusiastically support it and will continue to speak on it at a later time when we have time. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. As the recent debate on this issue illustrates, this is not simply an issue of a woman's `right to choose' whether or not to have a child. It is also an issue of protecting the life of an unborn child. However much we may disagree about whether life begins at conception, when it comes to late term abortions, we are clearly talking about a baby. And therefore, it is entirely reasonable to place restrictions on such abortions, especially when the procedure in question is as barbaric--and as unnecessary--as this one. 
Last September 26, when the Senate was debating whether or not to override President Clinton's veto of this measure, the Wall Street Journal made the same point in this way: 
Up till now the abortion debate, if you'll pardon the metaphor, has managed to ignore the 800-pound gorilla in the room. For the first time, people are also talking about the fetus, not about women alone. A fetus may or may not be human, but on the other hand, it's not nothing. At 20 weeks of gestation, when the partial-birth abortion debate begins, a fetus is about nine inches long and is clearly becoming human. 
Opponents of the effort to ban this procedure based their argument largely on claims about the relative safety and medical necessity of this procedure which we now know to be false. We all know by now about the admission by Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, that he lied through [his] teeth about the frequency of and justification for this procedure. And even the doctor who invented the procedure has admitted that 80 percent of these procedures he has performed were purely elective. In other words, they were not performed to preserve either the life or the health of the mother. 
Mr. President, the majority of Americans agree that abortion on demand--at any time during pregnancy, for any reason--is wrong. Even a majority of people who describe themselves as pro-choice believe it is reasonable to restrict abortion under some circumstances. It is time we decided where to draw that line. This is certainly a good place to draw it.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I urge my fellow Members of the Senate to support the legislation being introduced today by my distinguished colleague from North Carolina, Senator Helms--the Safe Schools Act of 1997. 
Urgent calls for more and more Federal money for schools to pay for everything from school construction to Internet access are misplaced. I would argue they are misplaced in any case, because decisions about how a school district should allocate its resources are better left at the local and State level. But they are certainly misplaced without a primary commitment to reducing school violence. 
Students cannot learn effectively unless they feel safe. It was hard enough to learn in the days when I was in school with the normal distractions--the occasional spitball or gum-smacking student. Now some students worry about whether they will even survive to graduate from high school. 
My colleagues have noted the results of several studies which confirm the very strong correlation between school violence and illegal drug use. And we already know the cost illegal drugs have exacted in terms of ruined lives and the breakdown of families. Yet in the past year we have seen two States, California and Arizona, pass laws to legalize the so-called medicinal use of drugs like marijuana, heroin, and LSD. That is why I introduced the Drug Use Prevention Act to impose strict penalties on doctors who prescribe marijuana. As my colleague has noted, a San Francisco Federal judge has recently overruled such penalties. But that particular debate is far from over yet. 
Many Americans have concluded that the ground lost in recent years in the war on drugs is not recoverable, that the war is lost. I disagree. Too much is at stake to simply surrender the fight, especially when it comes to providing a safe environment for students in public schools. At the very least, schools should not receive Federal funds unless they refuse to tolerate the presence of drugs as well as firearms on school property.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I have agreed not to offer an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill regarding a radio station in my State, because I am told that a point of order may be raised against it. But, Mr. President, I will continue to probe this matter further. I intend to request documents from the FCC on this issue. Further, I think that the Commerce Committee should hold a hearing to investigate the irregularities concerning this case. 
Mr. President, in 1987, Zeb Lee and his family attempted to get a new FM station license in Asheville, NC. At the time, Mr. Lee had owned and operated a successful AM station in the area for 40 years. 
By all accounts, Mr. Lee has been a model citizen and a model radio station operator, this is in stark contrast to a lot of what is taking place on radio today. 
In 1993, a full 6 years later, Mr. Lee was awarded the station on a temporary basis, beating out 12 other applicants. Several of his competitors were found to be unqualified. In fact, one lied about his ability to operate a station. Another lied about his heritage in order to obtain a minority preference. 
Pending final approval, Mr. Lee was required by the FCC to sell his AM station and to begin constructing a new FM tower. In reliance on the Government, he did both. A week after Zeb Lee was on the air, the FCC issued a public notice freezing all licensing proceedings affected by the Bechtel versus FCC case. 
In an unusual move, in 1996, the full FCC Board reversed all previous decisions and awarded temporary operating authority to the four opponents of Zeb Lee in the original application process. The four opponents were acting as a group by this time. 
Mr. President, here we are, 10 years later--and Mr. Lee is still fighting his case with the FCC. He was on the air for 3 years--only to be told by the FCC that he would now be taken off the air, once his opponents could go on. 
Mr. President, this is a highly unusual case. This was the only station, affected by the Bechtel case, where the initial decision was reserved. Furthermore, the FCC has never issued final regulations pursuant to the Bechtel case. 
And what did the four opponents who got the radio station do with the new license--they have shopped for another buyer. 
The four opponents have now turned over their temporary license to a large out of state radio company. 
The fact of the matter is that the opponents in the licensing process had no intention of running a radio station. They only hope was that Zeb Lee would buy them off--in other words pay `blackmail.' If that did not work--and they did win the radio station--they would transfer those rights for a big profit. 
Mr. President, this process is wrong. It is deeply flawed. 
Any bureaucratic process that takes 10 years, by itself is an outrage. 
But the process that bankrupts an 80 year old man is truly wrong. 
If he losses the station, the end result will be that a family owned radio business, located in Asheville area for 40 years, will have lost the radio license in a deeply flawed process. 
His four opponents never had any intention of operating a radio station, they only wanted to flip the license to a larger company. 
This is wrong, and it must stop. 
Mr. President, my amendment would have provided that Zeb Lee could continue to operate his station for a period of 6 more months. This would allow the Congress to review this matter. It would allow us to get to the bottom of what the FCC is doing. 
We have to make certain that this process has been fair and even handed, but quite frankly, judging from the facts, there have been serious problems with this entire issue. 
Mr. President, in conclusion, I can assure all the citizens in Asheville that I will continue to pursue this matter with vigor.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleague from North Carolina, Senator Helms, and 12 other Senators to introduce the First Flight Commemorative Coin Act. This revenue-neutral legislation instructs the Treasury Secretary to mint coins in commemoration of the Wright Brothers' historic 1903 flight on the North Carolina coast. 
Mr. President, in the cold morning hours of December 17, 1903, a small crown watched the Wright Flyer lift off the flat landscape of Kitty Hawk. Orville Wright traveled just 120 feet--less than the wingspan of a Boeing 747--in his 12-second flight. It was, however, the first time that a manned machine sailed into the air under its own power. The residents of Kitty Hawk, then an isolated fishing village, thus bore witness to the realization of the centuries-old dream of flight. 
The significance of the Wright Brothers' flight reaches far beyond its status as the first flight. Their flight represented the birth of aviation. On that morning, aeronautics moved from untested theory to nascent science, and it triggered a remarkable technological evolution. In fact, just 24 years after their fragile craft rose unsteadily and took to the air, Charles Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic Ocean. In 1947, less than half a century after the pioneer 31 m.p.h. flight over Kitty Hawk, Chuck Yeager shattered the sound barrier over the Mojave Desert. 
The rapid aeronautical progression, which the Wright Brothers initiated on that December morning in Kitty Hawk, is, of course, remarkable. Mr. President, it was just 66 years after the Wright Brothers' 120-foot flight--a timespan equivalent to the age of many Members of this body--that Neil Armstrong traveled 240,000 miles to plant the American flag on the moon. Today, some 86,000 planes lift off from American airports on a daily basis, and air travel is routine. It was with a sprinkling of onlookers, however, that the Wright Brothers ushered in the age of flight on that cold winter morning in Kitty Hawk. 
The site of the first flight, at the foot of Kill Devil Hill, was initially designated as a national memorial in 1927 and is visited by close to a half-million people each year. 
I think that First Flight Commemorative Coin Act is a most appropriate tribute to the Wright Brothers as the centennial anniversary of the first flight approaches. The coin will be minted in $10, $1, and 50 denominations, and its sales will fund educational programs and improvements to the visitor center at the memorial. These commemorative coins are struck to celebrate important historical events, and, of course, the proceeds are an important revenue source to the custodians of these legacies. The centennial anniversary of the Wright Brothers' flight merits our observance. 
Mr. President, because all of the funds raised under this legislation will be used to, build, repair or refurbish structures all within a national park, I have added an exemption to the mintage levels as required by coin reform legislation last year. Nevertheless, so that coin collectors can enjoy some certainty that the coin will be of value in the future, the Mint can reduce the mintage levels as it deems necessary.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I want to make clear, that had the Senate taken a rollcall vote on Senator Hutchinson's amendment to Senator Feingold's amendment, I would have voted no on the Hutchinson amendment. I want our troops home as soon as possible, and I am strongly supportive of any effort to bring them home as quickly as possible. 
The President promised that our troops would be home in December 1996. He clearly mislead the Congress and the American people when he made this promise. 
Only after the election was over did the President make his decision to extend our troop deployment, even though he knew full well that our troops would not be coming home in December, well before the election. 
The Bosnian mission is going to cost the taxpayers of this country $6.5 billion. The question is what will be changed after our troops have been there this long, and we have spent this amount of money. I contend that little will be changed. When the deployment was made, a principle question was whether the United States had an exit strategy. It now appears that we may have no exit. 
Again, I was strongly supportive of the Feingold amendment, and I would have liked to have seen it passed without change.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I felt compelled to speak today on behalf of S. 562 which I support as a cosponsor. It is a good bill and apparently long overdue. This legislation provides protections to homeowners who are receiving reverse mortgages by ensuring that there are no unnecessary or excessive costs charged for obtaining the mortgage. 
I state that this bill is apparently overdue because of the horrendous stories we have heard about the elderly being charged outrageous fees simply to find out information about the reverse mortgage program. Because the reverse mortgage program is only available to individuals over 62 years of age, these so-called scam artists are preying on older citizens who typically are cash-poor and in need of additional dollars, sometimes for health care costs or home improvements. 
A reverse mortgage is a loan that works backwards. It is beneficial for those who are house-rich but cash-poor. Instead of receiving a lump-sum amount that must be repaid in monthly installments, the homeowner gets to borrow money based on the equity in his home and nothing has to be repaid until the owner moves or dies. When the home is sold, the loan, along with the accrued interest, is repaid from the proceeds. 
Some of the estate planning companies who provide information on the reverse mortgage have been charging referral fees of up to 10 percent of the amount of the loan that is eventually taken out by the individual. The exorbitant fees being charged are outrageous. These companies have been preying on our country's older citizens, and this practice must be stopped. 
Just a few weeks ago, the Secretary of HUD, Andrew Cuomo, attempting to halt these practices, issued a departmental directive preventing lenders who insure loans through the FHA from dealing with the referral companies. However, just 10 days after the announcement of HUD's directive, a Federal judge here in Washington set the directive aside awaiting further hearing. While some of the mortgage originators have indicated that they have stopped dealing with the estate planning firms by their own initiative, many of us in the Senate want better safeguards. 
Senate bill 562 ensures that the practice of charging exorbitant fees in the reverse mortgage program are halted by doing two things. One, the bill requires that all fees and costs associated with the reverse mortgage program be disclosed to the homeowner. Two, the bill gives authority to the Secretary of HUD to ensure that the homeowner does not pay any unnecessary or excessive costs for obtaining the mortgage. This would include any costs of estate planning, financial advice, or other related services. S. 562 does not set prices or products in the reverse mortgage program, it only acts as a safeguard from excessive costs. 
I am proud to say that my State is home to the largest servicer of the FHA reverse mortgage. Wendover Funding, a Greensboro based mortgage banker, is the Nation's largest wholesale lender and administrator of these loans. Wendover currently services more than 11,500 reverse mortgages, representing approximately 60 percent of the market. Of these, Wendover has funded more than 400 loans to seniors in North Carolina. 
Many believe that FHA's involvement provided much-needed consumer protection to the reverse-mortgage industry. Lenders who make FHA-backed loans have to abide by strict rules on rates and set-up fees and can't charge any hidden fees to make extra money. Unfortunately, some of the estate planning companies who refer the borrowers to the FHA lenders have not had the same restrictions put upon them. 
The several unscrupulous companies that have scammed thousands of unnecessary and exorbitant fees from elderly citizens have forced this Congress to act. The protections placed in S. 562 will ensure that senior citizens are no longer taken advantage of when they are looking at this new source of income. Our grandparents, as they face longer years of needed income and want to stay in their homes, will be able to do so and still be protected. 
Thank you Mr. President. I urge my colleagues support.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am here today to join the Senator from Georgia in letting the American people know what a costly and dangerous paragraph the President of this country has proposed on behalf of the labor unions, its bosses. What I am referring to is the President's Executive order, first announced to great applause by Vice President Gore before a recent gathering of union bosses. It would force all contractors doing business with the Federal Government to be unionized. To be specific, Clinton has issued an Executive order in draft form--he hasn't issued the order--which would require that anybody that sells goods to the Federal Government become a party to a labor agreement--in plain language, become a unionized closed-shop company. These agreements are nothing more than a clever device proposed and written by the union bosses that all contractors would have to be unionized if you do business with the Federal Government. 
Now, this is a union-only mandate for anyone who sells to the Federal Government. But that isn't as far as it goes--not by a long way. These agreements would force the contractor to have a union, but, in turn, it would force anybody he buys from to have a union. Anybody that sold him a pencil would have to be a union contractor, if it were going to be used in Government business. So 13 million people, as Senator Gramm said, would be forced to join unions. But I think it would run a lot more than that because this thing goes to the ultimate end of who would have to join the union. Big fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite them, and little fleas have lesser fleas. So this would go down to the ultimate end of who would have to join a union to comply with this proposed order. 
Now, Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO, said, `In any given year, Federal contracts total as much as $200 billion, and Federal contractors employ one-fifth of the Nation's work force.' And with great glee, he says, `If properly implemented . . .'--referring to President Clinton's order--`. . . it would affect hundreds of billions of dollars every year.' What he could have said and didn't say, but was thinking, is: Think of the money that it will bring into the unions and how much more money we will have to play with. 
What we are talking about is the President, by the stroke of a pen, changing the laws of this country. Government contracts have always been awarded on the basis of the low bidder and the company that was capable of doing the job. Unions have never held a special claim to Government contracts. But, under this, everybody else would be excluded and the unions would be totally in charge. 
What we are saying is that all of the $200 billion the Federal Government spends would go to 20 percent of the work force, or probably a much smaller percentage than that; probably closer to 10 percent of the work force in this country is unionized. And to the other 85 to 90 percent, we would say: Tough luck, you simply don't qualify. You pay the taxes and keep working, but any Government contracts will go to union members only. 
Now, the General Accounting Office has said that union labor will run the price of a contract up 20 percent or more. I think they, very simply, underestimated the amount. That is certainly a low figure, that 20 percent of the cost will be added to every Federal contract because of this requirement. 
I am troubled by the fact that no committee of Congress has had the opportunity to review proposed language. There have been no hearings. None of the millions and millions--13 million-plus--of American workers who are going to be affected by this mandate have had an opportunity--or their representatives--to be heard on it. The President has shown no interest in the American people or in what they think. He is simply putting a proposal up as a payback to the unions. It is just simply that. He has not submitted it to Congress, and from what it would appear, he doesn't plan to. If he wants to do it, this is the place he needs to do it--bring it before the Congress and then see what happens to it. It would pass through the normal checks and balances between the Congress and the administration. The Congress is bypassed and this would impose unions on businesses across the country, without the American people or the Congress having anything to say about it. 
As the Senator from Georgia has so eloquently stated, in America, we didn't elect a President to rule by decree. My State of North Carolina is a right-to-work State. I am sure that nonunion employees in North Carolina would be forced to become unionized because of what the President has done. They would have to join a union. I understand that the checks and balances may be inconvenient to the President. He would rather do it by decree. But that system has served us well--the system of checks and balances--for over 200 years. The proposed Executive order is a payback to the labor union bosses, who spent hundreds of millions of dollars on behalf of the President in last year's election, and who do not want to subject their plans for American workers and employers to congressional scrutiny. They know it would lose in 
the Congress. 
I am opposed to compulsory unionism. No worker should be forced to join a union, and no employer should be forced by the Federal Government to be unionized as a condition of doing business with the Federal Government--particularly, not by an Executive decree that has never seen the light of day in the Congress of the United States, or given the Members of the Congress an opportunity to oppose it or to speak on it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 522, The Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure to stop IRS employees from electronically browsing through taxpayer files. 
Mr. President, today is not a day when most Americans feel much sympathy for the IRS. For many Americans finishing up their tax returns, the last several days have been painful ones, with families struggling to understand and fill out complex forms, writing checks to the IRS and wondering where all the money they send to Washington actually goes. 
And it doesn't help to see recent news accounts of the $4 billion of the taxpayers money has been wasted by the IRS in an effort to modernize its computer system--without success. That's nearly enough money to pay for our troops in Bosnia, and for continued disaster relief to areas of the country damaged by floods and storms, including areas of North Carolina still suffering from the effects of Hurricane Fran. 
And so, Mr. President, today is not a good day for the American people to be told of yet another outrage at the IRS. As many as 211 million Americans who file tax returns this year will pay over $1.6 trillion in taxes. That is outrage enough. Quite frankly, the American people are overtaxed, and I hope that we can provide them some tax relief this year. 
As complicated and burdensome as our Tax Code has become, the vast majority of taxpayers fill out their tax forms honestly and completely. In fact, our entire system of tax collection depends on the voluntary compliance of the American people. Much of the information contained in these tax returns is extremely private and sensitive. Taxpayers have a right to expect that this information will be treated with the greatest of care. 
For that reason, I was deeply troubled by the results of the recent investigation of the Internal Revenue Service by the General Accounting Office which has prompted this hearing. The GAO has uncovered at least 1,515 cases where IRS employees have used Government computers to browse through the private tax files of Americans--without authorization. 
According to the GAO, this is not the first time that IRS employees have been caught peeking in on private tax files. In 1993 and 1994, the GAO discovered that more than 1,300 IRS employees had used Government computers to electronically browse through tax records. At that time, the Commissioner of the IRS announced a new zero tolerance policy for such behavior. 
Unfortunately, zero tolerance has been more like zero improvement. According to the GAO, little has changed since this problem was first identified in 1993. IRS employees are still snooping into tax files without proper authorization. The system put in place by the IRS to fix the problem and detect unauthorized browsing--the Electronic Audit Research Log, or EARL--can't even tell the difference between browsing and legitimate work. 
To make matters worse, an IRS internal audit found that many employees who were caught browsing did not believe that snooping in taxpayers' files is wrong, and perhaps even more troubling, they thought there would be little or no consequence to them if they were caught. 
I am concerned that we can't count on the senior management of the IRS to supervise their employees. In fact, I am concerned about the supervisors themselves, and I wonder who is watching them. I find news accounts that the IRS may be conducting politically motivated audits of selected nonprofit organizations deeply troubling. 
Mr. President, the IRS has demonstrated that it cannot adequately supervise its own employees to protect the privacy of the American people. Stronger measures are clearly needed. That is why I am a cosponsor of of S. 522, The Taxpayer Browsing Protection Act offered by my good friend, Senator Coverdell. I join my colleagues in support of the measure. 
Mr. President, due to a prior family commitment, I was unavoidably detained and missed the vote on S. 522. Had I been present I would have voted `aye.'

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I take the floor today to discuss an issue that is serious and becoming more serious every year, and that is the pitiful state of our legal system. It is becoming harder and harder and harder to convict anybody of anything. You can catch them on tape, film them committing the crime, and then you will probably lose it; they will be found not guilty. No amount of evidence seems to be sufficient anymore. I think we have reached this sorry and pitiful state because we have basically let the system be controlled by lawyers. When you control the legal system by lawyers, you are simply asking a thermostat to set itself. Defense lawyers are twisting and bending common sense to let the guilty go free, and they are aided by judges--in many cases, hand-picked by the trial lawyers. The lawyers pick the judges. 
At every turn, you have lawyers controlling a system that makes no common sense, except to serve one purpose, which is for their benefit. 
The most recent example I can think of is the glaring stupidity involving the Oklahoma bombing case. First, it has taken 2 years to bring it to court when the man was caught the day after he did it. Now, many taxpayers are appalled by the very fact that they are paying for McVeigh's defense--they are paying for it. They think that is reprehensible. But they don't realize how much they are paying. If they did, they would rise up and revolt. It is not just the defense of McVeigh; it is gold-plated from one end to the other. He has 14--14--expensive lawyers defending him that the working people of this country are paying for--14 of them. His chief lawyer, Mr. Jones, says that it will cost $50 million to defend him. That is his estimate. Now, anybody that has ever had a lawyer knows they never come in with a low estimate. They are estimating $50 million to defend him. This is absolutely offensive to every taxpayer in this country, and it should be. But this is a typical example of a legal system that is out of control. 
Now, to defend Mr. McVeigh because he blew up the building in Oklahoma City, his lawyers have traveled literally all over the world. They have been from Kansas, where he rented the truck, to Jericho. I don't know why he would have been there. They have been to the Philippines. These lawyers are traveling at taxpayers' expense. They have been all over Italy. They have covered every country in Europe and gone to the West Bank. Nobody knows what they are searching for--maybe for the real killer, or maybe just enjoying travel at taxpayers' expense. While they have the killer, they are always looking for another one. The taxpayers have paid for a TV and VCR for Mr. McVeigh so he can review the evidence. 
Mr. President, to add insult to injury and outrage to outrage, they moved the trial. So now we, the working people of this country, are paying $50,000 a week--$50,000 a week--for the living expenses of his lawyers. When you start talking about the working people, $50,000 every week for the living expenses of his lawyers--they spent $0.5 million to remodel the courtroom in Denver for his trial. They couldn't try him at home. They had to move it to Denver and we spent $0.5 million getting the courtroom ready for him. 
The victims of his crime have had to travel hundreds of miles from Oklahoma to Denver in hopes that they see that he gets justice. They are paying for the defense of the man that killed their children. They are also having to pay for their own room, board and lodging in Denver. Plus they are paying $50,000 for his lawyers' lodging and board in Denver. There is no end to it. 
How many times do the victims of this crime, or any crime, have to be made victims again by the very judicial system that they are paying for? We will be paying for McVeigh's trial long from now in the form of interest on the debt and the money we borrow to give him $50 million for his lawyers. 
It would be my thought that if McVeigh didn't have the money for his gold-plated defense, he should not have blown up the building in the first place. 
Mr. President, I suggest that there are a number of things we could do, and we need to start fixing a system that is broke. And it is broken bad. We need to change the law that allows criminals to get the best defense that taxpayers can pay for. That is exactly what they are getting. I am going to propose legislation putting a cap on the Federal Defender Program. 
I would like to cap what McVeigh is getting right now. But that will be appealed for years and years. As long as we pay the lawyers, they will keep appealing for Mr. McVeigh. So he will be out there far into the future with the people's money. The $50 million figure will run into $75 million before we get through hearing about him. We need a comprehensive overhaul of the legal system, and it needs to be done by nonlawyers. We need to overhaul the legal system and not let a single lawyer be involved in the overhaul. We need a national commission composed of nonlawyers to review the judicial system and provide some commonsense solutions to the problem, and it needs to be made up of homemakers, regular people, business people, truck drivers, and people who would bring some practicality to it and not lawyers who would continue to feather their own nest. 
I think we need a victim's rights amendment to our Constitution. Over the last 40 years liberal judges have turned our Constitution into the `Criminal Protection Act.' The purpose of the last 40 years is to make sure that every criminal is coddled, pampered, and looked after in a very proper manner. It is time for it to stop, and the Constitution has to protect victims as well. 
Mr. President, I know that many Senators share what I am talking about and are frustrated by what we see. I think we need to start on legal reform, and I think we do need to do it soon. 
The first thing that will be said is, `If you start it, the President will veto it.' Well, let him veto it. I think the American people need to know where the President stands. So if he wants to veto it, let him do it. If the President says that the regular people of this country--or if he chooses sides with Ivy League lawyers that never got a murder case that they couldn't appeal, it is time to bring the practicality and the common sense of the American people into the legal system and take it out of the hands of the lawyers. The very idea of $50 million to defend McVeigh--$50 million, 14 lawyers. Anybody who would tell me that that isn't an absolutely out-of-control system simply has lost all common sense themselves. 
It is time we put an end to it. I intend to introduce legislation that will do so. 
Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, yesterday I voted `no' on the nomination of Merrick Garland to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
In so voting, I take no position on the personal qualifications of Mr. Garland to be a Federal appeals court judge. What I do take a position on is that the vacant 12th seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit does not need to be filled. Senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, has examined this issue thoroughly, and has determined that the court's workload does not justify the existence of the 12th seat. Last Congress, Senator Grassley introduced legislation to abolish this unneeded seat. By proceeding to renominate Mr. Garland, President Clinton has flatly ignored this uncontradicted factual record. 
I commend Senator Grassley for his important work on this matter, as well as Senator Jeff Sessions, who has also emphasized the importance of this matter. With the Federal deficit at an all time high, we should always be vigilant in looking for all opportunities to cut wasteful government spending; this is one such opportunity. After all, each unnecessary circuit judge and his or her staff cost the taxpayer at least $1 million a year. 
Lastly, our vote yesterday is an important precedent, since it marks the beginning of the Senate's new commitment to hold rollcall votes on all judicial nominees. This is a policy change which I had urged on my Republican colleagues by letter of January 8, 1997, to the Republican Conference. Voting on Federal judges, who serve for life and who exert dramatic--mostly unchecked--influence over society, should be one of the most important aspects of serving as a U.S. Senator. Rollcall votes will, I believe, impress upon the individual judge, the individual Senator, and the public the importance of just what we are voting on. I hope that my colleagues will regard this vote, and every vote they take on a Federal judge, as being among the most important votes they will ever take.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I join with my good friend, Senator Coverdell to introduce the National Right to Work Act of 1997. This is the same legislation that I introduced during the 104th Congress, and I am delighted to have Senator Coverdell as a partner in this effort during the 105th Congress. 
As I have said before, and continue to believe strongly, compulsory unionism violates the fundamental principle of individual liberty--the very principle upon which this Nation was founded. Compulsory unionism basically says that workers cannot and should not decide for themselves what is in their best interest. I can think of nothing more offensive to the core American principles of liberty and freedom. 
The National Right to Work Act will address this most fundamental problem of federal labor policy: does America believe that working men and women should be forced, as a condition of employment, to pay dues or fees to a labor union? I believe, as does my colleague, Senator Coverdell and many others, that no one should be forced to pay union dues just to get or keep a job. 
The National Right to Work Act would not change a single word of Federal law. Rather, the measure would repeal those sections of the National Labor Relations Act and Railway Labor Act that authorize the imposition of forced-dues contracts on working Americans. I believe that every worker must have the right to join or support a labor union. This bill protects that right. However, no worker should be forced to join a union. 
In 1965, Senator Everett Dirksen said of compulsory unionism, `Is there a more fundamental right than to make a living for one's family without being compelled to join a labor organization?' I could not agree more. 
Mr. President, again let me say that I am pleased to introduce today with Senator Coverdell the National Right to Work Act of 1977.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the constitutional amendment we are debating today. 
Frankly, I think this amendment is very dangerous. 
It is dangerous anytime you tinker with the first amendment, our right to freedom of speech. 
I suppose what is most appalling to me is that we have the tenacity to even consider this amendment. Two weeks ago, the Senate could not muster the fortitude to pass a constitutional amendment to control Federal spending. 
Now, here we are debating an amendment to limit an individual's spending. 
Mr. President, this demonstrates just how backward our priorities are. 
We can't control how much the Federal Government will spend--but we will presume to tell an individual how much he or she can spend on political campaigns. 
That is simply unacceptable. 
Also, Mr. President, I am not a lawyer. But the term `reasonable' limits used in this amendment appears to be pretty loose. 
How can we reasonably restrict what someone can spend? 
How can we reasonably restrict political speech? 
And the very thought that the Federal Government--the Congress--would be setting a reasonable standard is troubling. 
Further, Mr. President, we should call this for what it really is--the incumbent protection constitutional amendment. 
Everyone knows that if you limit your opponent's spending--the better known incumbent has an advantage. And under this amendment, we can limit opposition spending. 
This is absurd--the Congress setting how much our opponents can spend against us. 
Who can possibly hope to challenge an incumbent if he or she is not allowed to use their own money--however little or much--in the campaign. 
Of course, this amendment probably puts us on the path to Federal funding of political campaigns. 
Mr. President, I cannot abide the fact that not only do we pay a politician's salary. Now some politicians expect the citizens to spend their tax dollars paying for the campaign as well. 
We can't ask the working men and women of this country to do that. 
Further, I would remind my colleagues that we have full Federal funding for Presidential races--and has this stopped the President from shamelessly raising money? The answer is no. 
President Clinton didn't need to sell the Lincoln bedroom to pay for his campaign. The taxpayers of this country paid for every penny of his campaign. We did this so that the President wouldn't have to be bothered or be influenced by the fundraising process. 
But that apparently did not matter. His goal was to raise as much money as possible--beyond that legally permissible for himself--to buy misleading ads on Medicare. 
Federal funding has failed at the Presidential level--and it won't work at the congressional level. 
Mr. President, I also have to question why the minority and the President is in such a hurry to enact campaign finance reform. 
During 1996, they used the White House and the executive branch to squeeze money out of everyone from banks to Indian tribes. 
Now the American public is finding out about it. 
Suddenly, the No. 1 priority of the Democratic Party is campaign finance reform. 
When the horse is out of the barn, a horsethief running down the street telling everyone about it isn't going to do any good. 
If the front pages weren't covered in negative stories about the sordid tales of DNC and White House fundraising, I don't think we would be out here rushing to clutter the Constitution with supposed campaign reform. 
Finally, Mr. President, we never seem to question why there is so much money in politics. One reason we have overlooked is because the Government is in everyone's business. 
If we weren't threatening to legislate and regulate businesses on a daily basis, perhaps they wouldn't feel compelled to give large donations. 
The best campaign finance reform we can make here is to get out of Americans' daily lives. They shouldn't have to buy access for the purpose of making their views heard on legislation that would be ruinous to the free enterprise system. 
If we would stop the bad legislation and regulation--we could stop the bad campaign finance practices we don't like. 
Mr. President, I have great respect for Senator Hollings and Senator Bryan, they are both fine Senators from the other party, but I believe that on this issue, they have taken a very dangerous approach by suggesting that we amend the Constitution. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today a bill to protect housing. This bill will ensure that all residents have a peaceful, well-maintained, and managed community with the services they deserve. 
The Housing Protection Act prohibits the Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] from establishing a national occupancy standard and transfers the authority to set those standards to the States. In the absence of a State standard, a two-person-per-bedroom standard would be presumed reasonable. 
In 1995, Senator Kyl and I introduced this same piece of legislation, after HUD's General Counsel Nelson Diaz issued a memorandum which, in effect, attempted to supplant the reasonable two-person-per-bedroom standard with conditions which could have forced housing owners to accept six, seven, even eight people in a two-bedroom apartment. The House of Representatives passed it as part of its public housing reform bill, but the bill failed to pass out of conference last year. 
Too often apartments are crowded with excessive numbers of people. When this happens, apartment complexes experience excessive noise, lower levels of safety and most often deterioration of the units. Building codes are in place for a reason. They are designed to determine the maximum amount of people who may safely exit a building during a fire or other emergency. Occupancy standards, on-the-other-hand, determine how many residents can be accommodated and for whom they can properly provide services on the premises. 
The purpose of occupancy standards is to provide decent, safe, comfortable housing and a peaceful living environment for all residents. They also help maintain properties in excellent condition. While housing providers set their own occupancy standards, such private standards are in effect limited by state-set laws or policies which establish the minimum occupancy levels at which housing providers achieve safe harbor from charges of familial discrimination. 
This bill is widely supported by housing industry associations such as the National Association of Homebuilders and the National Apartment Association, among others. Many of our colleagues have joined us in support of this bill, and I urge others to consider cosponsoring it.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize a great American from my home State, a man who is working to show all Americans that individuals can make a difference in the war against drugs. Ted Stone, a native of Durham, NC, wanted to do something to raise awareness about our Nation's drug problems. Ted has been a motivational speaker for over 20 years now on the subject of drug abuse. He has spoken to millions of people in churches, schools, civic organizations, prisons, and drug treatment facilities. But he wanted to do something more. 
On March 14, 1996, here in Washington, DC, on the steps of our Nation's Capitol, Ted began a 3,700 mile walk across America. He completed that trek on November 19 of last year in Los Angeles, CA on the steps of city hall. 
Ted's dramatic journey across America took him to the State capitals of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, where he brought his antidrug message personally to Gov. George W. Bush, Gov. Gary Johnson, and Governor Fife Symington. 
Ted carried an American flag with him throughout his walk across our beautiful country as a symbol that the American spirit can turn the tide in our Nation's war on drugs. Working together in our local communities I, too, believe we can raise awareness of our Nation's drug abuse problems. 
At one point on his journey, a little boy asked Ted if he was like Forrest Gump. Ted replied: 
No, because when people asked Forrest Gump why he was walking, he didn't know. I'm walking so that boys like you can grow up in a country that is drug-free. 
Ted believes, as I do, that the war on drugs will not be won in the courtroom or even here in Congress, but in our local communities. And in fact, Ted knows personally about winning the war on drugs, because he himself is a recovered amphetamine addict. He is living proof that individuals can overcome drug addiction. 
Today I hope my colleagues will join me in saluting a great American, Ted Stone, for his efforts to keep our Nation drug-free.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, on H.R. 668, had this been a rollcall vote, I would like for the Record to reflect that I would have voted `no.' 
No one is more supportive of aviation safety than myself. I have pointed out on the Senate floor that I have actually been in a plane crash. 
But, I oppose this measure because I believe that the American people are taxed too much. Why is it that general revenues, collected through income taxes, are not enough to cover such basic government services as safe skies. 
Further, even if we were to impose such a fee, we should find offsetting spending and tax cuts so that we do not increase the tax burden on the American people. Regrettably, this effort failed in the House of Representatives. 
Finally, this tax could be restructured so that it does not punish traveling Americans, but such a report on restructuring is not due until October of this year. 
For all of these reasons I oppose the ticket tax.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. Quite simply, no other legislative issue the Senate will consider is more important than this one. It was true in the last Congress. It is true in this Congress. It will be true in the next one if we do not pass it. 
Now, there are more reasons than I have ever heard not to balance the budget. We have heard them day after day. We just heard them, and they keep coming. But the future of the United States and the well-being of our children, grandchildren, and children yet unborn rests entirely on whether we pass this amendment or not. 
Mr. President, if we fail to enact this amendment I am concerned we will never balance a budget on any sort of a continuing basis. I have heard a lot of talk on the Senate floor about the need to balance a budget. Many have said that we can balance a budget but not necessarily on a continuing basis. Talk is cheap. The real question is, what will guarantee that we balance a budget year in, year out, and guarantee fiscal responsibility to the Federal Government, something we have not had? What guarantees will we make to our children and grandchildren and children yet unborn that we will not continue to mortgage their future with feel-good politics of the day? 
There is a lot of rhetoric in this body about the need to help children-- more resources for education, greater health care for children. In fact, if there is anything we really want to pass, we put children in front of it. But if we really want to help the children of this country that are here now and yet to be born we can stop piling a financial burden on them that they cannot pay. It is as simple as that. 
We could give them a society, if not debt free, at least be coming out of debt, reducing it. We are already seeing the effects of the 30-year spending spree. Most two-income families have difficulty sustaining the same lifestyle as their parents and grandparents that lived on one income. Why is it that one paycheck does not go as far today? The answer is simple: Taxes and debt. The enormous tax burden that has been created because of bigger government, taxes that are everywhere, and the IRS considers taxing everything--endless taxes, Federal taxes, State, local, sales, gasoline, property, personal, estate taxes, telephone, airline, the list goes on into infinity. We are taxing ourselves to death to pay for more government that we do not need because so much of what is already collected is being spent on interest for money we have already borrowed and already spent. 
Already we send $1.5 trillion to the Federal Government each year. That is not enough. Nor will any amount ever be enough. It is an all-consuming Government and no amount will ever satisfy the appetite. 
Mr. President, the debt is not going away. Today, every man, woman, and child in this country owes $20,000. A family of four owes $80,000, the cost of the average home. The money will have to be paid back. It will never disappear. What we have done is extremely wrong--we have ignored the reality of our time and have put the burden of the future on our children to pay for our folly. 
Mr. President, I have often thought what is it about the last 40 years that has brought us into this position? Certainly, too many people believe Government is the answer to every problem. We have spent approximately $5 trillion on Federal welfare programs since 1960, roughly the size of the debt. But we have more poverty today than we did when we started--a total failure. 
Another problem has been that an active Federal Government has regulated American business too much, stifling the productivity and unduly burdening small business. 
This is another unique problem that is recent: The Congress has no boundaries. The age of instant information and Congress' driven attempt to please everyone, we are never forced to choose between programs. We can be for anything and everything and against nothing and it rolls on. We are never forced to make a choice because we do not have the requirement of a balanced budget amendment. This is a fundamental flaw of the Federal Government. We have no limit on our ability to incur debt. Thomas Jefferson noted it 200 years ago. It was true then. It is true today. 
Mr. President, finally let me talk about the national debt that is consuming us. It took this country 200 years to acquire a $1 trillion debt, and we did that in 1983. Now, in just 14 additional years we have acquired an additional $4 trillion in debt. We clearly are out of control with our spending, and if we do not constrain ourselves we will destroy the fiscal integrity of this country. By the time we balance a budget, even by most conservative figures, we will have a $6.5 trillion debt. Every person who has ever had a debt knows that interest is a piranha and it will eat you alive. The same thing is happening to the Federal Government. Interest is eating us alive. 
We spend $366 billion on gross interest each year--that is, to the public and the Government trust funds. To put it in more real terms, when we file our tax returns on April 15, we should know that 52 percent of all income taxes that are sent to Washington will be used for the one purpose of paying the interest on the Government's gross debt. 
By the year 2000, our national debt will be equal to 52 percent of the gross domestic product. In 1980, the figure was half that. Besides interest, the only thing we spend more on is Social Security. I think it is so ironic that we have heard over and over that Social Security is being used as a block to a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. If we want to ensure the future of Social Security and Medicare for the people of this country in the future, the best thing we can do is balance the budget. It is the only way we can secure the future of Social Security--with a balanced budget. It should never be considered separately. 
Mr. President, if we could just control Federal spending, we might not need this amendment. But we won't control Federal spending. For 35 years we have been unable to muster the fortitude to stop or control Federal spending. The truth is, had we frozen Federal spending in 1994, we would have balanced the budget in 1997. 
Mr. President, we all know what the problem is. The question is, what are we going to do about it? The answer is that we must pass the balanced budget amendment if we are going to leave our children a clean slate, not a lifetime of debt, excessive taxes, and a contingent liability of $7 trillion. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

 Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Rogers H. Clark, the president of Sampson-Bladen Oil Co., Inc., on his recent election as senior vice president of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America [PMAA]. Rogers is a true leader who will bring decades of experience and insight to this important position, all to the benefit of our Nation's independent petroleum marketers, whose interests the PMAA represent. 
Rogers graduated from East Carolina University with a degree in business education. He joined the U.S. Army National Guard, contributing his spare time to our community and State until he retired. He was a Sunday school-teacher and was a chairman of the Board of Deacons in the First Baptist Church. He is also a past president of the Clinton [NC] Rotary Club, and a recipient of the Silver Beaver Award from the Boy Scouts of America. He served on the advisory boards of several local financial institutions, and he presently serves on the board of trustees for Meredith College in Raleigh. 
In addition to running the Sampson-Bladen Oil Co. in Clinton, Rogers is the president and CEO of Waccamaw Transport, which brings petroleum products to the people of Virginia and the Carolinas. 
Rogers is not new to PMAA. He has just completed a term as the association's southeastern regional vice president. He also served as president of the North Carolina Petroleum Marketers Association and received that group's esteemed Will Parker Memorial Award. 
I am pleased to offer this tribute to my friend and fellow citizen of Clinton. I am sure that his family is very proud of this latest of so many accomplishments.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, the White House Commission on Aviation Safety and Security is going to present its recommendations to the President today, and I commend the commission for its work and support most of its recommendations. 
Aviation safety should be a prominent feature on the list of bipartisan issues upon which we can find common ground this year. There are 22,000 commercial flights every day in the United States. The American air traffic control system served 550 million passengers last year. Mr. President, in my home State of North Carolina, 22 million people last year passed through the Charlotte airport. 
The safety of literally millions of Americans hangs in the balance of our commitment to aviation modernization. I have a rather personal interest in this issue. I was in a plane crash in 1983 and wound up in a lake surrounded by fire in an airplane without wings. 
I want to stress the importance of the commission's call for rapid modernization of our air traffic control system. These efforts to upgrade the system will necessitate certain costs, and no one in this city is more concerned about the taxpayers than I, but the system is decades old and on the verge of collapse. 
Mr. President, one of the better-kept secrets around Washington seems to be the $1.4 billion that we have squandered on a failed effort to upgrade the aviation computer network over the last several years. IBM worked for years to create a modern air traffic control computer system and spent more than $1 billion of the taxpayers' money. The exact figure is unclear, but the contractors think--they think--that they will be able to salvage some of this work--some of it--as the process starts anew. 
The system at O'Hare Airport in Chicago includes computers that are more than 30 years old, and, as you know, its failures leave some air traffic control personnel with blank screens. The lives of the passengers are in the hands of air traffic controllers hobbled by a system that is both inadequate and obsolete. 
The Federal Government called for installation of a Doppler radar system to detect wind shear at airports around the country. However, Mr. President, the system is operative at just a few airports. This Congress maintains an obligation to the air passengers of this country. Clearly, this obligation is not yet met, and too much money has been wasted. 
As a member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I intend to keep a keen eye on the dollars as I always do, but I also want to see a cost-effective modernization of the system. We owe a safe system to the taxpayers. Their tax dollars are paying for it, and they are entitled to it, and they need it. It is incomprehensible that the computers at one the busiest airports in the world can go blank. This is a condition that boggles the mind. 
I believe the hiring policies of airline companies and airports also merit serious thought. The airlines need to be certain that the people who service and maintain airplanes do not have questionable backgrounds. These security issues are critical to the safety of the American flying public. 
There are other safety concerns of note. The American airplane fleet is aging. We need to ensure that inspections are thorough and frequent on these older aircraft. There is nothing wrong with an older airplane, but it needs to be inspected and updated, lest problems go undetected and new technologies go unused. 
We need to take these and other steps to ensure that the American air traveler is safe. We can ensure safe skies without excessive inconvenience and delay, and, Mr. President, I am committed to just that. 
I thank the Commission for its efforts. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration to implement some of these recommendations. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this resolution. For 2 weeks, like many Americans, I was disturbed by the news that the National Institutes of Health would not recommend regular mammograms for women in their forties. 
Mr. President, we have to call this a deadly and silent disease. The fact is, cancer is the leading cause of death for women between the ages of 40 to 55. Mr. President, this statistic itself should dictate that women in their forties should have regular mammograms. It only makes common sense that they should. My worry is that without the National Institutes of Health's recommendation, women will be lulled into a false sense of security and believing that they do not need a mammogram, and that doctors may not always recommend that women in their forties have one. 
The last thing we need to say to women juggling family, career, and all of the problems they are faced with, is that this can wait. If we lead them to believe that, then they will let it wait, and they will face dire consequences when they do. 
Too often when these matters are debated, the fact that we are talking about the lives of people, the lives of wives, mothers, daughters, and friends--by remaining silent on this issue, we are putting their health at risk. I thank Senator Snowe for bringing this issue to the floor. It is one that deserves national attention and certainly the attention of the Senate. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the resolution. I thank Senator Snowe for bringing it to the Nation's attention. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Ford for introducing legislation regarding the regulation of tobacco. 
With respect to this very controversial issue, let us set one thing straight--no one supports teen smoking. We need to do more to discourage youths from smoking. No one is opposed to reasonable legislation that would curb young people from smoking. That much is clear and everyone agrees on it. 
Also, the tobacco companies have pledged that they will do more to curb teen smoking. 
What is questionable is the notion of the FDA regulating tobacco as if it were a drug. This is a stretch by anyone's standards. President Clinton has said that the era of big government is over, and yet he has allowed the FDA to vastly increase its regulatory authority. Ask yourselves this question, should the Food and Drug Administration be regulating the color of race cars at NASCAR events? This is no--absolutely no. 
What we need is a bill to address the problems of teen smoking, and one that protects small North Carolina farmers. I was not elected to the Senate to see small farmers slide into bankruptcy because of the Clinton administration. 
The Ford bill is a good start. I continue to work with Senator Helms, Senator McConnell, and other Senators to develop a consensus document that can actually pass this Congress. 
Our goal here is to get something passed so that we don't set the dangerous precedent of the FDA deciding that some product is suddenly decreed a drug--and that it will now be regulated. 
Thank you Mr. President, and thank you Senator Ford for your leadership on this issue.

Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of Madeleine Albright to be Secretary of State. Additionally, I am pleased to support the nomination of our former colleague, Bill Cohen to be Secretary of Defense. 
I am concerned, however, about the general direction of President Clinton's foreign policy. 
It has been a policy with very little direction. I fear that the U.S. armed forces have become an international cleanup force sent to all parts of the world that have no strategic relationship to the United States. Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, and other U.N. peace-keeping missions have been costly with little tangible benefits for the United States. 
In the case of Bosnia, clearly, the administration misled the Congress about the length of time troops would be present there. Only after the election did the President have the courage to tell the American people that the troops would not be coming home in December of 1996 and that the deployment would extend another 18 months. 
Further, with respect to Bosnia, it has now become apparent that this conflict dragged on longer than it should have because the administration and Democratic leaders in Congress blocked arm shipments for the Bosnians. Yet, in a secret policy, they allowed Iran to arm the Bosnian muslims. This administration told the Congress one thing and Iran another. 
This is an unacceptable way to conduct American foreign policy. 
The Clinton administration has pursued what I call the un-Reagan doctrine. Rather than preside over the decline and fall of the last remaining communist regimes, this administration has reached out and befriended them. It gave diplomatic recognition to Vietnam. We provided foreign aid to North Korea, and we sought warmer relations with Fidel Castro until he shot down innocent civilians out of the sky. In contrast, this administration ignored, almost to its peril, the new democracies in Eastern Europe and Russia, to the point that the Communists tried to stage an electoral comeback in Russia. 
This is not foreign policy America can be proud of. 
Another problem with this administration is its handling of our future security from nuclear attack. 
In my view, nothing is more important to the national defense of this country than deployment of a national ballistic missile defense for the United States. More than 25 countries now possess or are seeking to acquire nuclear weapons. 
We have to address this issue--we cannot ignore it. 
I would hope that the two people we are confirming today, both of whom are honorable, decent, hard-working people will work on these issues and improve our defense and foreign policy in the next 4 years. 
Finally, Mr. President, I wish Senator Cohen well in his new position. I was pleased to serve with him for the last 4 years, and we will certainly miss him in the Senate, but the United States will be better off by having him as Secretary of Defense.
