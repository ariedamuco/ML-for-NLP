Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to indicate my strong support for this bill. It is my sincere conviction that we are today making right a historic wrong. One hundred years ago, Theodore Roosevelt was denied the Congressional Medal of Honor simply because he attempted to force the War Department to return sick veterans of the Spanish-American War to their homes in the United States. In so doing, he embarrassed a political rival, who it just so happened was also the Secretary of War. As a result, despite the unanimous recommendation of his uniformed superiors, his political superior denied him the nation's highest military honor. 
On July 1, 1898, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, commander of the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment--the famed `Rough Riders'--was just 39 years of age. He had resigned his position as Assistant Secretary of the Navy so that he could help organize the regiment. American forces, battling both the Spanish and the Cuban jungle, prepared to storm San Juan Hill and the heights surrounding the strategic port city of Santiago, Cuba. within the protected walls surrounding the port of Santiago sat the Spanish fleet, which had to be neutralized if the United States was to win the war. 
The American attack against Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill was pinned down immediately by the merciless fire of the Spanish forces entrenched on the heights above. According to one participant, `the situation was desperate. Our troops could not retreat as the trail for two miles behind them was wedged with men. They could not remain where they were for they were being shot to pieces. . .' U.S. forces still hunkered down at the foot of the hill were unable to return fire. 
After long delay, Roosevelt received orders to advance. With Roosevelt at their lead, the Rough Riders advanced to the front of the American line. Determined to rally the American forces to victory, Roosevelt shouted: `If you don't want to go forward, let my men pass.' Roosevelt dared and goaded men in the rear forward until they crowded the ones in front of them. The whole line, tired of waiting and eager to close with the enemy, was straining to go forward. 
Leading the charge up the hill, Roosevelt waved his hat and went up the hill with a rush. With Roosevelt in the lead, thee American forces reached the summit of Kettle Hill and swept aside the last of the Spanish defenders. Without hesitating, Roosevelt directed his men to fire against the Spanish defenders on nearby San Juan Hill, where another American force was advancing in the face of heavy fire. Rallying his forces, Roosevelt leapt forward advancing into the valley between Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill. In his excitement to charge the Spanish position, Roosevelt soon realized instead of the entire regiment following him, only five other men had joined him in the charge. 
Roosevelt then proceeded to run back to Kettle Hill, where he angrily yelled at the regiment to follow him. The Rough Riders responded by shouting: `We didn't see you go! Lead on and we will follow!' Lead he did. Once again, Roosevelt, this time with the Rough Riders behind, rushed up San Juan Hill for a second time. Once again, Roosevelt led his men into the Spanish line on the top of the height. Roosevelt then succeeded in organizing and leading the defense of the heights throughout the night. Out of four hundred men in the regiment, 86 had been killed or wounded, six were missing and another 40 were struck with heat exhaustion. 
Military experts, historians, and everyone who had witnessed both the charge up Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill agreed that they had occurred and succeeded because of the man who had led them. For his actions, Colonel Leonard Wood, 1st U.S. volunteer Cavalry, recommended Roosevelt for the Congressional Medal of Honor. The recommendation received endorsement throughout the chain of command. 
After the cessation of hostilities, the American forces remaining on Cuba, including the rough riders, were ravaged by malaria and fever. The commanders on Cuba, including Roosevelt and Leonard Wood, pleaded with the War Department, to bring the men home. But Secretary of War Alger, who believed the troops were infected with yellow fever, wished to delay their return until the disease had run its course. Fearing that the continued stay of the troops on the island would result in the death of thousands, Roosevelt, with the support of the other commanders on the island, drafted a letter demanding that the troops be brought back home lest thousands die in Cuba. 
The letter was published in the press, and was a great embarrassment to President McKinley and Secretary of War Alger. Although subsequently Roosevelt received credit for bringing the troops home, Alger rejected the recommendation of Roosevelt's superiors that he be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. Roosevelt's wife would later write that Alger's rejection of Roosevelt's recommendation for the Medal of Honor `was one of the bitterest disappointments of his life.' 
I will admit that I approached the prospect of legislating the nation's highest military award for valor with some concern. However, my review of the facts of this case have convinced me that Teddy Roosevelt earned the Medal of Honor on the battlefield, only to see it denied for political reasons. I am pleased, one hundred years later, to be a part of correcting this injustice today.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I voted against the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999. One of the principal reasons why I voted against the bill is that it does not include two critically important provisions of the Smith amendment to the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill that passed the Senate on July 21, 1998, by a vote of 69-31. The Smith amendment provided major protections of the rights of law-abiding gun owners under the second amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
As passed by the Senate last July, the Smith amendment included three major provisions. First, the Smith amendment prohibited the Federal Bureau of Investigation from charging a user fee or `gun tax' for the so-called Brady handgun National Instant Check System (NICS) that will go into effect later this year. Second, the Smith amendment required the `immediate destruction' of all records related to gun purchasers who are determined by the system to be legally entitled to buy a gun. Third, the Smith amendment created a private cause of action on the part of any individual gun purchaser who is the victim of a violation of either or both of the first two provisions of the amendment. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, only the first provision of the Smith amendment remains intact in the final version of the omnibus appropriations bill. Although I am pleased that the FBI's gun tax scheme is now dead, I am deeply disappointed that those who negotiated this bill with the administration have ignored the legislatively expressed will of 69 United States Senators by rendering all but meaningless the second, and eliminating altogether the third, provisions of the Smith amendment. 
The omnibus appropriations bill replaces the Smith amendment's requirement for the `immediate destruction' of records on law-abiding gun owners with one that only requires `destruction' of such records. Thus, the bill leaves open to question just how long the FBI may lawfully retain such records. 
Although the omnibus appropriations bill does not include the Smith amendment's language explicitly creating a private cause of action, I believe that the bill retains an implied cause of action. Assuming that the courts will interpret the new law in a manner that gives full effect to legislative intent, judges will recognize such an implied cause of action on the part of gun owners to sue in Federal court in order to protect their rights under the Smith amendment. 
Mr. President, early in the 106th Congress next year, I will be introducing legislation encompassing all of the protections of the Smith amendment for which 69 Senators voted last July.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Mr. Jeff Merrifield to the position of U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner. 
Mr. Merrifield was born in Westerly, Rhode Island and spent most of his childhood in Antrim, New Hampshire. In 1985, Jeff graduated Magna Cum Laude with his B.A. from Tufts University. In 1986, he joined Senator Gordon Humphrey's staff and handled energy and environmental issues. I first came to the Senate in 1990 and I was fortunate that Jeff was one of several staffers who carried over from Senator Humphrey's staff to mine. 
While working for Senator Humphrey and me, Jeff put himself through Georgetown Law School. He graduated in 1992 after which he began work for the Washington D.C. based law firm of McKenna and Cuneo. There, he practiced environmental and government contracts law until 1995. I was very pleased to have Jeff returned to my staff in 1995 to be my counsel for the Senate Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control and Risk Assessment. He was the lead staffer in developing my Superfund reauthorization legislation. 
During his time with the Senate, Jeff has been involved with all aspects of solid and hazardous waste disposal and cleanup regulation. He took part in a number of bills including the Price Anderson reauthorization, the Oil Pollution Control Act, the Clean Air Act reauthorization, efforts to reauthorize both Superfund and RCRA, and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act (ISTEA I). 
In addition to his duties on the Committee, Jeff has also been extensively involved in assisting me on the Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, which I chair. He has provided me with valuable oversight of hazardous and radiological waste programs at DOD and DOE facilities. 
Jeff's philosophy as Commissioner will be that the NRC cannot take a solitary role in maintaining full public confidence in the safety of nuclear power. He has said that the nuclear industry must also assume equal responsibility for taking the steps necessary to maintain the trust of the American public. 
Mr. President, Jeff has done a great job for me over the years. Although I'm sorry to lose him from my staff, I'm confident that he will provide the NRC with the talents necessary to ensure adequate protection of the public health and safety, the common defense and security, and the environment in the use of nuclear materials in the United States. Jeff is a bright, dedicated and articulate individual who will serve the nation with distinction. I strongly recommend him for the position of U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner and urge my colleagues to do the same. Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, Friday, September, 18, 1998 has been designated this year by our Federal and State Governments as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. As we have done for nearly 20 years, we reaffirm today our national commitment to obtaining the fullest possible accounting for America's POWs and MIAs. This is also a day to remember and pay tribute to the ultimate sacrifices that have been made by America's finest and bravest service personnel--our unaccounted for prisoners of war and missing in action personnel who never returned from wartime enemy territory. 
It has been an honor and privilege for me, since my election to the Congress in 1984, to assist the POW/MIA families, our veterans, and their friends and supporters, with the many efforts that have been undertaken to try to achieve a proper accounting for so many of our nation's heroes whose fate remains unknown. It has been a difficult and emotional task, complicated by on and off-again cooperation by foreign governments 
As many of my colleagues know, I served as Vice-Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs in 1992, and I currently serve as the U.S. Chairman of the Vietnam War Working Group of the Joint U.S./Russian Commission on POWs and MIAs. I have traveled to North Korea, Vietnam, Russia, Laos, Cambodia, Poland, and the Czech Republic trying to assist our Government's efforts to open archives and interview people knowledgeable about the fate of our unaccounted for captured and missing personnel. I have also made efforts over the last year to prod our own U.S. Intelligence Community to provide the analysis and support necessary to help shape our policy toward nations that hold the answers we seek. Finally, I continue to work to ensure that U.S. Government records on this issue are declassified and made available to the public. 
Mr. President, today, as I have every year in this Chamber, I urge the Administration to take the opportunity National POW/MIA Recognition Day provides to rededicate itself to the fullest possible accounting mission. I also urge all Americans to continue expressing their concerns on this national issue because public awareness is critical to the accounting effort. 
In closing, I again want to assure my constituents in New Hampshire, my fellow veterans, the POW/MIA families, and the countless Americans who have contacted me through the years, that I remain absolutely committed to doing everything I can to learn the truth about our POWs and MIAs to whom we pay tribute on this special day.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Santorum, for his leadership on this issue. 
I pick up on what Senator DeWine just said about Nurse Shafer. Thirteen years she worked in an abortion clinic. She testified before the Judiciary Committee, and I think it might be interesting to read her statement about what she saw, word for word. I don't think anybody has done that. Listen to Nurse Shafer, who witnessed this partial-birth abortion. 
I stood at the doctor's side and I watched him perform a partial-birth abortion on a woman who was 6 months pregnant. The baby's heart beat was clearly visible on the ultrasound screen. The doctor delivered the baby's legs and arms. Everything but his little head. The baby's body was moving. His little fingers were clasped together. He was kicking his feet. The doctor took a pair of scissors and inserted them into the back of the baby's head and the baby's arms jerked out in a flinch, a startled reaction like a baby does when he thinks that he might fall. Then the doctor opened the scissors up. Then he stuck a high-powered suction tube into the hole and sucked the baby's brains out. Now the baby was completely limp. I never went back to the clinic, but I'm still haunted by the face of that little boy. It was the most perfect angelic face I have ever seen. 
My colleagues, if we continue to tolerate this, somehow, some way, some day, we are going to be judged. This is wrong. This is immoral. When we see and hear the things that are going on in our country today and read and hear the polls, maybe we shouldn't be surprised. This is the standard that we set for our children? What a disgraceful thing to do, not to override this veto. 
The President's own Southern Baptist religion, past and current president of the Southern Baptist Convention, wrote a letter to the President of the United States pleading with him to change his position, telling him why they believe he was wrong, that there is no medical reason to improve the health or to save the life of the mother. There is no medical reason to perform this--180 doctors in a letter I referred to yesterday on the floor said so; 4 doctor at a press conference yesterday said so; so did Dr. Koop, one of the most respected people ever to serve in government, former Surgeon General. 
Yet here we are. This is a terrible thing. I just hope and pray that my colleagues in the next hour or the next half hour will see the light, if you will, and change their position so we can win this vote.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator for his leadership. 
I wish to start my remarks by saying what an honor and privilege it is for me to stand here on the Senate floor with such distinguished colleagues as Senator Frist, Senator Faircloth, Senator Santorum and others who have spoken out so eloquently against this terrible practice that takes place, unfortunately, too many times in the United States of America. 
I was particularly impressed with the remarks from our distinguished colleague, Senator Frist, who today I think is more important as a doctor than as a Senator perhaps, listening to his very impressive and technical remarks about just exactly what this procedure is and how it is not necessary for the health or the life of the mother, to save the life or to enhance the health of the mother, and he noted, as has been said, the fringe element who perform these horrible procedures. 
In addition to that, I would just mention that here in this notebook--Senator Frist you heard from. He had a press conference this morning with four distinguished physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists, who spoke out saying the exact same thing that Senator Frist said. Here in this book are 180 letters. These are just the ones I have received in my office. These are from all the doctors who say that it is unnecessary to save the life of the mother or to enhance the health of the mother--180. I am sure there are many other Senators who have received similar correspondence saying exactly the same thing. 
But having been involved for almost 4 years now in this debate, coming to the floor, fighting your heart out, losing, it is pretty tough, and it is very emotional. And I know it has been the same for my dear friend and colleague, Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania, who has poured his heart and soul into this issue. 
I remember very clearly, and I am sure the Senator does as well, in 1995, when I was pretty much alone on the floor of the Senate--and I want to get into that a little bit in a moment as to why I was here--there was a newly elected Senator, fairly newly elected Senator from Pennsylvania named Santorum who was not saying anything but listening to the debate. There was a very emotional exchange privately between the Senator and myself. He just indicated to me that he had to get involved in this because of the horror of it, and he has. He has been a great leader, and I certainly appreciate another horse in the harness, so to speak. 
This is beyond, I should say, the in-your-face politics that we have endured on the floor in the past. I know I have gotten beyond it. I don't want to get into anybody's face on abortion or partial-birth abortion. I want to get in your heart. I want to get in your hearts because that is what this is about. I know that as we debate on the floor you don't see a huge crowd here. Hopefully, somebody is watching on the monitor. Of that 36 out there who have yet to see our way, maybe somehow, some way, some will see that it is wrong to continue to tolerate this in America and their votes will change, at least enough votes will change to end this horror. 
This is America, supposedly the moral leader of the world. What does it say to our children when we kill children, their colleagues, with a pair of scissors and a suction hose as they exit the birth canal? What does that tell them? How do you say to your children, `Be good today; do your homework; mind your parents; do what's right; live a good life; be a good Christian; do unto others; be good'--how can you say that and support this? What message are you giving them? 
No one should be surprised about the immorality that we see in our country today because we are not setting the example. We have an awesome responsibility as leaders in this country, whether we are in the Senate or whether we are just ordinary parents every day setting an example for our children. It is an awesome responsibility. 
I remember when I spoke in the Chamber 3 years ago, I was chastised by a colleague for showing those same medical charts that Senator Santorum has shown in front of young pages sitting in the well. Well, I think they had to see that. I think they needed to know what we as adults are doing to their younger colleagues, the unborn children who have done nothing against anybody. This is the execution of a child as it enters the world. You cannot color it up. You cannot make it any nicer. 
You can talk about all the legalities. I heard my colleague, Senator Durbin from Illinois, a few minutes ago say we had to follow the guidance of Roe v. Wade. I might change that slightly and say the misguidance of Roe v. Wade. This is not about technicalities. It is not about legal definitions. It is not about falsely creating definitions of what threats to health or threats to life are. This is about real children really dying every day as we speak. As this debate occurs, more will die, and we are letting it happen. And three votes in this Chamber tomorrow morning, three more than we had the last time, will end it all, will stop it. So when you think about whether your vote counts, whether it matters, my colleagues, it matters. It matters. 
I stood in the Chamber 3 years ago. Initially, I didn't know what this was. I could not believe that anything that would even resemble a so-called partial-birth abortion would occur in this country. I didn't believe it. So I checked it out. I talked to people who actually assisted and performed them. I took the charts. I came down in the Chamber. I held up the same medical doll that four doctors held up in a press conference today. I showed exactly what happened with a medical doll--not a plastic fetus, as the critics in the press like to call it, but a medical doll. I simply showed the same size as a real child, the same size as that child who is being held by the abortionist, to simply show what happens. 
I said then and I will say now, in any community in America--you pick it, you name it, your hometown, wherever it is--if you picked up your hometown paper tomorrow and in that hometown paper it said all the puppies and cats in your local humane society were going to be killed with no anesthetic, with a scissors to the back of the skull, open the skull and insert a tube to suck the brains out, I think you would probably be pretty upset. And you know what? It would probably be stopped. 
It probably wouldn't happen. But it is happening to children and we are letting it happen right here, tomorrow, on the floor of the U.S. Senate unless three Senators have the courage to put the politics aside and change their vote. 
When I came down here in 1995, I had one cosponsor because, frankly, people didn't know what this was. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas was an original. We have come a long way since then, and we are not there yet. When the partial-birth abortion ban first passed the Senate on December 7, 1995, it did so with the support of 54 Senators. When the Senate voted whether to override President Clinton's veto on September 26, 1996, 57 Senators voted, and when the Senate passed H.R. 1122, on May 20, 1997, 64 Senators voted in favor. 
You see, in here it is a numbers game. It is a game of numbers. But out there every day in those abortion clinics, it is a life game. It is a little child that is being killed for no other reason, other than it is not wanted. That is the reason. 
I, as I total up those thousands, and I think about it, I ask myself how many times have I said this, night after night, as I thought about the horrors of this--how many of these children may have grown up to be a physician? Maybe a chaplain? Maybe a President? Maybe a scientist, to cure cancer? 
Jefferson wrote so eloquently the Declaration of Independence that we have `the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' You cannot have liberty, you cannot pursue your dreams, if you are killed before you are born. I do not often quote from the Bible, but you reap what you sow, and we will reap what we sow if we do not end this practice in America. 
When the historians write about this age and this era--and I am standing right now at the desk of Daniel Webster. I think about it every time I speak. It is the only original desk in the Senate. There was a resolution passed in the 1960s that said for now and ever more, this desk belongs to the senior Senator from New Hampshire. Nobody else will ever get it. That is one of the highest honors that anybody could ever have. 
But the point I am making is we are here for only a short time. Webster occupied this desk. It did not belong to Webster, and it does not belong to me. It belongs to the people of New Hampshire and the people of America. The years will go by and the historians will look back, just like they look back on Lincoln and the Civil War, and they are going to write about this era. I know one thing, Senator Santorum, we are on the right side. History is going to judge us as being on the right side, I promise you that. Don't worry about it. It is a done deal. We are on the right side, for the same reason that Abraham Lincoln was on the right side. 
Can you imagine Abraham Lincoln taking a poll on whether or not we should end slavery? Putting his finger to the wind and trying to decide what the politically expedient thing to do is, to end slavery? Could you imagine Patrick Henry taking the floor of the Virginia Assembly and saying I wonder if these folks want liberty or whether they want death? Maybe I ought to poll them before I make this speech. 
Those were men of principle. Those were men of principle. They were not afraid of the political ramifications. When Patrick Henry said `Give me liberty or give me death,' he meant it. He was prepared for death if he could not have liberty. He meant every word of it. And Lincoln meant every word of it when he said slavery was wrong and it was immoral. And I mean every word of it when I say that this is wrong and this is immoral, and we will be judged on the basis of this vote. We have the chance to override the veto and send a powerful message. 
Today, 3 votes short, 67 votes. There have been a lot of facts presented here today and there will be more, probably, before the day is over. Take a fresh look, I ask my colleagues. I beg you. Examine your consciences. This is a huge conscience issue. 
I believe the reason we have made so much progress towards our goal of outlawing partial-birth abortion is that more and more Senators are realizing that the opposition to this bill was built on a foundation of lies--lies. I do not use that word lightly. I am using the very word that one of the Nation's leading abortion industry lobbyists used, Ron Fitzsimmons. He has been quoted here earlier, but he publicly admitted last year that he `lied through [his] teeth' when he helped orchestrate the campaign against partial-birth abortion. 
When I stood on the floor here, I was told that there were just a few dozen a year, that I was some kind of an extremist, a radical. President Clinton, Vice President Gore, Mrs. Clinton, came to New Hampshire in 1996 and campaigned against me in the last week of the election on this issue. 
In an interview published in the New York Times on February 27, 1997, and in an article published in the American Medical News on March 3, 1997, Fitzsimmons made the surprisingly candid admission that he had `lied' when he claimed that partial-birth abortions are rare. 
In those same interviews Fitzsimmons also conceded that he `lied' when he claimed that partial-birth abortions are 
performed only on women whose lives are in danger or whose unborn children are severely disabled. `It made be physically ill,' he told his interviewer. `I told my wife the next day, `I can't do this again.' A man of conscience. In seeking to justify his veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act last year, the New York Times points out, `President Clinton echoed the argument of Mr. Fitzsimmons.' In other words, in justifying his veto, Mr. Clinton relied on the same statements of `fact'--or wrong facts--that have now been conceded by a key leader of the abortion industry to be `lies.' 
In summary, the President used Fitzsimmons' argument; Fitzsimmons was lying, and the President should change his position. If the President of the United States, tonight, would say to his colleagues in the Senate, `I was wrong, override me,' imagine the impact that would have on this Nation. 
Regarding the President, I called upon the President a couple of years ago with a personal, handwritten note, to meet with me, to meet with my colleagues privately, publicly, any way he wanted to; on the record, off the record, with doctors, with his doctors, with my doctors--any way he wanted, any location, any way, any how, any shape or form, to discuss this issue so I could present, in 5 or 10 minutes--that's all I asked for--what I believe to be the truth and to show where he was being told things that were wrong. He never answered my letter. Never answered my letter. 
Let me repeat it tonight, Mr. President, and I think I speak for Senator Santorum. We would love to come over and talk to you tonight about this. We will bring our doctors. You can have all of yours. I appeal to you to take me up on this. What have you got to lose? Maybe you will agree with us. If you do, you can ask your colleagues in the Senate to change their votes. 
The truth, Mr. Fitzsimmons told the New York Times, is that `[i]n the vast majority of cases, the [partial-birth abortion] procedure is performed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 or more weeks along.' Five months. And, as Mr. Fitzsimmons told the American Medical News, `[t]he abortion rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably, does everybody else.' Except, Mr. Fitzsimmons might have added, for President Clinton, who vetoed this bill, even though the reasons he gave to justify his previous veto had turned out to be lies. 
Mr. President, following Mr. Fitzsimmons' startling revelations, on March 4 the Washington Post ran an unusually blunt editorial entitled, `Lies and Late-Term Abortions.' After recounting Mr. Fitzsimmons' lies and his candid admissions that he lied, the Post editorial drew the final conclusion:  
Mr. Fitzsimmons' revelation is a sharp blow to the credibility of his allies. These late-term abortions are extremely difficult to justify, if they can be justified at all. Usually pro-choice legislators such as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Representatives Richard Gephardt and Susan Molinari voted for the ban. . . . Opponents of the ban fought hard, even demanding a rollcall vote on their motion to ban charts describing the procedure from the House floor. They lost. And they lost by wide margins when the House and Senate voted for the ban. They probably will lose again this year when the ban is reconsidered. And this time, Mr. Clinton will be hard-pressed to justify a veto on the basis of misinformation on which he rested his case last time. 
Please listen, Mr. President. Please listen to those words. 
When the President vetoed H.R. 1122, he did so on the same discredited basis that he used before. Partial-birth abortions, he said, are `sometimes necessary to preserve the woman's health.' 
That is a false statement. We have had doctor after doctor say it. We had Dr. Frist say it on the floor, and we have had other testimony, and, as I said, 180 letters from other physicians saying it as well. 
Mr. President, President Clinton's assertion that partial-birth abortions are sometimes needed to protect a woman's health, again, is not true. Even the AMA, who has been quoted today, has said that. The American Medical Association said in the New York Times, May 26, 1997: 
The partial delivery of a living fetus for the purpose of killing it outside the womb is ethically offensive to most Americans and physicians. Our panel could not find any identified circumstances in which the procedure was the only safe and effective abortive method. 
In other words, as Senator Frist has said on the floor, it is a fringe element that performs that. 
There you have it, Mr. President. My colleagues can take a look at these choices: On the one hand, the claim by the President that partial-birth abortions should remain legal because it is needed to protect a woman's health; on the other hand, the American Medical Association, which is, by the way, pro-choice, saying that partial-birth abortions should be banned because it never was needed to protect a woman's health. I will take the American Medical Association on this one. 
Aside from the Fitzsimmons revelations and the AMA's dramatic decision to support H.R. 1122, I believe another reason why the partial-birth abortion ban continues to attract greater and greater support in the Senate is that Senators are coming to realize that this issue really does transcend abortion. I never made any secret about my position on abortion. All abortions are wrong. I am speaking for myself. They all are a taking of a human life, and they are all wrong, which is why I have introduced a human life amendment to the constitution of the amendment. I am proud of it. I don't care if I only get five cosponsors. I am proud of it. I stand on that record, and I think I will be judged correctly for having introduced it, whether I get any cosponsors or not. 
Indeed, as one Senator, Senator Moynihan, who supported us on the veto override in the last Congress, put it, partial-birth abortion is `too close to infanticide.' Let me go one step further, and it has been said here, it is infanticide. All abortion is wrong, but this is not abortion. This is infanticide. This is taking a child in your hands and executing it. 
We need to move away from the partisan rhetoric--not partisan, but the rhetoric on the pros and cons whether the pro-life community or the pro-choice community supports this; get away from that and look into your hearts. It is never too late to change your position on something. I have done it, and others have in here, I am sure. This was a pretty stark, truthful way to put it by Senator Moynihan, Mr. President. It took courage for him to say it, and I commend him for it. It takes a real person with a lot of courage and a lot of guts to say he was wrong and change his vote. 
Another Senator who didn't support the bill the first time around also joined us on that override, Senator Arlen Specter, who believes, he says, that partial-birth abortion is more like infanticide than it is abortion. Senator Specter said it on the Senate floor September 26, 1996: 
In my legal judgment, the medical act or acts of commission or omission interfering with, or not facilitating the completion of a live birth after a child is partially out of a mother's womb constitute infanticide. 
I stood on that Senate floor in 1995 with Senator Specter arguing with me heatedly and differing with me. To Senator Specter's credit, he studied it, he looked at it, and he had a change of heart. Again, that takes courage. The line of the law is drawn, Senator Specter said: 
When the child is partially out of the womb of a mother, it is not an abortion, it is infanticide. 
When you hear about this being an abortion to protect the health of the mother or the life of the mother, how does it help the health or life of the mother to restrain a child from being born, holding it in the birth canal, head only, until it is killed? No doctor has told me yet how that enhances the health or the life of the mother. 
Those are strong words from Senator Specter, a pro-choice Senator. It took a lot of guts for him to say it, but he said it. 
We are picking up support in the Senate. As I have argued today, more and more Senators are realizing that the case against this bill is on a foundation of what have now conceded to have been `lies.' 
We are also picking up greater and greater support because more and more Senators are realizing that this issue transcends abortion--that the tiny little human being whom we are talking about is a partially born baby who is just inches from drawing her first breath. 
To those Senators who are still considering joining the ever-increasing majority of Senators who support the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, let me address a few more comments to you. Perhaps the Nation's most respected and revered doctor--`America's Doctor'--is the former Surgeon General of the United States, C. Everett Koop. I am particularly proud of Dr. Koop because he is a part-time resident of my home state of New Hampshire. 
This is what Dr. Koop has to say: `Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility. On the contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to both her immediate health and future fertility.' 
We all know that Dr. Koop is not a man who uses words lightly. On the contrary, Dr. Koop is a doctor who chooses his words with care and precision. Listen to those words again: `Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility.' 
Now, of course, Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, even the American Medical Association, which is `pro-choice' on abortion, has endorsed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. So, my colleagues, if you are worried about protecting women, listen to the words of Dr. Koop and listen to the American Medical Association. They are for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act because partial-birth abortion is never necessary to protect a woman's health. 
In addition, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues who are still undecided about this bill to look at it in light of our beloved Nation's history. We all know those beautiful and majestic words that Thomas Jefferson wrote for our Declaration of Independence: `We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.' 
Mr. President, one does not have to agree with my view that human life begins at conception to see that a living baby who is in the process of being born has, in Jefferson's words, been endowed by her Creator with the unalienable right to life. Can anyone seriously doubt where that great American, Thomas Jefferson, would stand on that question? 
Another of America's greatest leaders, Abraham Lincoln, made one of the most dramatic and prophetic statements of his life in a speech that he delivered on June 16, 1858. In that speech, Abraham Lincoln said `I believe this government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free.' Today, Mr. 
President, as we debate this Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in this great Capitol of the Union that Lincoln saved, I would say this: The moral foundation of this government cannot endure permanently when even the half born are not free to live. Can anyone really doubt where that moral giant, Abraham Lincoln, would have stood on the question before us here today? 
Let us rise to the moral level to which our Nation's history calls us. Let us recognize the unalienable, God-given right to life of the partially-born. Let us protect the partially-born from a brutal death. Let us be worthy of the Nation that Jefferson helped create and that Lincoln surely saved. Let us pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act with a two-thirds' majority and thus override President Clinton's unconscionable, immoral, and dishonest veto of this bill. 
I was honored when, in 1996, the National Right to Life Committee recognized my work in the Senate on behalf of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act by presenting me with its `Proudly Pro-Life Award' at a banquet at the historic Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. The most memorable moment of the evening, however, was not when I received the award. Rather, it was when I heard Gianna Jessen sing. 
Gianna Jessen is a beautiful young woman whose life was nearly ended before she was born. Gianna's teenage biological mother had her aborted in the final three months of pregnancy by the so-called saline solution abortion procedure, but Gianna miraculously survived. 
Though she survived the abortion attempt, Gianna weighed just two pounds at birth and was afflicted with cerebral palsy. She spent the first few months of her life in a Southern California hospital. Though her doctors doubted that she would ever be able to sit up, to crawl, or to walk, after years of physical therapy and surgeries, Gianna, now 21 years old, today enjoys an active, productive, and happy life. 
As Gianna Jessen stood before the crowd at the Waldorf-Astoria that night and sang `Amazing Grace,' there was not a dry eye in the house--including mine. 
In July of this year, a media report reached my office about the first known survivor of an attempted partial-birth abortion. According to the Associated Press and other media accounts, personnel at the A-Z Women's Center in Phoenix, Arizona, told a 17-year old mother that her unborn baby was between 23 and 24 weeks' gestational age (in other words, between 5 and 5 1/2 months). 
Reportedly, after beginning the partial-birth abortion 
procedure, abortionist John Biskind found himself dealing with a 6-pound, 2-ounce baby girl of about 37 weeks (near full term), and he delivered her alive. She was kept in the hospital with a fractured skull and `two deep lacerations' on her face, but no brain damage. 
When I learned about this baby, who pro-life activists call `Baby Phoenix,' I immediately thought of Gianna Jessen. How wonderful it is that Baby Phoenix will now be able to grow up in this great country of ours. She may some day stand in front of a pro-life dinner and sing `Amazing Grace.' She may become a scientist and help find a cure for cancer. She may become a United States Senator. She may become the first woman President of the United States. She may become a Supreme Court Justice and vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. With life, anything is possible. I praise God that Baby Phoenix lives. 
The case of Baby Phoenix, the first known survivor of an attempted partial-birth abortion, illustrates that we are dealing with real human beings here. For Baby Phoenix, once that partial-birth abortion procedure was started, all that stood between her and a full life was an abortionist. In his hands, he held the power of life and death. 
Thankfully, Mr. President, the abortionist in Baby Phoenix's case, John Biskind, had a conscience. He saw that he was dealing with a little human being--all 6 pounds and 2 ounces of her. And he didn't brutally punch a hole in her skull. He didn't take a suction device and remove her brain. He didn't kill her. He let her live. 
Unfortunately, Baby Phoenix is the only known survivor of an attempted partial-birth abortion. All the other abortionists who perform the partial-birth abortion procedure don't have the conscience of John Biskind. They, too, know that they are dealing with little human beings. They manipulate their little living bodies. They feel those tiny babies move. Then, with unspeakable brutality, they forcibly restrain those little babies from being born, brutally poke scissors into their little skulls, and then literally suck the lives out of them. 
Today, we can put a stop to the unspeakable brutality of partial-birth abortion. Two-thirds of the United States House of Representatives has said `Yes, stop partial-birth abortion.' The American Medical Association has said `Yes, stop partial-birth abortion.' President Clinton has said, `No, I want partial-birth abortion on demand to be legal.' Today, the United States Senate can say to President Clinton, `You are wrong.' 
I plead with my colleagues. Listen to two-thirds of the House of Representatives. Think about Baby Phoenix. Listen to the American Medical Association. Don't listen to the cravenly political deceptions of President Clinton. 
Vote your conscience. Vote your heart. Vote to stop partial-birth abortion. Vote to override the President's veto and let the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act become the law of this land. We will be a better country for it. 
I can go on, Mr. President. I know there are lots of other things that I can say, but I will close at this point in the debate by again reminding my colleagues to separate yourself from the heated exchanges that we have all had. I see the Senator from Nebraska on the floor. We have had a couple of exchanges in the past on this issue. But try to look into your hearts and see if we can't get out of each other's faces and into each other's hearts and see if we can't get three more votes to change this horrible procedure. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is with some regret that I am here today to join my colleagues, Majority Leader Trent Lott and Environment Committee Chairman John Chafee, in announcing that we will be unable to enact legislation this year to reform the remediation waste provisions of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. 
As many of my colleagues know, since I became Chairman of the Senate Superfund Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the RCRA, it had become apparent to me that hazardous waste cleanups in the United States take too long, are too costly, and result in widespread areas of our country becoming brownfield wastelands. 
Since I introduced RCRA remediation legislation in the 104th Congress, S. 1286, I have attempted to work with Senators Lott, Chafee, Breaux, Baucus, and Lautenberg, with the Clinton administration, States, and members of the industrial and environmental communities to achieve a bipartisan fix to this confusing and burdensome law. Despite our best efforts and the dedicated work of our respective staff, we weren't able to come to agreement. 
It is particularly troublesome that we come to this juncture given the fact that just about a year ago we received a report from the GAO (Hazardous Waste--Remediation Waste Requirements Can Increase the Time and Cost of Cleanups) that demonstrated the urgency of fixing the remediation waste program. Although I have quoted that report previously, I believe that it is worth repeating today. 
Despite the fact that remediation waste `does not pose a significant threat to human health and the environment,' the RCRA requirements are so costly and time consuming that `parties often try to avoid triggering the requirements by containing waste in place or by abandoning cleanups entirely.' 
The report further stated that RCRA `can drive parties to use less aggressive and perhaps less effective cleanup methods, such as leaving contaminated soil in place and placing a waterproof cover over it rather than treating it.' Instead of dealing with the problem, the statute forces parties to `purchase land elsewhere for their plant expansion or other needs.' 
Even the EPA, which is responsible for implementing the statute is quoted in the report as stating: `Although cleaning up a site may offer economic benefits, such as relief from liability for contamination and increased property values, industry sometimes concludes that the costs of complying with RCRA can outweigh the benefits.' 
According to the GAO report we could save upwards of $2 billion per year by making some common sense legislative fixes to RCRA--cost savings that would really jump-start the efforts by industry to address these languishing sites. Nonetheless, despite tireless efforts by members and staff, and notwithstanding good progress in translating these changes into legislative language, it appears that we will not be able to accomplish our shared goal of passing a RCRA remediation waste rifle shot during the time we have left in the 105th Congress. 
As I conclude my statement, I would like to join Senator Lott and Senator Chafee in pledging my desire to press forward on this issue when the Senate returns next year. Perhaps the additional time will give the staff the additional opportunity to bridge the gaps that currently separate us. 
Finally, in addition to thanking Senator Lott and Senator Chafee for their leadership on this issue, I would like to thank our staff, Jeff Merrifield, Lynne Stauss, Ann Klee Carl Biersack and Kristy Sims for their hard work on this issue. Similarly, I would like to recognize Senator Baucus and Lautenberg and their staff for their hard work on attempting to come to a consensus. 
Again, I am disappointed that we were unable to make this happen this year, but I am hopeful that we can make it happen in 1999.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of the marriage penalty amendment. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment. I want to say, under our current tax system, getting married increases your taxes. That does not make a lot of sense. 
The typical family pays more than $100 per month in extra taxes because of the marriage penalty. I have looked at this matter for years and never understood the rhyme or reason for the policy in the first place. Why on Earth such legislation would ever pass the U.S. Congress is mind-boggling. I guess there are some out there who think the institution of marriage has no special importance. 
Even if there are those people who feel that way, it would be hard not to acknowledge that taxing people simply because they got married is discriminatory, pure and simple, no matter how you feel about marriage. Why should you be discriminated against in the Tax Code because you get married? 
Let's not overlook the importance of marriage and the family to our country's success. Children do best when they are raised by two happily married parents. We have some in the liberal establishment who would probably take issue with that as well, but I believe that is the case. I think the statistics speak for themselves. Study after study indicates that children raised in such families are more successful in school, are less likely to commit crime, do drugs, or bear illegitimate children. They do better in the workplace when they get out of school. They do better and they are more likely to stay married as adults if they have that kind of family unit to learn from.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield myself 7 minutes at this point. 
I rise to support the committee language that is in the bill before us with respect to Vietnam. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to listen carefully to the debate between myself and my colleague from Massachusetts. 
It seems that we can depend on three things anymore in America--death, taxes, and the fact that Senators Kerry and McCain will somehow oppose any language that I try to support in regard to the POW/MIA issue. 
Senator Kerry said that this is not workable, that the term `fully forthcoming' is not workable. Of course it is workable. It is workable because the language says that the President's judgment, the President's own judgment, is based on information available to the U.S. Government. There is nothing unworkable about that language at all. It is very workable. The President has continued to certify the very language that the Senator from Massachusetts wants to revert back to, which was language that I helped to write and put in the bill last year. We are simply upgrading it a little bit. That is not anything to be concerned about. The President still does the certification. It is his judgment. No one is changing that. I might not agree with the President's judgment from time to time, but he has the right to make that judgment under the law. That is the issue here. 
I hope the Senators and their staffs who are monitoring this debate will look at section 405 to see what the Senator from Massachusetts is striking--it is found on page 96 of the committee bill--because it is reasonable. I think most Senators will resist the effort to strike it. It is reasonable. 
Senator Gregg and the committee support this language. The committee language continues a certification process that was begun in 1995 when the President established full diplomatic relations with Vietnam. It has continued, through this year, when the President issued his latest certification in March. Now, whether or not we agree or disagree with the President's certification is not the issue. I happen to disagree. I didn't believe he should have certified based on the evidence. But he did, and he has the right to do that under the law. 
What the committee has done is to further modify the language in an appropriate manner based on developments and communications from the executive branch over the last year. Each time, in the end, the President has complied with the certification process. I have no doubt he will do it this time. In fact, let me refer to the President's own words when he issued the most recent certification in March of this year. 
In making this determination, I wish to reaffirm my continuing personal commitment to the entire POW/MIA community, especially to the immediate families, relatives, friends, and supporters of these brave individuals, and to reconfirm that the central, guiding principle of my Vietnam policy is to achieve the fullest possible accounting of our prisoners of war and missing in action. 
That is the President. I have that document right here, signed by the President of the United States.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. For the Senator from Massachusetts and others now to basically prevent the committee from updating the language based on the President's own words, and based on the words of Sandy Berger and others, sends a terrible message, a message that I simply do not understand, for the life of me, why we have to fight this battle day in and day out, year in and year out, on the floor of the Senate. There is nothing wrong with this language, I say to my colleague, with all respect. The President still has the right to certify. And he does in spite of the fact that I disagree, many times, with his reasoning for the certification. 
To prevent the committee from updating this language sends, I think, a terrible message to the Government of Vietnam: It is OK, do whatever you want. Go ahead, provide us documents, don't provide us documents; provide us access, don't provide us access, it doesn't matter. The families of 2,000-plus American service personnel still unaccounted for, don't worry about it. Our Nation's veterans, we no longer attach the same priorities to the POW/MIA effort in our development of relations with Vietnam which we had in the last 3 years. Don't worry about that. Let's go ahead, pursue lines of trade, sell oil, buy oil, whatever. Set up a full diplomatic mission. Don't worry about these things. Don't worry about POW/MIA. That is a side issue that is not really important. 
That is reason alone for the Senators and my colleagues to table this amendment. Don't send this kind of message to the families. God knows they have been through enough. They support the language in the committee bill. That should be enough right there. These are the people who have suffered. It hasn't been Senator Smith; it hasn't been others on the Senate floor--well, in some cases, there has been great suffering by some of my colleagues in the Vietnam war. But it is the families of the missing who want this message. We should do it for them, if for no other reason. They have been in touch with me as recently as this morning. They passionately object to what the Senator from Massachusetts is trying to do. They have told me that.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, with all due respect of my colleague, on that last point, this is a document entitled the Comprehensive Report of the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on POWs/MIAs, of which Senator John Kerry is a member, and I am, as well as others. In that document, which Senator Kerry signed, is this phrase: 
There is debate within the U.S. side of the commission as to whether the numbers cited in these reports are plausible. The U.S. Government has concluded that there probably is more information in Vietnamese party and military archives that could shed light on these documents. But, to date, such information has not been provided by the Vietnamese government. 
That is an absolute statement signed by Senator Kerry, which goes exactly in the opposite direction of what the Senator is trying to do by striking the language. It says simply that the Vietnamese have not provided all of the information. This commission says so and it was signed by the Senator himself. So I do not understand how the Senator can sign one document and come to the floor and try to strike all the language that supports the document that he signed. I think the whole matter is just subject to great criticism in that regard alone. 
In addition, I have a letter from Sandy Berger, the President's National Security Adviser, that says, `Vietnam's full faith efforts in cooperating on this issue are essential to the development of the relationship.' 
We have that in our language. In addition, there is another letter from Mr. Berger, dated April 10, 1997. The previous one was August 15, 1997. The same point: We will continue efforts already underway to require additional information on these documents, the 735 document, including access to this document, and on and on and on--all of these relating directly to the language. 
In addition, the Senator from Arizona, who I understand is supporting the Senator from Massachusetts, said on the floor of the Senate on April 10, Madam President:  
I thank [the Senator from New Hampshire] because if it had not been for him, this very important letter from the White House would not have come to our leader signed by Sandy Berger, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. It lays out a very important set of priorities for further actions that need to be taken by the United States and by the Vietnamese so that we can finally put this difficult chapter behind us. 
That is exactly what we are doing in this language, laying out this series of priorities. It is updating it and laying out the priorities. I urge my colleagues to simply look at 405 and respect the wishes of the families and veterans groups and others, and please keep the language in there for the sake of those people who have suffered so much throughout this process. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, there is nothing inappropriate at all about continuing the updating of the certification process. The President of the United States still must certify. This does not change that. This does not, as the Senator from Arizona said, close down the consulate at all. It simply says the process, ongoing, is to continue to have the Vietnamese participate fully and cooperate fully with accounting for MIAs. That is all it is. 
We have had correspondence from Mr. Berger on this matter. We have had comments from Senator Kerry himself, and Senator McCain, on the floor, indicating this is a process that should work--forward. So there is absolutely no reason to oppose it. 
I point out, 70 former POWs have supported what I am doing in a letter, as does the American Legion, as does the League of Families, the Alliance of Families, and VVA, and many others. 
I think the evidence is there to say this does not interrupt certification and the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts should be tabled.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Alan Shepard, the first American to fly in space, and a native of Derry, New Hampshire. On Tuesday, this American hero fell victim to leukemia at the age of 74, and leaves behind his widow, Louise, two daughters and six grandchildren. 
As the first American to fly in space, Alan Shepard was a pioneer for manned space exploration as we know it. On May 5, 1961, at a time when the American space program was marked by many failures and setbacks, Shepard courageously made a 15-minute suborbital flight, spending five of those minutes in space, and forever distinguishing himself as an American hero. Shepard was also one of the seven original Mercury astronauts, NASA's first space pioneers. 
On January 31, 1971, Shepard returned to space for his second and last flight as the commander of Apollo 14. This trip allowed Shepard to become the fifth of only twelve Americans ever to walk on the moon, and the only man to hit golf balls playfully on the lunar surface. 
In addition to his space endeavors, Shepard headed NASA's astronaut office in the years between his two flights, and he began investing in banks, oil wells, quarter horses and real estate. Shepard was also a Navy test pilot, sacrificing a great deal for the future of his country. He retired from the space agency and from the Navy as a rear admiral in 1974, in pursuit of many and varied interests. 
Alan Shepard was known for his determination and ready wit. He never backed down from a challenge, and was characterized as the most eager to be picked from among three astronauts who were finalists for the historic first flight. These traits are exactly what make Alan Shepard nothing short of a hero in American history. Without his willingness to make sacrifices for the good of his country, the United States of America never could have achieved such glorious accomplishments in its space programs. He was a modest explorer, a man of integrity, a modern role model and one for ages to come. The bravery of this man gave Americans the confidence to continue pursuing the space program, in spite of the enormous challenges that were in sight. 
Alan Shepard will be missed dearly across the nation, and especially in Derry, New Hampshire, the town of his birth. His motivation and dedication to the American space program and the American people serve to encourage all to welcome challenges and follow dreams to whatever heights they may soar. Let us mark the passing of this great leader not with sadness, but with gratitude and deep appreciation for being such a valiant American.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is with a great deal of personal pleasure that I recognize the major accomplishments of an individual who dedicated his career to serving the interests of our country by strengthening our national security for more than 30 years. 
On August 31, 1998, Mr. Charles L. Fox will retire as Senior Vice President, Congressional Relations for the Raytheon Company. Under Chuck's leadership and dedication, Raytheon has contributed tremendously to the effectiveness of our national security. 
Mr. Fox has headed Raytheon's Congressional Relations Office since May 1995. In this capacity he was responsible for ensuring that issues and programs of interest to Raytheon in supporting national security requirements were communicated to members and staff of Congress in an effective manner. Mr. President, I can tell you, I know of no one more professional than Mr. Fox. In all his dealings with the Congress, he was a true professional, dedicated to ensuring national security interests, and the security of our country were always well served. 
Prior to joining Raytheon, Chuck served a distinguished career of more than twenty seven years in the United States Air Force, retiring as a Colonel.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the life and accomplishments of Thomas Clifford Estes, of New Ipswich, New Hampshire, who recently passed away at the age of 66. 
The family of Tom Estes can take comfort and pride in the way that he lived his life. Born on November 28, 1931, to the late Bedford and Emily Estes of New York, Tom graduated from Erasmus Hall High School and later studied at RCA Institute. 
Following his father's distinguished example in serving this country in the armed forces. Tom joined the United States Navy in 1951, shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War. For three of his four years of active duty, Tom served on the U.S.S. Tarawa, a Navy aircraft carrier that entered the Asian war zone. He earned a number of Navy awards, including the Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, the China Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Good Conduct Medal and the Navy Occupation Service Medal. 
Tom's service to the nation was commendable, not just during the Korean War, but throughout his thirty-two years of Federal civil service. He began his career as a quality assurance engineer for the United States military in Florida and later moved to Dallas, Texas, before settling in New Hampshire in 1967. Upon his retirement, Tom was recognized by the Defense Logistics Agency for his contributions. 
Tom was admired for his integrity, dedication to his community and positive demeanor. He remained a devoted husband to his wife, Mary, throughout almost thirty-five years of marriage and helped care for his disabled sister for many years. An accomplished chess player, Tom also enjoyed baseball and studied the law. He and his wife ran a small, twenty-acre farm in New Ipswich for many years. He was a man who cared about the needs of others and his community, whose sense of humor, cheery smile and knack for storytelling will be missed by all who knew him. 
Tom will be buried with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery on Monday, August 3, 1998. I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Mary, his daughter, Evelyn, his sons Thomas and Peter, and his sister, Nancy. It is my great pleasure to pay tribute to this special American in the official Record of the annals of Congress.

The only thing is, I don't know if there are others who may wish to speak for or against the amendment. I didn't want to preclude that opportunity. I certainly have no objection to going back to your amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this amendment relates to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's new National Instant Criminal Background Check System, otherwise known as the NICS, which is scheduled to take effect on December 1 of this year. 
The so-called Brady Act had two provisions. One of those provisions was an interim provision, and the other was a permanent provision. In the interim provision is the waiting period for gun purchases that is now in effect but which will expire on November 29 of this year. 
Now, the permanent provision, which takes effect on December 1, mandates--I emphasize the word `mandate'--mandates the establishment of a National Instant Criminal Background Check System, known as the NICS, which is to be operated by the Department of Justice. 
The purpose of this National Instant Criminal Background Check is to prevent the purchase of guns by persons with criminal backgrounds who are prohibited otherwise from owning firearms. Under this new system, persons seeking to buy guns will be required to submit certain identifying information for clearance through this NICS. 
Now, this raises serious concerns. I have concerns here that the FBI has stated that in cases where the NICS background check does not locate a disqualifying record, information about that individual, according to the language, will only be retained temporarily for audit purposes and will be destroyed after 18 months. 
My question to my colleagues is this: Why hold on to this information for 18 months? These are innocent people who have no disqualifying record. They are entitled, under the second amendment, to own their firearms. I don't think any records ought to be kept for 18 minutes, let alone 18 months. There is simply no reason that the FBI needs to retain private information on law-abiding American citizens--in this case, gun owners--for any time at all, let alone for 18 months. 
There are no legitimate audit purposes for retaining private information on law-abiding gun owners in the FBI. Now, we have seen abuses. 
We have seen files turning up from the FBI on individuals who happen to appear in the White House, and on and on and on. This is an opportunity to abuse the privacy rights of millions of American gun owners. It is simply wrong if you didn't do anything. If your record is clear and there is no disqualifying information, then there should be no record kept, period. 
I have heard a lot from law-abiding gun owners in the country who view this FBI gun owners ID record retention scheme as an ominous step toward national gun registration, which I believe is probably the ultimate goal here. Justifiably, in my view, they see this plan as a threat to their second amendment right under the Constitution of the United States. I agree with them. I feel deeply about this. I emphasize again that FBI files have been abused, and to keep, for any period of time--especially as long as 18 months--files on people who have done nothing wrong, in the FBI, is wrong. 
Stated simply, my legislation will put a stop to the FBI's plan to keep records of private identifying information on law-abiding citizens who buy guns. My amendment will require the immediate destruction of all information submitted by or on behalf of any person who has been determined not to be prohibited from owning a firearm. 
Mr. President, my amendment has another purpose as well. The Department of Justice has proposed to charge fees--a gun tax, if you will--for the NICS, using the authority of a provision in the 1991 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Act. 
As Appropriations Committee Chairman Stevens noted when he introduced the No Gun Tax Act of 1998 earlier this year, the 1991 Appropriations Act was passed 2 years before the law establishing the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. 
Moreover, as Chairman Stevens properly observed, the 1991 act `was never intended to allow fees under the NICS program.' `This limited 1991 authority,' Senator Stevens noted, `allowed fees only `to process fingerprint identification records and name checks for noncriminal justice * * * and licensing purposes.' `It was not intended,' concluded Senator Stevens, `to apply to programs like the NICS program, which checks the criminal background of purchasers and has nothing to do with licensing.' 
In introducing his No Gun Tax Act of 1998, which I was honored to cosponsor, Senator Stevens also aptly observed that, `The imposition of a fee would encourage some to try to obtain firearms on the black market.' `No matter how you feel about gun control,' Senator Stevens said, `we should all do what we can to make sure that the new background check system works.' 
My amendment would prevent the use of funds by the Department of Justice for the `implementation of any tax or fee' in connection with the implementation of this new National Instant Criminal Background Check System. 
Under the second amendment, law-abiding American citizens have the right to own a firearm. And if the Congress, in its wisdom, decides that we are going to have this background check and a person is not disqualified, he or she should not have to pay for it. It is their constitutional right to have a weapon if they are honest, law-abiding citizens, and they should not have to pay a fee because somebody said they needed to check to find out if they were honest people or not. It is wrong. This is `big brother,' Mr. President, and it is wrong. 
So my amendment would create a civil cause of action, as 
well, on behalf of any person who is aggrieved by a violation of this act, which can be brought in the Federal district court for the district in which the person resides. So if your rights are violated, then you have a right to take this matter to court, as any citizen would. If successful, such a lawsuit would entitle the gun owner wronged by a violation of the provisions of my amendment to an award of damages and any other remedies deemed to be appropriate by the court, including attorney's fees. 
We must not allow a trampling of the second amendment. We must not allow fees to be charged to people who have done nothing except own a firearm and be legal, law-abiding citizens. They should not have to pay a fee. I hope this amendment will have broad support. The sound operation of the new National Instant Criminal Background Check requires neither the retention of ID records on law-abiding gun purchasers nor the imposition of a user-fee gun tax. 
So, in conclusion, let me just say, No. 1, my amendment says if the background check is conducted, no record is kept if you have done nothing wrong, you are a law-abiding person, and you are entitled to that gun. No record is kept, period. Secondly, no fee is charged. Thirdly, if records are kept in violation of this act, then you have a remedy in court. 
That is the amendment, Mr. President. So I say to my colleagues, if you support the second amendment and the rights of law-abiding people not to be harassed, you will support my amendment. We have seen harassment by the IRS, and this will invite harassment by the FBI if we do not stop this process. How many files will be retained? What information will be used on these people in these files? When I think of the FBI and I think of a file held in the FBI on somebody, I think of someone perhaps doing something wrong or being accused of doing something wrong. These people have done nothing wrong, except own a gun. That is not wrong; that is legal under the Constitution of the United States. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, let me explain this amendment. I have heard some very interesting remarks on the other side about Brady and registration. That is not what my amendment is--very eloquent, but that is not what my amendment is. 
My amendment does three things. First, it prevents the FBI from keeping a file on a law-abiding citizen who, after he had the gun checked, came up fine, clear. Why would we want the FBI to maintain a file on a law-abiding gun owner who did nothing wrong except exercise his constitutional right to own a gun? They want 18 months to keep these files. I don't want 18 seconds. I want these files destroyed immediately. That is point one in my amendment. 
Second, my amendment prevents the FBI from imposing a tax on people who use this national instant criminal background check system because they want simply to exercise their right to own a gun. That is the second point. Why should they be taxed for that? Why should they pay this fee? It could be up to $20 to $25 just to do this--maybe more. That is to start. There is no reason why anybody should pay a fee. You are an individual who has a constitutional right to own a gun. Somebody in the Government decides that they want to check you out, fine. You check out clear. Why should you have to pay for that? You didn't ask for it; it is your right. The person who is a criminal or a person who is not entitled to have that gun because of something they did, fine, they can pay for it, and they should pay for it and they shouldn't get the gun. But that is not the people about whom we are talking. 
Third, if the Government, in violation of the law, holds these files, you have the right to pursue this matter in court, which is the proper procedure. 
I simply ask my colleagues, Why would you keep a file in the FBI on an innocent person who did nothing except own a gun, which is his constitutional right to do so? That is what this amendment is about. If you want those files maintained, then you would vote against this amendment. This is Big Brother at its worst. It is Big Brother at its worst. 
It is coming in and taking privacy--your privacy; you have the right not to have that file in the FBI, and they don't have the right to put it there, because you did nothing wrong. That is what this amendment is about. 
Secondly, it is about a tax. If you want to charge these fees, so be it. But then you can vote against my amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I respond to my friend by repeating what Senator Craig said a moment ago. There is $100 million in the law to do this, so we don't need to be charging additional fees. That is No. 1. 
No. 2, it is interesting how we pick out certain constitutional rights and say we are going to tax them and not others. Maybe we should tax everybody for having free speech. Or maybe we should tax everybody for reading the newspaper. Maybe we should tax everybody for going to church. 
It doesn't make sense. It is our constitutional right. 
Let me repeat, again. No. 1, this amendment prevents the FBI from keeping files on innocent people who simply had a background check done on them who did nothing wrong and were perfectly entitled to own a gun. 
Secondly, the amendment prevents the FBI from imposing a tax on these people. Thirdly, it allows a person to go to court if the FBI does that. We have seen abuses by the FBI. We have seen files held in the White House. Do you want this to go on? That is what this issue is about. That is what my amendment is about. I hope my colleagues will support me on this amendment because this is more than a gun issue--this is a privacy issue. 
I yield the remainder of my time.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Rick Metts of Derry, New Hampshire, on being named the 1998 `Citizen of the Year' by the Greater Derry Chamber of Commerce. Rick has earned this very special honor as a result of his many years of volunteer work for a variety of different organizations in the City of Derry. 
At the Derry Village Rotary Club, Rick has been Sergeant at Arms for the past seven years and has participated in every fundraiser, project and event the club has held. As a member of the club's Social Committee, Rick has helped organize Pot-Luck suppers and Yankee Swaps, and has served as the Master of Ceremonies for Pictionary Games. Rick has also demonstrated his commitment to education, as he and his family have co-sponsored scholarships given to outstanding vocational students. 
In addition to his work at the Rotary Club, Rick is also active in a number of other organizations in his community. He is currently serving his second three-year term on the Derry School Board and has held the position of Chair twice. Rick also has shown his true dedication to children through his work with the Boys & Girls Club of Greater Derry. For the past two years, Rick has chaired the Club's largest fundraiser, which features a gourmet dinner as well as both a silent and live auction. He has also coached and refereed many basketball games for the club and recreation teams. Rick has also been a longtime member and supporter of the Greater Derry Chamber of Commerce. 
According to one of his close friends, Rick Metts `never has to be asked, he always volunteers.' The many ways Rick has found to be involved in his community are a true testament to that statement. Rick embodies that great spirit of volunteerism that helped make this nation great. I want to again congratulate Rick Metts on being named `Citizen of the Year' and it is with great pride that I represent him in the United States Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. As the Senator from Arizona knows, I took the lead as Chairman of the Armed Services Committee's Strategic Subcommittee in drafting these reporting requirements. I think that, if what the Senator has been told is accurate, the Administration's conduct would not only be unresponsive to the mandate of Congress, but irresponsible with respect to our national defense. 
It would be completely unacceptable if Congress were to be denied information it has sought, not because the information is unavailable, but because its conclusions are inconvenient to an Administration that is determined to do everything it can to prevent the deployment of missile defenses. 
As Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee it is my responsibility to ensure that missile defense programmatic decisions are based upon solid information and facts. The report we are currently discussing is key to my subcommittee's future decisions on program direction and funding for missile defense. This report is one part of the process of examining our NMD program objectively, comparing the merits of each and deciding where future resources should be applied.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the players of the Kingswood High School varsity baseball team for winning their first division championship. 
As any baseball fan well knows, winning a division championship is no easy task. Yet what makes the Knights' season all the more remarkable is the fact that they ended their season with a spectacular record of 22 wins and only 1 loss. The Knights battled for the championship against Somersworth High School. Pitcher Kyle Frank and the team's four other seniors, Allie Shelley, Shaun St. Ong, Corey Eastman and Matt Pearson, led their team to an 8-5 victory to win the school's first championship. 
Equally as important as the team's victory is the way the players carry themselves both on and off the field. The Kingswood Knights' hard work, fierce determination and positive attitude in the face of tough competition are traits that exemplify true champions and should make every student at Kingswood Regional High School proud. 
The Kingswood Knights are a refreshing example of a principle that often gets lost in today's sports world: dedicated baseball playing. The Knights play because of a love and respect for the game of baseball and this is evident in their division championship. 
Kingswood's victory is also very special to me personally. Twenty years ago, as a teacher at Kingswood Regional High School, I had the privilege of coaching the Knights and, in fact, had Coach Chip Skelley on my team. Mr. President, I want to once again congratulate the Kingswood Knights as well as Coach Skelley and Assistant Coach Bill Rollins. It is an honor to represent the Kingswood Knights in the United States Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is not my intention to delay the Senate. I have a very serious amendment, and I have a few moments of time and would like to outline what it is. If there is not a lot of argument on the other side, I say to my colleagues, we could have a vote in a very few minutes. 
The amendment is very simple. It just limits the use of funds to support the continued deployment of ground forces of the United States in Bosnia pending a vote of Congress on the continuation of deployment, and to require the President to submit a plan for withdrawal, if the Congress does not do so by March 31. 
Very simply put, Mr. President--Mr. President, may I have order.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It simply says that we will have a vote, that the Congress will go on record one way or the other. It doesn't say we have to vote yes. It doesn't say we have to vote no. It just simply says that we exercise our opinion so that the Congress can speak, so that we will be on record one way or the other. Leaving forces in Bosnia, taking them out, whatever that vote turns out to be, that is all this amendment does. If the President decides to keep them there after that, then so be it. But we go on record as making a statement. This does not get into some of the other issues that have been gotten into. 
I would just like to briefly go back a little bit to remind Senators, because we hear a lot of talk of frustration about the Bosnia operation, about why our troops are there, how long are they going to be there, people complaining about being misled by the President or not being told the truth by the President and all this. I am hearing all of these comments and here is our chance with this amendment to be heard. It just seems to me if we vote against this amendment, I don't see any reason why we should be complaining about the operation. 
I remind my colleagues of some testimony. Secretary of Defense Perry on December 1, 1995, said the following: 
We believe the mission in Bosnia can be accomplished in 1 year. So we built our plan based on that time line. And this schedule is realistic because the specific military tasks in the agreement can be completed in the first 6 months and thereafter IFOR's role will be to maintain the climate of stability that will permit civil work to go forward. We expect these civil functions will be successfully initiated in 1 year, but even if some of them are not, we must not be drawn into a posture of indefinite garrison. 
Further, on December 6, 1995, Assistant Secretary of State Holbrooke said: 
The military tasks are doable within 12 months. There isn't any question. The deeper question is whether the nonmilitary functions can be done in 12 months. That is the real question. But it is not the NATO or U.S. force responsibility to do that. It is us on the civilian side working with the Europeans. It is going to be tough. Should the military stick around until every refugee has gone home, until everything else in the civilian annex has been done? 
No, that is not their mission. That is what Secretary Holbrooke said. 
So, Mr. President, the mission to Bosnia has very strong advocates and strong detractors. We have heard that in the debate in these past few hours. My amendment does not seek to open that discussion nor to close it. It really has nothing to do with that. It simply asks that Members of Congress at some point between now and March 31 of next year, 1999, cast a vote on the wisdom of the United States-Bosnia policy. That is all it does.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The Senator is exactly correct. It gives us the opportunity to go on record as saying, one, let's just keep going, doing what we are doing. If you vote against the resolution, you can do that, or if you want to get out. But the point is we vote. This says that we have to have a vote by March 31 before we spend the rest of the money for the 6 months of the fiscal year 1999. 
That is all it says. Now, however we vote is another issue. Then Senators go on record one way or the other--get out, stay in, either one, but they will be on record instead of all the complaining that we hear around here about the Bosnia policy. Why would anybody object? This is not asking us to vote yes. It is not asking us to vote no. It is asking us to vote, have a vote.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The Senator is correct. I would have preferred the stronger version myself, but given the fact that we didn't have the votes, I decided to step back and just say, look, let's go on record. Let's have the opportunity to go on record. It doesn't require that the vote be affirmative for the money to be released, only that a vote takes place. 
So to require that a vote take place and to have that vote taken seriously, my amendment uses the constitutional power that Senator Byrd spoke so eloquently of an hour or so ago of Congress to restrict funds. The amendment holds back half the money authorized for Bosnia operations next year until a vote is held--not a vote to leave them there, not a vote to take them out--a vote on a resolution authorizing continued deployment 
of U.S. ground combat forces to Bosnia. If it fails, the only result is that the President is required to tell us how and when he intends to withdraw. The money is still released. 
The purpose is simple and straightforward. It is to use a small amount of leverage, half of next year's money, to force Congress to express itself--that is all, to express itself--clearly on the Bosnia mission. The resolution may pass, it may fail, but at least Congress will have expressed itself. 
As the Senator from West Virginia has said so eloquently a while ago, why would Congress want to step away from its constitutional responsibilities if it doesn't tell the President what to do? It doesn't restrict the President. It doesn't get into troop strength. It doesn't get into deployment. It doesn't get into any of that. It just simply says Congress will have a vote. 
Let me just say this. Before we have a vote on this amendment, I would say to my colleagues that our constituents elected us to represent them. How can we represent them if we are afraid to just express ourselves on the Senate floor one way or the other? They expect us to stand and be counted on major foreign policy issues, and I can't think of any excuse that we would give our constituents that would justify refusing to even have a vote on the resolution on Bosnia. 
So I would urge my colleagues to accept some responsibility for United States-Bosnia policy, stand up and be counted and to pass the amendment. 
Let me be a little more specific, in summary, as to what the amendment does. It is going to withhold half of next year's funding for Bosnia until Congress votes on the issue. It doesn't require that the mission be approved, just that the vote is one way or the other. The purpose is to honor the very strong arguments and strong feelings on both sides of the issue--both sides of the issue--by requiring the debate and a vote. I hope my colleagues understand this amendment because I think there have been some expressions of misunderstanding. 
As the Senator from West Virginia so eloquently said awhile back, the only leverage that Congress has is funding. That is our leverage. I think to use it in this manner is to use it responsibly. Unless we place some restriction on it, there will be no pressure to debate anything and no pressure to vote on anything, and the debate itself will not, in my view, ever be taken seriously. You know: sense of the Senate, sense of the House--these resolutions, they don't mean anything. 
So, to try to get in the middle here so we can get some common ground, just to have a vote rather than go one way or the other, is my goal. I do not think that is asking that much, that the American people, through their elected representatives, declare either their support for or opposition to this. 
Don't you think your constituents are entitled to know how you feel, on the record, not in some speech where it is easy to say something and then walk it back a little later, but on the record with a vote? I don't think that is unreasonable. I think it is in everyone's interests to have this vote. I have been trying to offer this amendment for a long, long time. I have been put off on certain other vehicles because it was not the appropriate place to do it, they said. I don't know what the appropriate place is. 
I remember, as some of my colleagues will who are here on the floor with me, I remember similar debates on the floor of the Senate and the House of Representatives while people were dying every day in Vietnam. While those men and women were honorably serving their country, the debate raged on and nobody had the guts to do one thing or the other, either win the war or get out. I am not saying this is Vietnam, yet. But we do have a situation here where I believe Congress should go on record. 
I happen to be a critic of the mission. I agree with Senator Inhofe and I supported Senator Inhofe in his mission here, if you will, to end the deployment. But that is not what I am trying to do here. If the Senators on both sides cannot force themselves to vote, take a public position, then I don't understand how they can continue to talk about it and complain about it and attack the President and say: `Oh, the President's going to do this,' or, `We might get stuck in Bosnia,' or, `We ought to do this,' or, `We ought to do that.' Here is your chance to say, one way or the other. I want to have a vote. That is all it says. No more complaining about costs. No more second-guessing the President. Just stand up and be counted. Yes, we will have a vote, and when we take that vote, we can decide one way or the other what we want to do. 
I think I have made the case on this amendment. It uses funding leverage. It is an appropriate congressional tool. It does not micromanage the executive branch, as some people have expressed a lot of concern about. It does not do that. It doesn't tell the President how to conduct his operations. But it does say that we ought to have a vote, and I think it calls for a future vote. Don't wait until next year or the year after; let's have the vote. Let's let the American people know how we feel. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. With all due respect, the Senator misunderstands my amendment, because that is not what my amendment does. You just articulated the policy that you supported. Even if your side would lose in the debate that we would have in Congress--let's say we have the debate. If your side lost, the money would still be released. If my side loses --I happen to favor withdrawal--if I lost, the money would still be released. 
All my amendment calls for is a vote. It doesn't say that if we vote to get out on March 31 that the money is not released. The money is still released. 
This is on the Senator's time. He has been very generous. The only conclusion I can draw is the Senator just doesn't want a vote in the Congress at all.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Foster's Daily Democrat on its 125th birthday. 
On June 18, 1873, Foster's first paper proclaimed, `We shall devote these columns mainly to the vital interests of Dover and vicinity. Whatever may tend to benefit this people and enhance their prosperity, will receive our warm and enthusiastic support.' 
Our nation and indeed the world has changed many times since that day 125 years ago when Foster's first made that commitment to its readers. Ulysses Grant was president and the United States had just gone through the most destructive and divisive war in its history. Since then, the United States has fought two world wars, an economic depression and the Cold War. 
Yet in over 125 years, one thing has always stayed the same: Foster's commitment to truth, journalistic integrity and its readers. It is that unyielding commitment that has made Foster's Daily Democrat the nation's longest continuously managed and owned newspaper by direct family descendants of its founder in the United States. As the paper itself eloquently states, `When your family's name is at the top of every page, you try a lot harder.' 
Foster's has also been a leader in applying technological advancements to the field of newspaper publishing. In 1964, it became the first newspaper in New Hampshire to use offset printing as a way to produce brighter and sharper newspapers. 
At a time in our nation's history when journalists and the media in general are often accused of fostering cynicism, the people at Foster's have been reporting news to the men and women of New Hampshire while never sacrificing the principles of Joshua Lane Foster, the paper's founder. Congratulations to current publisher Robert Foster and all the other hard working men and women at Foster's Daily Democrat on your 125th birthday. It is an honor to represent you in the United States Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, later this year, under the so-called Brady Law, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) will go into effect. The purpose of NICS is to prevent the purchase of guns by persons who are prohibited from owning firearms. 
Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, on June 4, 1998, the United States Department of Justice published in the Federal Register a notice of its intention to establish a new system of records with respect to NICS to be maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. 
I am particularly concerned about the statement in the Justice Department's June 4 notice that states that `[i]n cases where the NICS background check does not locate a disqualifying record, information about the individual will only be retained temporarily for audit purposes and will be destroyed after eighteen months.' 
It seems to me, Mr. President, that there is no reason whatever why the FBI would need to retain private information on a law-abiding citizen for any time at all, let alone for eighteen months, after that person has been determined not to be someone who is prohibited by law from owning a firearm. Any legitimate `audit purposes' could certainly be addressed without retaining such private information on file at the FBI.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Roger Wood, an institution in the broadcast community of New Hampshire. After 18 years as a radio reporter in New Hampshire, and 30 years in broadcasting, Roger will sign off at the end of this month to pursue other endeavors. 
Roger, 50, is the news and public affairs director at WOKQ radio in Dover, New Hampshire. WOKQ is one of the largest stations in New Hampshire and, with its country music format, is my unequaled favorite. I am a WOKQ listener not only for the playlist, but because of the outstanding commitment, dignity and character that Roger Wood has brought to the airwaves in my years as an avid listener. 
Roger's distinguished voice has broadcast the news to WOKQ's audience since 1979. Before that, Roger was a one-man news shop at WHEB AM/FM in nearby Portsmouth, and worked at a variety of Seacoast stations including WWNH in Rochester, WBBX in Portsmouth and New Hampshire Public Television. He also worked at a number of stations in his native Pennsylvania before he graced the Granite State with his presence in 1970. 
Roger was never one to `rip and read.' He always researched stories thoroughly, went the extra mile to get an interview, and provided in-depth coverage from both a human interest and hard news perspective. And he has the awards lining his walls that prove it. 
Roger Wood is committed to his profession. He has won recognition from UPI, AP, the New Hampshire Association of Broadcasters, and other organizations in the categories of outstanding reporting, best newscasts and individual achievement. He has said that one of the achievements that most touched him was his coverage in 1986 on the fatal launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger, with New Hampshire teacher Christa McAuliffe on board. Roger was at Cape Canaveral in person, and has said the implications of the explosion left him `deeply moved.' 
Although Roger Wood is a veteran newscaster, he is a trend setter for the new generation of broadcasters. He led WOKQ to an innovative partnership with Channel 7 in Boston, establishing the largest news exchange network in the region. He has also implemented the first cellular car phone reporting system in the region, for listeners to report accidents and news `they see happening.' 
Roger is committed to his community, as exemplified by involvement in the Seacoast Housing Partnership, a nonprofit organization dedicated to affordable housing issues; the Mayor's Blue Ribbon Committee to improve the environment of Pierce Island; the Greater Seacoast Economic Summit; and his volunteer work to help many local citizens in poverty. 
Most importantly, Roger is committed to his family. He and his wife, Elaine, have been married for 27 years. They have three grown children, Roger, Jr., Emily, and Melissa. His family can be very proud of his achievements, and glad that they will finally have him around for breakfast! 
My interviews with Roger always left us sharing a laugh and, though he rarely took any of my suggestions for use in the `Joke Du Jour,' his resulting stories were always fair, thorough, and forthright as is always Roger's style. As he embraces future endeavors in the field of communications and public relations, I wish Roger Wood all the best. I am proud to represent him in the United States Senate, and proud to call him my friend.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Aaron Lopez of Nashua, NH. Aaron was recently named the New Hampshire State Youth of the Year by the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. 
The Youth of the Year program, in its 51st year, recognizes outstanding contributions to a member's family, school, community, and Boys and Girls Club, as well as personal challenges and obstacles overcome. 
At the Club, Aaron has served as president of the Toastmasters, treasurer of the Keystone Club, a teen leadership group, and peer leader of Smart Moves, a drug and sex prevention program. Aaron, a senior at Nashua High School, is also active in his community. He participated in the Teen Institute, a leadership seminar to educate teens about drug and alcohol abuse, violence, teen pregnancy, and family and community issues. He is also organizing a program for Parents and Children Together (P.A.C.T.) to help families resolve conflicts. 
For the first time, winners of the 1998 State Youth of the Year honors will receive scholarships for post-secondary education from popular television personality Oprah Winfrey. A nationwide fund drive, known as `Oprah's Angel Network,' was announced by Oprah on her nationally-syndicated television program last fall. 
Boys and Girls Clubs of America comprises a national network of close to 2,000 neighborhood-based facilities annually serving some three million young people, primarily from disadvantaged circumstances. Known as `The Positive Place for Kids,' the Clubs provide guidance-oriented character development programs on a daily basis for children 6-18 years old, conducted by a full-time professional staff. Key Boys and Girls Club programs, such as Youth of the Year, emphasize character and leadership development, education and career enhancement, health and life skills, the arts, sports, fitness and recreation. 
Aaron and other extraordinary young people from the Boys and Girls Clubs of America continue to keep alive the virtue of community service and inspire others to do the same. Their personal initiatives, dedicated service, and hard work have impacted the lives of many. In a time when young people seem to be less involved in their communities, these young Americans continue to defend and keep the spirit of community alive. I want to congratulate Aaron Lopez for his outstanding work and I am proud to represent him in the United States Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jacquelyn Benson and Alexander Kaufman of New Hampshire for being named 1998 United States Presidential Scholars. 
Jacquelyn Benson is a student at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, and has been active in her school's National Honor Society and Art Department. Jacquelyn plays the piano, is currently working on a book of fiction, and plans to attend Northeastern University in the fall. She chose Ms. Toni Talas as her most influential teacher. 
Alexander Kaufman is also a 1998 Presidential Scholar. As a student at Phillips Exeter Academy in Dover, New Hampshire, Alexander has excelled in writing and math and was the editor of the school's poetry journal. He is also active in environmental issues and will be attending Harvard University in the fall. Alexander selected the late Frederick Tremallo as his most influential teacher. 
The United States Presidential Scholars Program was established in 1964, by Executive Order of President Johnson, to recognize and honor some of our nation's most distinguished graduating high school seniors. Each year, the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars selects up to 141 Scholars on the basis of their accomplishments in many areas: academic and artistic success, scholarship, leadership, and involvement in school and community. The Commission invites the students to Washington, DC, to be honored for their accomplishments during National Recognition Week. 
The Scholars, as guests of the Commission, along with their families and the teachers whom the Scholars have chosen as the `most influential' in their academic and artistic endeavors, will be involved in many activities while in Washington, DC. They will participate in informative panel discussions, a ceremony sponsored by the White House, a reception and art exhibit of the work by Scholars in the Visual Arts at the National Museum for American Art, and an evening at the Kennedy Center featuring performances by the Scholars in the Performing Arts. 
As a former teacher and school board chairman, I recognize the challenges involved in providing students a quality education. Congratulations to Jacquelyn and Alexander for their distinguished recognition. I am pleased they have been recognized for their success and it is with great pleasure that I represent them in the United States Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, our Nation's founding document, the Declaration of Independence, ultimately proclaimed that the right to life comes from God and that it is unalienable. Life itself, the declaration held, is the fundamental right without which the rights of liberty and the pursuit of happiness have no meaning. As the author of the declaration, Thomas Jefferson, wrote, `The care of human life and not its destruction . . . is the first and only object of good government.' 
It is important and I think proper to note that without that basic right of life, there is no liberty, there is no opportunity to pursue happiness in any way, shape, or form. 
One hundred ninety-seven years after that Declaration of Independence, in 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court violated this most sacred principle of the declaration. In Roe versus Wade, the Supreme Court held that the entire class of unborn children--from fertilization to birth--have no right to life and may be destroyed at will. As we know, the statistics are pretty dramatic. Thirty-five million children since Roe versus Wade were denied the opportunity to be born. Without getting into the reasons or the explanations or the rationale, the result is that 35 million children were denied that right. 
In subsequent cases, the Court has zealously guarded the right to abortion that the Court created. The Court has repeatedly rejected all meaningful attempts by the States to protect the unalienable right to life of unborn children since that decision in 1973. 
Mr. President, those of us who support the pro-life cause must never lose sight of our ultimate goal. Our objective is very simple. It is not complicated. It is to keep the promise of the Declaration of Independence. There is only one way to do that, Mr. President, and that is to overturn Roe versus Wade and restore to unborn children their God-given right to life, a God-given right that our Constitution. I believe, and certainly the declaration, gave them. And the Court took it away--a court, by the way, that is sworn to uphold the Constitution. 
In order to keep that hope alive in the Senate today, Mr. President, I am introducing two legislative proposals, and I am pleased and honored that the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms, and the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft, are joining me as original cosponsors of both measures. 
Senator Helms for many, many years--long before my time in the Senate--had the courage to stand here on the Senate floor day after day, week after week, taking insult after insult but supporting the lives of unborn children. I believe history will judge Senator Helms very prominently in this regard. And Senator Ashcroft, with less time in the Senate, is certainly a strong proponent and advocate of the right to life of unborn children. 
Let me talk specifically about the bills--first, a bill, the Human Life Act of 1998. The human life bill sets forth the findings of Congress that `the right to life is the paramount and most fundamental right of a person' and that `the life of each human being begins at fertilization.' Based on these findings, and in the exercise of the power of Congress under section 5 of the 14th amendment, my bill establishes that the word `person,' as used in the Constitution, applies to all human beings, including unborn children, because, Mr. President, an unborn child is a human being. 
I have never been able to understand the rationale, as many times as it has been debated here on the floor, how one can say that an unborn child is not a human being. Remember, if it is a human being, it deserves the right of protection under the Constitution of the United States. 
As one Senator, I will freely admit that when fertilization occurred, I was created. There was a sequence of time that occurred after that caused me to be here today, standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate. If it had been interrupted at any stage from that moment of fertilization until today, I wouldn't be here. 
The effect of this legislative determination that the unborn child is a human being and, therefore, a `person' would be to place unborn children under constitutional shield of due process and equal protection clauses of the 14th amendment. Thus, the right to life of every unborn person would be protected to the same extent that the right to life of all born persons is guaranteed by our Constitution. 
Mr. President, today we have seen in this day and this age a number of violent acts: School shootings, violence of children upon children, of children upon parents, terrible violence. I think we have a cultural problem. Most Americans would not deny that. 
I think it is fair to say that we need to set an example as adults--those who are supposedly leaders of our country not only here in the Senate, or in the White House, or in the Congress, but also at the head of our communities, our families, whatever else. Whatever the role we may play as parents, as citizens, or husbands, or wives. I think we have a role to set an example. I would ask here on the floor of the Senate my colleagues: Are we setting an example for young people to follow when, at the will of any individual at any time after fertilization occurs, we say or we tolerate that that unborn child's life may be ended? It is an innocent life. It is a life who can't speak here on the floor of U.S. Senate. No child who is unborn has the opportunity to stand up on the floor and say, `I'd like to live; I'd like to have the opportunity to raise a family, to be a leader, to be a preacher, be a Senator, be a doctor, to cure cancer, to be a teacher, be a good mom, a good dad. I would like to have that opportunity.' I think they would say if they could speak that they do not have that opportunity. 
I think of those 35 million children, I say to my colleagues, since 1973 whose lives have been ended. How many of those children may have lived to find that cure for cancer or may have lived to have made a difference in a life--perhaps one of those lives of those children who took the lives of others? Perhaps one of these children who died may have been a counselor, may have been somebody on the spot who may have made a difference. We will never know, because those 35 million lives are gone--never had the opportunity to be happy, never had the opportunity to be successful, never had the opportunity to live--gone. And we did it. We did it because of that Supreme Court decision. It is wrong. 
I am reminded of Abraham Lincoln--a totally different issue but very similar in terms of its scope. Abraham Lincoln didn't take polls when he stood up in the United States of America in the 1860s and said: Slavery is wrong. It is wrong to enslave an American, or any individual, because of the color of their skin. And he spoke out against it. He spoke out eloquently against it, and he didn't take polls. He didn't stand up at a press conference and say to his aide, `I am going to examine the feelings of my constituents on this. Would you please take a poll and find out whether the majority of the American people favor slavery or oppose slavery?' 
I am reminded of what Lincoln said. I don't have the exact quote in front of me. I am going to paraphrase it from memory. He said: They tell me not to oppose slavery in the slave States, because they have left the country, so it is not our concern. They tell me not to oppose slavery in the free States, because we don't need to because they are free. They tell me not to oppose slavery from the pulpit, because it is not religion. And they tell me not to oppose slavery in politics, because it causes too much of a fuss. 
Substitute abortion for slavery in each of those four examples and you have the same situation. If we can't oppose it in any of the 50 States, if we can't oppose it in politics, if we can't oppose it in religion, where does that leave the unborn children who will never have the opportunity to stand up here and debate this issue? 
The right to life of every unborn person should be protected to the same extent as the right to life of all born persons. How can anybody in America, any Christian in the Judeo-Christian culture of America, not believe that? 
I know the insults. I have been the victim of them. I know the taunts. I know the recriminations that come from standing up here and making these comments. But it is nothing--nothing--compared to what those unborn children endure because they have been denied after they have been created by God himself. Man denies them the right to life, that life. 
I am reminded of Gianna Jesson, a young woman, perhaps 23 or 24 now, who was aborted. She was aborted. I saw her sing `Amazing Grace'in front of 1,000 people a couple of years ago in which she said `I am thankful to my God to be where I am today, and I forgive my mother.' Well, I say that is powerful, Mr. President. I have never seen anything to equal it. Not from the lips of any politician or any pastor have I ever seen testimony stronger or more powerful than that young woman crippled by abortion standing up before 1,000 people and singing `Amazing Grace.' There was not a dry eye in the place. That woman deserved the right to live. So did every one of those 
other 35 million children who have been denied. 
There is only one way to stop this. We can preach about it. We can talk about it. We can debate it in politics. We can sing, or be quiet and be silent. But there is only way to stop it. We have to change the Court. The Supreme Court is wrong. In 1857, the Supreme Court said in the Dred Scott decision that a slave could not sue in federal court because he was property and not human. Chief Justice Roger Taney made that decision. The Supreme Court is not omnipotent. Roger Taney was wrong in that decision. He was wrong. And Roe v. Wade was wrong. And we need to change it. 
My bill provides that nothing--nothing--in it `shall prohibit a law allowing justification to be shown for only those medical procedures required to prevent the death of either the pregnant woman or her unborn offspring as long as such a law requires every reasonable effort be made to preserve the lives of both of them.' 
I am also introducing a joint resolution that would submit the human life amendment to the States for ratification as part of the Constitution of the United States. Specifically and more directly, I am introducing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to protect the lives of unborn children. It has been done before. It has been introduced before, and it has gone nowhere. It doesn't mean that it should not be introduced again and again and again and again until somehow, someway the message is received in this country that we have to protect the lives of these innocent children. 
Let me explain why I am proposing a human life amendment in addition to the human life bill. If the human life bill were to be enacted into law and its constitutionality upheld by the Supreme Court, it could be weakened or repealed by some Congress of the future. But a human life amendment to the Constitution could not be altered or repealed except by another constitutional amendment. Thus, my human life amendment would provide more durable protection to the fundamental right to life of unborn children. 
Like the human life bill, the human life amendment restores the word `person' in the Constitution to its original and natural meaning by making clear that it includes all human beings--all human beings--born and unborn. 
I have witnessed the birth of three of my children. It is a privilege that I am glad I had. I will tell you something. There is no difference between the 15 or 20 minutes before the child was born, when it was in the womb and I could not see it, and 15 or 20 minutes after the child was born when I saw my daughter and my two sons for the first time. There is no difference. Why is it right and proper under the law to kill 
that child 20 minutes or 20 days or 20 months before that wonderful time when the child comes into the world? Why is it right to do that and wrong to do it 20 minutes or 20 months or 20 years after? It is wrong in both cases. It is wrong in both cases. 
So the human life amendment includes the same language as the bill regarding medical procedures required to prevent the death of either the pregnant woman or her unborn offspring. 
I introduce these two legislative proposals and I realize as I stand here today that there is not sufficient support in the Congress to restore legal protection of the right to life of unborn children in this country, but I believe ultimately we will prevail. When the abolitionists stood in this Chamber in the 1820s and the 1830s and the 1840s and they said that slavery was wrong, they did not prevail either, but ultimately they did because they were right. And we are right. It is wrong to take the lives of unborn children, and someday, someway, somehow, the American people are going to come to realize this, and they are going to throw everybody out of here who will not support the changing of that court. That is what they are going to do. 
One of our Nation's greatest Presidents, in my estimation, Ronald Reagan, had the same confidence that the right-to-life cause someday will prevail. He believed it deep into his being. I can remember meeting personally with President Reagan and discussing this issue with him. I know how deeply he felt about it, and I also know the attacks he had, but I would ask my colleagues who somehow are a bit timid to stand up; when this issue comes up, they hide, many of them. They are worried about the political repercussions. Well, those repercussions of politics are not as bad as what Gianna Jesson went through when she was aborted. Here is what Reagan said 14 years ago in a book called `Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation.'  
Despite the formidable obstacles before us, we must not lose heart. This is not the first time our country has been divided by a Supreme Court decision that denied the value of certain human lives. 
This is a reference to what I talked about earlier. 
The Dred Scott decision of 1857 was not overturned in a day, or a year, or even a decade. At first, only a minority of Americans recognized and deplored the moral crisis brought about by denying the full humanity of our black brothers and sisters; but that minority persisted in their vision and finally prevailed. They did it by appealing to the hearts and to the minds of their countrymen, to the truth of human dignity under God. From their example, we know that respect for the sacred value of human life is too deeply ingrained in the hearts of our people to remain forever suppressed. 
Mr. President, I close by addressing my colleagues in the Senate. Each one of us, every one of us, started out in life as an unborn child. We were once, all of us, very small human beings living in our mother's wombs. As President Reagan wrote, `Abortion concerns not just the unborn child, it concerns every one of us,' because we would not be here if our parents had made that awful decision. 
The English poet, John Donne said, `Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind; and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.' 
`It tolls for thee.' 
My colleagues, regardless of where you have stood on abortion in the past, regardless of the acrimonious debate, 
regardless of the hard feelings, regardless of the political pressures, the contributions, the political attacks, I urge you to search your conscience and to search your soul and ask yourself, is it right, is it really right to kill an unborn child? 
I am not interested in hearing about all of the social conditions of the person who is having the child. That is another issue. I am not asking you to comment about the plight of that child when it is born. That is another issue. I am asking you to think, reach down in your souls like you would have if you stood on this floor in 1840 talking about slavery, if you were an abolitionist. I am asking you to search your soul and I am asking you to say, Is it right; is it right? And if it is not right, then you have an obligation to support this amendment and to help me to right a wrong. 
I am pledging here today in this Chamber that as long as I am a Senator, and as long as I am alive, I am going to work for the passage of this amendment. I have two cosponsors this morning. That is all I have. But I know there are more people who agree with me in both political parties. Frankly, I am going to be talking to them, every one of them. It is not an in-your-face situation. This is an in-your-heart situation--not the face, the heart. Is it right or is it wrong? If you can look me in the eye and tell me it is right to take the life of an unborn, innocent child, then I will not bother you anymore. But if you don't tell me that, then I am going to keep on bothering you and try to get your support. 
I hope you will decide to join me in cosponsoring both of these measures and place the lives of the unborn children of our Nation once again under the protection of our great Constitution. The only way to do that, in my opinion, is through the amendment.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I would like to announce that today there will be a period for morning business until the hour of 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 1415, the tobacco legislation, with several amendments still pending. It is hoped that short time agreements can be reached on those amendments so that remaining amendments to this important bill may be offered and debated. 
As a reminder to all Members, a cloture motion was filed by the minority leader to the tobacco committee substitute. Under rule XXII, Senators have until 1 p.m. today to file first-degree amendments to the modified tobacco committee substitute. The leader has also announced that there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. Therefore, the cloture vote and any votes offered with respect to the tobacco bill today will be postponed to occur at a later date. As always, Members will be notified of the voting schedule next week as it becomes available.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to require Vietnam to provide freedom of emigration for the Vietnamese people before tax dollars from our constituents across America are used to further expand our government's trade relations with this communist regime. As provided for in the Trade Act of 1974, my resolution prohibits implementation of the President's decision yesterday to waive the freedom of emigration requirements with Vietnam. 
I am pleased that Senator Helms, the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has joined me as a sponsor of this joint resolution, and I commend my colleague, Congressman Rohrabacher, for introducing a companion measure in the House. I also note that our efforts are strongly supported by the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee, Congressman Gilman, the Chairman of that Committee's panel on International Operations and Human Rights, Congressman Christopher Smith, and several other Members on both sides of the aisle in that chamber. Frankly, Mr. President, given the support for this resolution by the relevant Committee chairmen, one has to question why the Administration moved forward on this in March of this year and again yesterday. This is particularly troublesome given the fact that the President's own National Security Advisor stated this past December that the President would not move forward unless consultations with Congress went well. Clearly, the consultations did not go well. 
When Congress considered and passed the amendment by Senator Jackson and Representative Vanik in the Trade Act of 1974, everyone at the time understood Congressional intent--free emigration was to be a condition for expanding U.S. trade relations with non-market communist nations. 
Today, nearly two and a half decades later, we do not have free emigration provided to the people of Vietnam by the communist regime that took over that entire country by force in 1975. Moreover, the Administration has failed to make a convincing case to the Congress to justify President Clinton's decision to waive freedom of emigration requirements. Hanoi's record does not support this decision. Yes, Hanoi has taken some steps to permit more orderly departures in recent years, but there are still unwarranted delays, and I am very concerned that recent promises and pledges of cooperation have yet to be satisfactorily fulfilled. 
Congressional intent was clear in 1974, and it has not changed since that time. U.S. policy is supposed to put freedom of emigration ahead of the trade interests some might have with this one-party communist state. We are supposed to be putting principle over profit, not the other way around. 
I believe America should not abandon the Vietnamese people who long for respect for human rights and democratic freedoms. They were abandoned over two decades ago, and we simply cannot let it happen again. Jackson-Vanik requirements should not be waived for Vietnam if it is not absolutely clear that such a waiver would `substantially promote' freedom of emigration requirements as the law requires. This past March, State Department witnesses testified there had been `measurable' progress. The term measurable does not imply to me that we are seeing dramatic positive changes by Vietnam. I do not believe we have seen `significantly more rapid progress' which was the standard set by Secretary of State Albright herself last year during her visit to Vietnam. And I fail to see how the President's first waiver for Vietnam on March 9, 1998 has substantially promoted progress these past three months. If more people had been permitted to leave Vietnam in the last three months than we had seen over the last three years, then maybe the waiver would have, indeed, substantially promoted progress, but that has not happened, Mr. President, from what I have been told. 
Today, as we introduce this joint resolution, there are still people in Vietnam who supported us and fought for us during the war who have not been allowed to freely emigrate. Some of them have not even been allowed to meet with U.S. officials for interviews. I understand that others have been forced to pay exorbitant bribes in order to be considered for exit visas. 
Under the Trade Act of 1974, Congress has an opportunity to ensure that freedom of emigration requirements are met by Vietnam before further trade benefits are extended. The joint resolution introduced today by myself and Senator Helms provides my colleagues the opportunity to go on record in support of the people of Vietnam. If you want to send a message to the Government of Vietnam that they must fully comply with the promises and commitments they have made in recent years, this is the way to do it. 
Additionally, for those of my colleagues who continue to be concerned, as I am, that Hanoi has not been fully forthcoming in their accounting for American POWs and MIAs, and their progress on human rights, then you should support this resolution. Some of my colleagues may recall that both the POW/MIA issue and human rights concerns were, indeed, central to the provisions first adopted in the Trade Act of 1974, and so it is appropriate that these concerns are made part of the current debate as well. 
How far must we go, Mr. President, to embrace this communist regime before they fully address our long-standing concerns on all these important issues? I am certain that the time has come once again for Congress to go on record in support of the objectives behind this resolution. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would note that the resolution we are introducing today is strongly supported by numerous organizations of Vietnamese-Americans, many of our national veterans and POW/MIA family organizations, several international refugee organizations, and a host of other concerned groups of Americans. 
I look forward to the forthcoming debate on this timely and important issue.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I join the majority of my colleagues today in expressing strong support for the conference report on H.R. 2400, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act reauthorization. As a member of the conference committee, I know the amount of time and effort that was put into developing this final agreement. I believe a fair compromise was reached among the wide variety of interests and between the House and Senate. 
This legislation represents a change from past transportation legislation and a shift toward an integrated, intermodal transportation system to promote efficiency and economic growth. Some of its major provisions include: assurance that gas tax dollars are used for transportation purposes, greater planning authority for state and local government, increased funding for highway safety, and funding for environmental protection activities. 
A reauthorized ISTEA should continue to recognize regional differences but at the same time, recognize that our transportation system is a national system. Certainly, every state want to get its `fair share,' and we will need to balance each state's needs with the needs of the Nation. 
From New Hampshire's perspective, it is important to ensure that small states continue to receive adequate funding for their infrastructure needs. New Hampshire strongly supports certain programs, such as the Bridge Rehabilitation, Scenic Byway and Recreational Trail programs, that other states may not need as greatly. The strength of this legislation is that it recognizes these varying needs and provides states with the flexibility to direct funding as they see appropriate. 
There are many challenges before us as we operate in a balanced budget environment--something for which I have fought long and hard. Our needs will always outweigh our resources. But we also have to recognize how critical our transportation system is to our economy and social well-being. While it is difficult to balance these frequently competing goals, I believe this bill strikes the right balance in providing an adequate amount of resources within the context of the balanced budget agreement. 
In conclusion, I believe this is a good bill and deserves Senate approval. The quality of our Nation's transportation system is depending on it. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the students, teachers, and staff of the Frances C. Richmond Middle School in Hanover, New Hampshire for being recognized by the United States Department of Education as a Blue Ribbon School. 
Blue Ribbon status is awarded to schools that have strong leadership; a clear vision and sense of mission that is shared by all connected with the school; high quality teaching; challenging, up-to-date curriculum; policies and practices that ensure a safe environment conducive to learning; solid evidence of family involvement; evidence that the school helps all students achieve to high standards; and a commitment to share best practices with other schools. This honor is vigorously sought by thousands of schools across the nation, and only 166 schools are so recognized. 
The Richmond School is part of the Dresden School District, the first interstate district in the United States. The school educates sixth graders from Hanover, New Hampshire, and seventh and eighth graders from both Hanover and Norwich, Vermont. 
The curriculum of the Richmond School focuses on the academic, social and developmental transitions which take place at each grade level. Special care is taken as the Hanover sixth graders move from elementary to middle school, as the Norwich seventh graders join them one year later, and as the eighth graders take their place as school leaders and begin planning for high school. The Richmond School takes pride in the fact that students have individual schedules built around their choices for academic and elective courses. A foundation of their program is the fine and practical arts program, which allows students to choose from over 25 elective courses each quarter. Community service is required for all eighth graders to introduce students to the pleasures and responsibilities of contributing to their community. 
The school has grown from 286 students to 460 students in the past ten years, and this has presented the school with a number of challenges. A creative and challenging administrative response to the growing student population has been to divide leadership roles among the staff. Rather than simply hiring assistants in the central office, the administration asked teachers and other professionals to take on the role of leadership in budget development, curriculum articulation, school climate and technology planning. These initiatives on the part of the staff have resulted in lively staff debates, enriched staff development opportunities, better communication from grade to grade, and more frequent interaction with parents and community. 
As a former teacher and school board chairman, I recognize the challenges involved in providing students a quality education. I commend the teachers and staff for their effort and innovation that have built a top-notch school. I am pleased that they have been recognized for their success, and it is with great pride that I represent them in the United States Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Robert Bowen for receiving the 1998 VITA Wireless Samaritan Award. The award is given by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry to recognize the contributions of individuals who used their cellular phone to heroically help their communities. Robert is a clear example of how matching emergency situations with technology can impact people's lives. 
Robert Bowen is a police officer who is the head of the Keene Crime Watch Bike Patrol. Robert was on patrol one day when the local police received a frantic call reporting a missing child. The police, in turn, alerted Robert on his wireless phone. An eight-year-old, who had run away from home, was nowhere to be found and was in need of his daily medication. Robert headed out on the wooded trails to an area he knew was a popular congregation spot for area children. He quickly spotted the boy and doubled back to alert the boy's father. The father and son were reunited, and Robert called the police department on his wireless phone to let them know they could call off their search. 
The Keene Crime Watch Bike Patrol, armed with wireless phones, has found lost children, stopped crimes and brush fires and assisted in similar emergency situations for the past two years. I congratulate Robert for his courage and for demonstrating how police forces are utilizing modern technology to protect their communities. I am very honored to have Robert Bowen as a police officer in the Granite State, and it is with great pride that I represent him in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Heidi Marie Noyes for being crowned Miss New Hampshire 1998. As Miss Winnipesaukee, Heidi prevailed over a competitive field of thirteen New Hampshire women. Her triumph earns Heidi the right to represent New Hampshire in the Miss America pageant in Atlantic City this September. 
One has to admire Heidi for her persistence and dedication. She had appeared in the pageant five times in the last seven years. Heidi's runner-up finish last year and her victory this year attest to her drive to improve and triumph. 
Heidi is deeply committed to helping children. She studies criminal justice at Franklin Pierce College in order to eventually work as an advocate for children and to campaign for juvenile law reform. She has been a volunteer for the Youth Services Court Diversion Program in Belknap County for the past six years, and she models in United Way bridal shows to benefit charity. Heidi's platform issue as Miss New Hampshire is the `Let's Get Motivated' scholarship program that she founded three years ago. 
At only 23 years old, Heidi is the owner of two dance studios, The Broadway North School of Performing Arts and Broadway North Andover. She is a renowned dancer herself, winning the talent portion of the Miss New Hampshire pageant twice. She was chosen to tour the United States with Dance Caravan and was the Grand National Female Tap Soloist for Hoctor's `Stars of Tomorrow' dance competition in 1992. 
I am proud to represent Heidi Marie Noyes in the United States Senate, and wish her much success as Miss New Hampshire.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to address the committee amendment offered by the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from Michigan. This amendment implements agreements made between the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee. Pursuant to this agreement, the Armed Services Committee has agreed to reduce by $275 million funds in the pending bill for non-intelligence programs, and to increase by $275 million funds for the National Foreign Intelligence Program, which is also part of this bill. 
The Armed Services Committee has considered a range of options for implementing this agreement, all of which involve making difficult choices to cut defense programs. After consideration deliberation, the committee has decided to reduce funding for the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) program by $254 million and the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile system by $21 million. The $21 million in AMRAAM is now excess to program requirements as a result of contract negotiations between the Air Force and the contractor. The funding issue related to THAAD is more complex. 
We have all heard the news of Tuesday's THAAD test failure. This was the fifth time in a row that THAAD has filed to intercept a target. Although we don't have the details, we know that there was an electrical failure in the booster which caused the missile to self-destruct early in flight. Whatever impact this may have on the long-term prospects for THAAD, judging by what we now know it appears that the THAAD program will not be able to enter engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) during fiscal year 1999. 
In its markup of the Defense Authorization Bill, the committee expressed concern that THAAD might not be able to spend all of its EMD budget during fiscal year 1999 even if the recent flight test was a success. Therefore, the markup included a reduction of $70 million in THAAD EMD. This left $254 million in the THAAD EMD budget, $498 million in the THAAD Demonstration and Validation (Dem/Val) budget, for a total of $752 in fiscal year 1999 for THAAD. 
With the recent test failure, however, it will be virtually impossible for THAAD to enter EMD during fiscal year 1999, which means that the remaining $254 million of THAAD EMD money cannot be spent. 
I am very disappointed by the results of the THAAD test, but I continue to believe that this program is important and must be permitted to proceed. Therefore I believe that the Senate should support the full budget request of $497 million for THAAD demonstration and validation. Nonetheless, due to the circumstances that the THAAD program is now in, I believe the best course of action to take now is to disapprove funding for THAAD to enter EMD during FY99. I would remind the Senate that this would leave almost $500 million in the THAAD program overall. 
I would like to emphasize that I fully support the THAAD program and I would not have supported this reduction if I felt it would in any way hinder current progress on the program. The THAAD program is a critical upper-tier theater missile defense program that has encountered a setback, but I have full confidence these programs can be corrected and the program can move forward to its next test.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I rise as chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee to focus on some areas that are very critical to our Nation's defense. Certainly, `strategic' takes on a new meaning as we hear news in the last few days of what is happening in India. 
We tried, in our subcommittee, to continue initiatives that have been started in previous years. At the same time, because of overall funding reductions, we were forced to make some substantial cuts, cuts that I did not want to make. But as part of the overall budget, we felt we had to do it. So we do have a budget cap, and that issue, in and of itself, is somewhat controversial. 
I think it is time, as we look at the reduction in defense spending, to begin to look at that cap and, in my opinion, remove the cap. We must recognize that the defense budget has been cut deeply, and these cuts are beginning now to affect the effectiveness of our military force. 
The budgets of both DOD and DOE, which are in my Strategic Subcommittee, had to be reduced. I tried to do that as fairly as I possibly could. Let me just outline some of the tough choices that we had to make. Missile defense, of course, is an area that I care deeply about. But there is some redundancy in some of the programs that we have. We have to begin to set some priorities. 
The budget, as it was presented to us by the President, had some areas in it that were funded in this budget but not in future years. So the question is, If a program such as MEADS--Medium Extended Air Defense System--is not funded beyond 1999, what is the purpose of providing funding for it in fiscal 1999? So I tried to look at this. If I could not get a commitment from the administration to fund beyond fiscal year 1999, then I, for the most part, reduced or eliminated the funds for next year. In the case of MEADS, our intent is to encourage DOD to find alternative approaches to meeting the requirement. But we cannot support the program if DOD has no budget for it in the future. 
Another very controversial reduction, which I was not happy about, was our cut of $97 million from the Airborne Laser Program. Because this was a tough decision, I want to explain what happened. 
There were a lot of news reports that said we `slashed' the Airborne Laser Program, that we `ruined' the program, that we `killed' the program, that we have made it impossible for the program to recover, and so on. This is unfair and inaccurate. I simply felt that we had an obligation to review the technical and operational viability of the program. 
Two years ago, our Committee included report language which basically called on the Air Force and Airborne Laser Program advocates to come forward and justify the program. I do not believe that they have done so. 
So we withheld funds for placing this very complex technology on an actual aircraft, a 747, until the capability is more fully tested and the operational concepts are better defined by the Air Force. I do not want to go into great detail; to some degree I cannot because it is classified. But let me be clear--we only cut the dollars intended for integrating this technology on an aircraft. This does not destroy the Airborne Laser Program, nor does it make any comment, subtle or otherwise, by anyone on the committee that somehow this program is not worthy. It does require the Secretary of Defense, with the help of outside experts, to review the program's technology and concept of operations, and show us how this technology will work when it is placed upon an aircraft. I don't think it destroys the program to delay the purchase of an airplane for a year or two while we find out whether the technology and the operational concept is valid. This is what congressional oversight is all about. 
We have increased funding for Navy Upper Tier, another missile defense program, and the space-based laser readiness demonstrator, which is the ultimate step, I think, in missile defense--the space-based laser. 
We tried to reduce as much of the risk as possible in the NMD Program by encouraging the Department to modify the program. Currently the so-called 3+3 program is extremely high risk. To deploy a complex system in 3 years is very, very difficult. It is an artificially compressed date and an artificially compressed program. It requires us to do everything at once instead of running a low-risk program to ensure everything fits together first. There is no margin for failure or problems. If one thing goes wrong, the whole program could collapse. It needs to be run like any other defense acquisition program, with the objective of reducing the program risk. 
With the Administration's 3+3 program, we must first decide that there is a missile threat to the United States. Then we assume that in 3 years we can deploy a system to intercept that missile. I think that assumption just does not make sense. 
Can we depend on our intelligence to give us that information? I draw my colleagues' attention to what happened in the last few days with India's nuclear tests. We didn't, frankly, know what was happening until it happened. We either did not have that information, or we did not heed it. 
I am not trying to fault the intelligence community, other than to say that intelligence is not always objective. It is not always thorough. It is not always timely. It is not always heeded. The question we have to ask is, Are we willing to take the risk once we know that somebody has the capability and the intent to use a missile against us, and are we then prepared to say that in 3 years we will have the technology deployed to intercept that missile? I am not prepared to take that kind of chance, which is why I was very disappointed in the vote in the Senate yesterday on Senator Cochran's legislation, which would have established a policy to deploy a national missile defense system when it becomes technically feasible. That wise legislation was rejected; it did not get enough votes to bring it to cloture. So the current administration plan for NMD 3+3 means an NMD system will be developed in 3 years, and when a threat is acknowledged this system 
will be deployed in 3 years. 
This just does not make a lot of sense. It naively assumes that we will see all emerging threats, and that if and when we see one, we can confidently deploy a complex system in just 3 years. 
So I hope my colleagues in the Senate sometime sooner rather than later will come to the realization of how dangerous this 3+3 approach really is. Perhaps a few more unforseen nuclear tests will convince them. If not, this extremely naive and extremely dangerous complacency could cost us dearly in years to come. We are seeing proliferation of missiles, and of the technology to develop missiles, all over the world--China, North Korea, India, Pakistan, Iran. And, yet, we were denied the opportunity yesterday on the Cochran proposal to get going on a national missile defense system. 
It is extremely disturbing. As one who deals with these issues every day on the Armed Services Committee, and specifically as the chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee, I know full well that this is a naive policy. It is well intended--there is no question there--but naive. 
Colin Powell, former National Security Adviser to President Reagan and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents Bush and Clinton, used to say we have to be concerned first and foremost about the capability of an enemy because we never know what his intent will be. The intent tomorrow might be good. It might be bad. But what is the capability? We all know that the Chinese, and the Russians, have the capability to fire a missile at the United States of America. Do they have the intent? Maybe not today. But what about tomorrow? 
So we have to deal with capability. If we deny that, if we look the other way, we are really putting our heads in the sand. 
In space programs, the committee increase funding for a range of activities: space control technology development; the enhanced global positioning system; the microsatellite program and the space maneuver vehicle. The budget for those programs were increased. These efforts are critical for the future exploitation and use of space by the United States. 
Another area of the strategic forces subcommittee budget concerns weapons and other activities of the Department of Energy. We tried there to stabilize the core mission funding for weapons activities and environmental cleanup. As you know, we have a lot of environmental cleanup to do as a result of DOD and DOE activities over the past several decades, especially during the cold war. 
So we tried in our budget to maintain the capability to remanufacture and certify enduring U.S. nuclear warheads. We tried to maintain the pace of cleanup at DOE facilities with our funding, and though the overall DOE budget was reduced, a number of funding increases were authorized for programs critical to achieving these goals. 
Increases include additional funding for the four weapons production plants, tritium production, and environmental management technology development. Some will criticize these DOD cuts. But it is a matter of balance. If you look at the budget in real terms, since 1996, DOD funding has decreased by 5.2 percent, and DOE has increased by 7.7 percent. 
We did the best we could. I hope that my colleagues will be supportive of the recommendations that we have made, not only in the Strategic Subcommittee but in other subcommittees as well. It is a tough job. I don't think there is a member of the committee who doesn't feel that we have gone probably too far, that we need to, perhaps, remove that budget firewall and begin to put more dollars into defense. But given the constraints of the budget agreement, we had to do with what we had. 
In conclusion, I thank Senators Thurmond, Levin, and Bingaman for the cooperation that we have had together, especially Senator Bingaman on the subcommittee who has always been courteous to me. 
I want to thank Eric Thoemmes, Paul Longsworth, and Monica Chavez of the Armed Services Committee staff, and John Luddy, Brad Lovelace, and Steve Hellyar of my own staff as well. 
I would be happy to yield the floor, Madam President. I see others who wish to speak.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, yesterday, India conducted three underground nuclear tests, further destabilizing relations among Pakistan, India, and China. Today, two more tests were conducted. 
The whole world was caught by surprise--including the U.S. intelligence community and the Clinton administration. In fact, administration officials were quoted in the Washington Times yesterday saying that, `Our overhead [satellites] saw nothing, and we had zero warning.' 
The most ominous response came from Pakistan, which recently tested its newest ballistic missile, with a range of 1,500 kilometers, and now says it may conduct a nuclear test of its own. 
It is against this very stark backdrop that we are today, this week, considering the American Missile Protection Act of 1998. 
I want to commend my colleague, Senator Cochran, for his long-time leadership on this issue. He deserves a lot of credit. It is a very timely situation, I must say.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to a unique and wonderful woman, Doris Stocklan, of Dover, New Hampshire. Doris will celebrate her 90th birthday on May 29, 1998. She will be surrounded by family and friends at a party in her honor at the Ashworth Hotel in Hampton Beach on May 24. Although I am unable to join Doris at the festivities, I would today ask that she count me among the admirers who will be wishing her well on her special day. 
Doris' parents came to America from Eastern Europe in the late 1800's. She was raised in the Boston area where she met her husband, Louis. They were married for 61 years before he passed away in 1991. They raised three children, Stephen Stocklan, 56, of Barrington, New Hampshire; Maralyn Simond, 67, of Rochester, New Hampshire; and Joyce Goldberg, 65, of North Miami, Florida. They also had five grandchildren; Sandra, Melody, Lisa, Lauren and Jennifer; and one great-grandchild, Thomas. 
Doris and Lou moved to Dover in the 1930's, where Lou began work at Dover Hardware. He eventually purchased the store, and business boomed. Soon they were able to buy two more stores in the Seacoast, and Doris pitched in as a cashier and occasional bookkeeper. Steve and Maralyn joined the staff, and the operation was one of the most successful family-run businesses in the area. In the mid-1970's, Doris and Lou also bought The Strand movie theater in Dover. Again, it was a family affair. Doris, Maralyn, and some of the grandchildren worked the ticket booth and the concession stand. The success of Doris and Lou was the embodiment of the `American Dream.' 
The Stocklans were always active in their community, in politics, and in their synagogue. Doris' commitment to her community and her country started when she was a young mother, volunteering for the local Red Cross during World War II. Doris is a life member of the Sisterhood and the Hadassah of Temple Israel in Dover. She is also a life member of the Wentworth Douglass Hospital, and a 50 year member of the Women's Club of Dover where she serves on the Board. She is loved and respected by her peers, her family, and all the people she has graced with her warm smile and laughing eyes. 
There is no one more deserving than Doris of the special honors and kind words that will be bestowed upon her at her 90th birthday celebration. I have known Doris Stocklan for over a decade. She is a lovely and gracious woman with a heart of gold, and I am proud to represent her in the United States Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2676, the IRS reform bill that is now under consideration on the floor. This bill, which is the product of extensive oversight hearings, is much needed and long overdue. I applaud Chairman Roth and the other Finance Committee members for reviewing the legislation sent to us by the House, for their efforts to strengthen the bill, and for their persistence in moving this bill to the Senate floor. 
As taxpayers testified at the Finance Committee hearings, the abuses fostered by the IRS are intolerable. Innocent taxpayers are suffering under an out-of-control agency. 
We have witnessed this problem in my own state of New Hampshire. Shirley Barron of Derry, New Hampshire has suffered greatly since her husband's death in 1996, and she claims that the IRS's collection tactics are the cause. The Barrons' problems with the IRS began in the mid-1980s when they lost an $80,000 investment. The couple's accountant advised them that they could get a tax deduction, but the IRS informed the Barrons two years later that they had to pay. Mrs. Barron said that she and her husband were unable to pay the IRS immediately, so interest and penalties mounted. According to Mrs. Barron, her husband took his own life just after learning that creditors were to foreclose on the couple's Derry home because the IRS had placed a lien on it. Even after Mr. Barron died, the agency continued their collection efforts against Mrs. Barron: They foreclosed on the family's Cape Cod vacation home, they took her tax refunds, and they placed claims against the life insurance of her late husband. The IRS recently agreed to cancel Mrs. Barron's entire tax debt, thus ending her long ordeal. While this is a welcome development, it won't bring her husband back. No one should have to go through an ordeal like that again. 
Last week, the Senate Finance Committee heard similarly disturbing accounts of IRS intimidation from agency employees. Auditors and agents voiced their frustration with field office managers and high level management. Some reported that almost no one at the agency 
listens to them when they report discrimination or wrongdoing. For example: 
Ginger Garvis, a District auditor in New York City, said that she uncovered a multimillion-dollar tax evasion and money-laundering case which her supervisors refused to pursue. Ms. Garvis testified that the IRS often forgives tax debts by large firms with the resources to fight back in court. Instead, it focuses on smaller companies that cannot fight back. 
Michael Ayala, a thirty-year IRS employee, testified that he has observed `a broad range of misconduct by high level managers.' He said that `such abuses are generally known to a large percentage of the IRS workforce but are perpetuated by management's intimidation and punishment of anyone within the agency who objects to or reports such misconduct.' 
A former IRS criminal investigation agent, Patricia Gernt, reported that her supervisors did little or nothing to help her stop another IRS agent who tried to frame former U.S. Senator Howard Baker. 
Perhaps for these reasons, another District auditor in New York City testified: `before there is a taxpayer victim there is first an employee victim.' 
Such an atmosphere of fear and intimidation is deplorable and must be stopped. The American taxpayers deserve better. 
H.R. 2676 will help us change the culture at the IRS to which so many are objecting. This bill establishes many new taxpayer rights; it calls for the IRS to revise its mission statement to focus on taxpayer service; and it provides for increased oversight of agency activities by a citizens' advisory board. At the same time, the bill gives the new IRS Commissioner, Charles Rossotti, broad flexibility to better manage the agency. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. We have an historic opportunity to restore accountability to the IRS and change how the agency functions. Let us seize this opportunity by promptly passing H.R. 2676. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, No. 1, for recognizing me, but more importantly for supporting the provision that we should not use these environmental income taxes, and oil and chemical excise taxes, for anything but Superfund. I know it was a difficult decision. I support the Senator fully on the IRS reform which he has done such a tremendous job on, and on which he has exerted such great leadership. I commend him for understanding, also, there is another issue here with Superfund. 
This, essentially, with the greatest respect to my colleague from Nebraska, will just totally destroy the Superfund reform that we have worked on for some 3 1/2 years. In order to make the things happen that we need to make happen in the Superfund Program, these taxes would have to be reinstituted and used strictly and exclusively for the Superfund Program. So I vehemently oppose the Kerrey amendment. 
I am certain the majority of this body, and I think the majority of the American people agree that IRS and Superfund have a similarity. They are both badly broken. They both need to be fixed. But they don't have to go against each other to do 
that. These are two separate and distinct issues. 
I support the IRS reform the distinguished chairman is pursuing and I also support reforming the Superfund Program. It is inappropriate to utilize Superfund taxes to pay for the cost of IRS. Superfund taxes should be used to fix Superfund. 
For those who have been anxiously waiting for the reform of the program, help is on the way, I hope, if the Senate will be supportive. Working with the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee who is on the floor, Senator Chafee, and through his leadership we were able to pass a bill out of committee. I am hopeful the majority of our colleagues will allow that bill to be brought to the floor and fully debated. Within the next few days the committee's report will be complete. There are differences on the bill. But I think clearly no one should be of the opinion that we should use Superfund taxes; that is, the environmental income tax and the oil and chemical excise tax, for anything other than to reform that program. 
I don't want to get into a full debate now on the problems associated with Superfund. I will have that opportunity when we get the bill to the floor. But I just want to say, when Congress established this program in 1980, the consensus was it would take a few billion dollars to clean up what we thought were around 400 sites. In order to fund this program, revenues were collected through these taxes. We reauthorized the program in 1986, extending the taxing authority. What has happened is we spent $20 billion of taxpayers' money and we have only cleaned up about 160 sites; that is 160 sites were removed from the NPL. 
These folks who pay the environmental income taxes, who pay the oil and chemical excise taxes, rightfully say this program isn't working. We are paying all this tax money and it is going to lawyers and it is being wasted and we are not cleaning up sites. Our Superfund bill clearly expedites cleanup, gets the money away from lawyers and towards cleanup. To take that money away from this program and provide it for some other use is simply unconscionable. Although maybe well intended, it is a serious mistake in terms of the bipartisan consensus that we have to fix a broken program. 
So I am hopeful--I wish the Senator would reconsider his amendment and I hope this will be defeated. 
Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in support, strong support, of the Craig amendment and commend the Senator for offering it. It is a very reasonable amendment that simply says, prior to the deposit of the U.S. instrument of ratification, that there must be enacted a law containing specific authorization for the continued deployment of troops in Bosnia. I don't know how--if Congress wants to exercise its responsibility--I don't know how anyone could object to the amendment. Surely, if the comments that I have heard on and off the floor over the past couple of years regarding the issue of troops in Bosnia are any indication, this vote ought to be overwhelming in support of the Craig amendment. I certainly don't think anyone has any right to complain ever again if they are not going to vote to at least have the opportunity to say that we ought to have a vote here in the Senate to put forces in Bosnia. 
I hope those who have been doing all of this complaining over the past couple of years will vote for the Craig amendment so that we can get a vote by the Congress to authorize the extension of having troops in Bosnia as part of the ratification process. 
When the Congress first considered the President's plan to send troops to Bosnia in 1995, the administration placed clear limits on the duration of that commitment. On every single occasion that I can think of, that I know of, administration officials stated that U.S. troops would remain in Bosnia for 1 year--1 year. That was 3 years ago. They are still there. 
Secretary Perry said on December 1, 1995: 
We believe the mission can be accomplished in 1 year. So we have based our plan on that time line. This schedule is realistic, because the specific military tasks in the agreement can be completed in the first 6 months and, therefore, its role will be to maintain the climate of stability that will permit civil work to go forward. We expect these civil functions will be successfully initiated in 1 year. But even if some of them are not, we must not be drawn into a posture of indefinite garrison. 
That is what Secretary Perry said on December 1, 1995. He used the term `indefinite garrison.' And 3 1/2 years later, we are still in Bosnia with no end in sight, no plan to get out, and here is the opportunity for Congress, certainly the U.S. Senate in this case, to speak up. 
I hope the Senate will speak responsibly here and agree with the Craig amendment. 
Let me give you some more testimony. Secretary of State Holbrooke on December 6, 1995: 
The military tasks in Bosnia are doable within 12 months. There isn't any question. 
That is a quote-- 
The deeper question is whether the nonmilitary functions can be done in 12 months. That's the real question. But it's not NATO or U.S. force responsibility to do that. It's us on the civilian side working with the Europeans. It's going to be very tough. Should the military stick around until every refugee has gone home, until everything else in the civilian annexes has been done? No. That is not their mission. 
That was Secretary Holbrooke on December 6, 1995, and yet troops remain. There are still troops there sitting in the middle of a war zone between warring factions. Yes, holding the peace, but the commitment that was made to the American people and to this Congress by this administration in 1995 was that we were not going to keep them there beyond 12 months, and he said there isn't any question about that, we don't need to keep them there. 
Nothing has changed. There is nothing different today than there was 3 years ago regarding that kind of comment. He says the deeper question is whether nonmilitary functions can be done in 12 months. That is the question. But the military is still there, and they are using the military to try to accomplish nonmilitary functions, which in and of itself is a real problem. 
Many of us who closely studied the conflict in Bosnia saw this, frankly, as an unrealistic comment. We didn't believe--I certainly didn't believe and I know many of my colleagues didn't believe--that this made sense. There was no way that you could make that kind of a military commitment and allow this whole situation to become resolved in less than 12 months. But, 
what choice did the American people have but to take the President and the Secretary of State and others at their word? That is what we did, we took them at their word. What do we have for it? 
I was disappointed, but not surprised, when right after the 1996 elections, the President said that we are going to continue this military commitment for an additional 18 months, until June of 1998. I happen to be a veteran of the Vietnam war. This has a familiar ring to it, a very familiar ring to it. I can remember the McNamara charts and the one more battle and, `In just another year or two, we'll wrap this up.' Mr. President, 58,000 lives and about 13 years later, we got out of Vietnam. 
That could happen here. This is an extremely sensitive area that has a lot of problems that could escalate in a hurry. 
Last December, the President said that he acknowledged that our commitment to Bosnia is open-ended, but he is still talking about clear and achievable goals. If you have an open-ended policy, you don't have clear and achievable goals. They are two direct opposites. There is no clear and achievable goal. There is an open-ended policy, and as long as it is open-ended, we are just going to give a blank check to the administration to stay in Bosnia and do what? To nation build, is that what our troops are there for? 
This policy must come to a vote in this Congress. We have to act responsibly, otherwise, another Vietnam could occur. After people are killed or injured or maimed, it is too late to debate it. It is too late for those people. We need to be debating it now, and the Craig amendment is simply asking for a vote in the affirmative if we are going to continue the policy and continue to keep troops in Bosnia. I don't know what the policy is. The policy to me is just open-ended. Just keep them there, keep them there, keep them there; make another promise, another promise, another promise. 
The administration has had a free ride in Bosnia now for 2 years. It is wrong, to put it very bluntly, for this Government to conduct its foreign policy without the participation of Congress and the public. For the life of me, I don't understand how anyone could oppose the Craig amendment. 
The American people need to understand what is at stake and either agree to the commitment or not. We represent the American people, supposedly. The President has stated what he wants to do and he said why. He said, `I want an open-ended policy in Bosnia, and I want to do it because I feel like I have a clear and achievable goal.' He hasn't said what it is, just to keep the peace. 
War has been going on in Bosnia for a thousand years. I am not sure just how long we have to hold American military forces there. Under this open-ended policy, maybe it is another thousand years. I don't know. But Congress has to act. The President gave his reasons, and now the American people ought to hear Congress' debate on this proposal, and that is what this amendment is about. This is no longer a Presidential use of force based on his judgment of an immediate threat. It is nation building in Bosnia. That is what we are talking about. It is now a deliberate foreign policy, and it must be approved and funded by Congress or not. 
Mr. President, how much time is remaining in the debate?

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to me from President Clinton dated April 20, 1998, in which he said: 
To ensure that NATO functions as effectively in the next century as it has in this one, we must preserve its ability to respond quickly, flexibly and decisively to whatever threats may arise. 
It is the `whatever threats may arise' that bothers me in this debate, Mr. President.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to compliment my colleague on his amendment. As chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee on the Armed Forces Committee, this has long been an irritation and frustration for many of us, the fact that we don't have a national missile defense. As it is right now, you have a provision in the NATO resolution that would exclude a missile defense system for Canada and the United States, and, in turn, having specifically mentioned Europe would be just outrageous. 
I think that the fact that the Senator has identified this and brought this forward is a huge plus to this debate. 
I also would like to lend my remarks in support of the remarks the Senator made about the caliber of the debate here. We have had, as the Senator said, no partisan debate but rather a very academic debate for several days now and one which I think is very, very important and I think will have a profound impact on our future and perhaps the future of the world. 
I know people, as we get down to the latter part of the time here, get a little upset with planes to catch and so forth. But this is a very, very important debate. Votes have been changing in the past several days. In one case somebody told me they were absolutely in favor and are now opposed. 
I think we are moving in the right direction. Even though this may seem dilatory, I am very much pleased with the debate and where we are. 
I again want to say on this amendment that it is extremely important to identify and not to have this separation. To say 
in the NATO resolution that we would have Europe protected and not the United States and Canada just wouldn't work. 
Let me just make a couple more points. 
The President's plan, as we know, does not cover all of the United States. A plan for a missile defense system would comply with the ABM Treaty and, as required by the treaty, would be based out as a single site. The evidence available shows the areas that the President's ABM Treaty compliance system would protect in the event of a ballistic missile attack. As one can clearly understand, Alaska and Hawaii are left vulnerable to a ballistic missile attack under the President's plan. 
There are a whole number of other factors, which I will not go into at this point other than to simply say that I am very strongly in support of this relatively minor change in terms of semantics and words. But a couple of words, where you change the word `Europe' and add `Europe and the rest of NATO,' that is very, very important and sends a very, very strong signal. 
Again, I strongly support the amendment, and urge its adoption.

<TEXT>
Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I say to my colleagues I will be very brief and try to keep it within 10 minutes. 
This amendment is really quite simple. It is very much like the Craig amendment that we voted on earlier with the exception that it doesn't call for the passage. It simply says that one way or the other we would require Congress to debate and then vote--whichever way the vote comes out--but just vote on our deployment in Bosnia prior to depositing the instruments of ratification. 
I want to briefly touch on why I am offering this amendment. When the Congress first considered the President's plan to send troops to Bosnia in 1995, the administration placed very clear limits on the duration of this commitment. On every single occasion I am aware of, the administration official stated that U.S. troops would remain in Bosnia for 1 year. In fact, Secretary Perry, on December 1, 1995, said, `We believe the mission can be accomplished in one year, so we based our plan on that time line. This schedule is realistic because the specific military tasks in the agreement can be completed in the first six months and thereafter IFOR's role will be to maintain the climate of stability that will permit civil work to go forward. We expect these civil functions will be successfully initiated in one year. But, even if some of them are not, we must not be drawn into a posture of indefinite garrison.' 
I think these remarks were well intended, and I think it is clear that the Secretary of Defense meant what he said, but it is also clear that they didn't bear out. 
We also heard from Secretary of State Holbrooke on December 6, 1995: `The military tasks are doable within 12 months. There isn't any question * * * The deeper question * * * [is] whether the nonmilitary functions can be done in 12 months. That's a real question. But it's not the NATO or U.S. force responsibility to do that. It's on the civilian side, working with the Europeans. It's going to be very tough. Should the military stick around until every refugee has gone home, 'til everything else in the civilian annexes has been done? No, that is not their mission.' 
There were many of us who watched these comments--especially in the Armed Services Committee--very closely, studying the conflict in Bosnia. We felt that this was an unrealistic commitment. We didn't feel that those kinds of commitments should have been made, because we didn't feel they could have been kept. But the American people had no choice but to kind of accept these comments from our leaders. 
I was disappointed but I wasn't surprised when right after the 1996 elections, the President announced the continuation of the military commitment for an additional 18 months, to June of 1998. That is where we are now. It is almost June of 1998. Last December, the President acknowledged that our commitment now in Bosnia is open ended but we are still talking about clear and achievable goals. 
For 2 years the President has had this opportunity, and I believe that he has been wrong in making these statements. I believe it is wrong for the Government to conduct the foreign policy of the United States without any input from Congress and the public. The American people need to understand what is at stake and either agree to the commitment or not. We have a commitment. The President made it, and now he has extended it open ended. 
The question before the Congress today is, do you want to continue with an open-ended commitment, a blank check in Bosnia or don't you? The President has stated he wants to, and he stated why. Now the American people ought to hear from us, the Congress, as to whether or not this is a good idea or a bad idea. 
This is no longer simply a Presidential use of force based on his judgment of an immediate threat. We now have nation-building in Bosnia as deliberate foreign policy, and it ought to be approved and funded by the Congress of the United States. Failure to place this before Congress, in my opinion, will destroy congressional support for his foreign policy and, frankly, it insults the intelligence of the American people. 
There already has been a casualty in Bosnia, and that casualty is the trust of the American people that their Government will do what it says it will do when it puts American armed forces in harm's way. 
I don't see how Congress can allow this extended commitment to continue simply because the President sees no way out. Now, I have been around the cloakroom and in meetings for a couple of years now while this policy has been going on and I have been hearing a lot of complaining from my colleagues, a lot of complaining about how this will continue, it is open ended, what are we going to do about it. 
Here is a chance to vote--and I'm not asking you to vote to say that we ought to take the troops out or leave them in; I'm asking you to vote. All I'm asking for is a vote. It could go 5-90 against deployment or the other way around for deployment. I'm not asking for a vote to come out either direction. I'm just simply saying the Congress should vote, the Senate and the House of Representatives, before we deposit the instruments of ratification. That is all this amendment does. It does nothing less and it does nothing more. 
I don't, frankly, think that is asking very much. With the new nations we may have more Bosnias. We may have more Bosnias before we are finished, especially as we continue the expansion that Senator Hutchison of Texas was talking about a few moments ago, 
where we defeated the Warner amendment. So who is next down the line? We continue to draw lines. Where do we draw these lines? This is a very important debate, and I really cannot understand why anybody would oppose this amendment that simply says vote one way or the other. Keep them in 90-10, or take them out 90-10. Just vote. That is all this amendment asks for, before we submit the articles of ratification. In either case, I think the objective is clear that the American people need to be heard. They haven't been heard. We should let them be heard right here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Again, let me just say that if my colleagues on both sides of the issue don't support this amendment, which simply requires them to cast a vote--just cast a vote--on this matter before the June 30 deadline, they ought to forever keep their peace on Bosnia. No more complaining in the cloakroom, no more speeches on the floor about how the policy is so bad and so open-ended, no more second-guessing the President, no more criticizing the President, no more saying Congress doesn't have any responsibility. If we can't force ourselves to stand up here tonight and be counted on this subject, then we don't have a right to criticize the President on this issue. Every time I am on the floor and I hear somebody criticizing the President on this, I am going to check the vote list and see how the votes were, and I am going to rise up and challenge that Senator. This is not going to delay the passage, the instruments of ratification. We can vote on this any time. We can vote next week or the following week, or tonight, for that matter. It doesn't matter to me when we vote on it. Whenever the leader wants to schedule it. 
Mr. President, my final remarks. The purpose of this amendment is to simply require Congress to vote, period, one way or another on deployment to Bosnia prior to depositing the instruments of ratification for NATO. That's it.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I announce this morning the Senate will resume consideration of the Senator Smith of New Hampshire and the Senator Hutchison of Texas amendment No. 2314, pending to the NATO enlargement treaty. Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate equally divided between Senator Smith and Senator Hutchison, followed by a rollcall vote on or in relation to the amendment. Following that vote, it is hoped that Members with amendments to the NATO enlargement treaty will come to the floor to offer and debate those amendments. 
The majority leader has indicated to me it is his hope the Senate will be able to complete action on the NATO treaty hopefully by the close of business today or by Thursday evening at the latest. So I thank my colleagues for their attention to this matter. 
Mr. President, I believe under the previous order, there are 2 minutes equally divided between Senator Hutchison and myself.

This is a straightforward, simple amendment which I am confident has a strong bipartisan support of this Chamber. It is based on the debate yesterday, with myself, Senator Hutchison and Senator Biden. I don't expect any opposition. 
The amendment expresses a condition with full regard to NATO expansion requiring full cooperation from the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland concerning unaccounted for MIAs and POWs, and it is supported by all POW and MIA families and certainly many of the national veterans organizations. 
I want to stress that I personally received pledges of cooperation from the leaders of the three countries involved here. This amendment is designed to ensure that there is serious follow-up not only with the individuals who may have accessed information but also access to the archives. 
I want to thank Senator Hutchison of Texas for her support on this humanitarian issue, and I yield to her 1 minute.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I will be very brief in my remarks regarding this amendment. First of all, I want to compliment and commend the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, for her cooperation and support as we worked together to craft this amendment. 
This is a very, very important amendment, which I will get into in a moment, regarding the cooperation of these new NATO nations--if they were to become NATO nations--that would require their full cooperation with the United States in order to obtain the fullest possible accounting of any military personnel missing from any of the wars, from World War II, Korea, Vietnam, to the cold war. 
This amendment is supported by a number of veterans organizations--Vietnam Veterans of America, National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans Coalition, MIA Families, Korean/Cold War Family Association, National League of POW/MIA families.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I also thank Congressman Sam Johnson, who, as many of my colleagues know, was a POW, along with Senator McCain, and others, during the Vietnam war. Congressman Johnson and I have traveled to Prague, Warsaw, and to Moscow together in search of answers, along with former Ambassador Malcolm Toon, as part of the U.S.-Russia commission to seek answers on our missing. 
There is a great window of opportunity here in the old eastern bloc countries as well as Russia to get some answers as to what may have happened to these Americans. I think as we went out and searched the countryside and met in the capitals of these countries, we received some cooperation. I want to make that very clear. But, Mr. President, there is much more to be done. There are clearly answers in these archives. I think it is very important that, if we are going to say that our military--our men and women in uniform--is going to be asked at some point, if NATO expansion occurs, to shed their blood, possibly, or defend these countries, I think it behooves these countries to provide us the fullest possible accounting of any service personnel who may have crossed their borders during the time the Communists held, basically, and controlled these countries. 
I wish that I could say that all follow-up action to our trip had occurred properly and that we had every satisfactory answer that we wanted, but that is not true. It is disturbing because of the reasons that I gave. At some point in the future, by having these countries part of NATO, we are going to ask Americans to face possible combat situations to defend these countries. So the least they could do is to provide us answers that they may have now of things that occurred during Communist control. It has been said by some NATO advocates that we have an opportunity to ensure the cold war never resurfaces. Yet we still can't seem to get the cooperation we need from this region to address vital questions about our missing Americans, especially from the cold war but also possibly from Korea and Vietnam. If their pledges were genuine, as I believe they were, then, frankly, I question why leaders of these countries can't convince the old cold war bureaucracies to allow us access to the archives and allow us access to individuals who could provide us answers. 
We have had some cooperation. I am very grateful for that cooperation. We met with some very influential people in the governments of those three countries when I traveled there last summer. Since last summer there have been follow-up communications by our commission support staff at the Department of Defense and also by my own office with each of these nations urging them to follow through. But most important is the fact that, based on current leads available, our commission really still believes that there is relevant information, very relevant information, which likely exists in Eastern Europe, especially in the military intelligence security Communist Party archives of these three nations in question. 
Again, this is a very complex situation that has developed. The Communist Party controlled these archives, controlled all of the government activities, controlled the activities of intelligence and military and security. Now we have a different government, a friendly government. But the access to those archives has not yet been provided to us. If they are friendly and we are going to bring them into NATO and defend them, then they owe us that information, pure and simple. They owe us that information. They owe us every opportunity to get and find that information wherever it may be. I regret to say we really have not had that kind of cooperation, even though we have had some very interesting meetings. 
Let me just conclude on this point. We should remember and not forget that these eastern bloc countries, when they were eastern bloc countries, were allies of the North Koreans, were allies of the North Vietnamese, and the Soviets, of course, during the cold war. They had a significant presence in both North Korea and in Vietnam. They were privy to information about Communist policies toward our own American POWs. That is very important. I want to repeat that. They were privy to a lot of information about our POWs in Vietnam, our POWs in Korea, and indeed some of the missing cold war losses. This information has not yet been shared with us. 
It is very important that we delve into this and find out 
whether any American POWs were transferred, either stopping there permanently or transferred through any of the capitals of these countries. I want to emphasize again, this is not meant to be a hostile statement. We met with those governments, and they were very cordial and very cooperative but somewhat standoffish by basically passing the buck by saying, Well, you know those were the Communist days, and I am not sure we can dig that out. 
Again, if we are asking Americans to shed their blood in the future to defend free nations, then asking them to dig into their archives a little bit is not asking too much. 
I want to emphasize again and appeal to leaders of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary to follow through on commitments that were made during our visits and help us to search for American missing service personnel from the cold war, from Korea, and from Vietnam and urge my colleagues on behalf of the veterans organizations that I have mentioned, on behalf of all veterans throughout America and the families, most especially the families of those who are missing, to please join with me in continuing to push for more progress on this humanitarian issue. We can do that and, I think, make a very strong statement here on the floor by voting for this amendment. 
At this point I yield the floor for the purpose of allowing my colleague, Senator Hutchison, who has been a stalwart on this issue to speak. I am very grateful to her for her support. 
I yield the floor. 
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I say to my colleagues, just 1 or 2 minutes. I wish to expound a little bit on what the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, just said in terms of the impact on families. 
In the 1950s, there was a Captain Dunham who was shot down over Soviet territory--then Soviet territory--and as a result of the U.S.-Russian commission, of which Senator John Kerry and I are members, we ran an ad in the Red Star newspaper in Russia that went all over; it was read heavily by former military people, veterans of the Soviet Union. And an individual read the article about this Captain Dunham who was missing. It turned out that this individual had been at the crash site and provided us the ring of Captain Dunham, his personal ring, which came back to his family, and as a result of following that up, we were able to find Captain Dunham's remains, missing since the 1950s, and returned just 2 or 3 years ago. 
So I think this is a good example of what cooperation can really produce. Sometimes what might seem like a small, insignificant fact turns into a huge issue and a great relief to 
the family of a missing serviceman or woman. So this is very important, and I want to emphasize again that what this amendment does is very simple, Mr. President. 
Let me just mention three things. It would require that prior to the deposit of the U.S. instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to Congress that each of the Governments--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--is fully cooperating with the U.S. in order to obtain the fullest possible accounting of any military personnel from the cold war, from Vietnam, or any military conflicts; that they facilitate full access to all relevant archival material; and that they would identify any individuals who may possess knowledge relative to the capture of missing personnel. That is it. That is all the amendment does. 
I thank my colleagues, especially Senator Hagel, who has been waiting. I yield the floor.

I might say, we have found in the last 4 or 5 years, aircraft--I am almost certain that we located an aircraft in New Guinea and other areas where aircraft had been lost during World War II. I think it says a lot about our own Nation that we would still send teams out there in those jungles, searching for people who were lost. Maybe at some point, maybe--I know it was your relative, I did not hear, what relative?

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the North Haverhill, New Hampshire, Post #5245 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) on the occasion of their fiftieth anniversary. As a veteran and member of the VFW myself, I honor these men for their selfless commitment to their country and to their community. 
Since 1948, the original membership of 30 World War Two veterans has grown to 160 veterans of World Wars One and Two, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the Gulf War. I would like to specially recognize the charter members that have been there from the beginning--William Fortier, Leo Fortier, Fred Robinson, Paul LaMott, Everett Jessman, Maurice Bigelow, Willis Applebee, Ernest Hartley, William Harris, Laurent Fournier, Clifford Sawyer and Leon Dargie. All have served our country valiantly, and now tirelessly serve the Upper Valley, devoting endless hours to their community. 
The extent of the Post's involvement is endless, helping not only veterans, but anyone to whom they can lend a helping hand. They are especially involved with the youth of the Upper Valley. Their youth programs projects stretch from donating American flags to schools and teaching proper flag etiquette, to sponsoring essay contests and awarding college scholarships. They also sponsor Cub Scout and Girl Scout troops and instruct youth on bicycle safety. In addition, members host meals at a local soup kitchen, visit nursing homes and the VA Hospital and also visit shut-ins. They transport the elderly to appointments, donate wheelchairs and walkers and distribute food baskets on Thanksgiving. 
For half of a century, these members have exemplified goodwill and concern for their neighbors, and their efforts will no doubt continue for the next fifty years. I congratulate Post #5245 for their steadfast service to the Upper Valley. New Hampshire and the United States are truly indebted to the North Haverhill Post #5245 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and I am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to 27 students from Hollis/Brookline High School for winning the right to represent New Hampshire in the `We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution' national competition in Washington, D.C. 
As the New Hampshire state champions, the Hollis/Brookline students will compete against more than 1200 students from across the United States in a three-day national competition May 2-4, 1998. Students will demonstrate their knowledge of the Constitution and its relevance to contemporary issues in front of simulated congressional committees composed of constitutional scholars, lawyers, journalists, and government leaders. 
The distinguished members of the Hollis/Brookline team are: Meghan Amber, Wayne Beuner, Randy Brown, Jonathon Davies, Meredith Edmunds, Jaima Elliott, Emily Gagne, Sara Godshall, Laura Hacker, Alex Harris, Nicola Huns, Craig Kimball, Sarah Kirby, Anna Klein, Brannon Klein, Maya Levine, Sara Liebling, Kass Litwin, Heidi Packard, Amy Rattin, Jared Rosenberg, Nadine Schneider, Carrie Spaulding, Kent Springfield, Anja Helene Stronen-Lien, Amy Tozier and Amanda Vormelker. Their teachers, Helen Melanson and Joel Mitchell, deserve special recognition for their role in preparing these students for this intense constitutional testing. I applaud them for their commitment to enriching the lives of these students. 
As a former high school civics teacher myself, I recognize the value of instilling an understanding of the Constitution in students. The `We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution' program provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an informed perspective about the history and principles of our nation's constitutional government. I wish these young constitutional experts from Hollis/Brookline High School the best of luck in preparing for the national finals. It is an honor to have them represent New Hampshire, and I wish them luck as they prepare to be America's leaders in the twenty-first century. I am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I might add to the comments of the distinguished Senator from Virginia in the discussion of the distinguished Senator from New Mexico that we had had some testimony along the same lines in the strategic subcommittee. General Xavier indicated he felt, likewise, that the Duma would be less inclined to provide--they believe that if, in fact, NATO expansion were to continue, this could very well jeopardize the START II talks. 
I think it is also important to note--and I know the distinguished Senator made many visits to Russia, as I have in the past few years--the worst part of this, I don't sense anger on the part of some of our Russian colleagues, but I do sense frustration, especially those who want to see Russia move to a democracy and stay there. Small `d' democrats in Russia really believe--and I think they are correct--that this is not going to help their cause. 
President Yeltsin has been steadfast and brave and courageous as he has tried to move, despite great odds and a lot of problems, especially inflation, to try to move Russia to the West and to democracy and to a good free market. 
I think this is going to hurt it, and I think hurt it needlessly, because there is absolutely, in this Senator's opinion, no urgency whatever to make this decision, which is the part I just cannot understand--why there is this sense of urgency. 
Only 2 short years ago, reading a quote from the President of the United States--actually 4 years ago, in which he gave a compelling reason not to have NATO expansion, and yet now it has all changed, and it didn't change that quickly.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague for those remarks. 
I just say to Senator Warner, on January 10, 1994, along the same vein, President Clinton himself made the following statement, only 4 years ago: 
Why should we now draw a new line through Europe just a little further east? Why should we now do something which could foreclose the best possible future for Europe? The best possible future would be a democratic Russia committed to the security of all of its European neighbors. The best possible future would be a democratic Ukraine, a democratic government in every one of the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union, all committed to market cooperation, to common security and to democratic ideals. We should not foreclose that possibility. 
That was the President of the United States, Bill Clinton, on January 10, 1994. I simply say to my colleagues, what has changed? What has changed?

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I think it has a lot `to do with anything.' The President made these statements at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, and his point is that drawing a new line through Europe a little further east might jeopardize the relationship between the Russians and the United States and bringing the Russians into the democracy, into the West as a democratic nation. The Senator doesn't believe that is relevant to this?

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I'm reading the President's quote. `The best possible future would be a democratic Russia committed to the security of all of its European neighbors. We should not foreclose it.' That was the time he followed in President Bush's footsteps of supporting the Partnership for Peace, which I also support. Now something has intervened--perhaps the election of 1996--that caused him now to change his mind, and suddenly now there is this urgent need to have these three nations become part of NATO.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Let me say, when I came into the room and prior to coming into the Chamber, I listened to some of the debate of my colleagues on the other side of this issue. Very interesting. I thought for a moment that I was in a time warp, that I was back in the 1950s and was somehow privy to the debate here. I heard terms like `cold war.' I heard terms like `evil empire,' `Iron Curtain,' and Stalin was mentioned, as was Yalta and the Soviet Union. 
Unless I am missing something--and I try to pay pretty close attention to current events--I don't see that same situation in the world today. I think Stalin is gone. It is my understanding that he is. The Iron Curtain is no longer there, which Churchill talked about. Yalta divided up Europe, unfortunately, and now we have these nations who have sought and got a well-deserved freedom. Now the Senate is considering whether to add these three nations--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. That is the issue before us. The question is whether that is necessary or not in considering the situation right now in the world. 
I just say to my colleagues, what is the threat today to those three nations or any other nation that may be coming into NATO in the future? What is the specific threat? Is there still a cold war? Is there still an Iron Curtain? Is there a massive Soviet army poised at the ready on the borders of Poland or on the borders of Germany or on the borders of Hungary or Romania or the Czech Republic? I don't see any. Is Russia now an absolute to become a democratic nation, never to be a threat to the United States? No, absolutely not. That is the point of the discussion. What is the best way to try to bring that nation into the democratic fold, not 
to turn to the East, not to turn to Red China, not to turn to Iran and other nations that could very well be a serious threat to the United States before the end of the 21st century? 
But a few weeks ago when this matter first came up, it seemed to be a foregone conclusion that we were going to run this thing through with no debate, essentially. Everybody was feel-good, emotional. These nations had `earned it.' They are free and now they have earned the right to fall under the umbrella of NATO--25 percent of which is funded by the United States, I might add--and earned the right to become members of NATO. Then, after several of us had written a letter to the leaders and requested some time--we had a little difficulty getting it, but we did get the time to have a good debate, and I appreciate the fact that both Senator Daschle and Senator Lott responded to that request. However, unfortunately, there is still other information that is out there that we would like to have. For example, the NATO report, which is not due until perhaps late next month or early in June; it would be nice to have that. We don't have that. Again, we are now trapped in this urgency--this urgency. There is this huge threat looming out there to these three countries. Yet, I have not heard anybody tell me what that threat is. I would be happy to yield to anybody on the floor now or later who would be willing to stand up and tell me what the threat is to Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. Where is the threat that forces us to immediately, this week, vote on NATO expansion? 
Frankly, a growing number of us have come to the realization that expanding NATO is unwise. At worst it is unwise and unnecessary at best. It is time for a little thought. Some tried to get this thing to go through without any thought. I think that was the goal initially, to run this thing through before we had much time to think about it, analyze the thoughts, and before we had time to realize that there wasn't any threat, that this was emotional, feel-good politics. That is what this is. 
If NATO enlargement made sense, it would have gained strength as the debate began, not lost strength. It is losing strength. There are more Members now than there were several weeks ago who are opposed to NATO expansion. The more it was discussed, the more opposition there was. My suspicion has been that many of those clamoring for that speedy vote did so out of fear that the case for enlargement may not just bear the scrutiny that is deserves--and it does deserve a lot of scrutiny for a number of reasons, which we will be getting into, costs among others. But in discussions with constituents over the recess and colleagues over the past several weeks, my suspicion has been confirmed. When asked careful questions, the American people have serious reservations. I think initially--and I was one of them--when it first came up, the emotional response was, wow, they have gotten their freedom finally. We spent trillions to help them win it--trillions. We sacrificed American lives, millions of Americans in uniform, to help defeat the `evil empire' that Ronald Reagan spoke about. And it worked. But the question really is whether or not the so-called NATO umbrella makes sense right now. Now what are the people saying? 
Hot off the presses is a poll from Opinion Research of Princeton, a nationwide poll, just completed today. They ask the following question to people across the country: `Congress is currently debating expanding the NATO military alliance to include Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary. Estimates of the cost to U.S. taxpayers from the first phase of expansion range from $400 million to $19 billion. 
Do you oppose or favor expanding NATO? Answer: Favor, 32 percent; opposed, 56 percent.' 
By almost a 2-to-1 margin, when you indicate that we do not have a handle on the cost, people are opposed. 
These are facts. This is information that deserves to be part of the debate. This decision should not be based on polls. I will be the first one to agree with that. We should not be making a decision as important as the expansion of NATO based on polls. But it shows that when the American people understand and get information, they react accordingly. I think many members had the feeling that the American people were overwhelming in their support of this because it is an emotional feel-good thing to do. These nations suffered immensely under communism for a long, long time. And they earned their freedom. 
The question is: How do we preserve and continue to protect that freedom? The question is, Mr. President, do we look back at the last 50 years, or do we look ahead at the next 50 years in terms of protecting that freedom? Because that is the question we are talking about here today. We are not talking about Stalin and the evil empire and the cold war. We are talking about the next 50 years, and hopefully the next 150 or 250 years. That is what we are talking about. 
The best way to preserve and protect and defend these nations and their way of life is to have a Western Russia, a Russia that has moved into the West, a democratic Russia, and we ought to be doing everything in our power to see to it that that happens, and anything we do in any way to hinder that is a serious mistake, a mistake that we are going to pay for dearly down the road. It is a very shortsighted, a very, very shortsighted decision. 
With or without NATO, the United States can come to the defense of any European nation next week, tomorrow, next year, or 5 years from now. Should Europe ever be threatened by Russia, or by anybody else, we can expand NATO. We can do it quickly. 
But there is a lot to lose and very little to gain by expanding NATO now. We basically say to Russia: Don't worry about it. Don't worry about NATO expansion. It is OK. It is a defensive alliance. But it does not matter what we say. It matters what the Russians think. They have stated clearly and officially they oppose expansion. It has been said by others on the floor, and I agree that we should not set our foreign policy based on what the Russians say, I will be the first to admit that, but we ought to realize there is a lot going on inside Russia and there is no threat to these nations from Russia. 
So why not leave the window open a little bit longer? What is the urgency? What is the threat? Let me keep asking that question. Somebody rise on the Senate floor sometime during this debate, if not now, and tell me what the threat is. Tell me what the urgency is. There is no urgency. There is no threat. It is an emotional feel-good thing to do. They earned it. They are free. Let us put them under the umbrella of NATO and protect them. From what? We are still going to go to their defense if anything threatens them. Every person in the Senate knows it. The most important requirement for the Poles, the Czechs, and the Hungarians as far as their security is concerned is that America and Russia remain friends. That is the protection these nations need--that Russia and America become friends and remain friends. That is the issue here.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. It sure does. The Senator knows that. He knows the Senator has worked on this issue tirelessly in the Armed Forces Committee and has visited Russia to see this. 
I don't think anybody could deny that in the very near future Russia is going to be one of the, if not the, strongest nations in 
that region of the world. The question is, Whose side is it going to be on? Is it going to be on the Iranians' side? Is it going to be an alliance with the Chinese Communists? Or is it going to be on our side? If it is on our side, why will the Poles care, or the Czechs, or the Hungarians, or anybody else? The point is they wouldn't. 
What we ought to be doing again is keeping the window open, using the advantages that we have to draw that out, to draw them this way. Senator Warner has mentioned how they have reached out to do that. We are taking down tremendous numbers of weapons that have been aimed at the United States for decades. 
But extending an alliance, which during the cold war the Soviet Union considered hostile, the countries that she doesn't threaten is basically kicking this former giant, like the Senator from Virginia said, poking them in the ribs. That is exactly what we are doing. God knows. I have stood on this floor many times and in the House Chamber before that and extolled the virtues of the United States against the cold war Soviet Union and voted trillions to defeat it. But let's not walk away from the victory. Let's not walk away from the victory. History shows that it is unwise to treat nations like that, and it is highly dangerous for countries in the middle, because these are the countries that are going to suffer if there is a confrontation that takes place between the United States and Russia again. It is the nations in the middle in Eastern Europe that are going to get the squeeze. That is where it is going to be fought. Those are the people who are going to suffer. 
We are talking about costs. The cost was in that poll question. I am not sure what we are paying for it. Maybe someone else does. You have estimates as high as $125 billion, some $250 billion. It is not the issue of cost per se. It is that nobody knows what the facts are. Nobody knows what we are dealing with. That is why there is this uncertainty. 
What if there is a threat and these nations were actually threatened? The question of cost would be irrelevant--I think. I think we would go to the defense of France, a current NATO member, and I would assume if these nations become members we would go to their defense if there was a threat. It would be irrelevant now as it was in the cold war, because we made the commitment if one is attacked, we are all attacked and we are going to do our part. But unfortunately, our part becomes the dominant part in NATO, and as current members shrink back from responsibility, this will increase our responsibility or our burden. There is no foreseeable conventional threat to any country in Europe, and no credible analysis disputes this. I challenge anyone to give me an analysis that shows how any nation in Europe today has a conventional threat. Is there a Russian army, a strong Russian army that has threatened France, Hungary, or the Czech Republic, or England, or anybody else? Where is it? If it isn't, then what is the urgency? What is the threat?

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague for his comments. I in no way object or feel interrupted. I think this is a good way to debate the issue. It is much better than a series of monologues, I think, in regard to this issue. 
I would just say to my colleague, though, I am trying to accomplish, I think, the same thing that he is, which is that Poland or any other country not be a doormat for anyone else ever again. I think that really goes to the heart of the debate here; what is the best way to accomplish that? 
My point is--and I am a supporter of NATO, always was and still am--but I believe that what we have here is a window of opportunity that allows us to try to pull the Russians to us. If the Russians right now were threatening Poland, I would say it is urgent--or were even talking about threatening Poland--it is urgent to move forward on this. We would still go to their defense, in my opinion, anyway. But that is an academic argument.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. It is still going to take a commitment, whether you are in NATO or not, it is still going to take a commitment to defend Poland, period. You have to have a will to do that, whether you are in NATO or not. 
The point here is we have an opportunity, where the Russians have reached out to us ever so slightly, but as the Senator from Virginia has talked about in strategic weapons reduction, in trying to look at what Yeltsin has gone through, the market reforms--1000 percent inflation a few years ago down now to 8 percent. They have worked hard to try to make this thing work with a lot of strong leadership. 
I don't think this is the way to encourage them to continue to do that. This Senator, I guess much like Nixon going to China, is hardly one who has been soft on the Russians or the Soviet Union over the past several years of my public life, and certainly I have been in as strong opposition to them as anyone else. But also a strategist has to look at the real world, and I don't think we ought to be looking at just simple, cheap analogies here. We ought to be looking at the real world, and the real world is today, not what it was yesterday. Yesterday the real world was Stalin, was the cold war, was the `evil empire,' was expansionist tendencies, and was the NATO which came forth to block all of that. 
Today, we don't know what the future will bring; therefore, we do need NATO. But the question is, `Do we need NATO expansion?'; not, `Do we need NATO?' Those are two different issues. Do we need NATO? Yes. Do we need NATO expansion in order to make this transition? I don't believe that we do. I think that is really the crux of this issue. There is no urgency. 
Again, what is the urgency? I say with the greatest respect to my colleague. What is the urgency? What now is the threat that is perceived, that you perceive to be, that makes this necessary to do today or tomorrow rather than to give the Russians some more time to make these reforms work, to perhaps get the START II agreement that the Senator from Virginia was talking about? What is the urgency? That is really the thrust of my involvement here. 
I will be happy to yield for a comment.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Let me say to my colleague, I posed the question to you about urgency, and you answered it. And I commend you for that. I do not agree with your assessment of urgency. 
I think that, to me, `urgency' would be a military urgency, a perceived threat. It is not an urgent matter to make this decision today or tomorrow or within the next few months. It might be a matter that could, in your opinion, enhance the situation to prevent an emergency or an urgency, but I do not see it as that right now.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Clearly, yes. It clearly had the capability to send an army into Western Europe if it so chose, if we had not stood up to stop it. 
I think the issue, though, of dividing lines--I believe the Senator used the term `dividing line' or `artificial lines' or `demarcations in Europe,' saying, `See, I think it's the opposite.' I think by doing this, we are creating artificial lines in Europe, and we are picking winners and losers. These three--why these three nations and not six, seven, eight others? 
And I think we are going to have a permanent sense of disruptions, if you will, now in Europe over the next several years as this debate comes up over and over and over again as to who is next and who would be the next country to go in. 
As far as going back to 1939 and what happened--we have 100,000 troops in Europe today. If we had 100,000 troops in 1939, Hitler may not have come into Poland with his panzer divisions. I think that is a very important point here. It is not that we are sitting there in a sterile vacuum in Europe with nothing there. We 
have NATO now. We have armed forces there. And, again, my objective here is to see to it that we create an environment that, hopefully, will see a peaceful relationship between the United States and Russia which will enhance the protection of these very nations that we talk about.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I really would take issue with the comparison between the situation today we are talking about with the expansion of NATO and Yalta. We had a ground war, a terrible war that impacted almost every nation in Europe, Western and Eastern, that was costly, and at the end of it, with two sides converging, the Americans and the Russians converging on Europe, basically, I believe in a horrible mistake--I think the Senator would probably agree--the politicians sat down and carved up Europe and therein caused the problem that we faced. And from that came NATO and the cold war and everything else. 
This is not what we are talking about today. This is Russia today. This is a country that has had its ears pinned back pretty well as far as its conventional forces. It still has a ton of nuclear material and certainly nuclear weapons, tons of it, literally, that we are interested in working with them to get rid of. 
But I do not know what message it sends, not only to the American taxpayers but also to the Russians themselves, to say, on one hand, as the Senator is saying, that we would provide moneys to this empire, former evil empire, to take down their strategic systems--and we are doing that with Nunn-Lugar and other funds--and, on the other hand, spend as much as $250 billion to bring nations into an alliance to defend ourselves against that very same nation. 
Now, there is an inconsistency there somewhere, that sooner or later somebody will figure out that it doesn't make sense. I think we have to understand that. 
I say to my colleague from Delaware, I am about to wrap up. I know the Senator has a statement. I have been on the floor quite some time and I will yield in a moment. 
We are creating insiders and outsiders here. In my humble opinion, what we are going to do if we act on this this week is say to three nations, `You guys are winners; we are picking you.' You talk about Yalta; if there is a comparison, that is it. They picked winners and losers at Yalta. We are picking winners and losers. You three nations, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, you are the good guys. You get the protection of NATO. 
Tomorrow, next year, or 3 years from now, depending on how this is resolved on the expansion vote here, depending on what amendments may pass, we will see this revisited again with other countries--whether it be Romania or some other country down the line, Slovenia, and on and on, Latvian countries. We will see this come up again and again. The same issue is going to have to be argued again and again and the same hard feelings. 
Again, going back to the position of the point of urgency, I just don't see what the urgency is to do that and to continue that kind of dialog and that kind of agitation. Basically, it is a permanent agitation that will go on for years and years and years. If at any time the Russians, the nationalists in Russia, the Zhirinovskys of the world were to assume power or even to look like they were going to assume power, we do what we have to do. 
Adding these three insiders creates more outsiders. That is the issue. This is a perpetual anguish that will be taken up year after year after year here on the Senate floor and will be debated nationally, and all the difficulties--and I think if the Senator would talk to some of the arms control people in the current administration, he might be surprised at some of the information they might give you on the QT as to how they feel about NATO expansion and what it might do to the strategic arms talks. I have talked to some of them, and it is interesting what they have to say. This will be disruptive for the alliance as a whole, and as member nations are encouraged or compelled to take sides, it will cause stress in the whole alliance. 
The end of the cold war, NATO faces internal issues, serious ones about its means and its end, whether Bosnia-type missions are appropriate. Is a Bosnia mission appropriate for NATO? Do we know that? We couldn't find unity in the Persian Gulf war when we had the threat from Saddam Hussein. We could not get unity. We saw evidence in the Libyan situation where the French Government refused to allow our aircraft to fly over their country. We have not had a big, rosy picture of unity even among NATO nations at all times, although the alliance has worked well on the whole. There are a lot of issues that need to be desperately looked at regarding the current NATO before we start exacerbating the problem by adding new nations. 
Enlargement, in my opinion, is a token, well intended, but a token and unimagined distraction from real problems. That is my concern. I get a little tired of the old cold-war dividing line reference and how we left the countries out in the cold and somehow we owe them. 
A lot of Americans died, a lot of Americans put on uniforms, a lot of taxpayers ponied up to the tune of trillions and trillions of dollars to help them get that freedom. They earned it. I am glad they have it. Not letting them in NATO is not going to do one thing to harm it at all. It may enhance it. In fact, in my humble opinion it will enhance it because we will draw the Russians, I believe, out toward the West and not to the East, which I believe in the long run protects their freedoms. 
In conclusion, this should not be a sentimental decision about our historic relationship with Europe. It ought to be a hard-nosed decision about extending a military guarantee to a precise piece of territory under current strategic circumstances.  
I think, again, it is about the next 50 years, not the last 50. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this is National Victim Rights Week and today I am introducing a bill to amend section 991(a) of title 28, United States Code, to require certain members of the United States Sentencing Commission to be selected from among individuals who are victims of a crime of violence. 
Each year, Mr. President, about 40 million Americans are victimized by crime. Yet, all too often, the voices of those victims are lost in the criminal justice system. In fact, it often seems that the voices of those who commit crimes are heard with greater attentiveness by our criminal justice system than are the voices of the victims of crime. As President Reagan's Task Force on Victims of Crime stated in its 1982 report, `the criminal justice system has lost its essential balance.' 
One response to this problem has been S.J. Res. 44, a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of victims of crime, which has been introduced in this Congress by Senators Kyl and Feinstein. I am proud to be a cosponsor of that crime victims constitutional amendment. 
The bill that I am introducing today, Mr. President, is another response to the problem of the under representation of victims' rights in our criminal justice system. My bill, which my distinguished colleagues from North Carolina, Senators Faircloth and Helms, are cosponsoring, would reserve two of the seven seats on the United States Sentencing Commission for victims of violent crime. 
Mr. President, the United States Sentencing 
Commission is an independent entity within the judicial branch that establishes sentencing policies and practices for the Federal courts. This includes sentencing guidelines that prescribe the appropriate form and severity of punishment for offenders convicted of Federal crimes.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Vicki Donovan for being named the 1998 New Hampshire Teacher of the Year. Vicki is a fourth grade teacher at Belmont Elementary School in Belmont, New Hampshire, and is being recognized for her excellence in teaching and leadership in innovative curriculum reform. 
As a teacher for over 15 years, Vicki has proven her dedication to her students and her community, going far beyond her classroom duties. As a member of the Belmont Elementary Language Arts Curriculum Committee, Vicki facilitated a pilot program in their new language arts curriculum. She is involved in Belmont Elementary School's extracurricular activities, and has always displayed an avid interest in the lives and well-being of her students. She is a member of the newly formed Health Fair Committee that involves school staff and local health care officials in providing resources and information to students and families. She is an elected member of the Government Study Committee that has done exhaustive work in attempting to restructure and improve the Belmont town government, and she is involved with the Youth and Education Committee of the Belmont Civic Pride Organization. This is just a sampling of Vicki's professional and civic involvements; her contributions to Belmont Elementary School and the Town of Belmont are immeasurable. 
Vicki's own educational record proves the value that she places in learning. She has continued to take professional courses throughout her teaching career, and in 1996 completed her Masters degree in Education.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Commander Richard A. Searfoss, mission specialist Richard M. Linnehan and payload specialist Jay Clark Buckey for their participation in the April 16, 1998, Neurolab mission STS-90. These men are on the forefront of science, bravely pioneering the new frontier of space in an effort to investigate the effects of weightlessness on the brain, central nervous system, and sensory organs. 
After graduating from Portsmouth Senior High School in New Hampshire, Rick Searfoss attended the United States Air Force Academy where he was awarded the Harmon, Fairchild, Price and Tober Awards as the top overall, academic, engineering and aeronautical engineering graduate in the Class of 1978. When Commander Searfoss was selected for the astronaut program, he was a flight instructor at the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School where he was named the Tactical Air Command F-111 Instructor Pilot of the Year in 1985. Having logged over 4200 hours flying time in 56 different types of aircraft, there can be no doubt about Commander Searfoss' courage or ability. 
Richard M. Linnehan, a graduate of the University of New Hampshire, is a distinguished astronaut and veterinarian. After entering into private veterinary practice and further study of animal medicine and comparative pathology, Dr. Linnehan was commissioned as a Captain in the U.S. Army Veterinary Corps. He served as chief clinical veterinarian for the Navy's Marine Mammal Project at the Naval Ocean Systems Center in San Diego. Dr. Linnehan has been at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) since 1992, where he has worked in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory and in the Astronaut Office Mission Development Branch. He was a member of the international crew of the STS-78 mission in 1996, the longest space shuttle flight to date. 
Jay Clark Buckey, currently a NASA payload specialist and Associate Professor of Medicine at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, New Hampshire, has a distinguished record in aerospace medicine. Dr. Buckey has over twenty publications to his credit in the areas of space physiology, cardiovascular regulation and echocardiographic techniques. He is a former executive board member of the American Society for Gravitational and Space Biology, as well as a member of the Aerospace Medicine Association and American College of Physicians. His accomplishments at NASA include performing as co-investigator and project manager for the Spacelab Life Sciences-1 experiment `Cardiovascular Adaptation to Zero-Gravity,' for which he received two NASA Certificates of Recognition for software developed. 
WMUR-TV of Manchester and the Christa McAuliffe Planetarium of Concord are cooperating to offer a live interactive question-and-answer session with the New Hampshire astronauts on April 24, 1998, that will be shown in the Planetarium and relayed to students in the astronauts' hometowns of Portsmouth, Pelham and Hanover. Students will beam questions up to the astronauts and have the answers beamed back to them, giving the students a window into life aboard the space shuttle and an opportunity to speak with real live heroes. 
Risking their own lives to determine the effects of space travel, these men exhibit bravery that should inspire us all. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Commander Richard A. Searfoss, mission specialist Richard M. Linnehan, and payload specialist Jay Clark Buckey for their outstanding work. I am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dr. John R. Kreick as he retires from Sanders after a distinguished 28-year career. I commend and admire his dedication and commitment to the defense industry, the community and the employees of Sanders. 
John joined Sanders in 1969, after receiving his doctorate in theoretical physics as a research physicist. He proceeded to manage and direct the development and production of infrared countermeasure systems that are today deployed on U.S. and allied helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft around the world. John moved up to technical director for the Sanders Defense and Information Systems Division in 1983 and was then promoted to vice president and chief engineer for the division that same year. He was named vice president of the company's airborne countermeasures product line in the Electronic Warfare Division in 1984 and was named President in 1988. 
John is nationally recognized as a leader in the electronic warfare field. He was honored in 1995 by Aviation Week magazine with the Aerospace Laurels Award and he holds a gold medal award from the Electronic Warfare Association. 
As Chairman of the U.S. Senate Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I have witnessed firsthand John's contributions to our national defense and how his efforts have helped protect American lives. Our rights to `life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness' are safer today because of John's leadership. 
I have had the pleasure of John's friendship and mutual respect for the past 13 years. I wish John, Carole and his family much happiness in his retirement and I know he will enjoy his free time skiing mid-week in the White Mountains. John Kreick, best wishes and Godspeed. It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Nashua Lions Club for devoting over 75 years to humanitarian acts of public service. I commend their fervent passion and aggressive dedication to improving the quality of life for fellow Americans. They have touched the lives of many through gifts of hope and continued support through countless charitable endeavors. 
I am proud to know many of the members in the Nashua Lions Club. I recently had the opportunity to address the club, and enjoyed the time I spent with them. They are great men who live by their motto of `We Serve,' and give others the chance to better their lives. 
The Nashua Lions Club was started in 1923 by a small group of businessmen led by William Hillman, Jr., and former Mayor Alvin Lucier. It became the first club in District 44-H and remains the second oldest Lions Club in New Hampshire. As a result of their foresight, these businessmen started a tradition of service and benevolence still exemplified today. 
The Nashua Lions Club has kept this 75-year old legacy alive by raising money and funding organizations like the Lions Sight and Hearing Foundation, Lions Eye Clinic and Lions Diabetes Awareness Programs. Also, major building projects have been realized like the `Friendship Club,' for the handicapped and `Melanie's Room,' for multiple handicapped young girls. 
Over the years, the Lions Club has raised over $750,000. Its members continue to develop new and innovative ways to invest that money back into the community. The above mentioned groups are just a few of the wonderful organizations for which the Nashua Lions Club have spent countless hours and dedicated service. This impressive list goes on and they should be very proud of these contributions. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Nashua Lions Club for their outstanding work over the past three-quarters of a century. I am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to request that my colleagues in the Senate conduct deliberative and thorough debate on NATO expansion before the expected vote next week. 
Many questions remain regarding cost, strategic objective and military requirements of the proposed expansion. If NATO enlargement makes sense, it will make more sense the more it is discussed. We should not casually rush through debate in the Senate. 
This should not be a sentimental decision about our historic relationship with Europe, but a hard-nosed decision about extending a military guarantee to a precise piece of territory under current strategic circumstances. Our moral obligation to these countries was abundantly met by generations of Americans, who spent trillions of dollars to win the cold war. This decision should be about the next 50 years, not the last 50.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as you know, earlier this week the full Senate began to deliberate expanding the NATO treaty to include the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary. While I have already presented some opening remarks on the floor about my concerns with moving forward now on this matter, I want to update my colleagues on a closely related issue which I personally think has some degree of relevance to what we are considering. 
In July, 1997, I was pleased to be a leader of a delegation to Prague and Warsaw whose primary mission was to seek information about missing American servicemen from the Cold War period. I was joined on this trip by my House colleague, Congressman Sam Johnson of Texas--himself a former POW from Vietnam--and also by one of our former Ambassadors to the Soviet Union, Malcolm Toon. Together, we are all members of a Joint Commission with Russia on the POW and MIA issue which was established by President Bush and President Yeltsin in 1992. One of our goals last summer was to broaden our search to the former communist Eastern Bloc nations who were allied with North Vietnam, North Korea, and the Soviet Union during the Cold War period. 
During our trip, we were received by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel, and the President of the Republic of Poland, Aleksander Kwasniewski. We also met with various ministers in each of these two countries. I want my colleagues to know that we were very impressed with the pledges of cooperation we received at all levels during all of our meetings. It appeared to us at the time that Poland and the Czech Republic clearly understood the importance that Americans attach to resolving lingering questions about the fate of our unaccounted for POWs and MIAs. These nations had suffered their own tragedies under communist domination, and we believed there would be a sincere, thorough effort to assist us with our humanitarian mission. 
I might also add that although we did not personally visit Hungary during that trip, we did send staff representatives to Budapest, and we later received similar pledges of cooperation from the Hungarian Embassy in Washington. 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, I must report that the follow-up actions that we had hoped would take place have not been satisfactorily fulfilled by these three nations. This is especially disturbing and troublesome to me as the full Senate now considers whether to guarantee putting more American military lives on the line for these republics in the former Eastern Bloc. 
It has been said by some NATO expansion advocates that we have an opportunity to ensure the Cold War never resurfaces in this part of the world. Yet, we still cannot seem to get the cooperation we need from this region to address vital questions about our missing and captured Americans from this same Cold War period. We still are not able to resolve this Cold War problem. 
If their pledges were indeed genuine, as I believed they were, then I, frankly, question Mr. President why the leaders of these countries cannot convince their respective bureaucracies to open their Cold War communist files and make relevant personnel available to us for interview. To me, this apparent inability to follow through on commitments has serious implications which we should be considering in the context of the NATO expansion debate. 
Since last summer, there have been follow-up communications by our Commission support staff at the Department of Defense and also by my own office with each of these nations urging them to follow through on their commitments. Most important is the fact that, based on current leads available to us, our Commission believes there is relevant information which likely exists in Eastern Europe, especially in the military, intelligence, security, and communist party archives of these three nations which we are considering bringing into NATO. 
We should remember that the Eastern Bloc was an active ally and supporter of the communist North Vietnamese and North Korean regimes during those respective U.S. wars. They had a significant presence in Asia and were probably privy to information about communist policy toward the disposition of American POWs, to include whether any were transferred to the territory of the former Soviet Union as we now suspect. 
Mr. President, today I appeal once again to the leaders of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary to follow through fully with the commitments they have made to help us search for our missing American servicemen from the Cold War. And I urge my colleagues, on behalf of our veterans and POW/MIA family members, to join with me in continuing to push for more progress on this humanitarian issue. 
We simply cannot afford to lose sight of this issue of highest national priority in the context of the current NATO expansion debate. It has important ramifications which we should carefully consider.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Bode Miller, a distinguished athlete from Franconia, New Hampshire, for participating in the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Bode had the opportunity to compete in the Olympics because of his dedication to precision, relentless drive for excellence and unswerving passion for skiing. 
It was a special honor to have Bode represent our country and the State of New Hampshire while competing in Nagano, Japan. He started skiing at the young age of three at his favorite and most frequented mountain, Cannon. As a young boy, his ability to ski caught the attention of many. He soon acquired the nickname, `Kid Cannon,' and dazzled his peers with his talent. Bode was then invited to a training camp at Sugarloaf Mountain and was soon targeted as a gifted athlete. As a result, he was offered a scholarship to the Carrabassett Valley Ski Academy where he was able to improve his abilities and work with experienced coaches to tune his skills. 
Bode burst into the international scene with an 11th-place finish, the best by an American, at the World Cup giant slalom at Park City in November. Before this outstanding finish, Bode was ranked internationally at 69th place. Bode's career then took off and he became a member on the Olympic Ski Team. Often times, the television announcers for the races raved about his athleticism and admired his aggressive style. At the age of 20, in a sport where racers are generally older, the media characterized him as a young rebel. 
According to Bode's coach, Bode is very good at figuring out what it takes to be successful and is exceptionally confident. He is aware of his own physical talents and incorporates this attitude in his style. I'm sure, because of his young age, he will continue to excel and impress the nation. Nonetheless, he still has achieved what most only dream about and has proven once again that Americans continue to achieve great feats. At a fresh age, Bode proudly represented our country and delivered a superb performance in the world arena of Olympiads. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Bode Miller for his youthful vigor and aggressive competition in the 1998 Olympics and I am proud to represent him in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the Senate now is about to engage in a great debate, a debate that is very important to our country and, indeed, to the world. I had hoped that we could have postponed this debate somewhat, for a number of reasons. NATO itself is planning to put out a report on the requirements, costs and feasibility of enlargement sometime in May. Originally this debate was scheduled to come up in May, and now it has been moved up to mid-March. It is no secret that I am an opponent of enlargement, for reasons that I will go into somewhat today and, of course, later on as the debate continues. But I also feel very strongly--as some of my colleagues did who signed a letter to the leader, on both sides of the aisle--that we need more time to debate this, to understand fully what we are doing. 
I think that, when you first look at this issue, you might come to the conclusion that after being subjected to the tyranny of communism for 45 years, somehow these nations have earned a place in the NATO alliance. I think the nations certainly have earned their freedom, without question. They paid a heavy price for it. But so did the United States of America. We spent about $6 trillion in the Cold War to defeat Soviet communism. 
From the time I first came to the Congress, in 1985, I have been a strong supporter of our military and a strong supporter of the NATO alliance--which, by the way, is a military alliance, which sometimes I think people forget. It was a military alliance created to thwart the attempt of the Soviet Union to attack Western Europe and conquer it with its massive armies. 
But today there is no massive Soviet Army. There is no Soviet Union. Is Russia unstable? Of course it is. But it is not the Soviet Union and it is not the same threat that NATO was designed to contain. As we begin this debate, so many of our colleagues on the other side have said expanding NATO is a great idea, and that we need to move forward as quickly as possible. I have been around a few years on this Earth, and I have generally found that if something is a good idea today, it will probably be a good idea tomorrow. If it is a good idea tomorrow, it will probably be a good idea next month or perhaps even a year from now. 
So I wonder what the hurry is. I wonder why panic has set in among so many proponents of enlargement. It seems to me that, if it is a good idea, then a healthy debate ought not to ring the curtain down on it. But there appears to be some fear, I guess, that adding more time to the debate might change the outcome. I hope it does. I hope we have enough time to change the outcome, because I sincerely believe, after a lot of review on this issue, that we are making a serious mistake. 
Let me offer some of the reasons for opposing NATO enlargement. Given the administration's support and that of a lot of very prominent people of both political parties--there has been a very impressive outside lobbying effort by a lot of people--the political pressure has been very strong for moving this forward. Again, the date has been moved forward, from May to March. But I believe the Senate should take its advice and consent role with treaties very, very seriously. This is a matter for advice and consent, and I have a hard time understanding how one can adequately advise and adequately consent if we are being told that the resolution of ratification has to be voted on now, with minimum debate. 
The distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is now on the floor. I know he had an extensive period of debate on this issue in his committee. Unfortunately, I am not a member of that committee. Sometimes I wish I were, because I admire the chairman greatly, but I am not. However, I am a member of the Armed Services Committee, and we are having a hearing this Thursday on NATO enlargement. I would like to be able to digest the information that we will receive there. Unfortunately, that hearing will now fall right in the middle of the debate, so it will be difficult to reflect on the hearing with the debate already underway. 
As doubts have begun to appear, it has been somewhat 
disconcerting to see the proponents of NATO enlargement, the expansionists, so afraid that the Senate might carefully deliberate on this issue. As I said, if it is a good idea today, it ought to be a good idea a month from now or perhaps even a year from now. I might also add, only two countries in NATO have voted to broaden the alliance and bring in new members. 
Some have suggested that those of us who are opposed to expansion are not committed to European security. If there is any Senator in the U.S. Senate who has a stronger record of support of the NATO alliance, or has a stronger anti-Communist record than I, I would like to know who that Senator is. Perhaps, Mr. President, they are really anxious for us to vote because they fear the case for enlargement might not bear the scrutiny that we are about to give it. 
I have no plausible ulterior motive for opposing enlargement, and I am as anti-Communist and tough on the Russians as anybody alive. But this is not about communism anymore, although it appears some still think it is. 
Since coming to Congress in 1985, I have enthusiastically supported spending billions of dollars for the defense of Europe. As a matter of fact, the United States spent roughly $6 trillion on defense during the Cold War, much of it directly for the defense of Europe. A lot of American lives were lost in wars against communists, and millions of Americans served in uniform at great sacrifice to their own families to contribute to the security of Europe. So, with the greatest respect for those countries that now seek membership in NATO, I do not think we owe anything to anybody. I have weighed all the alleged benefits, I have looked at the potential risks, and I have come to a number of conclusions which I would like to cite here. 
First, if Europe or North America were truly threatened by Russia, the question of financial cost would be as irrelevant now as it was during the Cold War. Would we have gotten into a debate about how much it was going to cost if the Soviet Union had attacked North America? or attacked Europe? I don't think so. But for the foreseeable future--and I emphasize `foreseeable future'--Russia does not pose a conventional threat to any country in Europe. 
What is the conventional threat from Russia? They do not have a capable army. They have removed most of the conventional weapons, the tanks, and other items of warfare that would be associated with a standing army. I am unaware of any credible analysis of their military that disagrees with that conclusion. So, cost is an issue today because, unlike during the Cold War, we are not sure what we are buying. 
Second, I cannot imagine a worse long-term strategy for European security than jeopardizing United States-Russian relations. We have fought now for 50 years, first to defeat communism and to rid the world of the Soviet Union, and now to bring Russia and the Independent States back into the family of democratic nations. Russia is not there yet. We know that. Russia has many problems. But their once-mighty military is gone, for all intents and purposes. 
Regardless of what experts and even United States Senators may say, Russia opposes NATO expansion. Of course, that does not mean that we should. Russia does not dictate our foreign policy. In fact, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces in the U.S. Armed Services Committee, I routinely confront Russia on matters of arms control, proliferation, and national missile defense. These are important things to confront them about. But extending an alliance that she considers hostile to the countries that she cannot threaten is basically kicking the Russians for no reason. History tells us that this is unwise. 
You see, I think some are still in the Cold War looking at a 21st-century issue. I want to be talking to the Russians about national missile defense, about weapons proliferation, about arms control, about the ABM Treaty, and about how we can hopefully work together for the sake of keeping the peace in the world. This is 
far more important than picking 3 nations as winners--Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland--and ignoring 14 or 15 others who could also make a compelling case to come in. And we have now said: `You, you, and you, can come in.' And to take this token step, we are putting at risk progress with Russia on arms control, proliferation, missile defense and the ABM Treaty. 
I think we could be engaging the Russians to promote a world in the 21st century that has no dividing line between Western and Eastern Europe or dividing line between all of Europe and Russia. In the 21st century, I want this to be a world of peace. The 20th century was a world of war. I want to try to build something in the 21st century by looking ahead instead of thinking in the past. How do we do that? We engage the Russians on these issues, instead of antagonizing them or insulting them; we engage them. I think then, when the 21st century comes, we will see a Europe that is united with all nations in the European Union--united, friendly, cooperative in their economies, for the most part; perhaps even in their monetary system; and certainly acting as democratic nations with a common military bond. 
But in addition, I hope to see a Russia that is a buffer between Islamic fundamentalism and China, a buffer between Europe and those two entities, Islamic fundamentalism and China, two very, very dangerous philosophies looming out there. One, China, has nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them. Fundamentalist Islamic countries are getting these weapons. We want a Russia that is going to be a buffer against these threats. We want a Russia that is a part of the West. For 50 years we have dreamed of the day that we could make this happen. 
I am not some George McGovern liberal talking here. I am one who has been fighting the Soviet Union for 50 years, as many others have in both political parties. But we need to look ahead, think a little bit into the future about what we are doing. We are beginning to carve up Europe again, picking Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland and putting them on the right side of the line. But what is the threat to Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland today from Russia? I have not heard anybody tell me what it is. 
If Russia decides to build its defenses back up--and it very well may happen--if they decide to turn to communism again, or some other brute-force-type government, if that even begins to happen, we can take the necessary steps, including the expansion of NATO. But why do it before we have to? Why pass up the greatest opportunity we have had in 75 years to bring the Russian people into the West? We have that opportunity. It would be a crime to pass it up. Declining to expand NATO now does not in any way prevent us from doing so in the future. There is absolutely no reason why we cannot do this in the future --no reason. If somebody can come on the floor and explain to me why we cannot do this a year from now, or 2 years from now, if the danger so exists, I would like to hear that argument. 
It doesn't prevent us from doing it. Adding three insiders--Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary--creates a whole category of outsiders who say, `Well, why not us? We were dominated by the Soviet Union. Why are you picking them over us?' 
So you are going to subject NATO almost annually to the perpetual anguish of, `Am I next?' Latvia, Estonia, Romania, on and on down the line. `When is it my turn to come into NATO?' And meanwhile, while focusing on a cold war alliance, we continue to ignore what we want to do, which is to bring Russia into the Western World. 
With the end of the cold war, NATO now faces serious internal issues about its means and ends which should be aired and resolved before new countries are added. Enlargement is a token and, frankly, an unimaginative distraction from these real problems. We saw this in the debate in the Persian Gulf crisis last month. Many NATO countries weren't with us. 
Mr. President, I hope that we will think very carefully about this. It is a hardnosed decision about extending a military guarantee to a precise piece of territory under a specific set of strategic circumstances; it should not be a sentimental decision about a moral commitment to Europe. We already have that. 
What do we really want to accomplish? Do we really want to accomplish another line drawn through Europe this year, perhaps extending that line through another part of Europe next year and another line bringing in another nation the following year and continue this cold-war-era attitude? Or do we want to build a world where the United States and a strong Europe and a strong, democratic Russia can be a buffer, a source of power to confront Islamic fundamentalism and perhaps--perhaps--Communist China? I think we are being shortsighted, and I am going to get into more detail as to why later in the debate. Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I join the majority of my colleagues today in expressing strong support for the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, otherwise known as `ISTEA.' I was a proud supporter of this legislation in 1991 and continue to support its goals today. 
While the acronym `ISTEA' is often joked about, it does share at least one quality of the popular summer drink--It is refreshing. ISTEA also represents a revolutionary change from past transportation legislation and a shift toward an integrated, intermodal transportation system to promote efficiency and economic growth. Some of its major provisions include: assurance that gas tax dollars are used for transportation purposes, greater planning authority for state and local governments, increased research for innovative technologies such as intelligent vehicle highway systems, and funding for environmental protection activities. 
A reauthorized ISTEA should continue to recognize regional differences, but at the same time, recognize that our transportation system is a national system. Certainly, every state wants to get its `fair share,' and we will need to balance each state's needs with the needs of the nation as a whole. 
While there is some merit to having various funding programs to serve specific needs, it is important to me in the 
development of this legislation that we refrain from creating new funding categories or set-asides, and allow for maximum flexibility between the various programs. I also believe we should not be adding onerous mandates or sanctions on the states. I firmly believe that state governments are capable of protecting the health and safety of their citizens. 
From New Hampshire's perspective, it is important to ensure that small states continue to receive adequate funding for their infrastructure needs. New Hampshire strongly supports certain programs, such as the Bridge Rehabilitation, Scenic Byway and Recreational Trail programs, that other states may not need as much. The strength of ISTEA is that it recognizes these varying needs and provides states with the flexibility to direct funding as they see appropriate. 
There are many challenges before us as we operate in a balanced budget environment--something for which I have fought long and hard. Our needs will always outweigh our resources. But, we also have to recognize how critical our transportation system is to our economy and social well-being. While it is difficult to balance these frequently competing goals, I believe this bill strikes the right balance in providing an adequate amount of resources within the context of the balanced budget agreement reached last year. 
There is one other subject that I want to touch on briefly, and that is the environmental review and permitting process. I believe S. 1173 makes good progress toward streamlining the environmental review process. However, I do not believe we have gone far enough in resolving this problem. 
As it stands now, it takes as long as eight years to complete the planning and permitting phase of a highway project. This is simply too long and too wasteful of taxpayer dollars. We must take steps to shorten this process while still maintaining high environmental standards. 
There are numerous examples from all regions of the country that show why the current system is broken. One of these examples is from my home state of New Hampshire. The Nashua Circumferential Highway project was in the planning and environmental review phase for more than 10 years and had received the necessary permits from the Corps of Engineers when, at the eleventh hour, EPA stepped in and exercised its veto authority. EPA vetoed the project even though a $31 million environmental mitigation package was committed by the state. A scaled back version of this project is finally back on the table. However, many years and a significant amount of resources were unnecessarily wasted. This is just one of many fiascoes that have occurred all over the country. 
We need to bring some common sense and reason to the environmental permitting process. Unfortunately, there are certain groups who consider the National Environmental Policy Act, NEPA, to be sacred and untouchable. But, I am pleased to say that we have at least begun a debate on this issue and that a bipartisan effort to improve the environmental review process has taken place. While I think the language in S. 1173 represents a good first step, I still believe we could do more to streamline and improve the review process without circumventing protections for the environment. 
In addition, I am pleased that the bill managers agreed to include my amendment to authorize a recycled materials research program at the University of New Hampshire, UNH. UNH has already begun extensive research into the use of secondary or recycled materials in transportation infrastructure. The data developed through the university's testing and demonstration of the feasibility of certain recycled materials in road building will be extremely valuable to state departments of transportation, the Federal Highway Administration, and the construction industry. 
On balance I believe this is a good bill and deserves Senate approval. I look forward to swift action by the House on its ISTEA reauthorization bill, so we can get to conference and reach final agreement by the May 1 expiration date. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes on the need to bring some common sense and reason to the environmental permitting process for transportation projects. I am pleased to say that we have at least begun a debate on this issue and that a bipartisan effort to improve the environmental review process has taken place. 
As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am very familiar with the planning and construction process for highway and bridge projects. As such, I have been disturbed by statistics showing that it takes 10 years to plan, design and construct a typical transportation project in this country. 
Why does it take so long to plan a project? The answer lies in the multiple layers of agency evaluations on the impacts of various modes and/or alignment as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). While it would be sensible and efficient if the NEPA process established a uniform set of regulations and submittal documents nationwide, this has not been the case. 
For example, the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and their companion state agencies each require a separate review and approval process, forcing separate reviews of separate regulations and requiring planners to answer requests for separate additional information. Also, each of these agencies issues approvals according to separate schedules. The result: the time period between project beginning to completion has grown to at least 10 years, assuming that the project is non-controversial and there is adequate funding available. If either of these assumptions is not the case, the time period could be even longer. 
I am sure that if Senators contacted their own state transportation departments, they would be dismayed by the number of transportation projects that are delayed due to overlapping and often redundant regulatory reviews and processes. These delays increase costs and postpone needed safety and traffic improvements that would save lives. Clearly, this process from start to finish is too long and too cumbersome, often taking eight years just to complete the planning, review and design phases of a project. 
There are numerous examples to illustrate why the current system is broken. One of these examples is from my home state of New Hampshire. The Nashua Circumferential Highway project was in the planning and environmental review phase for more than 10 years and had received the necessary permits from the Corps of Engineers when, at the eleventh hour, EPA stepped in and exercised its veto authority. EPA vetoed the project even though a $31 million environmental mitigation package was committed by the state. A scaled back version of this project is finally back on the table. However, many years and a significant amount of resources were unnecessarily wasted. This is just one of many fiascoes that have occurred all over the country. 
While I think the language in S. 1173 represents a good first step, I still believe we could do more to streamline and improve the review process without circumventing protections for the environment. Unfortunately, there are certain groups who consider the National Environmental Policy Act to be a sacred statute in which no changes are warranted. I disagree with that viewpoint. 
I had intended to offer my own NEPA streamlining amendment today which would greatly improve the environmental review process for highway-related projects. In fact, my amendment is endorsed by numerous professional organizations involved in transportation as well as the association of state departments of transportation--the people who have first-hand knowledge and experience in the planning and design of a project. When it takes an average of eight years to complete the environmental review process, there is something wrong with the system. 
Many of these wasteful endeavors could have been avoided if a coordinated interagency review procedure was established early in the process. I think it is also important to establish a framework with mutually agreed upon deadlines for each agency to take action, as well as establish an effective dispute resolution process. As it stands now, often times there is no Federal-State coordinated review process established from the beginning, no set timetables for meeting certain reviews or permit approvals, and no system for resolving disputes in a timely manner. 
We need to design a better system that protects both the taxpayers' investment and the environment. I do not buy the argument that making common sense reforms to the NEPA review process is in any way compromising environmental protection. 
In conclusion, I hope we can continue working on improvements to the planning process as the ISTEA bill makes its way through conference. The system is `broke' and needs fixing. Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield to the distinguished majority leader.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The Senator caught me a little bit by surprise. I appreciate the Senator yielding. I will take 3 or 4 minutes to make some comments, Mr. President, on behalf of my colleague's amendment. 
Again, the Senator from Kentucky is out in front taking the lead on an issue which, when you look at it on the surface, appears to be the right thing, but when you look deeper, you know that it is not. Again, he has had the courage to take a lead on this. 
This amendment would, I believe, end one of the most costly and unfair and unconstitutional, as the Senator from Kentucky has said, minority set-aside programs in our Federal Government. As the Senator has already said, ISTEA mandates that `not less than 10 percent' of Federal highway and transit funds be allocated to `disadvantaged business enterprises.' These are firms owned by officially designated minority groups presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged. 
The Senator from Kentucky already mentioned the Supreme Court case. In the 1995 case, the Supreme Court spoke on this issue in Adarand v. Pena. Senator McConnell has gone into the details extensively, and I will not go back through it. But in that decision, as he has said, it is explained that not only the Supreme Court but a U.S. district court has ruled that this minority set-aside program is unconstitutional. 
It does seem somewhat, I don't want to say odd, but maybe ironic that we on the floor of the Senate have to debate to take language out through an amendment a piece of legislation that has already been ruled unconstitutional. I don't know what that says about the process, but it does not sound very good to me that we have to do that. 
It would seem to me that the logical thing to do would be to not have it in here; in other words, let's end this program and let's not have it in the legislation as we proceed. But it is there. 
Plain and simple, this is an affirmative action program for contractors. The administration's attempt to comply with the Court's decision by fiddling around with the DOT regulations does not meet the constitutional litmus test. Therefore, it is now incumbent on the Congress to bring ISTEA into compliance with our Constitution. 
We now have a major piece of legislation, i.e. the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, ISTEA, and in order to pass it, we have to bring it into compliance with our Constitution. 
It is one thing for the Federal Government to carry out unfair quota-based programs, which most reasonable people oppose, but it is bordering on outrageous, if not outrageous in and of itself, to say that the Federal Government should now mandate these very same unfair quota-based systems on its face, which is exactly what is 
going on without the Senator's amendment. 
This is a time-consuming, a very costly burden to the States. Some of the States, like my own State of New Hampshire, simply don't have, to be very candid about it, some of the significantly racial minority populations. So what happens is, it forces us into a position where we have to deal with the bureaucracy and twist and turn and try to jump through as many hoops as possible to meet that 10 percent DBE goal, which, as the Senator from Kentucky mentioned, is not good public policy. As the Senator well knows and has said--and I agree with him--the opportunity to gain employment ought to be based on merit, not be based on any type of quota. 
So by continuing this and the other 150-plus, I might add, preferential treatment programs--150 other preferential treatment programs--we are encouraging businesses to tie their business strategies to unconstitutional programs. As I said, what does this say about our process here, that we are encouraging businesses to tie their business strategy to something that is unconstitutional? The Court has spoken; two courts have spoken. Let's listen to the courts. It is sending the wrong message to many people, whether it is constitutional students or whether it is simply the minority startup businesses that we are trying to help. 
A better way, as the Senator has suggested, is to encourage minority entrepreneurs with a small business outreach program, which Senator McConnell has in his amendment. It is a good amendment. This alternative will still provide assistance to smaller minority-owned businesses without the heavy-handed mandate upon our States. 
Most Americans do not support preferential treatment programs, Mr. President, no matter where they come from or who they are supposed to help. We now have an opportunity to end one right here on the floor of the Senate, to end special preferential treatment. This is an opportunity to do that. 
I urge my colleagues to do two things: One, to uphold the Constitution, which, with all due respect to my good friend, is more important than the McConnell amendment, but the language of the McConnell amendment should be the second reason we should support it. So support the Constitution and support Senator McConnell and adopt the amendment. I yield to my colleague.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to join my colleague from Kentucky in supporting his amendment to end one of the many costly, unfair, and unconstitutional minority set-aside programs in our federal government. As the Senator has already stated, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) mandates that `not less than 10 percent' of federal highway and transit funds be allocated to `disadvantaged business enterprises'--firms owned by officially designated minority groups presumed to be `socially and economically disadvantaged.' 
In 1995, the Supreme Court spoke on this issue in its Adarand versus PenAE6a decision. While I will not go into detail on this decision since it has already been explained by the Senator from Kentucky, suffice it to say that both the Supreme Court and a U.S. district court have ruled that this minority set-aside program is unconstitutional. Plain and simple, this is an affirmative action program for contractors. And, the Administration's attempt to comply with the court's decision by tinkering with DOT regulations does not meet the constitutional litmus test. Therefore, it is now incumbent on the Congress to bring ISTEA into compliance with our Constitution. 
It is one thing for the Federal Government to carry out unfair, quota-based programs, which I oppose, but it is even more egregious that the Federal Government mandate that our states carry out such programs. This is a time-consuming and costly burden on some states, like New Hampshire, that simply do not have a significant racial minority population. It forces the state into situations where it is either awarding contracts to less qualified contractors or jumping through bureaucratic hoops trying to prove that it cannot meet the 10 percent DBE goal. Both of which are not good public policy. 
By continuing this and the other 150-plus preferential treatment programs, we are encouraging businesses to tie their business strategy to unconstitutional programs that will eventually be eliminated by the courts. This is sending the wrong message to minority start-up businesses. 
A better way to encourage minority entrepreneurs is with a small business out-reach program as outlined in the McConnell amendment. This alternative program would still provide assistance to smaller, minority-owned businesses without the heavy-handed mandate on our states. 
Most Americans do not support preferential treatment programs. We now have an opportunity to end one of the many race and gender-based programs in our federal contracting system. I urge my colleagues to uphold the principles of our Constitution and support the McConnell amendment.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Sarah Tueting, Gretchen Ulion, Katie King, Tarah Mounsey, Tricia Dunn, Sue Merz, Colleen Coyne and Karyn Bye, all distinguished athletes, for bringing home an Olympic gold medal in women's hockey. This gold medal symbolizes their dedication to excellence, relentless drive for greatness and unfailing crusade to become the best of the best. 
It is a special honor to have these Granite Staters represent our country and the State of New Hampshire while competing in Nagano, Japan. Concord's Tara Mounsey and Salem's Katie King both went to Brown University in Rhode Island. Tricia Dunn, a resident of Derry graduated from the University of New Hampshire. 
I also feel New Hampshire has a special claim to the Olympiads that attended Granite State Universities. Sarah Tueting and Gretchen Ulion both went to Dartmouth College. Sarah is from Winnetka, Illinois, and Gretchen is from Marlborough, Connecticut. Also, Colleen Coyne, Sue Merz, and Karyn Bye all went to the University of New Hampshire. Colleen is from East Falmouth, Massachusetts, Sue is from Greenwich, Connecticut, and Karyn is from River Falls, Wisconsin. 
The team was a strong medal contender coming into the Games, however, the Canadian team had a stronger pre-Olympic record. Nonetheless, they beat the odds and prevailed. Team USA went undefeated, winning the final gold medal game against Team Canada, 3 to 1. 
Their triumph created an immediate boom to women's hockey. Like pioneers, they have forged ahead in a sport historically not common for women and have proven to the world that it is no longer a sport just for men. As a result, they have become a catalyst for significant change in the interest of women's hockey. Already, local skating rinks across the country are reporting huge increases in lesson sign-ups. 
These young Americans have reached the pinnacle of success, achieved what most only dream about, and have proven once again that Americans continue to achieve great feats. They are very much like diplomats, proudly representing America and delivering a superb performance in the world arena of Olympiads. 
This Olympic team best exemplifies the qualities of a winning team. Four words come to mind that best represent the tools they used to bring home the gold: teamwork, dedication, hard work, and perseverance. Their attributes are an example for all that inspire others to succeed and reach that dream of dreams. 
As a participant in the Olympics, they have joined an elite group of athletes who have continued a tradition rooted since the days of the ancient Greeks. The Olympics are a time when countries come together and put aside their differences to celebrate not only competition but humanity. It is a gathering of diverse cultures, beliefs and traditions which are brought together for a common cause. This event, for which these women have worked so hard is one of the few times the world can concur this way. To not only attend the Olympics but to win a gold medal is an honor of which they should all be proud. 
Mr. President, I want to congratulate Sarah Tueting, Tarah Mounsey, Tricia Dunn, Sue Merz, Colleen Coyne and Karyn Bye for their outstanding accomplishments and I am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Thom Hindle, a distinguished individual, for being named the 1998 Dover Citizen of the Year. I commend his passion for American history and his inexhaustible dedication to keeping it alive. 
Thom, a Dover native, became very concerned that the history of Dover was not given the appreciation nor the recognition it deserved. As a result, Thom set out to remind and educate the community about the important facts and contributions Dover's history has to offer. 
Thom became the trustee for the Woodman Institute, an organization that focuses on preserving and documenting the past. Thom felt that he was preserving Dover's `hidden treasures' and sought to give everyone the chance to experience them. To keep it alive, he wrote a historical book on Dover which included written and pictorial information for future generations. 
Thom is also the president of the Northam Colonists, Dover's historical society, as well as a member of the Heritage group, a committee that is part of the historical society. The committee centers on historical areas of the town and also provides guided tours during the fall, which focus on historic homes and other noteworthy sights. He is also a trustee to Dover's oldest elderly care facility, The Wentworth Home. As a trustee, he raises money for a number of city projects that improve the visual aesthetics of the community. His work not only recognizes the important tributes of the past but also those that enrich the present. 
As a former history teacher, I appreciate Thom's commitment to history. It is imperative to remember our country's past, to see where we have been as a nation, and to see where we are going as a people. Not honoring American history is not honoring those who have fought, died, and sacrificed for the great nation we have today. 
Therefore, we as a generation should carry on the tradition our forefathers started: to continue to fight and strive to improve the lives of generations to come and to never give up the aggressive crusade for greatness and consistent drive for virtue. Like Thom, we should continue to defend the past and augment the future. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Thom for his outstanding work and I am proud to represent him in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Let me start by recognizing the amount of work and effort that Senator McConnell, the Senator from Kentucky, has done on this issue. At a time early on, I can recall in this debate when it seemed like this thing may take off across America, and Senator McConnell, even in the face of his own tough reelection, stood firm and led us, all of us in this body, on this issue. He is knowledgeable, to say the least, and has been a great leader not only leading us on this issue but, more important, leading the fight to protect and defend the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. 
I say with great respect for my friend--I know I embarrass him a little bit--this has been one of the major debates in this Congress since I have been here, with the possible exception perhaps of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, but this goes to the heart of the first amendment. And the Senator from Kentucky stood strong day after day, sometimes by himself, I remember, leading a filibuster. I remember being here at 5 o'clock in the morning, to the marching orders of my leader to be out here in a filibuster. The Senator was right, and history will prove that he was right. So there is a great debt of gratitude that I think--he may not realize it at the moment, but it will come his way. 
I want to add a few remarks to the debate. Much has been said and there is not too much more to add. I was somewhat taken by some of the remarks of my colleagues on the other side about special interests. We hear a lot about that. I think you can pretty well come to the conclusion that if you don't like somebody's views, they are special interests. But if you do like their views, they are probably responsible policy advocates. 
This is where the whole debate gets kinds of silly. There are a lot of people who have special interests. The Breast Cancer Institute is a special interest. Social Security recipients are special interests. But I don't get the impression that some of our folks over there would be labeling them special interests in the context of what has been defined. 
There are many reasons why McCain-Feingold is the wrong approach, but I just want to focus on a couple and specifically title II. 
Under title II of McCain-Feingold, it purports to draw a new bright line between issue ads and independent expenditures. As so many have said before, I had expenditures against me. I would have loved to have seen them off the air, but I had the opportunity to respond to them. As many have said before me, however close, I made it back because I did have the opportunity to respond, thanks to thousands of people who were there to help me with contributions so that I could respond. 
Many citizen organizations have expressed strong opposition to these issue-advocacy provisions. The Christian Coalition, for example, in a letter dated January 28 of this year urged the Senate to defeat McCain-Feingold because `this legislation essentially requires that if a citizen or group plans to advocate a position or report on votes candidates have cast, they must operate a PAC and comply with all the regulatory burdens that go with it. More Government control over what is said and how it is said is not what campaign finance reform should be about.' 
They are correct in that assessment. 
The National Right to Life Committee sent letters to Senators on February 17 of this year saying: 
Title II of McCain-Feingold would radically expand the definition of the key legal terms expenditure, contribution and coordination, so as to effectively ban citizen groups from engaging in many constitutionally protected issue advocacy activities. 
Lest you think I am singling out groups that may be more inclined to be Republican, we can also take a letter dated February 19 from the American Civil Liberties Union--certainly one of the leading organizations, I would say, not exactly ideologically with the right--they characterize title II as `a 2-month blackout on all radio and television advertising before primary and general elections.' 
The ACLU continues by noting: 
Under McCain-Feingold, the only individuals and groups that will be able to characterize a candidate's record on radio and TV during the 60-day period would be the candidate, the PACs and the media. 
That last point made by the ACLU is very interesting, Mr. President, because by limiting what issue groups can say during the 60 days before an election, McCain-Feingold would increase the power of the media, which may be the reason why they have been so silent in this debate. 
We are picking and choosing what part of the first amendment we want to protect, and of all people, the media should understand that. I think they do understand it and they are being very silent. I was particularly taken by the Senator from California a few moments ago when she said more money by candidates who have access to more money is not fair. I think that is pretty much what she said. I think I characterized it correctly. It is not fair or it is not right to have people with more money or access to more money. 
What about newspapers that have more money than other newspapers, is that fair? Should we restrict the New York Times and the Washington Post 60 days out so that they can be as fair as some small paper in Louisville, KY, or Wolfeboro, NH? Maybe we ought to even that out. There seems to be a lot of silence in regard to that. It is ironic that so much of the media supports these restrictions on free speech of political candidates and groups, and even more ironic is the silence. It is deafening. 
I can just imagine the cry if the Government tried to restrict the freedom of the press or say how many words, as the Senator said this morning, that Dan Rather can speak. I hear him speak so much I get sick of it, but it is his right to speak, and I would certainly protect that right, as we are doing today with our votes on the Senate floor. I hope Mr. Rather is taking note that we are protecting his rights to speak. But I hope that they will speak to protect our rights and to protect the rights of others to participate in the political process who don't have access to the national media to speak every day to the listeners. There are thousands of people out there, and they do it by contributing to a political campaign. 
Beyond the very serious issues raised by the specific issue-advocacy provisions in title II of McCain-Feingold, I have a more general concern, and this is something, Mr. President, that I think has not really been stated firmly in this debate. 
There is a premise, and I think it is an erroneous premise, and I say this to the Senator from Kentucky because I think this is something that may not have been brought out quite as much, that money is the corrupting factor here, that money in and of itself corrupts. I say to the Senator, does money corrupt when we do research for cancer? Does money corrupt when we give to charity and help millions of people? Does money corrupt when we ask for more money for education, indeed, higher education to allow kids to go to college, does that corrupt? I don't think so. 
Let me say it in another way. If I am in a store or any American citizen is in a store somewhere, and as I am walking down the aisle looking for something to purchase, I see a wallet on the floor. I reach down and pick up the wallet and there is $5,000 in the wallet and a name. I have two options: I can put the wallet in my pocket and walk out of the store, or I can take the wallet up to the counter and give it back to the clerk and say, `Somebody lost their wallet. Here is the name. There is $5,000 in it and you can return it.' 
If you use the logic that money corrupts, everybody keeps the wallet. But everybody doesn't keep the wallet, and the majority of Americans don't keep the wallet. That is the issue here. If the shoe fits, wear it; if money corrupts you, maybe you shouldn't be here. I have never been asked for anything for the money. Nobody has ever asked me for a vote, and I wouldn't give it to them and I would be insulted if somebody thought I would, and if somebody thought I would then they ought not elect me and vote for me. That is how strongly I feel about it. 
Fundamentally, McCain-Feingold is unconstitutional. That is the bottom line, as the Supreme Court said in Buckley versus Valeo, 9 to 0, liberals and conservatives on the Court. 
We also hear a lot about how we give special access to those who give us money. It is never reported in any of the stories, but yes, sure, people give money and they might see me or Senator McConnell or Senator Kempthorne or Senator Feingold, sure. But how about the other people who we help get their Social Security checks, who we meet with every day or we speak to from this group or that group who we never ask for anything, they never give us anything; we just help them every day, day in and day out, hundreds of letters we answer, hundreds of people we help in our constituent offices in our States. Nobody talks about them. Nobody asks them for money. They can't give money, in most cases. They just want good Government and some help. We don't hear about that. If you put it out there and balance it out, you find there is heck of a lot more people with access to us who don't have money than people who do.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life and accomplishments of Edward Aker, of Adelphi, Maryland, who passed away last week of brain cancer. 
Ed was an executive officer with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for nearly two decades. His service brought him posts in many countries, including Israel, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Pakistan, Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania. He was known by citizens throughout the Washington area and the world for his commitment to his mission, and his desire to help the underprivileged by encouraging economic development, humanitarian assistance and international cooperation. 
Ed distinguished himself with his public service. He served in the United States Navy during the Korean War, and worked at a number of government agencies including Housing and Urban Development, the State Department, and the General Services Administration before commencing his distinguished career at the United States Agency for International Development. He graduated from the University of Maryland, received masters degrees from the U.S. International University in Nairobi and San Diego, and received a PhD in business administration from Pacific Western University. 
Ed was admired by many for his patriotism, commitment to his family, dedication to his job, and uplifting spirit. He was the type of dedicated public servant that all Americans can admire. He was a no-nonsense executive who could be tough when the job had to get done; but, he combined this strong work ethic with a quick wit, great sense of humor and special charm. His generous smile will be missed by all who knew him. 
Ed Aker was buried today, Tuesday, February 24th, 1997, with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Lisa, his sons, Mike and Tim, his stepson, Jared, and his grandson, Mitchell. He leaves behind a legacy of which his family can be very proud.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Senate Resolution which recognizes the 25th anniversary of the return of 591 American POWs from communist Vietnam in February and March, 1973, and reaffirms our national commitment to seek answers about missing Americans from the Vietnam War. 
I have been privileged through the years to come to know many of the Americans POWs held for so many years by the Communist side and finally released in 1973. This includes heroes in the Congress like Representative Sam Johnson of Texas, and Senator John McCain of Arizona, and other heroes like Admiral James Stockdale, Ambassador Pete Peterson, Red McDaniel, Orson Swindle, Ted Guy, Giles Norrington, and Mike Benge, to name a few. 
Today marks the 25th anniversary of the return of the first group of American POWs from Hanoi during what was known as Operation Homecoming. This first group included Congressman Sam Johnson, someone who I have been honored to work closely with through the years to obtain answers about those still missing from the war. Several other groups of POWs were released later in February, 1973, and throughout March, 1973, with the last American acknowledged by Hanoi to be a POW being returned on April 1st. 
A few years ago, one of these returned POWs I mentioned earlier, Captain McDaniel, wrote a book about his experience as a POW entitled `Scars and Stripes.' 
I want to quote just a small passage from that book which describes the feelings of the POWs as they were being led from their prisons to the airport in Hanoi for repatriation. 
`I saw a familiar C-141 aircraft waiting for us on the field. At that moment, something broke inside me and the tears came easily. Somehow I had managed to restrict my tears to those rare times, in the nights under my mosquito net, when Hanoi Radio had gotten to me and I was down. But here, seeing that airplane waiting, I just let go, because I suddenly realized that my country had not let me down. And that great Scripture came to me, the Lord's words: I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.  
Even as God had stayed at my side through all that time and taught me the things that were to change my life completely about His reality and His presence in suffering, somehow that American plane socked home some of the things that made America and God great. 
Then I was on that airplane, and pandemonium broke lose. As those wheels lifted off, the cheers shook the plane. And when the plane crossed over water on the way south, we all shouted, `Feet wet!'--we were no longer over North Vietnam. Those mouths opened in a wild cheer--some with teeth missing, some with faces showing physical and emotional scars, some who cried while they cheered. No matter what anyone would say in the future about Vietnam, somehow we had won a little piece of something that no man would take away from us. 
Mr. President, what true patriots these men were. How fitting that we honor them today with this Senate resolution commemorating the 25th anniversary of their release. 
With this resolution, we also call attention to the important last mission of the war which is still unresolved--the mission to obtain the fullest possible accounting for those whose whereabouts and fate are still unknown. Our thoughts go out to the families of those missing men, and we reaffirm our national commitment to learning the truth so we can remove the uncertainty these families face. 
I have been personally involved with searching for answers on the POW/MIA issue, as my colleagues know, for several years now. I want to take this opportunity today to again call on the Governments in Southeast Asia, North Korea, China, Russia, and the former Eastern bloc to do more to open up their archives and make key witnesses available so we may advance the accounting effort. There is much work still to do, and I appreciate that this resolution before us today recognizes that fact. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Kathleen Jones and Moira Delahanty who have achieved national recognition for recieving the Prudential Spirit of Community Award. I commend their youthful spirit and aggressive drive to improve the quality of life in New Hampshire through community service. 
The award, presented by The Prudential Insurance Company of America in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals, recognizes young people who have shown a great deal of commitment and dedication to improving their community. As New Hampshire's honorees, Kathleen and Moira will receive $1,000, a silver medallion and a trip in May to Washington, D.C., where they will join other honorees for four days of national events. 
According to Kathleen, she wanted to make a difference in her community and spend time helping others. As a result, she launched an environmental group called Earth Service Corps. Today, the group has nearly 70 members who help build and maintain hiking trails, initiate and conduct recycling programs, and plant trees throughout the state. Kathleen not only was the founder, but she also plans group meetings, serves as a liaison with community groups, and handles all administrative work for the Corps. 
Moira volunteers as an aide to a swimming instructor with the local chapter of the American Red Cross. She helps younger kids overcome their fears of water and then teaches them to swim. She completed a special training session and volunteered for one month over the course of two summers. Her love for teaching and her passion to help others overcome individual fears is a great attribute I admire dearly. 
I also would like to salute four other young people who were named Distinguished Finalists by The Prudential Spirit of Community Award and recieved the bronze medallion for their outstanding volunteer service. They are: Christopher Vachon, 14, Pinkerton Academy in Derry, created several multimedia presentations to promote driving safety among teenagers; Christopher Pappajohn, 16, Keene High School, raised $40,000 with a group of friends to build a skate park in his town; Joseph Allison, 13, Hudson Memorial Middle School, volunteers in his community for a variety of nearby organizations; and Justine Barrett, 14, West Running Brook Middle School in Derry, helped collect money for the needy through a Holiday Fund at her school. 
These extraordinary young people continue to keep alive the virtue of community service and inspire others to do the same. Their personal initiatives, dedicated service and hard work have impacted the lives of many. In a time when Americans seem to be less involved in their communities, these young Americans continue to defend and keep the community flame shining brightly. Mr. President, I want to congratulate these individuals for their outstanding work and I am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the students of the Londonderry High School Lancers Marching Band for the distinguished honor of representing New Hampshire in the Washington, D.C., St. Patrick's Day Parade. All 201 band members and Andrew Soucy, the Band's director, deserve special commendation for their hard work and achievement. 
These band members have proven that determination, hardwork and dedication are the hallmarks of success both as musicians and students. Many of the songs they play symbolize American pride and forever keep patriotism alive through the language of music. `Londonderry Ear,' also known as `Oh Danny Boy,' is a hometown favorite that is also played in tribute to the Granite State and their home town. 
I am indeed honored to have the Londonderry High School Lancer Marching Band representing New Hampshire with their outstanding musical performances. I had the pleasure of meeting some of the band members, young men and women, who have recognized their own talents and continue to develop them into something great. I am proud to say, this continual drive for perfection and aggressive strive for greatness are commendable characteristics among Granite State students. 
These students not only attended school and practice, but they also had to raise money through several fundraisers to come to Washington, D.C. As a result, the band accomplished their goal by implementing a plan and having the right attitude and talent to meet their goal. 
The Londonderry High School Lancers Marching Band with their classic red, white, and blue uniforms have performed for audiences throughout the country. To name a few, they played at the Foxboro Stadium, home of the New England Patriots in Boston, Massachusetts, Nascar Winston Cup Series, and for Good Morning America, an ABC Television Network. 
I also want to recognize the Londonderry community, for giving so much support in helping these young adults. I am well aware of the pride the community has for this talented band. It is much easier to be successful when you have the support of others and the backing from friends and family.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from Missouri how much I appreciate his leadership, being out here hour after hour, many times alone, in opposition to this nomination. It is the right thing to do. I don't think it is a secret that probably we are going to lose this fight. But in the effort the Senator has distinguished himself in accenting what I think are the issues that need to be accented in this debate. 
The Senator pointed out a number of important other questions that have arisen, but I want to focus on one particular issue because, as the Senator said, I have written the legislation to ban partial-birth abortions here in the country. 
Regretfully, I must say, but for 3 votes in the U.S. Senate we would have a ban on partial-birth abortions--or, better put, perhaps if the President had not vetoed it, since we have 64 votes 
already in the Senate but we need 67, it would have come to pass. 
As I sat here for the last 15 or 20 minutes listening to my colleague, I couldn't help but think how frustrating it must have been, even for Lincoln in the time of the Civil War, basically having the courage to take on the issue of slavery. Ironically, it led to the destruction of one political party. The Whig Party went down and the Republican Party was formed in opposition to slavery. In those days, people refused to stand up on principle and lost a political party. I do not know if there is a lesson to be learned here, but it is certainly something to which we ought to give serious consideration. 
I know how the Senator feels because for many hours I stood here on the floor, in 1995, and took abuse from the national media. I still do take abuse from the national media, and many in the media in my own State, for pointing out what this procedure is and how horrible it is and how wrong it is. But we all know that there are many out there who fight hard to keep us from telling the truth on this issue. I want to get into that in a little more detail later, about just exactly what happened. But let me say on behalf of many, thank you for your leadership and stepping into the breech. 
As you know, there are many people who did not want us to make an issue of this; who wanted this nomination to slip by quietly so people wouldn't be `embarrassed' by having to vote on the Satcher nomination. But let me point out that the Surgeon General is America's family doctor. That is what he or she is supposed to be. When you go to see your family doctor you look for competence, certainly. You might want to take a look on the wall to see what his qualifications are, see where he studied. You certainly want to look for expertise. You want to look for somebody who works hard, who does a good job. 
You also want someone with moral authority. I know Dr. Satcher has a very distinguished record. But I ask whether or not, on an issue as important as this issue is, whether being passive is sufficient. Is it sufficient to say that you are not going to make an issue of partial-birth abortion if you are the Surgeon General, to say that you are not going to crusade for it, that you are just going to be passively for it? That is not good enough. That is not good enough. 
You want somebody who is grounded in common sense, who knows and understands the difference between right and wrong. Every day in the press today--we don't have to get into it. The American people know full well what I am talking about. But every day we are hearing suggestions that Americans no longer care. They do not care about right or wrong. They do not care about lying. They do not care about untruthfulness. They do not care about cheating. They do not care about setting a good example. We have to turn the television off now when our kids are in the room when we are talking about issues involving some of the leaders in our country. That is a pretty tragic commentary. 
Similarly, the family doctor, the Nation's family doctor, ought to be about saving lives, not taking lives. We are talking about taking lives here. Make no mistake about it. 
I was in a debate with a colleague on the floor of the Senate here a few years ago, in which this particular Senator said he had studied this issue very carefully and he realized that, until the third month, the fetus wasn't a person. I asked him if he could tell me what it was, then, for the first 3 months? There was not an answer. What is it for the first 3 months? We all know what it is. It's a life. It is a young child. And of course, in the context of partial-birth abortion, we are not talking about the first three months. What we are talking about in partial-birth abortion, as Senator Moynihan has said on the floor of this Senate, is infanticide of a later-term baby. It is executing a little child. That is what it is. 
We are hearing today that families of America should not care whether their family doctor--the doctor for America--knows the difference between right and wrong, that we should not care whether 
our family doctor believes that killing a little child as her body rests in your hands is wrong or right. You should not care about that. It does not matter, as long as he believes in the President, as long as he supports the President and doesn't say anything about it. It will be all right. 
Would we have ended slavery if we had taken that approach? Would we have ended generations and generations of racial prejudice and discrimination? We still have not ended these, but would we have made the inroads that we have made? I don't think so. I don't believe it and I don't believe that deep down in their souls the American people believe it either. 
That is why I am here today. 
I am not here today to cast any aspersions or make any commentary on Dr. Satcher's general character. He has had a very distinguished career. But he is wrong. He is wrong on this issue. And as long as I have a vote I intend to exercise that vote against this nomination. I know it is not going to be a vote that we are going to win--and that is unfortunate. 
Now I should probably know better than to expect this President to pick someone for Surgeon General who is going to be against abortion or even against partial-birth abortion. This President is for abortion. He is for partial-birth abortion. He has vetoed the legislation we sent him two or three times now. We do not have quite the number of votes to override him. We are only 3 short, though. 
When you hear people tell you that votes don't matter, or your vote doesn't matter, or one vote doesn't matter--I would ask you to reflect for a moment on this. This bill has been brought through the process two or three times, through the House, through the Senate, up to the President's desk and vetoed. We are but three votes away from stopping the execution of little children as they come from the womb. That is what we are talking about. That is what partial-birth abortion is. Three votes. If three people in the U.S. Senate changed their mind we could change that. 
If we had a family doctor who would be willing to use the bully pulpit to talk about this issue, we might be able to influence those three votes. You never know. But we are not going to influence them with a Surgeon General who says, `It's OK. It is all right. There is nothing wrong with it.' And that is why we are here. 
I am going to oppose this nomination, along with Senator Ashcroft and others, because it is morally wrong 
to kill little children as they exit their mothers' wombs. 
I would say, deep down in your heart--no matter where you are, who you are, how you feel about abortion in general--you probably agree with me. You can get into all these other debates about who is responsible, who has the right to do this, who has the right to choose and all that. But deep down in your heart, do you think that is right? Do you think it is right that the chief medical person, the family doctor of America, won't speak out against it? Do you think it is right that the President of the United States refuses to appoint someone who will speak out against it to this post? Do you think the President is right? 
Maybe some of these folks ought to witness some partial-birth abortions, like nurse Brenda Pratt Shafer did. Until shortly before I came to the floor in 1995 and discussed this issue, I didn't know what partial-birth abortion was. One of the people I discussed it with was nurse Brenda Pratt Shafer who considered herself `pro-choice' until she accepted a temporary assignment at a clinic where partial-birth abortions are performed. 
Of course, we've heard all kinds of things from the other side of this debate. They said we only do a few of them a year, maybe a few dozen. They said it is only done in the case of extreme deformities. I said it wasn't so and I was attacked on the floor of the Senate and attacked in the press. I still am being attacked in the press. 
Come to find out, it is several thousand a year. This news came from prominent people in the abortion industry, a few people like Ron Fitzsimmons, the head of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers who came out and told the truth. He said, `I lied through my teeth.' Now we know, and in spite of the fact that we know, we still are faced with a nominee for Surgeon General who won't oppose this brutal procedure. 
With all the problems we face in America today, all the terrible things, what is wrong with our country when we can't get enough people in the Senate to override the President's veto of a bill to stop the killing of children, as their bodies are literally in the hands of the abortionist? What is wrong with this country? What are we coming to? 
We shouldn't even have to be on the floor of the U.S. Senate talking about this. We shouldn't have to be here. The Constitution protects life, but we are not abiding by the Constitution. 
When I introduced the partial-birth abortion ban in the Senate in June of 1995--we prevailed with 54 votes ultimately. I believe that is correct, 54 votes. I think we started off with maybe 40, but then I began to describe the procedure, and I remember Senators coming down here saying how horrible it was that in front of the American people I would talk about this. Well, why not? Why shouldn't we talk about it? 
Do you know what a partial-birth abortion is? Let me tell you what it is. We are talking about a child anywhere from the fifth month to the ninth month. 
In the first step, guided by ultrasound, the abortionist grabs the baby's leg with the forceps. This is the first step. 
The baby's leg, in the second step, is pulled into the birth canal. 
Then in the third step, the abortionist, by taking hold of that little child's feet, pulls the child entirely through the birth canal with the exception of the head, restraining it from being completely born. 
The abortionist then uses scissors which he puts into the baby's skull. He then opens the scissors to enlarge the hole, and, the final step, the scissors are removed and a suction catheter is inserted. The child's brains are sucked out, causing the skull to collapse, and the dead baby is then removed. 
That is what partial-birth abortion is. Let's understand what it is. That is a process that our Nation's family doctor will not oppose, that our President, the President of the United States will not oppose. 
There are two very famous ships in American history. One of them was the Titanic that sailed from Great Britain in the early 1900s. The other was the Mayflower that sailed in the 1600s from England. 
On the Mayflower, there was a group of people who knew where they were going and who knew what they wanted to do when they got there. They had a turbulent voyage. People died during the voyage. They hit storms. It was a long, long ride, but they got here. They landed on the beaches and began to found a nation. They knew what they wanted to do, and they did it. 
The Titanic sailed from England three centuries later. They were happily and merrily enjoying themselves, drinking and dining. But the crew failed to navigate the obstacles and the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank. Figuratively speaking, the Roman Empire hit an iceberg and sank into history. 
I say to you today, with the greatest respect for the differences of opinion on this issue, that there are huge moral icebergs out there facing the U.S.S. America today, the ship of state. There are a lot of them. Abortion is one of them, and partial-birth abortion itself is a big one. If we can't speak up for the babies who are innocent victims of an abortionist's scissors, then we are going to run smack into that iceberg and we are going to sink. 
Sometimes, when we take the Senate floor to speak, we wonder how important our words are. Sometimes they are not important at all; sometimes they are very important. But at some point, you have to look back and you have to say to yourself, `Did I sit by and not do what was right or say what was right?' or `Did I speak up for what I believed in?' 
I don't want to serve in the U.S. Senate if I can't do that. I am perfectly happy to have history judge me. Not by contemporaries in the media. I could care less what they say or how often they say it. It is irrelevant. History will be my judge, and history will be the judge of this debate. History will be the judge of the debate on abortion, and history will be on the side of those who stood up for life. I am convinced of that. I know that. So I don't worry about it. 
I used to get upset, but today I am very calm about it. Inside I am not calm, because it is a sad, sad commentary on America. That iceberg looms out there, and it is big. With three more votes in the U.S. Senate, we could melt that iceberg and take it out of the way of the American ship of state. 
We could get those three votes if we had a Surgeon General and a President who had the courage to hold a two minute press conference to say: `This is wrong, this is wrong. You know, I've thought about this. I'm for abortion but this is infanticide' We could succeed if the President came to the same conclusion that Senator Pat Moynihan did and said, `This is wrong. I am going to stop it. You send me that bill again and I won't veto it. And I'll send you a Surgeon General who will speak out against this and let's try to stop this brutal procedure that takes innocent life in such a brutal way.' 
I can't get a hard-and-fast number for how many partial-birth abortions are performed. Nobody will really talk about it but it is estimated to be several thousand. You have to ask yourself, what those several thousand human beings would have done with their lives. Just as we must ask the same question about each of the more than one million human beings destroyed by abortion every year in this country. We will never know. Is there a President of the United States in that group? Is there a doctor who will find a cure for cancer or a preacher who will save some souls? We will never know. They never had a chance. This Nation, but for three votes, stands by and lets it happen, to several thousand of these children even as they leave the birth canal. 
And this Senate tomorrow will vote to make Surgeon General a man who won't speak out against it. 
When this debate began in 1995, some worked hard to hide the truth. But Ron Fitzsimmons had the courage to speak out and admit, 
`I lied through my teeth.' They denied there was such a thing as a partial-birth abortion. `It's a phrase that was coined by the pro-life lobby,' they said, `There's no such thing.' And when they had to admit that there was such a procedure, they lied about what happens to a baby who is a victim of the procedure. 
But the web of lies spun by those determined to defend the indefensible has finally unraveled, and the American people now know the truth. 
And how do our two great political parties face up to this truth? In one political party, there is not even an issue. That party doesn't make any comment on life. Abortion is fine in that political party. In my political party, we take a position in favor of life. But--and this is the part that sends me in orbit--we say `be pro-life but don't talk about it. It offends too many people. Just say, `I'm pro-life, what's your next question? Is there a question on Iraq or maybe a question on education? Could we talk about something else?' I have been hearing it for 13 years in politics. All the consultants say, `Don't talk about abortion.' 
Well, I did in my last election. They tried to make me pay the price for it. I barely won, but I won, and you know what: If I had lost, I would have lost because I believed in something, and I would have gone on with my life. 
I often wonder what would Lincoln have said about this, or what would Jefferson have said? It is really sad; it is really sad. 
In 1995, the abortion industry said that all of these procedures are performed in situations where the mother's well-being is imperiled. But then the American Medical Association endorsed a ban on partial-birth abortions. And both Houses of Congress passed such a ban. And now only Bill Clinton and his veto pen prevent us from stopping this procedure. 
So as we consider Dr. Satcher's fitness to fill an office that provides a bully pulpit on matters of health, I believe that it is appropriate to inquire about his views on the subject. 
This has been quoted before here on the floor, but let me repeat it. Here is what Dr. Satcher said about partial-birth abortion:  
I support the President's position. The President opposes late-term abortions except where necessary to protect the life and health of the mother. 
The partial-birth abortion ban bills passed by Congress protect the life of the mother. But the President's insistence on a `health' exception is really a demand for language so broad that courts will interpret it to mean partial-birth abortion-on-demand. For that reason, we must ask: Does politics or science guide Dr. Satcher's abortion views? The Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, a nationwide coalition of hundreds of doctors formed to refute misinformation about partial-birth abortion, has asked why Dr. Satcher is so far out of the mainstream on partial-birth abortion. Physicians' Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth--citing the opinions of doctors holding a variety of views on the broader issue of abortion, including the American Medical Association--have concluded there is no medical reason for using this barbaric partial-birth abortion procedure. They express concern that Dr. Satcher `may be relying on politics rather than medicine in reaching his conclusions about abortion.' 
The `life-and-health' position is a political position. Worse, is politics that will cost the lives of innocent unborn children. 
It is amazing really to look at the intensity of the attacks on those of us who stand up here and speak out on this issue. They are venomous, they are vicious, but it's worth it. 
Someday I will look back. If any of my grandchildren ask me where I was when this issue was being debated, I can tell them in good conscience where I was. I am proud to be here today on the Senate floor defending unborn children in the context of this nomination. I am proud to be here. I wish I did not have to be here because we should not have to stand here on the floor of the Senate to do this because it is a right that these children have under the Constitution, one outrageous Supreme Court decision notwithstanding. 
Mr. President, I will oppose President Clinton's choice of Dr. Satcher for the position of Surgeon General. I will make that vote proudly. It is the least we can do when, as a result of the President's position--the position upheld by the nominee under consideration today--thousands of innocent lives will be brutally extinguished. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate William T. Frain Jr., a distinguished individual, for being named Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce Citizen of the Year for 1997. I commend his consistent drive and aggressive encouragement to improve the quality of life for his fellow citizens. 
William has held many officer roles as well as been a member of many organizations. To name a few, he has been involved in the Board of Directors of the Greater Manchester Chamber of Commerce, New Hampshire Business Committee for the Arts, and New Hampshire Better Business Bureau. He also devotes a great deal of time to civic and charitable endeavors including the Eastern Seal Society, Junior Achievement, The Humanities Council and Bishop of Manchester's Summer Reception Fund Committee. These are just a few organizations with which he has spent countless hours and dedicated service. This impressive list goes on and he should be very proud of these contributions. 
William has enthusiastically worked with more than twenty organizations, countless residents and employees, and developed a considerable portfolio of citizenship. Four words come to mind that best represent what William is trying to strengthen: community, teamwork, partnership, and development. These are terms that bind all Americans together and strengthen the unity of this great country. 
These words best exhibit the tools he employs to bring about positive change and as a leader, encouraging others to rise to the calling of citizenship. Yet, William is not just a great citizen, but a defender of companionship and a visionary of better communities. 
William's commitment to each organization he represents is extremely solid and substantial. He gives it his all and inspires others to follow his lead. His actions and beliefs have become a catalyst for significant change resulting in profound achievements. Mr. President, I want to congratulate William for his outstanding work and I am proud to represent him in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Hatch and Cleland and others, as an original co-sponsor of S.J. Res. 40, the proposed constitutional amendment to protect our Nation's flag. 
The act of flag burning--or any other kind of flag desecration--is an aggressive, provocative act. It is also an act of violence against the symbol of America--our flag. Even more disturbing, it is an act of violence against our country's values and principles. The Constitution guarantees freedom, but it also seeks to assure, in the words of the Preamble, `domestic Tranquility.' 
Many Americans have given their lives to protect freedom and democracy as symbolized by the flag. In my own family, my father died in a service-related accident during World War II. Our family was presented with his burial flag. That flag means a great deal to our family--and we believe that the flag deserves protection under the law. 
Some people believe that outlawing desecration of the flag--which this Constitutional Amendment would authorize the Congress to do--would lead to the destruction of `freedom.' I disagree. Our Constitution was carefully crafted to protect our freedom, but also to promote responsibility. We are stepping on dangerous ground when we allow reckless behavior such as flag burning or other forms of physical desecration of the flag. 
The Constitution that our Nation's Founders fashioned has survived the tests of time, but it has also been amended on 27 occasions. Under our Constitution, the Supreme Court does not have more power than the people. The people do not have to accept every Supreme Court decision--because ultimate authority rests in the Constitution, which the people have the power to amend. 
The idea of amending the Constitution is serious business. We have found, however, that a simple statute is not enough. We tried that, and the Court struck it down. We must stand for something or we stand for nothing. I stand for a constitutional amendment authorizing Congress to ban flag desecration and I am confident that we will succeed in passing it in this Congress and submitting it to the States for ratification.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Ben Kendig Jr., a distinguished individual, for being named the 1997 Hospital Auxiliary/Volunteer of the year. I commend his compassion for others in volunteering countless hours for the service of his fellow citizens. 
Ben bravely served his country as a fighter pilot in World War II. After the war, he attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology and received his degree in aeronautical engineering. Ben then used his skills working at United Aircraft. After that, he then decided to settle down in Nashua, New Hampshire, and opened up his own engineering firm. 
After 15 years of running his own business, he decided to retire. However, at the age of 71, he still had plenty of energy and drive so he decided to put it to good use. According to Ben, he wanted to spend his time helping others, an attribute that I admire greatly. 
As a result, he joined the Southern New Hampshire Regional Medical Center Messenger Service. Ben initially wanted an easy position with little responsibility, however, it developed into something much greater. 
As time went on, Ben accepted more responsibility and assumed leadership roles within the Messenger Service. His dedication to service and supportive energy exceeded the normal expectations of any volunteer. Naturally, people turned to him in times of need. Unfortunately, the president and the director of auxiliary was diagnosed with cancer. Like many times before, Ben picked up the reins of leadership and was appointed the president of the Messenger Service. 
This arduous job involved overseeing over 200 volunteers, a position that certainly would test any man. Close to 30,000 hours of time had to be delegated throughout the hospital. Ben also had a budget of $100,000 the organization had to distribute to improve certain areas of the hospital like the maternity ward. 
Ben gave not just to the hospital, but to each and every individual with whom he worked. He inspired others by his own actions and caring attitude. Ben exceeded the expectations and surpassed the ordinary responsibilities of a volunteer. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Ben for his outstanding work and I am proud to represent him in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Vicki Donovan for being named New Hampshire's 1998 Teacher of the Year. Vicki is a fourth-grade teacher at Belmont Elementary School, where she has taught for eleven years. I commend her outstanding accomplishment and well-deserved honor. 
Vicki, who lives in Belmont, will spend the next year representing New Hampshire's teachers at various statewide and regional functions. As New Hampshire's Teacher of the Year, she will be considered for the National Teacher of the Year Award sponsored by the Council of Chief State School Officers and Scholastic, Inc. The National Teacher of the Year Program is the oldest and most prestigious honors program to focus public attention on excellence in teaching. New Hampshire's Commissioner of Education, Elizabeth Twomey, named Vicki the Teacher of the Year. 
Vicki's accomplishments as a teacher are numerous. She organized Belmont Elementary School's yearbook in her first year there, and has taught at several grade levels in the elementary school. She is involved with the Belmont Elementary School Support Group, B.E.S.T., and has served on the town's Civic Profile Committee, Government Study Group, and Youth and Education Committee. 
In addition to her numerous extracurricular accomplishments, Vicki has excelled in perhaps the most important area: her students. Vicki's students say their experience with her as their teacher marked their best year in school. 
New Hampshire has always been fortunate to have many talented teachers, but Vicki Donovan is certainly a role model among teachers of the Granite State. As a former teacher myself, I am proud of her commitment to education and congratulate her on this distinguished achievement.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Paul Holloway, a distinguished individual and good friend, on being selected to become the President of the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA). As a friend of Paul's for over a decade, I commend his outstanding achievement and compliment him on this well-deserved honor. 
Paul will be the first New Hampshire automobile dealer to serve as President of NADA. This is a great honor not only for Paul, but for the Granite State. It is Paul's strong work ethic and Yankee ingenuity that have catapulted he and his wife, Anna Grace, from the first Buick-Pontiac dealership they bought in 1967 to the five dealerships they have today. 
Paul's strong drive and spirit was exhibited forty years ago when Paul passed up a career in professional football to finish his bachelor of science degree in business at Temple University in Philadelphia. Paul was drafted as a linebacker by several teams, but instead decided to pursue his career in the automobile industry. New Hampshire is fortunate that he made the choice he did. 
I am certain Anna Grace, along with their children Scott and Debra, are as proud of Paul's achievements as are his friends and colleagues in New Hampshire. Paul's commitment and dedication to excellence will benefit the members of NADA as much as it has the people of New England. Paul Holloway will be a vibrant and effective leader for NADA. 
Congratulations, Paul, on this outstanding recognition by your colleagues in the industry. I know you will meet this new challenge with honor and distinction. I am proud to represent you in the U.S. Senate and proud to call you a friend.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. New Hampshire's media corps will suffer a great loss in January 1998 when Donn Tibbetts steps down after 25 years as The Union Leader newspaper's Concord, New Hampshire Bureau Chief. Donn is a New Hampshire institution, and will be missed by all of us who call him our friend. 
Donn's career in journalism has spanned nearly 50 years--first as a broadcaster and then, since April 3, 1972, as a reporter and columnist for the Loeb newspapers. He has covered the often-colorful politics of the Granite State, writing the well-known `Under the State House Dome' column. As Dean of the State House press corps, he has been a leader in chronicling presidential primaries, state elections, nine governors, and the State Legislature--the largest in the nation. He has traveled to national conventions for the Democrat and Republican parties, interviewed presidents, and even sat down to talk with me on many occasions! My interviews with Donn always left us sharing a laugh--and the resulting stories were always fair, thorough, and forthright, as is always Donn's style. 
Donn's knowledge and expertise about New Hampshire politics is second to none. He is the author of `The Closest U.S. Senate Race in History,' a book about the hotly contested, historic election for New Hampshire's U.S. Senate seat in 1974 between John Durkin and Louis Wyman--an election that was won by one vote, with a subsequent second election being held the following year. 
Donn's accomplishments--from sports disk jockey to television host to political columnist--have brought him many accolades from distinguished individuals across the country. The late William Loeb, frank publisher of the Union Leader, said Donn is `a man of great integrity.' Former New Hampshire Governor John Sununu said of Donn: `Nobody is fairer and nobody is more of a credit to their profession than Donn. . .' 
Donn is originally from Manchester, and then went on to attend Lasalle Military Academy in Long Island, and the University of New Hampshire. He served 28 years in the military and the reserves with the same honor and distinction he has brought to his career as a journalist. He has been a community and civic leader, as well as a dedicated husband, father and grandfather. 
Retirement is a time of reflection, and I know that Donn will spend his retirement years enjoying the memories of his rich and fulfilling career. I have been told that he is leaving for Corpus Christi, Texas the day after he retires, to spend time traveling with his wife, Janie, and visiting his seven grandchildren and twin great-granddaughters. 
Donn, I wish you all the best for a wonderful retirement. You are a man of character, commitment and dignity. We will all miss you.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the conference report on the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill. I want to specifically commend the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, for his outstanding leadership in formulating this legislation. I also want to thank the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, for his profound contributions to this legislation. 
Mr. President, although this has been a long and difficult conference, the product of these labors is an excellent defense bill. This legislation will provide for necessary modernization of our Armed Forces, and significantly improve the quality of life for our service members and their families. 
Importantly, this bill addresses in a very fair and appropriate manner, a variety of issues upon which the administration expressed strong concerns. Many of these issues had been represented as possibly triggering a veto. These include Bosnia, the B-2 bomber program, and the depot maintenance provisions. 
But the conferees dealt in good faith on these issues, and have offered honest compromises that address the administration's concerns. In particular, the depot maintenance provisions have been modified to accommodate the strongly held concerns of the administration and the Senators from Texas and California. 
The resulting language is, in my view, balanced, fair, and consistent with our national security interests. 
However, in listening to yesterday's floor statements by the Senators from Texas and California, I could not help but think that they were looking at some other bill, because the characterizations made about the depot provisions in the conference report were grossly inaccurate. 
Mr. President, let me make clear that I am an advocate for competition. Whether it be private sector competition among defense firms, or competition between public sector and private sector facilities, I believe that fair and honest competition makes sense for the American taxpayers and should be pursued wherever practical and consistent with our national security requirements. 
The conference report includes a compromise on depot maintenance that would require the conduct of fair and open competitions at the Kelly and McClellan air logistics centers. The compromise would specifically define `depot maintenance' to include contractor logistics support and interim contractor support. It also requires that the Defense Department maintain the capability in public depots to perform maintenance work on certain mission essential weapons systems that the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs deem necessary as part of our national military strategy. 
Mr. President, the language is very clear and the intent is even more clear. The conferees support free and open competition for depot maintenance work. With all due respect to the Senators from Texas and California, who suggest otherwise, their assessment of this language is simply not accurate. 
The truth is, many Senators, including my friend from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, have very strong concerns on this issue. I want to commend Senator Inhofe for his willingness to compromise so much on this issue. He has been very statesmanlike throughout these negotiations, and anyone who looks at this objectively will come to the conclusion that he has acted 
in good faith and has gone the extra mile to facilitate a resolution on this issue. 
Mr. President, as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, I was deeply troubled by some of the assertions made by the Senators from Texas and California during yesterday's debate. In particular, I was troubled by the statement by one member to the effect that `we do not even need a Defense authorization bill since we have already passed the Defense appropriations bill.' With all due respect, this statement is flat out wrong. 
The truth is, we need this bill to authorize pay raises and bonuses, military end strengths, and military construction and family housing. If there is no fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization: 
Higher end strengths will remain in effect without funding to sustain them; 
There will be no reform of basic allowances for subsistence and quarters; 
All bonuses will continue at present levels, which prevents authorized increases to aviation and nuclear officer bonuses; 
The Navy will lose the ability to have the CNO's choice for Chief of Chaplains; 
Construction of 385 military construction and 45 family housing projects will not be initiated; 
There will be no authority to continue the Challenge Program; 
There will be no authority to expand the counternarcotics Riverine Program in Peru and Colombia; 
There will be no authority to increase counternarcotics support to Mexico; 
There will be no authority for the Department of Navy to reprogram funding for the advanced procurement and construction of components for the next nuclear aircraft carrier; and 
There will be no authority to accelerate the NATO JSTARS Program. 
Mr. President, as you can see, the authorization bill is urgently needed for a variety of compelling reasons. While I respect the views of my friends from Texas and California, I must honestly say that I do not believe they are being reasonable. The conferees conceded to approximately 80 percent of the requests made by advocates of Kelly and McClellan. The House Depot Caucus and the Senators from Oklahoma, Georgia, and Utah have negotiated in good faith. The result is a very reasonable compromise. 
Mr. President, in an honest negotiation, no one gets everything. Both sides must give and take. In this case, it is very clear that the Oklahoma, Utah, and Georgia delegations have given a great deal. In fact, I would say they have gone above and beyond the call of duty to facilitate a fair resolution on this issue. 
Accordingly, I would call upon my colleagues to reject any further attempts to stall this legislation or to prevent its enactment. The Armed Services Committee has worked diligently, in a bipartisan fashion, to formulate a very responsible and constructive defense bill. We owe it to our men and women in uniform, and particularly those deployed in harms way throughout the world, to pass this legislation promptly. 
I urge my colleagues to support the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization conference report.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President I rise today to honor the town of Hampton Falls, NH, for celebrating its 275th anniversary on November 22, 1997. The town is planning an evening of celebration, commemoration, and entertainment on this most important date. There will be a dinner party, a musical presentation by the Winnacunnet High School Chamber Singers, and a historical slide show dedicated to 275 years of history and heritage. This special night is certain to include full participation from the town's proud people. 
Originally, Hampton Falls was part of the town of Hampton. However, due to its seacoast location, high tides often prevented those living in the area from attending the church. In 1709 the General Assembly of Portsmouth acted on this problem and gave the residents permission to maintain a separate church. Nine years later Hampton Falls became a separate parish. That same year the first town meeting was held in which selectmen and a town clerk were elected. 
Hampton Falls, however, still remained a part of Hampton. The townspeople successfully petitioned for independence from their parent church after the death of the minister from that town. On November 22, 1722, the town was incorporated as an independent jurisdiction. 
Hampton Falls can be categorized as the quintessential New England town through its history and scenery. During the eighteenth century the local economy was dominated by mills; sawmills, gristmills, and cotton mills dotted the landscape and provided for a major source of employment. Also, the town served as an important post town where horse changes were frequently made. At times, up to 125 horses could be found stabled within this small vicinity. One of the most significant stables in the area was the Wells Inn, which could accommodate 40 horses. Today, the stage house is known as the Wellswood Inn, and provides fine food and atmosphere to patrons. On December 13, 1774 Paul Revere passed through Hampton Falls on his legendary ride from Boston to Portsmouth proclaiming the arrival of the British. Few towns can claim a more American existence. Hampton Falls, with its simple white churches and colonial buildings, provides for a prime example of American history and culture. 
Today, Hampton Falls is a thriving southern New Hampshire community of approximately 1,700 people. The town is unmistakably New England. Winding country roads bring one past many sprawling farms and picture-perfect farmhouses. Presently, the town's central industry is agriculture. A major area business is Applecrest Farms, one of the last working orchards on the seacoast. Applecrest celebrates the harvest season with pick-your-own apples, a country farmers market, and entertainment. Harvest season is a festive time in Hampton Falls, and it seems fitting that the town's anniversary would be during this period. 
I congratulate the residents of this beautiful town on 275 years of distinguished history, and wish to extend my very best wishes of continued prosperity. Happy birthday, Hampton Falls.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate two outstanding youths, Meagan Corlin and Alia Szopa, who are the 1997 honorees from New Hampshire for the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards. These awards, sponsored by the Prudential Insurance Co. of America in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals, honor outstanding, self-initiated community service by young people in middle and high school grades. 
The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, the country's largest youth recognition program based solely on community service, were created in 1995 following a nationwide survey of high school students. The survey indicated that while 95 percent of teenagers believe community volunteer work is important, a large proportion don't know how to get involved and lack role models that could inspire them to seek out volunteer opportunities. As a former high school teacher, I am well aware of the importance of empowering students with volunteer opportunities. 
Meagan and Alia have both created innovative community service programs to serve various needs in their respective communities. 
Meagan Corlin, from Strafford School in Center Strafford, NH, created a reading program called Story-time on the Road to share her love of books with others. She uses her title as Miss New Hampshire Pre-Teen to promote her program to day care centers, libraries, elderly housing facilities, and homeless shelters. Each week, she and several of her schoolmates travel to these various locations in order to read stories to children or to the elderly. 
Alia Szopa, from Central High School in Manchester, NH, created a dance program called Legato for pre-teen girls with developmental disabilities. Her program works in conjunction with the Moore Center, an agency serving the disabled, to provide training for dance instructors who will teach the children at the center. One hour each week, from November to June, Szopa and five other instructors teach basic dance to five students. 
School honorees are judged by State selection committees, which name the top middle-level and high school volunteer in each State. These State-level honorees receive a silver medallion, $1,000 and a trip to Washington, DC with a parent or guardian, for several days of national recognition events in May. Also, in May, America's top 10 youth volunteers for 1998 are chosen from the State-level honorees by a blue-ribbon national selection panel. These 10 national honorees will be announced at a special ceremony at the National Press Club in Washington, where they each will receive an additional $5,000, a gold medallion and a crystal trophy for his or her school. 
Meagan and Alia have made significant contributions to their communities and to the State of New Hampshire. Not only have they served their community selflessly, but they have also served as inspirational role models to other students. Volunteerism strengthens community life as well as enhances the lives of people. I applaud Meagan and Alia's dedication and innovation in creating programs to serve the needs of citizens in their community. Without these young leaders, our country would be lost. It takes a special person to make a difference in someone's life. Meagan and Alia are indeed special and treasures to their school, the State of New Hampshire and to our country.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of Sgt. William Roy Pearson, USAF. Earlier today, his remains were returned to his native town of Webster, New Hampshire where he will finally be properly laid to rest with full military honors this weekend, more than 25 years following his tragic loss in Vietnam. 
Sergeant Pearson was the all American boy who grew up in a small, New Hampshire town, played varsity baseball and soccer all four years at Merrimack Valley High School, and then, like his father before him, went off to serve his country in time of war. As an Air Force Pararescue `Maroon Beret', he was awarded a Silver Star, Purple Heart, two Distinguished Flying Crosses, and five air medals for his actions. To Sergeant Pearson, living up to the USAF Pararescuemen motto--`that others may live'--was a daily routine in the jungles of Vietnam. 
Then came the tragic day on April 6, 1972 when once again his unit was called upon to rescue a downed U.S. Air Force pilot whose rescue story was later depicted in the movie, BAT-21. During the rescue attempt conducted by Sergeant Pearson and his crewmembers, the Jolly Green was shot down by enemy fire, killing those on board. Sergeant Pearson was only 20 years old. 
But it was not until two decades later that U.S. personnel were finally permitted by Vietnam to fully investigate and excavate what remained of the crash site. Despite the passage of time, the recovery team was able to identify and repatriate the remains of Sergeant Pearson, and we are grateful to our military for their efforts in this regard. 
Sergeant Pearson was a hero, not only for his commitment to freedom and the sacrifices he made by serving in Vietnam, but also for his courage in trying to save a comrade, who, I might add, was eventually rescued six days later. His heroic deeds were exemplary of the New Hampshire spirit of duty, honor, and valor, and his story will be an inspiring and moving one in the history of United States Air Force Pararescue for all generations that follow in his footsteps. 
As a fellow Vietnam veteran and a long-time advocate for the families of our POWs and MIAs who have suffered uncertainty for far too many years, my thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant Pearson's parents, siblings, family members, fellow comrades, and friends. I know they are all very proud of his service, as they now close this long, sad chapter in their lives. 
Finally, Mr. President, I also want to publicly thank the United States Air Force, including personnel at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts, and Sergeant Pearson's fellow Maroon Berets for the special care they have taken to honor their own, and to bid Sergeant Pearson a fitting farewell in a such a dignified manner. I know that the honors bestowed on Sergeant Pearson by the Air Force during this difficult weekend ahead will help to console those who have suffered the most from his loss. It has been a long wait, but we are grateful he has now returned home for this fitting final goodbye in New Hampshire.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President I rise today to honor Bob Hill of Bow, NH. Mr. Hill was recently named Citizen of the Year by the Greater Concord Chamber of Commerce. 
Each year the Greater Concord Chamber of Commerce selects a man or woman who has made significant contributions to the standard of living in the community of Concord and its surrounding towns. The chamber of commerce looks for an individual who displays a commitment to others, demonstrates leadership, concern and dedication. Bob Hill, the winner this year, was surprised he was recognized. However, Bob's modesty underestimates the honorable and admirable characteristics he has clearly shown. 
Bob was honored for his numerous contributions to community organizations. He serves on the boards of the YMCA, the Capitol Center for the Arts, and the Concord Boys and Young People Club. Bob has also raised funds for Camp Spaulding in New Hampshire, allowing low- and moderate-income families the opportunity to send their children to camp. This cause is especially dear to Bob's heart because he attended Camp Spaulding as a young boy and has first-hand knowledge of the benefits. Bob is also known to lend a helping hand in any area. He is not afraid to give his time and energies to a cause of which he has limited knowledge, but a great interest. For example, Bob was instrumental in taking the Capitol Center for the Arts from an idea and making it a reality. Friends and colleagues refer to him as a warm and straightforward man, known for passionately tackling tasks and one who adamantly believes in giving back to the community. 
As a testament to Bob's unselfish nature, in his acceptance speech he spent little time talking about his achievements, but rather recalled the achievements and memories of others. Bob commented that law enforcement officials do not receive the daily recognition they deserve. He asked the audience of over 300 for a moment of silence for these men and women. In addition, Bob recognized the other people in the community whose accomplishments are similar to his own and who raise the standard of life in the community. 
This type of commitment to one's community is extremely worthy of homage. Bob is an asset to his town as well as to the State of New Hampshire. I admire, appreciate, and commend Bob's devotion to his beliefs and to the people. He is an invaluable citizen who has set an example for others to follow. I commend Bob for his contributions, and I congratulate him for receiving the distinguished honor of Citizen of the Year.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Dean Kamen of Manchester, NH. Mr. Kamen was recently inducted into the renowned National Academy of Engineers for his invention and commercialization of biomedical devices and fluid measurement and control systems. 
Mr. Kamen is currently the president of DEKA Research and Development Corp. of Manchester, NH. He studied at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where he earned his degrees in physics and has also received an honorary doctorate of science degree from Worcester Polytechnic Institute as well as Daniel Webster College. Dean has more than 35 U.S. patents attributed to him which range from a volumetric pump with replaceable reservoir assembly to an integral intravenous fluid delivery device. 
Dean's innovations and significant contributions to the field of engineering have strengthened the economy of New Hampshire as well as the Nation. Dean is also recognized for using skills and influence to promote scientific inquiry at this critical time in America, a time when more young people are needed in the fields of science. Combining sports and scientific discovery, Dean established the FIRST robotics competition for young people. He is currently working on a science and technology museum project in Manchester, NH, which will be a valuable addition to the town, as well as the scientific community. 
Entrance into the National Academy of Engineers is an extremely prestigious honor. In fact, it is among the highest honors with which an engineer can be bestowed. Engineers are nominated and then elected to the academy by the current membership. Becoming a member is a validation of an engineer's great contributions to science by his peers, and many scientists work to achieve this honor throughout their lives. Dean is one of 85 engineers and 8 foreign associates who was inducted into the academy in early October. 
Dean's induction into the National Academy of Engineering is only one of the numerous honors he has received. He is a fellow with the American Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering, in addition to being appointed a senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
Renowed the world over in various science fields for inventions and advances in engineering, Dean has established a tradition of greatness with his work. In 1995 he was awarded the Hoover Medal for `innovation that has advanced medical care worldwide, and for innovative and imaginative leadership in awakening America to the excitement of technology and its surpassing importance in bettering the lot of mankind.' Dean has also received the International John W. Hyatt Service to Mankind Award for service to humankind through the use of plastics. 
I have known Dean for over a decade, and I am very proud of the important advances he has made in engineering. He has increased the quality of lives through his engineering feats not just in New Hampshire, but also the United States and the world. He represents the very best in science today: a man of great expertise, capability, and integrity. The Granite State is fortunate to have Dean working in our State. His innovations in engineering are priceless. Both Dean, as well as the other members of the National Academy of Engineering, are national treasures. I congratulate Dean Kamen on this distinguished honor; it could not have been bestowed on a more deserving individual.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Town of Rye, NH, for receiving the 1997 Walter B. Jones Memorial and National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration Excellence Awards for Coastal and Ocean Resource Management. The town of Rye received the awards for the category of excellence in local government, which recognizes local communities that show exemplary leadership, innovation and accomplishment in coastal resource protection and management. 
Due to the gradual cut-off from the daily tidal water around the town of Rye, a number of wildlife habitats and marsh lands have steadily decreased. By thier own initative, The town of Rye's Conservation Commission took immediate action and undertook an innovate project to restore a majority of its historic salt marsh areas. 
Since 1993, Rye has undertaken numerous salt marsh restoration projects and is well on its way to restoring the majority of its historic slat marsh areas. Rye has also worked cooperatively with U.S. Fish and Wildlife, splitting costs with the town to replace culverts and restore the tidal flow to approximately 18 acres of salt marsh. 
To date, the town of Rye has jointly funded four restoration projects affecting 240 acres of salt marsh. Utilizing such agencies as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife, the Environmental Protection Agency, the New Hampshire Estuaries Project, as well as private businesses, the town of Rye continues to improve and enhance the salt marsh areas. 
Mr. President, as a member of the Environmental Public Works Committee, I am very concerned with every aspect of our environment. The salt marshes in Rye, NH, are a very important part to the overall habitat of the area and I am very pleased to know many other citizens of the Granite State share my concerns for the environment. But more importantly, I commend the action taken by the town of Rye for making the necessary changes to improve the salt marshes. It is this type of initiative that exemplifies how local government and its citizens can better and more efficiently manage their environment than the Federal Government. The town of Rye has shown dedication and is a model as well as inspiration to other towns in New Hampshire and the country. Congratulations and appreciation are in order to the many people who have selfishly worked to save the historic salt marshes. No town is more deserving to receive the Excellence in Local Government Award than Rye, NH.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the motion to invoke cloture on S. 25, the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. 
Throughout my years in Congress, I have supported efforts to reform campaign finance laws. I have, for example, voted to eliminate political action committees and to prohibit the use of the congressional franking privilege for mass mailings. 
Along with Senators Gregg, Torricelli, and Johnson, I am cosponsoring in this Congress legislation to establish a bipartisan commission that would recommend campaign finance reforms. The Claremont Commission Act, which is named after the agreement reached between President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich at a meeting in my home State of New Hampshire, would establish a nine-member commission to examine campaign finance rules and propose comprehensive legislation for reform. 
The Claremont Commission would make recommendations based on good policy, not politics. The creation of such a commission finally would make good on the promise that President Clinton and Speaker Gingrich made when they shook hands in Claremont in May, 1995. 
Mr. President, the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill is seriously flawed. Indeed, I believe that it is unconstitutional because it unduly restricts the freedom of speech that is guaranteed by the first amendment to our Nation's Constitution. 
The bill's ban on soft money is a restriction on free speech. Even worse, in my view, the bill's severe limitations on so-called issue advocacy advertisements that mention a candidate's name, or show the candidate's likeness, within 60 days of an election, involve a direct regulation of the content of political speech. 
Out Nation's founders meant to allow free, open, and robust political speech and debate. The McCain-Feingold bill, however, moves to limit free speech and debate. I wholeheartedly agree with my distinguished colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, as well as the many constitutional scholars whose views he has cited, that the McCain-Feingold bill goes too far in regulating and restricting free speech and, therefore, is unconstitutional. 
I believe that any meaningful campaign finance reform proposal ought to require candidates to disclose completely to the American people what they spend on their campaigns and from whom they received campaign contributions. Full disclosure, not limitations on free speech, is the right kind of campaign finance reform.  
Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Gregg and myself, I submit an amendment. Mr. President, this is a very simple and straightforward amendment which has been drafted to address a very unique situation concerning State tax liability for persons performing services at the Portsmouth, New Hampshire Naval Shipyard. This shipyard is a Federal facility located on a group of small islands in the inner Portsmouth Harbor and Piscataqua River, which forms the border between the States of New Hampshire and Maine. 
The amendment we are offering will make pay and compensation of Portsmouth Naval Shipyard employees subject only to the State taxation laws of the State in which the employees reside. 
On July 28, 1997, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1953, a bill which likewise makes State taxing authority subject to an employee's State of residence with respect to three other Federal facilities located on State borders. 
Again, Mr. President, these are very unique situations where we have a serious issue of tax fairness of Federal employees at these particular Federal facilities on the border between States. It is appropriate for the Congress, in these instances, to use its power to clarify taxing authority especially where the States involved have been unable to work out an equitable tax reciprocity agreement on their own. Moreover, I would note that in this instance, there is disagreement between New Hampshire and Maine on whether the border location of the shipyard puts it geographically in New Hampshire or Maine. This is all the more reason for Congress to seek to help these Federal employees caught in the middle of a border dispute. 
As a Member of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, I look forward to working with Chairman Thompson and my other colleagues on the committee in the next few weeks to schedule action on both the House bill and the amendment Senator Gregg and I are offering to it today. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would note that when H.R. 1953 passed the House a few weeks back, some of my colleagues there noted that it took nearly 10 years to correct the tax inequity for the Federal employees at the three Federal facilities on State borders referenced in that bill. Let me say that I first took up the unfair tax situation faced by my New Hampshire constituents at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard nearly 10 years ago, and introduced legislation in the years that followed which, unfortunately, never came to pass. However, my colleagues have told me a congressional hearing might be the best way to make our case. That is why I look forward to Senate consideration of this amendment in committee. When the facts are carefully reviewed, I think my colleagues will realize that my constituents have waited too long already for resolution of the unfair tax burden they face by virtue of their employment at this particular Federal facility. My amendment with Senator Gregg to H.R. 1953 gives the Congress another opportunity to address this situation, so it is my hope we can now rectify this situation without further delay.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mayor Eileen Foley, a remarkable and dedicated leader from Portsmouth, NH. Mayor Foley, Portsmouth's favorite daughter, has announced her retirement from the office of mayor after serving 10 consecutive years. She has demonstrated tremendous leadership and guidance to a countless number of people. A special era of service and dedication has come to an end with Mayor Foley's retirement. 
Mayor Foley, 79, has served the city in the top seat at various times for a total of more than 16 years. Her long history of city service began as a teenager, when she and her sisters helped their mother, Mary Carey Foley, in her mayoral campaign. The elder Foley served as the city's first woman mayor between 1945-47. 
Eileen Foley continued the tradition by submersing herself in a career of dedicated public service, first in the Women's Army Corps in 1944 and later as State senator, Portsmouth City Counselor and School Board member. As mayor, she has served many terms, between 1968-72, again in 1984-85, and then again in 1988 until the present. 
Mayor Foley, in her long years of public service, became identified with the very city of Portsmouth in the minds of local constituents, as well as government officials and business people far and wide. She has always acted as a kind of concerned and caring mother and goodwill ambassador, speaking at clambakes and ribbon cuttings, lending her support to civic, cultural, veterans, and charitable organizations, and representing the city around the State and at such distant locations as Carrickfergus in Northern Ireland and Nichinon in Japan. 
Over the years, Mayor Foley has been honored by many, including being named as 1 of the 10 most powerful women in the State by a statewide business magazine, as well as being honored with a lifetime achievement award by the Portsmouth Rotary. 
Mayor Foley will continue to serve on appointed boards, be visible around town, and take an active interest in city affairs, for it is hard to leave the public eye after earning the respect and admiration of so many. 
Certain people are made to serve the public. Mayor Foley is such a person, epitomizing the term public servant. Her service to the town of Portsmouth, NH, its people and to the State of New Hampshire is nothing short of appreciative and commendable. Mr. President, as a public servant myself I understand the amount of time, heart, and dedication required each and every day. Mayor Foley has served the public, not out of force, but out of love and compassion for the people, demonstrating immense heart and dedication. Mayor Foley will be missed as her public legacy comes to an end.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Creative Optics, Inc. in Bedford, NH, for receiving the Small Business Innovation Research [SBIR] Model of Excellence Tibbetts Award. Creative Optics is a 15-year-old, innovative think tank that develops ideas and solutions to complex problems facing the Department of Defense community. 
Companies were selected based on the economic impact of their technological innovations and their overall business achievements. It is a competitive three-phase program that provides qualified small businesses with opportunities to propose innovative ideas to the Federal Government. These proposals are a response to solicitations published by the 10 Federal agencies on their upcoming research and development needs. There is a mutual benefit in that the Government secures the needed research, while the small business retains rights to commercialization. Creative Optics has made, and continues to make, a significant impact at the State and regional level. 
After relocating to southern New Hampshire in 1991, Creative Optics developed a myriad of relationships with local organizations and business resources. Creative Optics is sharing its hard experience with other small businesses in the region, on the State level as well as the national level. 
The president of Creative Optics, Dr. John F. Ebersole, and the owner Ingrid Ebersole, John's wife, have provided both technical vision along with an administrative personal touch to the company. Along with the Ebersole's vision and touch are the brilliant, creative minds of the individuals developing new, inventive ideas, allowing Creative Optics to shine. 
Creative Optics is a unique small business in New Hampshire, providing high-level employment opportunities, economic growth, and an innovated technology developed through SBIR funding. Small businesses are fruitful in research and development, producing more than half the Nation's product innovations. Furthermore, the Federal Government is achieving the highest quality research to meet specific mission needs, as well as expanding the Nation's industrial base. I commend Creative Optics for their outstanding innovations that benefit not only the State of New Hampshire but also the Nation as well. Creative Optics is a worthy candidate for receiving the prestigious Tibbetts Award.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memories of two brave New Hampshire State Troopers killed in the line of duty. Leslie Lord, 45, of Pittsburg and Scott E. Phillips, 32, of Colebrook both bravely gave their lives trying to protect others and stop a man wielding an automatic rifle throughout the town of Colebrook, New Hampshire on August 19th. Vickie Bunnell, a Colebrook District Court judge, and Dennis Joos, editor of the Sentinel newspaper, were also innocent victims in the shooting spree. 
Leslie Lord was a 1974 graduate of Pittsburg High School and the next year graduated in the 25th class at the New Hampshire Police Academy. Later, Lord became the chief of police in his hometown, until January 16, 1987, when he resigned to become a state highway enforcement officer. After working as a state highway truck inspector, Lord became a state trooper for the Granite state in 1996. 
Lord, who was not only a husband to Beverly, was also a father to two teenage boys, Cory and Shawn. 
Scott Phillips was a 1984 graduate of White Mountain Regional High School in Whitefield and also a veteran of the U.S. Army. He served with the military police, including a tour of duty in Panama. In 1990, as a member of the 90th class at the State Police Academy, Phillips graduated an impressive 14th in a class of 38. 
Phillips lived in Colebrook with his dear wife, Christine, their young son, Keenan, 2 1/2 , and their 1-year-old daughter, Clancy. 
Both Troopers Lord and Phillips were known as dedicated, hardworking, and well-liked individuals by members of their respective communities. 
Mr. President, the state of New Hampshire as well as the families of these fine state troopers have suffered a tremendous loss. I would like to commend the efforts of both men, for their actions were nothing short of heroic. I would also like to extend to the families of not only Lord and Phillips, but also of Vickie Bunnell and Dennis Joos, my deepest heartfelt sorrow and I pray that God watches over them. The memories of Leslie Lord and Scott E. Phillips will live on in all of the lives they have touched, for they were two remarkable and beloved individuals.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of Chad Warren, a young, thoughtful and motivated man who recently passed away. Chad was only 25 years old when he unfortunately lost his life, only months away from his 26th birthday. He is an example to us all because of his sheer dedication to his job and his unconditional love for his family. 
Working at the Goodhue Hawkins Navy Yard for the past six years, Chad became an invaluable employee and was also known as a friend to all. Hard working and dedicated are only mere words to epitomize Chad as a person. He started out as a boat washer and dockboy and soon progressed to a boat rigger and forklift operator He then achieved certification as a boat mechanic. Mr. President, I admire Chad not only for his dedication but also for the heart he put into his service at the Navy Yard. 
Prior to his employment, Chad was in Steve Durgan's Junior High Geography and U.S. History classes at Kingswood Regional Junior/Senior High School. Steve, a close personal friend of mine, described Chad as quiet, shy and thoughtful. 
At such a young age, Chad was surrounded by many close, loving people. Besides his mother, Linda Morrill of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and his father, Paul Warren of Ashburnham, Massachusetts, Chad leaves his dear wife Sherri Warren and their young beloved children Corbin, 5 years old, Shane, 8 years old, and Amber, 12 years old. Chad was blessed to have these valuable people in his life. 
Mr. President, to lose any life is a sad event. But to lose a young life, one full of energy, life, hopes and dreams is a tragedy. My heart and prayers go out to Chad's family and especially his wife, Sherri, and their children, Corbin, Shane, and Amber. The loss of a husband and father is irreplaceable but Chad's memory will always live on in those who loved him.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of a bright, young police officer wrongfully killed while on duty. Officer Jeremy Charron, 24, of Concord, New Hampshire, was gunned down while checking on a report of a suspicious car during the early morning hours of August 24th. 
Officer Charron embodied all that is honorable about our state's law enforcement professionals. His selfless devotion to protecting the lives of innocent New Hampshire citizens enabled him to perform the heroic acts for which he will always be remembered. It is not often that we see such strength, valor, and courage in a person. Jeremy Charron was unique and his family can be proud of his bravery in this tragedy. 
Jeremy Charron was an All-American kid, a high school athlete, a natural leader, president of his senior class at Hillsborough-Deering High School, a U.S. Marine and a police officer. 
Fulfilling his life long dream, Charron became a police officer for the town of Epsom, New Hampshire, in November, after completing the full-time police academy training and becoming certified as a full-time officer July 11. 
Charron also served in the U.S. Marine Corps from July 1992 to June 1996, when he received an honorable discharge. 
Born to Robert and Frances Charron, Jeremy leaves brothers Rob, 28, and Andrew, 27, and sisters, Amanda, 21, and Bethany, 12, and his finance, April LaRochelle. 
Mr. President, the family of Jeremy Charron has suffered a great loss. The people of New Hampshire again have lost another fine officer. It is a time for faith and a time for healing. My prayers and sympathy go out to the families and friends of Officer Charron.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Susan M. Woodward, the New Hampshire winner of the Sallie Mae First Class Teacher's Award, which recognizes the Nation's outstanding elementary and secondary school teachers in their first year of teaching. Susan was selected for her outstanding dedication to teaching and her love for her students in her first year at Mastricola Middle School in Merrimack, NH. 
Ms. Woodward received her bachelor of arts degree from Rivier College in Nashua, NH, in 1995. She graduated summa cum laude and was valedictorian of her class. Ms. Woodward joined the staff of the Merrimack School District as a substitute, and is currently employed as a full-time French teacher at Mastricola Middle School. 
Dedicated, creative, hard-working and inspirational are all words which describe Ms. Woodward. A perfectionist by nature, Susan uses a variety of instructional techniques, auditory and visual, so her students are always active participants in their learning. She makes her classes fun, employing a marvelous sense of humor, fairness and compassion. Ms. Woodward believes every student has potential, every student is special, and makes every effort to be available for her students. 
Active inside and outside the classroom, Ms. Woodward is a good role model for her students. Whether staying after school helping her students or dancing at a school dance, Ms. Woodward is always available for advice and support. 
The mark of a great teacher is one who cares, unconditionally, about the success and well-being of students. Mr. President, as a former teacher myself, I understand the challenges, responsibilities and dedication involved with teaching. I admire and respect Ms. Woodward for establishing herself as an irreplaceable teacher in the school district of Merrimack. Most importantly, she is helping to shape the lives of the young students who are the future of New Hampshire and the country. I am very honored to have Ms. Woodward as a teacher in the Granite State. The Sallie Mae Award has indeed gone to a first-class teacher.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, Friday, September 19, 1997, has been designated this year by President Clinton and numerous State Governors as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. This is a special day for paying tribute to our missing service members and civilians involved with our Nation's past military conflicts. It is a day for reaffirming throughout the United States our national commitment to obtaining the fullest possible accounting for America's POW's and MIA's. 
It has been an honor and privilege for me, since my election to the Congress in 1984, to assist the POW/MIA families, our veterans, and their friends and supporters, with the many efforts that have been undertaken to try to achieve a proper accounting for so many of our Nation's bravest heroes still listed as missing. It has been a difficult and emotional task, complicated by on and off-again cooperation by foreign governments. 
As many of my colleagues know, I served as vice-chairman of the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs in 1992, and I currently serve as the U.S. chairman of the Vietnam War Working Group of the Joint United States-Russian Commission on POW's and MIA's. This past summer, I, along with Congressman Sam Johnson of Texas, himself a returned POW from North Vietnam, traveled to Russia, Poland, and the Czech Republic in our continuing efforts to open archives and interview people knowledgeable about the fate of American POW's. We both feel, as a result of our trip, that we have enhanced our Government's ability to further investigate POW/MIA leads. I have also continued my own efforts here in the Senate to ensure that U.S. Government records on this issue are declassified and made available to the public. I am pleased to report that I am making additional progress in that regard, specifically with respect to information from the Nixon administration that I hope will shed more light on our own Government's knowledge about POW's and MIA's when the Vietnam war ended in 1973. 
As a result of my direct involvement with this issue, I can report that, even though we have made some progress over the years, there is still much work to do. It is, therefore, my hope that this administration will take the opportunity National POW/MIA Recognition Day provides to rededicate itself to using all appropriate resources available to the U.S. Government to resolve the POW/MIA issue. 
I personally believe that public awareness is critical to ensuring that the United States vigorously presses Communist governments abroad, especially North Korea, China, Vietnam, and Laos, to give us the complete answers that we deserve on this humanitarian issue. Indeed, the support of the public has enabled us to continue to push forward with legislative initiatives in Congress that can help to ensure the POW/MIA issue is pursued as a top priority with the governments I just referenced. 
I want to assure my own constituents and the many concerned Americans who have contacted me through the years that I remain absolutely committed to doing everything I think is appropriate to resolve the fate of our missing soldiers. 
Mr. President, I thank the American people for remembering our unaccounted for POW's and MIA's on this special day.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Peter Wolf Toth who has completed a project to present each State with a handmade wooden totem pole that incorporates local and historical figures from all across the Nation. I commend his outstanding gift to our Nation. 
Peter came to the United States through extraordinary circumstances. He escaped with his mother from the Soviet takeover in Russian-occupied Hungary. Traveling through Budapest, Yugoslavia, and Austria, Peter eventually settled in Akron, OH. His interests led him to educate himself in American history, specifically with a focus on native American lore, tribal cultures, and contributions to our lifestyle today. 
Peter recently completed a project where he carved out enormous totem poles by hand and presented one to each of the fifty States to show his gratitude to our country. 
His totem pole to New Hampshire was presented in 1984 and it stands in Opechee Park in Laconia, NH. The dedication ceremony that September drew a crowd of over 3,000 people. 
Peter's immigration into this country, as well as his hard work, should stand as an example for all Americans. It is no doubt that he is worthy of great recognition and praise for his devotion to the United States. 
Mr. President, I want to pay great homage to Peter Wolf Toth for his outstanding commitment to the United States. We are indebted to his amazing gifts and talents that he chose to share with all of us.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, earlier this week, the White House and the Congress reached a historic agreement that will balance the budget by 2002. Today, I rise in support of the portion of the deal that provides tax cuts to American families and small businesses: the Taxpayer Relief Act, H.R. 2014. After enduring sixteen years without any tax relief, Americans will finally benefit from tax cuts that will affect many aspects of their lives. Under our tax package, not only will taxpayers immediately see their tax bill go down, but saving for retirement, paying for college, and investing for the future will be much easier. I am encouraged and pleased that the Republican-led Taxpayer Relief Act provides $95 billion in tax cuts over five years and represents an improved standard of living for taxpayers at every stage of life. 
This tax relief comes at a time when the nation's tax burden is at an all time high. Partly due to President Clinton's tax hike back in 1993, today's taxpayers face a combined federal, state, and local tax burden of nearly 50% of their income--more than the cost of food, clothing, and shelter combined. In fact, for every eight hours of work, the average taxpayer spends about three hours just to pay the tax collector. And too many families could not survive without two incomes just to make ends meet. We cannot let this situation continue. By letting hard-working Americans keep more of their own money, we allow them to preserve their family, prepare for their own future, and invest in the nation's economy. 
The future of the family. I can no longer stand by while families in New Hampshire lose more and more time together because they have to work longer and harder to send their pay to Washington. The Taxpayer Relief Act addresses this growing problem in several different ways. First, taxpayers with young children will get a $500 tax credit for every child. In 1999, a middle-income family in New Hampshire with two young children will save $1,000 with this credit! Second, the tax relief measure reduces the capital gains rate for taxpayers who invest for their future. If the same New Hampshire family realizes $2,000 in capital gains to help pay for college or buy a home, they will save an additional $100. It would also be easier for this family to sell their home, as the tax package exempts $500,000 of capital gains on the sale of a principal residence. Equally important, this tax cut benefits their grandparents since many senior citizens depend on capital gains as a primary source of retirement income. Since 56% of taxpayers with gains have incomes of less than $50,000, and the percentage of families who own stock has increased from 32% in 1989 to over 41% today, many Americans will welcome this revision. 
Our plan also offers relief to parents who face higher expenses as their children grow older. Families can save for higher education by taking advantage of the plan's education accounts, penalty-free withdrawals for education, or popular tax-free prepaid state tuition plans. When the student reaches college, parents receive a HOPE tax credit for tuition and related expenses for four years of college. In the first two years, for example, parents can receive a tax credit up to $1,500 to help pay for their child's education. These provisions help parents in New Hampshire face the challenge of saving and paying for higher education in order to invest in a brighter future for their children. 
Preparing for the future. Our savings rate is one of the lowest of all industrialized nations partly because too many Americans find it difficult to save for retirement and pay high taxes. Under our Taxpayer Relief Act, individuals planning for retirement will benefit from expanded Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). Specifically, we created a new `back-loaded' IRA--contributions are not tax-deductible, but withdrawals upon retirement are tax-free if the account is held for at least five years. Once the IRA is established, penalty-free withdrawals are allowed for a first-time home purchase or for higher education expenses. In addition, thanks to the efforts of Senator Judd Gregg, the bill allows non-working spouses to contribute to an IRA whether or not the working spouse is already in an employer-sponsored retirement plan. As a result, a New Hampshire couple can make a yearly tax-deductible IRA contribution of $4,000, rather than just $2,000. After 35 years at a 7.5% rate of return, they will have saved a nice retirement nest egg totaling $617,000! 
Investing in the future. Fortunately, small businesses will finally get a well-deserved break under the Taxpayer Relief Act. Under the bill, the home office deduction is expanded to help people who work at home. In addition, the increase in the health insurance premium deduction for self-employed individuals is phased in more quickly, rising from 40% this year to 80% in 2006. And by 2007, the premium is fully deductible. Most important to many New Hampshire families I talk to, the estate tax changes also help small businesses. Now, parents who wish to pass on their small, family-owned business or farm to their children can do so knowing that the first $1.3 million will be excluded from the extremely high inheritance tax. 
Finally, the tax package addresses the need to encourage saving and investment by cutting the capital gains rate from 28% to 20% (and from 15% to 10% in the lower bracket) for sales after May 6, 1997. The current high rates discourage the risk taking and creativity necessary to achieve increased productivity and prosperity. A lower capital gains rate, however, will make it easier to free up capital to invest in research, technology and equipment; increase worker productivity; and ultimately create higher paying jobs. Without a doubt, this pro-growth initiative will enhance U.S. competitiveness. 
I wish I could report the same degree of satisfaction with the final version of the social spending component of this effort. When I voted for an earlier version of this portion of the package, I did so with the hope that the conference negotiations would result in its improvement. I regret that the social spending provisions produced as a result of negotiations with President Clinton failed to live up to that hope. 
The conference report on H.R. 2015 contained many valuable provisions. I am pleased that Medicare beneficiaries will have more choice about the type of health care delivery plan in which they will be enrolled, including--for 390,000 seniors--the option to open Medical Savings Accounts. I welcome the creation of a bipartisan commission to address Medicare's long-term problems. And I believe that the effort to reform Medicaid undertaken in H.R. 2015 is overdue. 
Unfortunately, however, H.R. 2015 fails sufficiently to move toward the fundamental, structural reforms in Medicare we all know will be required to ensure the retirement security of future generations. Furthermore, I had serious concerns about the fiscal and social damage we risk doing by retreating from welfare reform and by creating new entitlement, particularly a flawed child health entitlement which some--inside and outside of government--plan to use as the foundation of a government-run national health care system. Ultimately, these reservations dictated a vote against this portion of the legislation. 
I have been a strong advocate for a balanced budget, tax relief, and entitlement reform for the past thirteen years and I am elated that we have finally made it here. I support the tax cut portion of the Balanced Budget Act, which provides $95 billion in tax cuts for American families including a $500 per child tax credit, tuition tax credits, IRA expansion to include non-working spouses, a capital gains reduction to create jobs, and reductions in the inheritance tax. These initiatives are long overdue, and I am proud to be an early and vocal supporter of tax relief. However, I am concerned that the spending portion of the budget deal creates a new entitlement program, threatens to move us toward government-run health care, and significantly increases social spending which could negatively impact the Balanced Budget Agreement. 
Given that President Clinton submitted a budget earlier this year which would have added $200 billion to the deficit, the Republican-led Congress can take pride in this final agreement that implements the tax cuts fought for by our party for so long. The Tax Relief Act will help American families keep more of what they earn, save for their retirement, and promote job creation and economic growth. I support a balanced budget and look forward to voting to give New Hampshire families their first tax cut in sixteen years.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to comment briefly on yesterday's unanimous passage of S. 39, the International Dolphin Conservation Act after the Senate had adopted a compromise amendment. 
I joined with my colleagues in supporting this effort to bridge the gap between the two sides because I believe that it was the result of sincere movement by both sides, a true compromise. As originally written, S. 39 would have permitted tuna caught by chasing dolphins and encircling them in purse-seine nets to be labeled dolphin-safe. The compromise amendment adopted by the Senate yesterday preserves the existing dolphin-safe label until the Secretary of Commerce has the opportunity to review a study of the effects of encirclement on endangered dolphin populations. This means that the label change will take place no sooner than March 1997. 
I must admit that the need for such a study is not entirely clear to me. I think that any method of fishing for tuna that involves chasing schools of dolphins through miles of ocean and encircling them--in nets a mile wide and as deep as a football field is long--cannot honestly be described as safe for dolphins. I only hope that the studies that will be conducted will be anchored in common sense. If they are, I am confident that the label change will not take place. 
Unfortunately, common sense may take a back seat to pressures from foreign governments, the same pressures that gave rise to S. 39 in the first place. It's no secret that the countries that permit dolphin-deadly fishing would like to have access to the American tuna market--the world's largest--even if it means that our consumer standards have to be gutted in the process. I regret that too many in Congress and in the administration have failed to resist this pressure and defend our country's laws. 
In that connection, I would like to associate myself with the remarks of Senator Boxer, a valued colleague but one with whom I do not typically find myself in agreement. Before the Senate voted on this issue, Senator Boxer said: `American laws should be made by Americans * * * American laws should not be made by other countries.' Senator Boxer has it exactly right. This issue has aroused the passionate interest of humane groups others concerned with dolphin welfare, but it should also be of concern to anyone concerned about the integrity of our governing institutions and the preservation of the sovereign right of the American people to make their laws through those institutions. I trust that we will have the opportunity to revisit that question. 
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to say that Senator Boxer has done a tremendous job of standing up for what is right on this issue and I salute her efforts and those of the others who brought the sponsors of S. 39 to the table. Without Senator Boxer's steadfast efforts, this compromise and the opportunity to preserve the dolphin-safe label it provides would not have been possible.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. As the Senator knows, I filed an amendment yesterday that I hope will not be necessary. The issue concerns truck weight limitations on interstate highways and potential sanctions on the States of New Hampshire and Maine. 
Last year's appropriations legislation for the Department of Transportation included an amendment sponsored by Senators Cohen, Snowe, Gregg, and myself which established a moratorium on the Department of Transportation's authority to withhold highway funds from New Hampshire and Maine because of their allowance of heavier trucks on Interstate 95. That moratorium is set to expire on September 1, 1997. 
Under section 127 of our surface transportation law, States may not allow trucks over 80,000 pounds on the Interstate System without risking the loss of highway funds, even though many State roads allow 100,000-pound trucks, as is the case in New Hampshire and Maine. While I do not wish to get into a policy discussion on truck weights, there is a safety argument to be made in keeping these heavier trucks on the Interstate System, which is built to higher standards. That debate should be appropriately reserved for ISTEA reauthorization, currently under way in the Environment and Public Works Committee. It is there that we will debate any proposed changes to Federal truck weight limits. 
Nevertheless, we are faced with the expiration of the sanctions moratorium on September 1 and the fact that the Environment and Public Works Committee has not yet dealt with this issue in ISTEA. It is for these reasons that I now seek assurances from the Transportation Department that sanctions would not be imposed before ISTEA is reauthorized and fiscal year 1998 apportionments are released. 
Is it the Senator's understanding that the Department of Transportation would not have the authority to withhold highway funds from New Hampshire and Maine for the remainder of this fiscal year or until such time as the highway program is reauthorized and fiscal year 1998 funds are apportioned to the States? 
Mr. SHELBY: Yes, that is correct. There would not be an opportunity for sanctions under section 127 of our surface transportation law until fiscal year 1998 highway funds are apportioned, which would not occur until Congress reauthorizes the surface transportation programs.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Brownback's amendment to the Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. This amendment prohibits the awarding of grants from the Advanced Technology Program [ATP] within the Department of Commerce to corporations with sales greater than $2.5 billion. 
This amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas is a good amendment that should enjoy bipartisan support. After all, I hear my colleagues on both sides of the aisle talking year after campaign year about eliminating corporate welfare. Therefore, I assume a vote to limit grants to the wealthiest corporations in the Nation should be an easy one. Let's be clear about what firms we are talking about. The companies that have been awarded the largest grant amounts are IBM, General Motors, General Electric, Ford, and Sun Microsystems, among others. Do these sound like corporations in need of one, two or three million dollar grants? To me, these profitable firms sound like companies that could certainly find private sector funding. And this belief is not without basis. In fact, the General Accounting Office [GAO] surveyed 89 grant recipients and 34 near-winners that applied for ATP funding between 1990 and 1993. Of the near-winners, half continued their research and development projects despite a lack of ATP funding. Among those who received grants, 42 percent said they would have continued their R&D without the ATP money. 
The Federal Government should not be in the business of providing corporate subsidies. However, we should fund basic science projects that do not have short-term profit-making potential, and would otherwise not be funded by the private sector. The Senator's amendment is a step toward reversing this trend toward funding applied research that ultimately produces handsome profits for these companies. Under his reasonable proposal, the most profitable firms, companies that realize more than $2.5 billion in sales, would not be eligible for ATP subsidies. While I would prefer to see these corporate subsidies eliminated from our budget, I would be pleased to know that Federal funding is not going to enormously profitable corporations. 
Defenders of the ATP corporate welfare program argue that these grants allow research that otherwise would not go forward. How do we know, when many of the grant recipients did not even seek private sector money before coming to the Federal Government? In fact, GAO found that 63 percent of the ATP applicants surveyed had not sought private sector funding before applying for a grant. Other opponents of this amendment are the same Senators who oppose the efforts of the Republicans to ease the tax burden on Americans. At the same time these Members deny taxpayers the chance to keep some of their own money, they turn around and give the hard-earned tax dollar to billion dollar corporations. 
However, after hearing so many Senators speak out against corporate welfare, I am confident that this amendment will be approved by a wide margin. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Roland and Claire Jutras of Peterborough, NH, the National 1997 Parents of the Year. The National Parents' Day Foundation bestowed the honor on the Jutrases after searching the Nation for the parents of the year. 
Roland Jutras came to town in 1972 to run the town of Peterborough's Recreation Department. His 25 years of service to the town's children has earned him much praise and esteem from the community around. Roland met Claire playing at the co-ed evening volleyball league in 1972. They were later married in 1975. 
Roland and Claire are active members of their community. Roland received the Peterborough Rotary Club Paul Harris Award in 1989, Peterborough Citizen of the Year in 1987, and he was VFW Man of the Year in 1981. Roland also served on the ConVal District School Board for 2 years and he taught at St. Peter's Church. Claire is involved in many community activities as well. She has been a Brownie leader for 3 years, a St. Peter's religious education teacher for 4 years, preschool teacher, recreation volunteer, and a member of a local sorority organization. Claire is also a full-time special education aide at Peterborough Elementary School and is known for her warm smile and generous heart to all of those people she has touched. 
Roland and Claire have strengthened their family with pride, dedication, and love, always first. The Jutras' four daughters have earned as much community recognition as their parents. Christine and Michelle are seniors at Norwich University, Veronica will be a sophomore at Holy Cross in Worcester, MA, in the fall, while Natalie will be a junior at St. Anselem College in Manchester, NH. 
The National Parents' Day Foundation was founded in 1994 after President Bill Clinton signed into law the creation of National Parents Day on the fourth Sunday of July each year. Every year the foundation looks for parents who are intact married couples with children, people of good reputation, couples who mirror in their lives behavior the ideals we want to see replicated, and people with strong religiously based moral values. 
Roland and Claire will join 13 other U.S. couples who were finalists for the award this week in a reception here on Capitol Hill. Mr. President, on Wednesday evening, I look forward to meeting the Jutrases here in a reception to honor this wonderful Granite State couple. 
Roland and Claire represent the very best in parenting and embody the finest in sacrificial and caring love for children. New Hampshire is fortunate to be blessed by their leadership and dedication. I applaud Roland and Claire Jutras for their outstanding and caring spirit for their community and family. I am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate. Congratulations Roland and Claire.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Geofferey Ward, a Portsmouth High School senior, for attending the 50th annual American Legion Boys Nation. Geofferey was chosen to represent the Granite State at the national program. He was also one of several boys to attend American Legion Boys State at the New Hampshire Technical Institute in Concord this summer. These are certainly accomplishments of which he should be very proud, and I applaud him for his achievements. 
Boys State and Boys Nation are week-long programs that aim to teach young men to be responsible citizens by teaching them how the Government works. The students set up a legislature where they introduce and debate bills in order to learn the complexities of democracy. While learning about the ins and outs of the Government, he will also learn interpersonal skills and the importance of listening, understanding and working together. 
Geofferey enjoys politics and may pursue a career in a related field. I congratulate Geofferey on his outstanding accomplishments. I commend his hard work and perseverance and wish him luck at Boys Nation.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the town of Barrington, NH. On July 20, 1997, the people of Barrington will gather in celebration of the 275th anniversary of the town's charter. 
On May 10, 1722 Gov. Samuel Shute signed Barrington's charter on behalf of King George I, encouraging the settlement of a new plantation of 50 dwelling houses, a meeting house for public worship, a parsonage, and a school. However, when Barrington's first settlers crossed the 20 miles between the harbor town of Portsmouth and their new plots of white pine forest land, they found the terrain wrought with the tough, plow-bending granite which has come to make New Hampshire famous. Early accounts depict fields overrun with rattle snakes and forests brimming with less-than-hospitable native tribes. 
Nevertheless, in quintessential Yankee fashion, the people of Barrington cut out a tiny foothold for themselves. Together, they burned back the brush, felled the towering hardwoods, and quarried the granite using crude hand-held drills and chisels. By 1742, granite boulders had been hewn into foundations and apple orchards had been planted. By 1750, Barrington's lumber mills were providing the timber for ships' masts in England, posts and beams for homes in surrounding towns, and chord wood for firing the seacoast's early ironworks. 
Mr. President, on Sunday I will join with the people of Barrington on the steps of its landmark Calef's Country Store to commemorate this historic birthday. Since its rudimentary beginnings the town of Barrington has grown into a prosperous township of 6,600 people. Joining me on Sunday will be members of Barrington's volunteer fire department, Barrington's volunteer emergency medical service and Barrington's volunteer youth association. I am pleased to report the unwavering dedication to community is alive and well in Barrington after 275 years. 
Happy birthday, Barrington. Live Free or Die.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Bingaman amendment. It would cut funding that is necessary for the space-based laser program. This program is making tremendous technical progress. DOD acknowledges that additional funds are required for this purpose and is working to identify those additional funds in the outyears. 
This has been one of the best managed programs in the history of U.S. ballistic missile defense efforts. You cannot often say that, that the program is on budget, on time, reliable, and even under severe funding constraints it has continued to make remarkable technical progress. It offers the best hope for the future of providing highly effective global boost phase defense against ballistic missiles of all ranges. 
There was an independent review team appointed by the directer of BMDO to study the future of the SBL Program that has recommended that this program transition to the development of a space technology demonstrator for launch in the year 2005. And the funding contained in this bill supports the recommendation. It does not violate the ABM Treaty, for those who may be concerned. It keeps our options open to deploy this system. 
I get very concerned, Mr. President, when year after year--and this the seventh straight year--there has been opposition expressed on the floor in spite of the full support of the committee on this program. This is a tremendously important program, and I think my colleagues need to understand that there is an expansion of the number of countries possessing ballistic missiles, not only nuclear but chemical and biological. These warheads present a serious challenge to the security of the United States. They are all over the world--North Korea, Iran, Iraq, just to name a few--China. They threaten our troops and they threaten our cities, and to take away a technology that can protect those cities, protect those troops in the field is outrageous. It is outrageous. It is immoral. I do not understand the intensity of the effort to do this year after year after year. 
As the number of countries with these ballistic missiles continues to increase and as the range of those missiles increases, the expansion in the number of targets to defend will dramatically increase. With this technology, we are able to get these missiles in their boost phase and make the debris from those missiles fall back on the aggressor or the firer of the missile. 
That is what this technology is all about. That is why it is so important, Mr. President. And to come down here year after year, time after time, and arbitrarily try to kill a program that has been on budget, on time, supported by the defense people and protecting our troops, protecting our cities is flat out irresponsible. There is absolutely no justification for it anywhere. 
I urge my colleagues to look very, very carefully at what they are doing here because if this vote were to prevail and this amendment were to be passed, it would do serious damage to our security and, frankly, put our cities at risk, our bases at risk and our troops at risk throughout the world.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the amendment offered by Senator Chafee, I would like to explain why I believe that this amendment not only protects public health and the environment, but will also ensure that we will maintain a strong national defense. 
As my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee are aware, the original motivation of section 363 of the National Defense Authorization Act, as reported, grew out of a series of executive agency actions in the various regions of the country that needlessly limited or stopped ongoing training activities. In those instances, long-scheduled training and readiness efforts of active duty, reserve and national guard forces were stopped in their tracks, because of the rash and unjustified actions of overzealous Federal bureaucrats. 
Although the action taken by these low-level functionaries was within their powers, and met applicable public safety, welfare, and environmental statues, the timing and nature of the actions taken were neither justified nor appropriate given the lack of actual and immediate implications to human health and the environment. As a result of these highly unjustified actions, troops who had to travel hundreds and sometimes thousands of miles, at considerable cost to the taxpayers, were unable to conduct these critical training and readiness missions. 
The purpose of the original language offered in committee, would have allowed the Secretary of Defense to impose a 30-day moratorium on the application of administrative or enforcement actions that could have a significant adverse effect on military readiness or training activities. Although appreciating the justification for the language, there were some, including Senator Chafee, who were concerned about the impact that this language would have on existing public welfare, safety, and environmental statutes. In order to address this concern, Senator Chafee and I, along with members of the Armed Services Committee were able to fashion the compromise language that we are offering today, that will strike the proper balance in these situations. 
Under this language, if the Secretary of Defense discovers that an official of an Executive agency is proposing to take, or has taken an administration action that will result in a significant adverse effect on the training or readiness activities of the armed forces, the Secretary shall submit a written notification to the head of that agency, which will trigger a mandatory consultation between those two officials. In addition, the Secretary's notification will trigger an immediate moratorium on the application of the administrative action until 5 days after the notification, or until the head of the Executive agency and the Secretary are able to agree on an appropriate course of action, whichever is sooner. If the two officials are unable to agree on a course of action, then the ultimate decision will be elevated to the President. 
One significant concern over the committee reported language was that a 30-day moratorium was too stringent and could frustrate efforts to avoid immediate, actual, and irreparable damage to human health and the environment. Subsection (D)(2) of this amendment provides that the head of the Executive agency can waive the moratorium if a determination is made that the delay in the administrative action or proposed administrative action will pose an actual threat of imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment. This language will not only strike an important balance between national defense and public welfare concerns, but it will also avoid a replication of past events undertaken by low-level bureaucrats. If the military training activity will pose an actual threat of imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and the environment, that decision will have to be taken by the head of the Executive agency. We believe that actions such as this, which will have a significant impact on our national security, should be taken by the top decision maker at the agency, who is in a better position to understand the full complexities of this decision, rather than some low-level government employee. 
I want to make one thing clear about this waiver however. The head of the Executive agency must meet a higher threshold of use of this provision than the tired and over-litigated test for the words imminent and substantial. The use of the words `actual threat' doesn't mean just a `possible threat' or a `potential threat.' Instead, it means that if the training or readiness activity is undertaken that it is `highly likely' or `near certain' that there will be an actual threat to public health and the environment. 
We must protect public health and the environment and we must ensure our national defense. When these issues come into conflict, we must take special efforts to balance these issues. Decisions of this nature should be made at the highest levels of our government, and because of this language, they will. 
I believe this is a very important amendment, and I appreciate the support of my colleagues for its adoption.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I take the floor today to introduce the Local Forest User Fairness Act with my colleague Senator Gregg. This legislation would allow residents of counties where U.S. Forest Service land is situated to recreate in the forest without paying a user fee. The introduction of this bill was prompted by the recent institution of recreational user fees in certain national forests across the country, one of those being the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire. 
While I am not opposed to user fees per se, I do have some concerns in this instance because of the potential for double taxation and inequitable treatment for local residents. Those areas where the Federal Government owns much of the land suffer from a diminished property tax base to fund schools and other necessary social needs. To address this inequity, Congress passed the Payments in Lieu of Taxes, or PILT, program in 1976 which partially reimburses local units of government for their loss of property tax revenue due to the U.S. Forest Service's ownership of local land. Unfortunately, this program has not been fully funded for a number of years. 
This bill provides that until the PILT program is fully funded to its authorized level, local residents recreating in the forest would be exempt from paying user fees. In New Hampshire, this would apply to all residents of Coos, Grafton, and Carroll Counties. For these areas, the shortfall in PILT payments for fiscal year 1996 was nearly $250,000, providing only 68 percent of what was owed to them. Because of this shortfall, county and municipal governments are forced to find much needed revenue elsewhere, including increased property taxes. It is simply unfair to charge these communities with using the White Mountains when they are already subsidizing the forest. 
I believe the Local Forest User Fairness Act provides for a reasonable, fair way of dealing with this inequity. Our proposed exemption would not be necessary, of course, if the Federal Government were to fully fund the PILT program and provide adequate funding for Forest Service management--initiatives that I strongly support.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Bingaman amendment which would cut funding for the space-based laser program--not just cuts it, it devastates the program. 
In its markup of the DOD authorization bill, the committee increased the funding for the program by $118 million. During the committee's markup, the Senator from New Mexico did offer an amendment to delete the increase. This was defeated in committee on a bipartisan basis. It was not a party-line vote. It is my sincere hope, Mr. President, that the Senate will follow suit as the committee did and defeat this amendment today or tomorrow when we vote. 
Mr. President, let me explain why additional funds are needed for this very important program. The President's budget request included only $30 million for the space-based laser. This is insufficient funding for the program to continue making the technical progress that it has been making. 
The Department of Defense is currently considering ways to increase this level of funding in the outyears, but there is a major deficit now for the Fiscal Year 1998. This program, the space-based laser, is the last remaining space-based laser missile defense left. The last one. If we allow the program to die, then we will have wasted well over $1 billion in investment, literally wasted. We will not see the fruits of that investment and we will have given up the option of deploying the most effective national and theater boost phase missile defense system known to man. 
The space-based laser program has been one of the best managed programs in the history of our ballistic missile defense efforts. It is not always the case that we can stand here and say that a program has been well managed. 
For over 10 years it has continued to make remarkable technical progress while remaining on schedule and within cost. How many other programs in DOD, or, indeed, in the U.S. Government, can we say that about? Not too many. 
Mr. President, could I have order?

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, if we do not allow the space-based laser program to proceed, we are going to erode the Defense Department's expertise in laser technology. There are other laser programs in DOD. The SBL, the space-based laser, represents a significant proportion of DOD's corporate knowledge about lasers and all of DOD's knowledge about space-based lasers. All this knowledge, all of this technology will simply be thrown out the window if we gut this program. 
This program has strong bipartisan support. It has had it for over many years. The Armed Services Committee has increased funding for this program in each of the last two fiscal years. In fiscal year 1997, for example, the committee recommended and the Congress and the President approved an increase of $70 million. DOD acknowledges that the additional funding is necessary if the program is to continue making the technical progress that it is making. 
Therefore, the bill before the Senate today, the bill in its current form, the DOD bill, includes an increase of $118 million for that program. This amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico will take that $118 billion out and basically stop the program in process. 
I must say, every year, year after year, in all the 7 years that I have been on the Armed Services Committee here in the Senate, somebody comes out and tries to cut this program. Every year I am standing up here defending it, trying to make people aware of the importance of this program. 
Let me explain why this specific funding level was chosen. The SBL program will complete its current development phase this year. The next logical step for a space-based laser is to develop and launch a technology readiness demonstrator. This is, in fact, the recommendation of an independent review team, the IRT, that was established by the director of the ballistic missile defense organization earlier this year to study the future of the SBL program. 
The IRT recommended proceeding with a space demonstrator in fiscal year 1998 that could be launched in the year 2005. The funding increase in the pending bill is the same amount as that recommended by BMDO, Ballistic Missile Defense Office's independent review team--no more, no less. Such an SBL technology demonstrator would be compliant with the ABM Treaty. For those who are concerned about that, it is treaty compliant. And both Secretary of Defense Cohen and officials from the National Security Council have confirmed that an SBL readiness demonstrator would be treaty compliant as long as it is not an operational system prototype. 
Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-smith-nh-7-19970710</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Additionally, the Department of Defense compliance review group has previously reviewed the SBL readiness demonstrator and deemed such a program compliant with the ABM Treaty. So the Air Force and BMDO have signed a memorandum of agreement to proceed with the SBL program. The Air Force and BMDO endorsed the development of an SBL readiness demonstrator and have done the preliminary work on how to proceed with such a program, and the Air Force has said if such a program proceeds, they will establish this program management office at the Philips lab at Kirkland Air Force base in New Mexico. 
The bottom line is, a readiness demonstrator is the next logical step for SBL. It doesn't commit the United States to deployment or development of an operational SBL system, but it preserves the option for that decision after the year 2005. If the Bingaman amendment were to be agreed to, this option would be precluded and we would be left with a space-based laser program lacking focus and lacking any logical direction. It is one of those situations where if we do take the focus and take the direction away, it makes all the money we have spent in the past, all the $1 billion, wasted, down the drain, when we are now on the threshold of being able to see it all come to fruition and see the space-based laser program take its proper place in the defense arsenal of the United States. 
So I urge my colleagues tomorrow, when we vote, to oppose this amendment as we have done year after year after year, to oppose the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico and defeat the amendment, and allow the space-based laser program to continue. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the FY98 Defense Authorization bill reported by the Armed Services Committee. This is an excellent piece of legislation, and I want to commend the distinguished Chairman of the Committee, Senator Thurmond, for his tireless efforts to formulate a balanced, constructive defense bill. 
Mr. President, the bill before us would add $2.6 billion to the President's budget request for national defense. While I strongly support this increase, I want to emphasize that it will not address all of the deficiencies resulting from the Administration's underfunded defense program. In fact, even with this increase, defense spending in FY98 will be $3.3 billion below this year in real terms. However, in the current budget environment, this $2.6 billion increase was all that we were able to achieve. 
As we did last year, the Armed Services Committee spent a good deal of time evaluating our national security requirements and establishing a set of firm priorities to guide our consideration of defense programs for FY98. These priorities included, among other things: ensuring national security and the status of the United States as the preeminent military power; protecting the readiness of our Armed Forces; enhancing the quality of life of military personnel and their families; ensuring U.S. military superiority by continuing to fund a more robust, progressive modernization program for the future; accelerating the development and deployment of missile defense systems; and preserving the shipbuilding and submarine industrial bases. 
Mr. President, as I said, the Armed Services Committee established these priorities to guide our investment strategy in the FY98 authorization bill. I am pleased to report that the bill before us embodies these priorities and corrects a number of serious deficiencies contained in the Administration budget request. 
For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to highlight some of the important measures contained in this bill. 
The authorization bill reported by the Armed Services Committee: provides a 2.8 percent pay raise for military personnel; increases by $41.5 million spending on research and development for counterproliferation, chemical and biological defense, and counter-terrorism programs; increases readiness funding by more than $1 billion in areas such as ammunition procurement, flying hours, force protection, cold weather gear, barracks renovation, and depot maintenance; adds $653 million for reserve force modernization programs; adds $720 million for an additional Arleigh Burke class destroyer; approves the Navy's proposed teaming arrangement for design and production of the New Attack Submarine; authorizes $345 million to accelerate the advance procurement and construction of the next nuclear aircraft carrier; and adds $90 million to procure an additional V-22 aircraft in FY98. 
Mr. President, as Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I also want to take this opportunity to outline for my colleagues some of the important initiatives dealing with missile defense, nuclear forces, and Department of Energy programs. 
As my colleagues know, Secretary Cohen conducted an extensive analysis of all defense programs, including missile defense, as part of the Quadrennial Defense Review. This analysis confirmed what many of us have long argued--that the 
Administration's National Missile Defense program is grossly underfunded. In fact, Secretary Cohen determined that the NMD program was underfunded by some $2.3 billion over the future years defense plan, and by a total of $474 million in FY98 alone. 
This shortfall of $474 million for National Missile Defense in FY98 proved to be a very big challenge for the Committee to address in its deliberations. And I would be remiss if I did not say to my colleagues that it caused us to have to make some very difficult decisions as we weighed the merits and affordability of many requested programs. 
However, I believe that we formulated a very responsible and forward looking package of initiatives in the Strategic Subcommittee. These initiatives include: increasing funding for the Navy Upper Tier program by $80 million; adding $15 million for the Arrow interoperability program; providing an increase of $118 million for the space based laser program; adding $50 million for the Clementine 2 micro-satellite program; authorizing $80 million for the kinetic energy anti-satellite program; increasing funding for cruise missile defense programs by $32 million; prohibiting the retirement of certain strategic nuclear delivery systems in FY98 unless the START 2 Treaty enters force; providing $4 billion for weapons activities to maintain the reliability and safety of the enduring nuclear arsenal; and including $5.1 billion for defense environmental restoration and waste management activities. 
The bill also includes a provision requiring the Director of Central Intelligence to establish a cadre of experts within the Intelligence Community to work POW/MIA issues. The President has directed that a Special National Intelligence Estimate be prepared on the POW/MIA issue; however, there are no intelligence experts on these issues currently remaining in the Intelligence Community. This provision does not affect POW/MIA policy or relations with Vietnam. It merely provides the Director of Central Intelligence with total descretion to establish an Intelligence Cell within the community. 
Mr. President, these are but a few of the many important initiatives included in this bill. In a more general sense, I want to also offer some observations concerning the current state of our Armed Forces and the course that President Clinton has charted for defense in his second term. 
As my colleagues know, I have been critical of the Clinton Administration's penchant for involving our military forces in unorthodox, non-traditional operations. Without question, these peacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations are bankrupting the defense budget and undermining the readiness of America's Armed Forces. 
I have also been critical of the so-called Bottom Up Review that was conducted by the Clinton Administration four years ago to guide its defense program. Whether they admit it publicly or not, everyone realizes that this was nothing but a budget driven exercise to tailor our defense forces and strategy to meet a pre-established defense spending level. 
I had hoped that in its second term, the Clinton Administration would take a more honest and objective approach to defense programming, and base our national security policy on the threat rather than on budget requirements. Unfortunately, it appears this was wishful thinking. 
The Quadrennial Defense Review that was recently released falls into the same trap as the Bottom Up Review. Rather than identifying the threats confronting our security and formulating the force structure, end strength and strategy necessary to counter these threats, the QDR establishes a baseline for defense spending and tailors our defense program to fit that baseline. 
I want to make clear that I do not impugn the motives or patriotism of those who worked very hard in the Pentagon to formulate the QDR. They were doing the best they could to balance requirements and resources. But the truth is that the resources they were provided were inadequate to fund the requirements. As a result, the QDR fails to correct the deficiencies of the Bottom Up Review and it fails to provide a credible, threat based strategy for our defense program. 
Mr. President, it is also worth mentioning that the days of the so-called `peace dividend' and the days of Congressional windfalls for defense are over. In the past 3 years, Congress has added approximately $20 billion to the requested level for defense. But with the recently negotiated budget deal, Congress and the Administration are now locked into agreed-upon defense numbers. There will be no windfall in future years. 
In fact, any spending additions requested by members will have to be offset with commensurate spending reductions. From here on out, it will be a zero sum game. I hope my colleagues understand this situation because it will have a very profound effect on the Committee's ability to accommodate member interest requests in the future. We have cut defense to the bone. There is no real growth programmed in the future; only further reductions. We have made our bed, now we must lie in it. 
I want to end with a somber warning for my colleagues. It is very simple and straightforward. Contingency operations are bankrupting our defense budget. If we do not reign in the Clinton Administration and curtail its continuing commitments of U.S. military forces for non-military and humanitarian purposes, there will be no money to recapitalize our Armed Forces. There will be no money to purchase DDG-51's, or F-22's, or F/A-18's, or Joint Strike Fighters, or Comanche helicopters, or V-22's, or satellites, or ground vehicles. 
If we continue to allow our Armed Forces to be used as a `911' emergency force for the United Nations, we will lose our combat readiness, and deplete our investment accounts. 
The Bosnia example is a particularly instructive, and particularly disturbing, example of this trend. When President Clinton first committed troops to Bosnia, he assured Congress that the scope of the operation would be limited and the cost of operation would be $1.6 billion. Yet, here we are today, with the price tag of the Bosnia operation having climbed to $7.3 billion and the Secretary of State talking about keeping troops in Bosnia beyond the June 1998 deadline, yet again. 
Mr. President, the Administration has asked for two additional rounds of Base Closures, arguing that these closures will enable us to save a few billion dollars. Under the most optimistic forecasts these closures will not even pay for the Bosnia mission. How on Earth can we justify putting America's communities through yet another two rounds of chaos, confusion, anxiety and economic disruption in order to pay the tab for a mission that a majority of them do not support? We have already had four rounds of base closures in seven years. Where does it end? 
Let me be frank. I absolutely oppose additional base closures at this time. In 1995, President Clinton completely destroyed the credibility of the Base Closure process by injecting subjective politics into an otherwise objective process. There was no question what the President's motivation was--pure electoral politics. But in the quest to gain more electoral votes, the President disrupted a very fragile consensus. That consensus, in support of shared sacrifice through and objective, transparent process, is now gone. And it is President Clinton who bears responsibility for that. 
I would hasten to add, however, that even if we were to ignore the politicization of the Base Closure process, the arguments in favor of more closures are specious. It has yet to be demonstrated that we have saved a single penny on the four previous rounds of closures. In fact, we continue to spend exorbitant amounts to close, realign, and remediate bases. While the Department assures us that we will save vast sums of money one day, that day doesn't seem to be anywhere in the near future. We are spending a lot more right now to close bases than we are recouping in operations and maintenance savings. 
Unless and until the President can convince Congress and the American people that politics have been eliminated from the process, and that previous closures are demonstrably producing savings, I will not support additional base closures. Undoubtedly, this issue will be debated further on the floor and conference, and I look forward to playing an active role in these discussions. 
Mr. President, I want to close by again thanking the distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services Committee for his outstanding leadership in formulating this bill. I know there has been a great deal of praise heaped upon the senior Senator from South Carolina recently in connection with his record for service in the Senate. It is richly deserved. He is a man of utmost integrity and a tremendous inspiration to all of us who aspire to have a lasting impact on this institution. I am proud to serve with him on the Armed Services Committee, and pleased to support this legislation. 
I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. If the Senator would yield, that is correct. The provision being proposed is applicable only to the stated plans in the Department's `dual track' strategy. This bill would not affect the Fast Flux Facility, because that facility is currently funded through a non-defense account. This bill does not have authority over these funds, and therefore, this provision would in no way alter the commitment made by former Secretary O'Leary to keep the FFTF in a hot stand-by condition.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to New Hampshire's 368th Engineer Battalion as they celebrate their 50th anniversary at a gala celebration in Manchester on July 19th. 
Mr. President, I wish to honor the nearly 1,000 men and women of New Hampshire's 368th Engineer Battalion who are known as much for their efforts in international peace building campaigns as their wartime readiness. They have earned an enviable reputation from their community action projects that include building roads, bridges, schools, hospitals to disaster relief projects. 
The 368th Engineer Battalion was formed in 1947 from engineer and heavy maintenance units. The battalion has been headquartered in Concord and Manchester and they have also had units in Laconia, Rochester, Gilford, West Lebanon, NH, as well as White River Junction, VT, and Attleboro and Danvers, MA. 
The 368th Battalion has made a substantial contribution to the quality of life for residents of the Granite State. The Engineer Battalion has developed disaster relief models for such disasters as the recent Alton, NH dam breach where the unit played a critical role in clearing flood debris, stabilizing erosion and restoring local transportation facilities for the residents of the small Lakes Region community, which I and the citizens of Alton are very thankful for their exceptional work in that time of crisis. Helping others is the cornerstone of the 368th Engineer Battalion, making the Granite State a safer place to live and raise a family. 
The 368th has seen their share of service on foreign soils in their 50-year history, where they have lived and cooperated with the civilian community including the countries of Italy, Germany, Honduras, Guatemala, Korea, and Kenya. They have continued their community action projects in building clinics, roads, and sanitation facilities which have had long term impact on the quality of civilian life and health for the people of the world. 
The decision by the U.S. Government to invest $17 million to create a new joint service reserve center at Manchester Airport is a testament to the professionalism and commitment to excellence embodied in the 368th. The facility will enable the 368th to continue serving our Nation with distinction well into the next century. 
I commend New Hampshire's 368th Engineer Battalion for their dedication to the community which is the embodiment of the American ideal. People like the members of the 368th are the backbone of their communities and our Nation. I am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate. Happy 50th anniversary.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee and the Finance Committee for having the courage to follow through on a promise the Government made long ago to career military personnel. I know the future of health care for elderly military retirees is an issue that deeply concerns many of us, and I am pleased that we have found a financially responsible solution to the growing problem of health care access for this group of retired personnel. 
With the Defense Department expected to complete full implementation of the Tricare medical plan within the year, many retirees, who made it their lives' work to defend our freedom, face the certain loss of medical benefits when they turn 65 unless Congress acts now. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am deeply disturbed by this prospect. That is why I have consistently supported responsible initiatives to guarantee the future of DOD health care for Medicare-eligible military retirees. 
In New Hampshire, I have witnessed firsthand the impact of defense downsizing on health care resources for this vulnerable population. When Pease Air Force Base closed in 1991, thousands of aging retirees were left to compete with active duty personnel and military retirees from neighboring States for fewer spaces in the New England DOD health care system. Once Tricare takes hold, this group will lose any remaining access to the military system they now enjoy because the Defense Department can no longer afford to offer these retirees the medical benefits they were promised. This is unacceptable. 
After 4 years of meetings, hearings, and failed legislative initiatives, the Senate has finally reached a workable solution to the health care crisis now facing Medicare-eligible military retirees. Medicare subvention, as the plan is known, will allow the Defense Department to seek reimbursement from Medicare for the cost of treating eligible retired military personnel. By authorizing the DOD to carry out a 3-year Medicare subvention test program, the Senate has taken a decisive step toward restoring military retirees' faith in the country they honorably served. I am pleased to have supported Medicare subvention since the proposal's inception, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming years to ensure that our Government does not shirk the responsibility of providing elderly military retirees with the quality, affordable health care they deserve. 
I thank the chair and I yield the floor.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Ani Danielian, a student at Phillips Exeter Academy, on being the recipient of the 1997 Japan-United States Senate Youth Exchange scholarship. This is certainly an accomplishment of which she should be very proud and I salute her for her achievement. 
Ani was chosen to represent the Granite State during a summer exchange program in Japan. She will spend 6 weeks living with a host family and meeting with Government officials. Before traveling to Japan, Ani will attend an orientation program in San Francisco, CA. 
The scholarship is administered by Youth For Understanding [YFU] International Exchange. One high school junior from each State received a scholarship this year from YFU. Competition for this scholarship was intense, as evidenced by the almost 700 applicants for the 50 available scholarships. Ani was selected through a rigorous screening process which involved numerous volunteers of YFU. 
Ani is involved in several organizations at Phillips Exeter Academy, including the Concert Choir and the Japanese-American Society. Following graduation, the 16-year-old plans on attending a liberal arts college and possibly majoring in International Relations or East Asian Studies. 
I congratulate Ani Danielian on her outstanding accomplishments. I commend her hard work and perseverance and wish her luck in her exploration of the Japanese culture.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey addresses a provision, section 3138, in the defense bill which relates to something called Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program [FUSRAP]. I just want to give a little background as to how and why the language the Senator is concerned about appeared in the legislation and also to indicate what its intent was and to discuss specifically his amendment. 
Earlier this year it came to the attention of the Armed Services Committee this program, the so-called FUSRAP program, was not getting the sites cleaned up as quickly or as efficiently as it could. Of course, as all of us know who work on the Superfund issue, that is true of many, many Superfund sites around the country as well as these particular FUSRAP sites. So the committee felt we wanted to do something to expedite the cleanups, to get it done quicker, to respond to the concerns raised by Members who were not on our committee--that is the Armed Services Committee--and in some cases were not even on the Environment and Public Works Committee. In order to try to respond to those concerns, the Armed Services Committee unanimously adopted this language. It was hoped it would speed up the cleanup of these sites and provide an incentive for parties that were responsible for the contamination of these sites to come to the table, negotiate their liability allocations with DOE, and to contribute an appropriate amount to the cleanup costs--not to give anybody a sweetheart deal, not to remove people from the hook, so to speak, but rather to bring people to the table to pay their appropriate share of the cleanup costs. That was the goal and the objective of the language. 
I might say, unfortunately, sometimes these disputes manage to make their way to the floor because they are not resolved before we get here. Had this Senator had some knowledge of concerns raised by members of the committee or other Members of the Senate prior to this time, we might have been able to address those concerns. But as I indicated earlier, it passed unanimously in the Armed Services Committee. There was absolutely no discussion of it in the committee. So it is unfortunate that we have to deal with it here, but, be that as it may, that is what we will do. 
The language included in the section would have limited DOE's ability to seek cost recoveries against some private parties. That is true. That is what Senator Lautenberg just said. But in no way would it have limited the similar powers, the collateral powers that the EPA and the Department of Justice has to obtain these recoveries, get these dollars recovered. So, given the fact that DOE may have some level of responsibility for liability at these sites, we on the committee believed it was an inappropriate conflict of interest for them to have control for recovering costs against private parties. So, by leveling the playing field, we believed it would be more likely that private parties would settle their liability at the site, and, given the fact that EPA and DOJ would still have enforcement authority, we knew no party would be let off the hook. That was the intention. 
I believe in my own heart, as I read the language, that the language supports that intention. But I can understand there may be differences of opinion in terms of how you interpret it. There have been some concerns raised that we tried to address a single-party site here, to give somebody specific relief. That could not be further from the truth. I think the facts speak for themselves. This was a generic amendment. I might say the topic at hand here is the so-called FUSRAP sites, that is the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Project. 
In a DOE Office of Environmental Restoration pamphlet that is dated April 1995, there are 46 FUSRAP sites, of varying degrees. I think it may be the case that the site in New Jersey could be singled out here as possibly being helped in one way or another by his provision. However, there are 46 sites, so I think the committee is on record here, being very clear that the intention here was to deal with 46 FUSRAP sites to try to expedite the cleanup. They are in States all across the United States.

<TEXT>
Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. So that was the intention here and the point I wanted to make regarding these sites. 
Let me also say, because this is kind of a technical term--the so-called FUSRAP sites is a little hard to understand. We have a lot of acronyms here. I know it is difficult for people to comprehend some of these, but this program was initiated in 1974 by the Atomic Energy Commission under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. They have 7 or 8 major objectives. I will just briefly highlight those. 
One is to find and evaluate sites that supported the Manhattan Engineer District/Atomic Energy Commission's early atomic energy program and to determine whether these sites needed cleanup or control. 
Second, to clean up or control these sites so that they meet current DOE guidelines. 
Third, to dispose of or stabilize waste in an environmentally acceptable way. 
Fourth, to complete all work so the DOE complies with the appropriate Federal laws and regulations and State and local environmental and land use requirements. 
Fifth, to certify the sites for appropriate future use. 
These sites are owned by either the Department of Energy, local governments, private corporations or private citizens or a combination thereof. 
Again, the goal here was to try to craft something that would expedite these 46 FUSRAP sites, some with problems more serious in nature than others. Obviously the site the Senator from New Jersey is talking about is much more serious than some of the others. But the idea was to bring these parties to the table in a fair and equitable way, being certain that those PRPs that had put money on the table, had offered money on the table, would be encouraged to provide not only that money but more. That way, we could get a fair settlement so the taxpayers would be saved dollars and at the same time we would accomplish the goal of cleaning up these sites. 
In a moment I am going to offer a second-degree perfecting amendment to the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey. Before I do that, I just want to say that I understand the concerns of the Senator. He has been very cooperative. We have talked about this at great length in the past few days to try to come to an understanding of what my intent was and what he believes the result to be. We may not be 100 percent in agreement here, but I think we can resolve this with this second-degree amendment which I believe addresses the concerns of the Senator and at the same time will lead us to accomplishing the cleanup goal that we want to achieve. 
I do not want to preclude the Senator's debate. I would be happy to withhold offering the second-degree if the Senator wants to speak on this amendment? I will withhold that amendment and I will yield the floor.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I think it would be appropriate at this time for me to offer the second-degree amendment, and then I believe we can get this matter resolved and go on to the next amendment. 
So I offer a second-degree amendment to Senator Lautenberg's amendment to strike section 3138 from the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am going to take a couple of minutes, and then we will move on. 
This second-degree amendment would substitute a reporting requirement for the original section of section 3138 directed regarding cost recovery agreements at cleanup sites managed by DOE within the so-called FUSRAP program. 
As you know, and as we indicated earlier, there had been some interest requested that limitations be placed on this Federal agency cost recovery from potential responsible third parties. We were able to deal with those, and the Armed Services Committee does not have jurisdiction over these issues, but does have jurisdiction over defense-related cleanups of DOE sites. Section 3138 was intended to narrowly focus on concerns that were related to cost recovery of FUSRAP. 
Mr. President, basically, there are six provisions that are part of that report language. They are self-explanatory. This is an attempt to try to get a reasonable compromise to see to it that we save taxpayers dollars, at the same time to be fair and to get both parties to the table as quickly as possible. 
I yield the floor, Mr. President.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the great citizens of Nashua, NH, Portsmouth, NH, and Manchester, NH, on being named to Money Magazine's best places to live in America. Nashua, NH came in at No. 1, with Portsmouth and Manchester finishing fifth and sixth respectively, based on Money magazine's rankings. 
The national investment magazine released their list of America's top 10 communities based on business climate, economic well-being, quality of life, and other factors that comprise a positive environment in which to work and raise a family. New Hampshire's tourism industry, scenic beauty, lack of sales or income tax, low crime rate, quality education and family and community spirit make the State attractive for families and businesses to locate here. The people of these communities, and of the entire State, have good reason to be extra proud. 
Nashua, the Gate City of the Granite State, named No. 1 by Money magazine, is the only State to receive this honor twice, of which I and the citizens are very proud. The former mill town, which borders the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, has a booming economy with manufacturing facilities, hi-tech firms and defense contractors. Nashua is also close to many cultural arts venues and major medical facilities of neighboring communities, which make it No. 1 as touted by Money magazine. 
Portsmouth, New Hampshire's port city, placed sixth as the most desirable place in the country. The Portsmouth community relies on many major technology and communications firms to help thrust to the forefront of the Nation. The Portsmouth community is a great place to raise a family with its many fine schools and major colleges nearby, including the University of New Hampshire in nearby Durham. The Port City is also the home of one of our Nation's finest military institutions, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. 
Manchester, the Queen City, picked up the sixth place honors in the Nation. The Queen City has many high-tech firms and major telecommunications businesses which help add to the economic power of the city. Manchester sits on the banks of the Merrimack River, the home to many of the historic manufacturing plants of the late 1800's and early 1900's. Situated in the Merrimack Valley of New Hampshire, Manchester is also home to a booming cultural arts center which is the pride of northern New England. 
Mr. President, it is no surprise that New Hampshire is the only State with 3 towns in the top 10. I can think of no cities in America more deserving of these top honors than Nashua, Portsmouth, and Manchester. I applaud the local officials, enterprising businessmen and women and the committed citizens of these great cities. They helped bring about an economic revival that has propelled New Hampshire into national recognition once again. I am proud to represent them all in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the town of Greenville, NH on their 125th anniversary. Greenville is celebrating their 125th birthday June 27-29, and the town's citizens will highlight these festivities with an anniversary parade and numerous other activities. This New Hampshire town has a significant heritage to celebrate on their 125th anniversary. 
The history of Greenville began in the mid-1760's with the building of a saw and grist mill by Thomas Barrett and his brother, Charles Barrett. From that time forward the mills have been the dominant feature of the town on the banks of the Souhegan River from the Upper Falls to the High Falls. The first mills were a grist or saw mill, however the adventurous pioneers discovered hydroelectricity which would help run woolen mills, the cotton mills, furniture mill, another saw mill and the generation of hydroelectricity which continues today. 
The early settlers of this untamed country were independent and self-sufficient folk, characteristics that have endured in the people of this region. With their independent spirit and determination they built a strong and lasting community that makes their descendants proud. By the early 19th century a unique village had grown around the mills along the flowing banks of the Souhegan. The village had its own meeting house, school, post office, inn, and several stores. As the mills thrived, the town around it blossomed into the town of today. 
The town of Greenville had been known by many names prior to 1872. The village along the river was first called Barrett's Mills, then Dakin's Mills, Mason Harbor, Souhegan Village, Mason Village, and finally Greenville in 1872. 
Today, the town of Greenville prides itself on its quality of life and community spirit, a tradition that has manifested itself throughout the town's history. Greenville is one of New Hampshire's smallest towns and boasts not only magnificent surroundings, but a community of friendly, caring neighbors as well. 
I congratulate the town of Greenville on this historic milestone and wish them a happy 125th anniversary celebration. I send them my best wishes for continued success and a prosperous year as they mark this historic occasion. Happy birthday, Greenville.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the town of Hooksett, NH on their 175th anniversary. Hooksett is celebrating their 175th birthday during the month of July, and the town's citizens will highlight these festivities with the dedication of a new safety center and numerous other activities. This New Hampshire town has a significant heritage to celebrate on their 175th anniversary. 
The history of Hooksett began in the 1700's. The early settlers of this untamed country were independent and self-sufficient folk, characteristics that have endured in the people of this region. With their independent spirit and determination they built a strong and lasting community that makes their descendants proud. What is now Hooksett was once part of three other communities during the 18th century. The residents of these towns were dissatisfied with having to travel 17 miles over rugged terrain to the community of Chester to attend church or to vote. 
On June 11, 1782, 40 years before the town would be incorporated, the General Court granted a petition that established a ferry at Isle of Hooksett Falls. The town would eventually take its name from this area. These strong-spirited citizens were determined to form their own community and five petitions later to the General Court, Hooksett was finally incorporated July 2, 1822. The first town meeting was at Halls Tavern on September 16, 1822, where the first town officials of Hooksett took the oath to serve the people of the community. The voters elected: the Honorable Richard H. Ayer, selectman and moderator; Samuel head, selectman; Samuel Poor, selectman and Gideon Flanders as town clerk. The residents also elected constables, surveyors of lumber, treasurer, hog reeves and a school committee. 
Today, the town of Hooksett prides itself on its quality of life and community spirit, a tradition that has manifested itself throughout the town's history. This town of 9,400 residents boasts not only magnificent surroundings, but a community of friendly, caring neighbors as well. 
Mr. President, I congratulate the town of Hooksett on this historic milestone and wish them a happy 175th anniversary celebration. I send them my best wishes for continued success and a prosperous year as they mark their 175th birthday. Happy birthday, Hooksett.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the great citizens of Nashua, NH, Portsmouth, NH, and Manchester, NH, on being named to Money magazine's best places to live in America. Nashua, NH, came in at No. 1, with Portsmouth and Manchester finishing fifth and sixth respectively based on Money magazine's rankings. 
The national investment magazine released their list of America's top ten communities based on business climate, economic well-being, quality of life and other factors that comprise a positive environment in which to work and raise a family. New Hampshire's tourism industry, scenic beauty, lack of sales or income tax, low crime rate, quality education, and family and community spirit make the State attractive for families and businesses to locate here. The people of these communities, and of the entire State, have good reason to be extra proud. 
Nashua, the Gate City of the Granite State, named number one by Money magazine, is the only State to receive this honor twice, of which I and the citizens are very proud. The former mill town which borders the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, has a booming economy with manufacturing facilities, hi-tech firms, and defense contractors. Nashua is also close to many cultural arts venues and major medical faculties of neighboring communities, which make it number one as touted by Money magazine. 
Portsmouth, New Hampshire's Port City, placed sixth as the most desirable place in the country. The Portsmouth community relies on many major technology and communications firms to help thrust to the forefront of the Nation. The Portsmouth community is a great place to raise a family with its many fine schools and major colleges nearby including the University of New Hampshire in nearby Durham. The Port City is also the home of one of our Nation's finest military institutions, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. 
Manchester, the Queen City, picked up the sixth place honors in the Nation. The Queen City has many high-tech firms and major telecommunications businesses which help add to the economic power of the city. Manchester sits on the banks of the Amoskeg river, the home to many of the historic manufacturing plants of the late 1800's and early 1900's. Situated in the Merrimack Valley of New Hampshire, Manchester is also home to a booming cultural arts center which is the pride of northern New England. 
Mr. President, it is no surprise that New Hampshire is the only State with three towns in the top ten. I can think of no cities in America more deserving of these top honors than Nashua, Portsmouth, and Manchester. I applaud the local officials, enterprising businessmen and women, and the committed citizens of these great cities. They helped bring about an economic revival that has propelled New Hampshire into national recognition once again. I am proud to represent them all in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of the late Dr. Karen E. Wetterhahn of Lyme, NH. Karen was an Albert Bradley third century professor in the sciences at Dartmouth College, who died of mercury poisoning on June 8 while working on the cutting edge of the scientific and academic communities. 
Karen, a research chemist of international reputation, spanned the fields of inorganic chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical toxicology. Sometime last year while working with dimethyl mercury, she came in contact with and received mercury poisoning during her studies of mercury toxicity. A dedicated member of the Dartmouth community, her work involved understanding how elevated levels of the elements known as heavy metals, which include chromium, lead, and arsenic, interfere with the processes of cell metabolism and the transfer of genetic information. 
Karen not only shaped the work inside her laboratory but in the classroom as well. Dr. Wetterhahn helped to develop curriculum in the life science area know as structural biology, which studies the structure of biologically active molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins to learn how they function. 
She was born in Plattsburgh, NY, in 1948 and graduated from St. Mary's High School in Champlain, NY. Karen graduated magna cum laude at St. Lawrence University where she earned her bachelor's degree. She received her doctorate from Columbia University in 1975, where she won the prestigious Hammett Award in chemistry. Karen was also a National Institutes of Health trainee at the Institute of Cancer Research, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, also in 1975. One year later she joined the faculty of Dartmouth College, in Hanover, NH. 
Karen also had an instrumental role in making Dartmouth's sciences and administration more representative of the changing faces in the college community. While in Hanover, she co-founded Dartmouth's women in science project, which was aimed at increasing the number of women majoring and taking courses in the sciences. 
Mr. President, Dr. Wetterhahn worked to make the world a better place, and she will be truly missed by all of us who knew and worked with her. Researchers like the late Karen Wetterhahn are important to the future of New Hampshire and the future of this Nation.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Atlas Advanced Pyrotechnics, the Granite State's largest pyrotechnics design firm, on winning the National Park Service's 1997 Independence Day aerial fireworks display, to be held July 4 by the Washington Monument in Washington, DC. 
Atlas Advanced Pyrotechnics is well known in the New Hampshire community for some of their spectacular shows like the annual Rock 101 Skyshow and Jaffery's Festival of Fireworks. Atlas won the North American Pyrotechnics Competition in 1994 and was the United States representative at the 1995 Benson and Hedges International Pyrotechnics Competition in Montreal, Canada. 
Atlas will light the sky over the Nation's Capital with more than 3,000 shells in 20 minutes. The entire show will be digitally synchronized to patriotic music of Copeland, Gershwin, Bernstein, and Eubie Blake. 
In addition to this year's fireworks display on the Mall in Washington DC, the National Park Service has also awarded Atlas the prestigious Harper's Ferry Historical Park display on June 28, at Harper's Ferry, WV. 
I commend Atlas for their hard work and dedication that has earned them such prestigious awards. I applaud the people of Atlas for their accomplishments in bringing joy to the American public. I wish them a very happy Fourth of July.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of the late Peace Corps volunteer Nancy Jean Coutu, as a special memorial site at Elm Brook Park in West Hopkinton will be dedicated to her memory on June 15, 1997 at 1 p.m. 
Nancy was an American hero. She was personally involved in educating children and helping people with disabilities help themselves. She brought joy to the lives of everyone she touched during her two summers when she worked for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers at the park. The Elm Brook Park was special to her, and she helped the many staff members make it much more accessible to persons with disabilities. 
Nancy, a 1993 graduate from the University of New Hampshire, was murdered by native tribesmen in Madagascar on April 9, 1996, after serving almost 2 years as a volunteer member working in a parks and wildlife program for the U.S. Peace Corps. She had lived in a mud hut teaching the 300 villagers how to grow vegetables, and building a school, hospital, and roads in the island country off the east coast of Africa. 
More than 140,00 Americans have served in the Peace Crops since it was founded in 1961. Tragically 15 have been killed, in all corners of the world while promoting the spirt of voluntarism. 
Mr. President, Nancy truly exemplified the spirt of voluntarism. I join with her family and friends, in expressing hope that the dedication of a memorial to honor her will inspire that spirit in others, and bring attention to the remarkable service of all public service volunteers.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Andrew R. Rudman, the New Hampshire Youth Governor for the 1997 National YMCA Youth Governor's Conference. Andrew was elected by fellow high school students from across the Granite State's various youth and government programs as the State's Youth Governor. Andrew will attend a conference in Washington, DC, on June 18, 1997. 
Every year since 1964, Members of the Senate have hosted these remarkable student leaders. The youth governors who will be visiting our Nation's capitol collectively represent over 25,000 of their peers. This select group of students will experience government service first-hand during the conference. 
Andrew is from Londonderry, NH, and in addition to an excellent academic record he finds time to participate in many different extracurricular activities. He is a member of the track and field team, loves music, and is teaching himself how to play the guitar. Andrew will attend Columbia University in the fall of 1997.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the town of Charlestown, NH, as they celebrate the 250th anniversary of the 3-day siege on the fort at township No. 4. The residents of this Connecticut River community will begin celebrating this historic occasion July 25 and continue with a number of festivities including a battle reenactment, blueberry festival, parade, and several church suppers. 
Two hundred fifty years ago, the Connecticut River Valley had only a few settlers scattered along the banks of the river. Township No. 4 would eventually become Charlestown, NH, the northwestern-most English-speaking village in New England. The settlers of this agricultural community were isolated, but still a vital link with towns to the south as they strove to build a strong community on the river banks. To the west and north of the settlement lay only lush mountains and forests, inhabited by moose, bears, native Americans, and a few French trappers. 
The people of Township No. 4 were trapped in a hostile environment when King George's war began. The pioneers decided to defend themselves by connecting the five existing houses together, and later added a sixth. The inhabitants of the fort at No. 4, which included a small militia of 30 volunteers, fought day and night to protect their homes and refused to surrender to an enemy force claiming to be 700 strong. During the 3-day siege their defenses were never breached. 
Two hundred fifty years later, an authentic reconstruction of the original 1744 fortified settlement sits on the site of the Siege of '47. The fort at No. 4 is one of the only living history museums in New England dedicated to preserving the 1740's and 1750's. The museum captures the spirit of those pioneers who cleared the rough landscape and made way for homes and farms in northern New England. The residents of Charlestown have kept a piece of history for all of the children of New Hampshire and the Nation to see, capturing the rich significance of the settlements along the Connecticut River Valley. 
Charlestown's residents today serve to better their community in the true New Hampshire spirit. They serve in professional, semiprofessional, and service occupations and are still willing to dedicate their time and talents on behalf of their neighbors. 
I congratulate all of the residents of Charlestown, NH, on this historic event as they continue in the tradition of their ancestors to make the lives of their community a better place to live. I am honored to represent all of them in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today the Senate is debating an aptly titled bill, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. The working families of today face more challenges than their parents and grandparents could have imagined. In addition to providing for their children, parents want to balance the other demands on their time--parent-teacher conferences, little league games, doctor appointments, car pools--but have little flexibility. 
The family friendly workplace will give employees the opportunity to adjust their work hours to take advantage of paid time off during the workday. It is a short, simple bill that would extend to the private sector the same benefits already enjoyed by public employees for almost 20 years. First, it will allow hourly workers the ability to bank extra time which could be taken as paid time off. Second, the measure will give employees and employers the ability to work out a flexible scheduling arrangement. Sound simple enough? Surprisingly, these common-sense practices are now prohibited under current law. 
The only explanation I can find for the opposition to this proposal is the flurry of misinformation that surrounds this debate. For instance, I have received a few letters in my office from Washington labor organizations, which reveal their unfortunate misunderstanding of this bill. One letter states, `S. 4 contains no penalty to punish employers who force workers to take compensatory time off if the workers want, instead, to receive premium pay at the time-and-a-half rate, after they work in excess of 40 hours during a week.' This claim is false. Not only are these options 100 percent voluntary for the employee, but, in addition to protections that already exist under the Fair Labor Standards Act [FLSA], S. 4 establishes further prohibitions against employee coercion in the voluntary acceptance of comptime. Intimidation is outlawed. Another letter I received argues that `the enactment of a less effective FLSA would jeopardize worker safety and health as employees are forced to accept excessively long and hazardous overtime assignments without pay fearing loss of future employment opportunities * * *' This claim is untrue. Let me repeat--these options are 100 percent voluntary for the employee. 
I am also confused by arguments my colleagues have made against this measure. One amendment the opponents may offer would expand the Family and Medical Leave Act to grant workers up to 24 hours of unpaid leave to participate in their child's school activities. They point to a poll that found that 86 percent of the American public favor legislation that would allow workers unpaid leave to attend parent-teacher conferences. Did the poll ask Americans if they would like paid leave for these educational purposes? I also find this amendment puzzling since the first argument I hear from labor groups is that workers cannot afford to take compensatory time off since they rely on their overtime pay. I agree that many workers would not take the comptime option because they prefer additional pay. But if extra pay is their first priority, why would they be so anxious to take unpaid leave? 
Furthermore, opponents cite the position of various women's organizations in Washington who have come out against this bill. Like many inside-the-beltway groups, they seem to have fallen out of step with the average working woman, since several studies contradict their opposition. For example, a study conducted by the Employment Policy Foundation reveals that women are far more eager to trade income for leisure--among women earning $750 a week, women are more than twice as likely as men to choose `fewer hours for less pay.' Second, a recent poll by Money magazine found that 66 percent of the American people would rather have their overtime in the form of time off, rather than cash wages, and 82 percent said they support the Republican-backed comptime bills. Also worth noting is the endorsement of the Family Friendly Workplace Act by Working Woman and Working Mother magazines. 
Even more perplexing is the President's failure to recognize the special needs of working women by refusing to allow comptime in exchange for overtime pay. While overtime pay is invaluable to many workers, nearly three out of four workers reporting overtime pay are men. In fact, overtime pay is most commonly reported in industries which are heavily dominated by men--manufacturing (73%), mining and construction (95%), and transportation (88%). Of the small number of women who work in mining and construction, only 5 percent worked overtime in 1996, while 95 percent of men did. The President's commitment to defeating this proposal will disproportionately harm women. 
While these polls and statistics are helpful and revealing, I need go no further than my home State to be convinced of the value of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. One engineering firm in New Hampshire, for instance, uses a complicated formula to allow employees every other Friday off. But the complexity of their current system is exactly why they would prefer the passage of S. 4. If there is any doubt that this flextime is appealing to employees, this company, like many in the highly competitive technology industry, advertises their existing flexible week as an incentive when seeking out technical expertise. Any Senator who represents an area like the Northeast, which has a large technology presence, can understand how competitive the recruiting can be. The flex week is so appealing to potential employees, firms highlight it in their ads in an effort to outbid their competitors. 
Because of the false claims, inconsistency, and bias against women, I reject the arguments against the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It is time that these options are enjoyed by all American workers, not just Federal employees. I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this commonsense legislation, and vote to invoke cloture. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in paying tribute to the distinguished President pro tempore of the Senate, the senior Senator from South Carolina, Senator Strom Thurmond. 
Senator Thurmond was born at the dawn of the 20th century, on December 5, 1902, at Edgefield, SC. He has lived nearly every day of this tumultuous century. 
Mr. President, I take particular interest and pride in Senator Thurmond's early career. After graduating from Clemson University in 1923, Senator Thurmond embarked on 6 years of service as a public school teacher and athletic coach. Mr. President, that is how I began my own career after my own graduation from college. 
Senator Thurmond subsequently served as his home county's superintendent of education from 1929 to 1933. 
Having studied law at night under the tutelage of his father, Senator Thurmond became a member of the South Carolina Bar in 1930. He was a city attorney and county attorney from 1930 to 1938. 
In 1933, Strom Thurmond was elected State senator, an office that he held until 1938. He next served as a South Carolina circuit judge from 1938 to 1946. 
It has been my honor, Mr. President, to have served on the Armed Services Committee with Senator Thurmond since I was elected to the Senate in 1990 and, for the past more than two years, under his able leadership as chairman. Given that connection, I want to call special attention to Senator Thurmond's heroic service in World War II. 
Mr. President, in June, 1944, Strom Thurmond volunteered to participate in D-day by parachuting into France, but was told that he was too old. Instead, then-Judge Thurmond, age 41, participated in the Normandy Invasion by landing with members of the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment, 82d Airborne Division. 
Ultimately, Strom Thurmond was awarded 5 battle stars and 18 decorations, medals, and awards, including the Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star Medal with `V,' the Purple Heart, the Belgian Order of the Crown, and the French Croix de Guerre. 
After World War II, Mr. President, Strom Thurmond served as the Governor of South Carolina from 1947 to 1951. He was the States' rights Democratic nominee for President in 1948. He carried 4 States, receiving 39 electoral votes. 
Following his service as Governor of his beloved state, Strom Thurmond practiced law in Aiken, SC, from 1951 to 1955. 
Mr. President, Strom Thurmond was elected to the U.S. Senate as a write-in candidate in 1954. He resigned in 1956, in the words of his official biography, in order `to place the office in a primary, pursuant to a promise to the people during the 1954 campaign.' 
Subsequently, of course, Mr. President, Strom Thurmond was elected to the Senate in 1956, and reelected in 1960, 1966, 1972, 1978, 1984, 1990, and 1996. He has spoken of retirement after his current term, which will end after Senator Thurmond's 100th birthday on December 2, 2002. I am sure that I am not alone when I say that I hope that he will reconsider. 
Mr. President, it has been my honor and privilege to serve in the U.S. Senate with Senator Strom Thurmond for the past more than 6 years. I respect him, I admire him, and I value his friendship. I look forward to continuing to serve with him, under his leadership as President pro tempore of the Senate and as the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, for many years to come. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Henry P. Johnson of Meriden, NH, retired plant manager of Dorr Woolen Co., for his exceptional service as a volunteer executive in Krasnador, Russia. 
Henry worked on a volunteer mission with the International Executive Service Corps, a nonprofit organization that sends retired Americans to assist businesses and private enterprises in the developing world and the new emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. 
Henry helped provide technical and managerial leadership to improve the lives of the citizens of Krasnador, Russia. He assisted Kubantex, a textile company, to set up a business and marketing plans. Henry was an `international volunteer' for our Nation and has represented our strong democratic beliefs and practices of a free-market economy. 
His spectacular display of voluntarism provided active assistance for people in need and helped to build strong ties of respect and trust between America and Russia. Henry's mission will help to end the cycle of dependency on foreign assistance, by fostering private sector involvement in international development. 
I commend Henry for his dedicated service and I am proud to represent him in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the New Hampshire delegates who represented the Granite State at the National Summit on Volunteerism in Philadelphia from April 27 through April 29. The 3-day summit focused on the challenges facing our Nation's children and youth, and encouraged Americans to dedicate their time and talents to communities and children. It was organized on the suggestion that America's young people have access to five fundamental resources. These resources include an ongoing relationship with an adult, safe places during nonschool hours to learn, a healthy start, a skill through effective education, and the opportunity to give back through community service. 
I would like today to honor the individuals from my State who gave their time and energy so our children can remain safe and strong. They are: Amy McGlashan of New Hampshire College and University Council, Daniel Forbes of St. Anselm College, Carlos Agudelo of the ALPHA Alliance, Regis Lemaire of the Office of Youth Services, David Fish of the United Parcel Service, Darlene E. Schmidt of CFX Bank, Joshua Morse of Southern New Hampshire Services, JoAnn St. Pierre of the Voluntary Action Center, Ann Puglielli of St. Anselm College, Richard Shannon of New Hampshire Catholic Charities, Susan Gilbert of Manchester, Suzanne Carbon of the Grafton County Family Court, Catie Doucette of the White Mountain School, Ed Farrell of the White Mountain School, Dick Fowler of the Division of Children and Youth Services, Katie Kelley of the Pathfinders Program, Theresa Kennett of Kennett High School, Bruce Labs of Woodsville High School, Sara Lang of Woodsville High School, Mike Purcell of White Mountain Mental Health, Lynn Wheeler of Nighswander, Lord and Martin, Debbie Tasker of the Dover Adult Learning Center, Bernie Mucci of Tyco International Ltd., Elise Klysa of the Timberland Corp., Ron Borelli of Aavid Thermal Technologies Inc., Karen Brown of Channel 9 News, Chris Gallagher of the Corporation for National Service, Sidney Swartz of the Timberland Corp., and Ken Freitas of the Timberland Corp. 
Each and every delegate from the State of New Hampshire has achieved success in effective citizen service. They are experienced in creating opportunities for others to contribute to solutions, and have a record of getting things done. Above all, they are trusted by others in their community and for that they can be very proud. 
The summit proved to be beneficial. The representatives from New Hampshire combined their efforts with delegates from Delaware. They came up with creative plans to bring adults and college students into Manchester's public schools together to help establish a mentoring program. The New Hampshire delegates will meet again in the summer to review this proposal and the other ideas they collected and decide how to use them. 
I commend the New Hampshire delegates on their willingness to help make the Granite State a better place to live, and to ignite the spirit of volunteerism to provide a strong foundation for America's youth. New Hampshire is fortunate to be blessed by their leadership and dedication. I applaud them for their outstanding work, and am proud to represent all of them in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. Smith of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Donald Hall, poet, essayist, and playwright, for being the 16th recipient of Plymouth State College Robert Frost Contemporary American Award. I commend his outstanding achievement and compliment him on this well-deserved honor. 
Donald is internationally known for his poetry and prose. He and his wife Jane, a late poet, too, moved to Wilmot in 1975. Their family homestead, Eagle Pond Farm, has provided him much inspiration for many of his works. 
Donald was a Guggenheim fellow in 1963-1964 and 1972-1973, and poet laureate of New Hampshire from 1984 to 1989. He was elected to the National Institute and the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1989. His book of poetry, `The One Day,' won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Award the same year. In 1994, Donald received the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize. 
His first book of poems, `Exiles and Marriages,' was written in 1955. Among other prose works are `String Too Short To Be Saved,' `Henry Moore,' `Writing Well,' `Their Ancient Glittering Eyes,' and `Ox Cart Man.' His recent works include `Old and New Poems', which was published in 1990 and `The Old Life' published in 1996. 
The Frost award is given in honor of Robert Frost, a late poet laureate who taught at Plymouth Normal School in 1911-1912. The Plymouth State Alumni Association inaugurated the award in 1970 to recognize northern New Englanders who exemplified Frost's traits of individuality, hard work, humanitarianism, and devotion to the Granite State. 
Mr. President, I want to congratulate Donald for his outstanding accomplishment. I am proud to represent him in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to voice my concerns about the budget resolution we debate here today. Since the announcement of a budget deal earlier this month, I have carefully examined the plan, contemplated its effect on our economy and the future of our children, and pondered the advice of many. I have also observed the floor debate and statements of my colleagues, and have heard the views of many of my constituents in New Hampshire. After much deliberation, I must oppose this budget. 
While I do not support the resolution, I would like to commend my colleagues who have worked so hard to try to craft a good plan. I appreciate their efforts and the difficult discussions they have endured. Most importantly, I realize that negotiating with the White House is no easy task. However, my concerns about the deficit, the exploding growth of entitlements, and the huge tax burden on Americans, far outweigh the temptation of a politically appealing agreement with the President. History has taught us that the most politically expedient solution is not always good for Americans. 
What happened to the Republican Congress that came into town in 1995, ready to attack the problems in our economy that had been ignored for decades? Where is the spirit of dedication that accompanied our success and the commitment to our principles that led to our win? Where are those voices that denounced Washington's business as usual? I cannot answer these questions, but I do know that we should not disappoint the voters who trusted us. 
For a minute, allow me to set aside the rhetoric that surrounds this debate and look at the facts. Fact 1: Under the plan, the era of big government is not over. This budget deal proposes to spend $5 billion more than even President Clinton requested for fiscal year 1998. In fact, spending for 1998 increases about $70 billion from 1997--a bigger increase than any budget passed by Democrat-controlled Congresses in recent years. Over 5 years, this plan spends $189 billion more than Congress proposed in last year's budget resolution. The so-called savings that have been celebrated by proponents are just reductions from the inflation-adjusted baseline that rises each year. 
Fact 2: All the pain is in the out-years. Since Congress revisits the budget resolution every year, we cannot count on anything past 1998 and we have no assurance that the cuts in spending will ever be achieved in 2001 and 2002. At the very least, we must cease the fairy tale rhetoric about savings that will be achieved over the next decade. 
Fact 3: The deficit goes up! While the deficit for this year is projected to be $67 billion, under this plan, it is estimated to grow to $90 billion for the next 2 years and then drop slightly to $83 billion in 2000. Not until 2001, does the deficit drop to below today's level. If we can reduce the deficit from $53 billion in 2001 to 0 in 2002, why can't we reduce it by $53 billion this year? Furthermore, the deficit reduction is due, in large part, to suspicious economic assumptions. Overnight, the Congressional Budget Office discovered a $225 billion `fiscal dividend' of new tax revenues that may or may not be realized in the out-years. 
Fact 4: The tax cuts will not provide noticeable relief. While we must vote on the spending increases now, we have but a skeleton of a commitment on tax relief for Americans--legislation which won't be discussed until next month. Since we have already promised away $35 billion for the President's education credit, the tax writing committees are left with very little room to accommodate the equally important capital gains tax reductions, death tax reform, the $500 per child tax credit, expansion of individual retirement accounts [IRA's] and other relief provisions. For instance, $100 billion would not even cover the full $500 credit. These restrictions will produce scaled-down, phased-in, and barely noticeable adjustments. 
Fact 5: The proposal contains no real entitlement reform. This budget proposes $115 billion in Medicare savings, but does absolutely nothing to fundamentally restructure the ailing program. In fact, the biggest reform is an accounting change that we condemned as a `gimmick' just last year--and rightly so. Worse yet, the plan wipes out many of the real reforms we enacted in last year's welfare reform legislation by restoring welfare payments to legal immigrants and expanding Food Stamp work slots. 
Fact 6: The budget deal protects additional money for Presidential priorities, but no programs are terminated. While the resolution guarantees that spending will go up for programs such as Head Start and bilingual education, there is not one word about reforming or eliminating arts funding, AmeriCorps, or corporate welfare programs. Since total discretionary spending increases in this legislation, I hold out little hope that wasteful spending programs will be tackled this year. 
A legitimate balanced budget plan should shrink the size of Government, reduce the deficit, and reform entitlement programs. The budget must be accompanied by a credible tax package that includes complete repeal of the estate tax; a 50 percent cut in the capital gains tax rate; an immediate $500 per child tax credit available to all, regardless of income; and creation of an `IRA-Plus' plan. These tax cuts should be financed by reducing spending, not increasing other taxes. 
Although this plan contains many serious flaws, it is my hope that we can renegotiate a plan that meets but one condition: it must be a good deal for Americans. In its current form, I cannot, in good conscience, support this budget resolution.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the New Hampshire delegates who represented the Granite State at the National Summit on Voluntarism in Philadelphia from April 27 through April 29. The 3-day summit focused on the challenges facing our Nation's children and youth, and encouraged Americans to dedicate their time and talents to communities and children. It was organized on the suggestion that America's young people have access to five fundamental resources. These resources include an ongoing relationship with an adult, safe places during nonschool hours to learn, a healthy start, a skill through effective education, and the opportunity to give back through community service. 
I would like today to honor the individuals from my state who gave their time and energy so our children can remain safe and strong. They are: Amy McGlashan of New Hampshire College and University Council, Daniel Forbes of St. Anselm College, Carlos Agudelo of the ALPHA Alliance, Regis Lemaire of the Office of Youth Services, David Fish of the United Parcel Service, Darlene E. Schmidt of CFX Bank, Joshua Morse of Southern New Hampshire Services, JoAnn St. Pierre of the Voluntary Action Center, Ann Puglielli of St. Anselm College, Richard Shannon of New Hampshire Catholic Charities, Susan Gilbert of Manchester, Suzanne Carbon of the Grafton County Family Court, Catie Doucette of the White Mountain School, Ed Farrell of the White Mountain School, Dick Fowler of the Division of Children and Youth Services, Katie Kelley of the Pathfinders Program, Theresa Kennett of Kennett High School, Bruce Labs of Woodsville High School, Sara Lang of Woodsville High School, Mike Purcell of White Mountain Mental Health, Lynn Wheeler of Nighswander, Lord & Martin, Debbie Tasker of the Dover Adult Learning Center, Bernie Mucci of Tyco International Ltd., Elise Klysa of the Timberland Corp., Ron Borelli of Aavid Thermal Technologies Inc., Karen Brown of Channel 9 News, Chris Gallagher of the Corporation for National Service, Sidney Swartz of the Timberland Corp., and Ken Freitas of the Timberland Corp.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1122, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997. 
Mr. President, it has been nearly 2 years since I first introduced the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in the Senate. At that time, only my distinguished colleague, Senator Gramm of Texas, joined me as an original cosponsor. We have come a long, long way since that time. We are not there yet, but we have made tremendous progress. 
When the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act first passed the Senate on December 7, 1995, it did so with the support of 54 Senators. When the Senate voted on whether to override President Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act on September 26, 1996, 57 Senators voted in favor of the bill. 
Today, we believe that we have at least 62 Senators who are prepared to vote for this legislation. We remain several votes short of the 67 votes that we will need to override President Clinton's promised veto of this bill, but we are getting closer. I am hopeful that in the wake of yesterday's dramatic announcement that the American Medical Association has endorsed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997, we will get there. 
Mr. President, one of the principal reasons why we are making so much progress in the Senate toward our goal of outlawing partial-birth abortion is that more and more Senators are realizing that the opposition to this bill in the last Congress was built on a foundation of lies. When I use the word `lies,' Mr. President, I am using the very word that one of the Nation's leading abortion industry lobbyists--Ron Fitzsimmons--used when he publicly admitted earlier this year that he `lied through [his] teeth' when he helped orchestrate the campaign against the partial-birth abortion ban legislation in the last Congress. 
In an interview published in the New York Times on February 27, 1997, and in an article published in the American Medical News on March 3, 1997, Mr. Fitzsimmons made the surprisingly candid admission that he had `lied' when he claimed that partial-birth abortions are rare. In those same interviews, Mr. Fitzsimmons also conceded that he `lied' when he claimed that partial-birth abortions are performed only on women whose lives are endangered or whose unborn children are severely disabled. `It made me physically ill,' Mr. Fitzsimmons told his interviewer. `I told my wife the next day, `I can't do this again.' 
In seeking to justify his veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act last year, the New York Times points out, `President Clinton echoed the argument of Mr. Fitzsimmons.' In other words, in justifying his veto, Mr. Clinton relied on the same statements of `fact' that have now been conceded by a key leader of the abortion industry to be `lies.' 
The truth, Mr. Fitzsimmons told the New York Times, is that `[i]n the vast majority of cases, the [partial-birth abortion] procedure is performed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 or more weeks along.' And, as Mr. Fitzsimmons told the American Medical News, `[t]he abortion-rights folks know it, the anti-abortion folks know it, and so, probably, does everybody else.' Except, Mr. Fitzsimmons might have added, for President Clinton, who still promises to veto this bill even though the reasons he gave to justify his previous veto have turned out to be `lies.' 
Mr. President, following Mr. Fitzsimmons's startling revelations, on March 4, 1997, the Washington Post ran an unusually blunt editorial entitled `Lies and Late-Term Abortions.' After recounting Mr. Fitzsimmons' lies and his candid admissions that he lied, the Post editorial drew the following conclusion:  
Mr. Fitzsimmons's revelation is a sharp blow to the credibility of his allies. These late-term abortions are extremely difficult to justify, if they can be justified at all. Usually pro-choice legislators such as Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Representatives Richard Gephardt and Susan Molinari voted for the ban last year. Opponents of the ban fought hard, even demanding a roll call vote on their motion to ban charts describing the procedure from the House floor. They lost. And they lost by wide margins when the House and Senate voted for the ban. They probably will lose again this year when the ban is reconsidered. And this time, Mr. Clinton will be hard-pressed to justify a veto on the basis of the misinformation on which he rested his case last time. 
There you have it, Mr. President. One of the abortion industry's most prominent leaders has admitted that the case against the partial-birth abortion ban was based on `lies.' Not my word, his word--`lies.' The New York Times points out that in attempting to justify his veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, President Clinton `echoed' those lies. And the Washington Post points out, in a great understatement, that President Clinton will be `hard-pressed' to base another veto on Mr. Fitzsimmons's and his friends' `misinformation.' 
Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist George Will drew the following conclusion in an opinion article published on April 24, 1997, in the Washington Post: 
The accusation that President Clinton cares deeply about nothing is refuted by his tenacious and guileful battle to prevent any meaningful limits on the form of infanticide known as partial-birth abortion. However, that battle proves that his professed desire to make abortion `rare' applies only to the fourth trimester of pregnancies. 
Mr. President, even though President Clinton seems bound and determined not to take another look at his stand on partial-birth abortion even in the face of Mr. Fitzsimmons's stunning admissions, I urge my colleagues who voted against this bill in the last Congress to do just that--take 
another look. Many, if not most, of you voted against this bill because you believed Mr. Fitzsimmons and his friends when they told you that partial-birth abortions are rare and they are only done on women facing grave physical threats or whose unborn children are hopelessly deformed. I urge you to take another look, reconsider your position, and on reconsideration, support us. Partial-birth abortions aren't `rare'--they're common--and they are done, in the overwhelming majority of cases, on perfectly healthy women with perfectly healthy unborn children. 
Mr. President, aside from the Fitzsimmons revelations, I believe that another reason why the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act continues to attract greater and greater support in the Senate is that Senators are coming to realize that this issue really transcends abortion. Indeed, as one Senator who did not vote for this bill the first time, but supported us on the veto override last year, Senator Moynihan, put it, partial-birth abortion is `too close to infanticide.' That was a starkly truthful way to put it, Mr. President, and it took courage for Senator Moynihan to say it. I commend him for it. 
Mr. President, another Senator who did not support this bill the first time around, but who also joined us on the veto override vote, Senator Specter, also believes that partial-birth abortion is more like infanticide than it is abortion. Listen to what Senator Specter had to say on the Senate floor on September 26, 1996. `In my legal judgment,' Senator Specter said, `the medical act or acts of commission or omission in interfering with, or not facilitating the completion of a live birth after a child is partially out of the mother's womb constitute infanticide.' `The line of the law is drawn, in my legal judgment,' Senator Specter concluded, `when the child is partially out of the womb of the mother. It is no longer abortion; it is infanticide.' 
Once again, Mr. President, those are strong words and they are truthful words. Senator Specter is a pro-choice Senator, and it took courage for him to support this bill. But he did so, again, Mr. President, because he recognized that partial-birth abortion is more like infanticide than it is abortion. 
So, Mr. President, we are steadily picking up more and more support in the Senate because, as I have argued here today, more and more Senators are realizing that the case against this bill was built on a foundation of what are now conceded to have been `lies.' We are also picking up greater and greater support because more and more Senators are realizing that this issue transcends abortion--that the tiny little human being whom we are talking about is a partially born baby who is just inches from drawing her first breath. 
To those Senators who are still considering joining the ever-increasing majority of Senators who support the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, let me address a few more comments to you. Perhaps the Nation's most respected and revered doctor--`America's Doctor'--is the former Surgeon General of the United States, C. Everett Koop. I am particularly proud of Dr. Koop because he is a part-time resident of my home State of New Hampshire. 
This is what Dr. Koop has to say: `Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility. On the contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to both her immediate health and future fertility.' We all know that Dr. Koop is not a man who uses words lightly. On the contrary, Dr. Koop is a doctor who chooses his words with care and precision. Listen to those words again: `Partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or future fertility.' 
Now, of course, Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, even the American Medical Association, which is pro-choice on abortion, has endorsed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. So, my colleagues, if you are worried about protecting women, listen to the words of Dr. Koop and listen to the American Medical Association. They are for the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act because partial-birth abortion is never necessary to protect a woman's health. 
Finally, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues who are still undecided about this bill to look at it in light of our beloved Nation's history. We all know those beautiful and majestic words that Thomas Jefferson wrote for our Declaration of Independence: `We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of happiness.' 
Mr. President, one does not have to agree with my view that human life begins at conception to see that a living baby who is in the process of being born has, in Jefferson's words, been endowed by her creator with the unalienable right to life. Can anyone seriously doubt where that great American, Thomas Jefferson, would stand on that question? 
Mr. President, another of America's greatest leaders, Abraham Lincoln, made one of the most dramatic and prophetic statements of his life in a speech that he delivered on June 16, 1858. In that speech, Abraham Lincoln said `I believe this government cannot endure permanently, half slave and half free.' Today, Mr. President, as we debate this Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in this great Capitol of the Union that Lincoln saved, I would say this: The moral foundation of this Government cannot endure permanently when even the half born are not free to live. Can anyone, Mr. President, really doubt where that moral giant, Abraham Lincoln, would have stood on the question before us here today? 
Mr. President, let us rise to the moral level to which our Nation's history calls us. Let us recognize the unalienable, God-given right to life of the partially born. Let us protect the partially born from a brutal death. Let us be worthy of the Nation that Jefferson helped create and that Lincoln surely saved. Let us pass the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act with a two-thirds' majority in the Senate and then dare President Clinton to turn his back on the moral legacy of Jefferson and Lincoln.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Alex Henlin, a Bishop Guertin High School senior, on winning the American Legion's National Oratorical Contest. This is certainly an accomplishment of which he should be very proud and I salute him for his achievement. 
Alex, 18, resides in Dracut, MA. He is president of his senior class and plans to study government next fall at Georgetown University. He was one of the State's representatives to the American Legion's 1996 Boys' Nation conference in Washington. 
His speech, `A More Perfect Union,' reported the U.S. Constitution as being a versatile, living document able to address unforseen circumstances. Alex warned that amendments should not be created to address trivial issues. As a former history teacher, I admire and commend Alex's commitment to our Nation's most precious document. 
Alex brought home an $18,000 college scholarship in addition to a $2,000 scholarship he received from the State contest. The national contest was hosted by Indiana University and Purdue University in Indianapolis. 
I congragulate Alex Henlin on his outstanding accomplishments. I commend his hard work and perserverance and wish him luck at Georgetown in the fall semester.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Hollis/Brookline High School math team members who recently took first place in the small school division at the New Hampshire State Mathematics Contest. 
As a former teacher myself, I commend their teamwork and talent which helped the 14-member squad oust 48 other teams for the State title and top the 19-team NH-SMASH league. 
Math team adviser Vina Duffy also deserves special recognition for giving the team an organized and supporting approach to math. She encouraged the students' interest and animated the diverse group to strengthen their aptitude. The team had no formal practice, and had only worksheets to prepare them for the meets. Their congeniality and confidence grew with the number of wins they achieved. 
I would like to honor math team members: Karl Athony, Dave Clark, Tyler Dumont, Michel Franklin, Mary Fries, Jason Glastetter, Jason Kerouac, Eric Larose, Bert Lue, James Robson, Jared Rosenberg, Steve Watkins, and Matt White. 
Mr. President, I want to congratulate these outstanding young minds for their excellent performance and team-spirit and I am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania for his very kind remarks, and want to join many of my colleagues in applauding his efforts on this issue the way that he has pursued this, I think in fairness and in looking for every opportunity to proceed along this course which basically, as we all know, is the taking of innocent life. And Senator Santorum has stood up for those innocent children, time and time again on the floor. 
I do know what it feels like to do that, but you know, when you look back in the great debates of history--and this is one of the great debates of history; it will be so judged, I will say to my colleagues--it will be judged up there with the debate on slavery and other great moral issues of our time, which some say we ought not to be debating here on the floor. But the truth of the matter is, this is a very appropriate place to debate these kinds of things. 
Slavery was wrong. It was morally wrong. And people stood up against the popular tide at the time and opposed it. Because they did, slavery was ended. 
I sincerely hope--and I know that there has been enough rhetoric said on all sides of this issue to make everybody tired of it, I am sure. And I do not intend to be loud. I like to try to be as quiet and unassuming, but firm, as I can. 
As I sat here listening this afternoon, and also as I have listened to so much of it on the monitor over the last day, I could not help but wonder what those who have been the victims of abortion would say if they could vote. They cannot. 
Some of our constituents who disagree with us or agree with us, whatever the case may be, have the opportunity to so judge you at election time, but not--not--the victims that we are talking about in this debate, which is somewhat ironic to say the least. 
And I know that I have seen pictures from both sides of the debate presented from those children who were born because a young woman had another opportunity to have a child and also from those children who were born because a young woman did not have an abortion. So I have seen the pictures. But, Mr. President, I go beyond pictures. 
I had the opportunity about a year-and-a-half ago to be at an event where a young woman--I will not use her name--but she was aborted in the eighth month by her mother, and she survived. And she was a 22-year-old young woman who had a slight disability as a result of the procedure. Other than that, she had nothing wrong with her. The abortion that this young child was the victim of was purely for convenience. 
Now, that is not the debate here--and I do not mean that it is on the Daschle amendment--but she was aborted. And to listen to her, Mr. President, stand before an audience of probably 800 to 1,000 people, say, No. 1, `I forgive my mother. And she is my mother,' she said, and, No. 2, listening to her sing `Amazing Grace'--now, if you want something to tear at your heartstrings, endure that. I have. But that is nothing as to what this young woman endured. 
I remember her testifying here before congressional committees where she was taunted by Members of Congress. We all know that story. And I bring that up to simply make the point that these are innocent children, the most innocent of society, unborn, but still children. 
I remember engaging in a dialog with one of my colleagues earlier on this issue--and it is a tough issue; there is no question about it--but this person--and I will not mention the name; it is not necessary; the record speaks for itself--but this person indicated that they felt that they looked at the issue and did not feel there was viability in these young months, therefore, there was not life. And I guess I would simply respond by saying: I started at conception. 
If there is anybody out here that did not, I would like to hear from them. But I started at conception. I do not know of any way to get where I am now without starting at conception. Now, if there is a way, I would like somebody to tell me what it is. 
The truth of the matter is, no matter how you define these terms--you can say `fetus,' you can talk about `viability,' and `medical procedure' and `abortion,' you can talk about all these words--but it boils down to children, innocent, unborn children. 
And in the case of partial-birth abortion, I might make the point, as Senator Moynihan has done, that it is probably children, born children, and borders on infanticide. Senator Moynihan is a very respected individual in this body, and one who does, by his own admission, call himself pro-choice, and I believe, unless he has changed his mind--I do not think he has--supports the ban on the partial-birth abortions. 
So, Mr. President, I would just like to preface my remarks by, again, making the point that we are talking about real children here, children who have no say, no opportunity to be heard. 
And, again, I would just ask my colleagues to reflect, as we have these next few votes on this issue, to think about that. They cannot vote against us. They cannot vote for us. They cannot criticize us. They cannot say anything. And they will never get the opportunity. And you know, I cannot help but wonder. I think about this a lot. I do not know. There are some 20 million-plus children that have been aborted, not partial-birth abortions. 
But let us just take partial-birth abortions. We know there have been thousands who have been aborted through this process. So let us focus on that group. 
How many children in that group may have grown up to be a President of the United States, a Senator, a doctor who maybe finds the cure for cancer, a teacher who perhaps saves a dozen, 15, 20 children during the course of his or her teaching career, saving these children from going astray, 
a clergyman who saves a soul? How many people, how many people would there be in that group? We will never know. We will never know. 
That is the issue, Mr. President. I hope as we continue this debate--and I know it is tough--I hope we can separate all of this rhetoric and all of the harsh words and the hard feelings, just put that aside and think about what we are really thinking about here, an unborn child--yes, created at conception, at some point along the way, denied the access to life, to being born. That is the issue. 
Now, I know how hard my colleague from South Dakota has struggled with this issue because we have talked, and I respect him very much and he knows that. I had to think long and hard and very carefully about what the Senator proposed to do. He is my friend. I cannot understand the amendment. I want to make some points about this amendment that I think perhaps the Senator has not thought about--I do not know if that is true or not. There have been a lot of things said out here, and it is probably unlikely there is something he has not thought about. 
I believe this amendment, as presented by the Senator from South Dakota, represents, even though it is not intended, an extremist position on this issue, on the abortion issue, because the Daschle substitute amendment explicitly permits abortions even in the 7th, 8th, and 9th month of pregnancy, so long as the abortion claims, `Continuation of the pregnancy would risk grievous injury to the mother.' 
Think about that, Mr. President. Babies in the 7th, 8th, and 9th month have already developed to the point where they can survive. In fact, babies can survive even earlier than that, survive in the sense that I mean survive outside the body of their mother. They can survive independently. 
Then let me ask this question, for anybody who may be undecided, and there probably are not many, if any. If you have a child that can live independently of the mother, why abort it? Why not deliver the baby alive? By definition, abortion means taking the life of a child. Why do we have to do that? Why do we have to take the life of a child? 
I am not a doctor and I do not pretend to be, but I do listen to medical advice and medical comments. I listen to the point of view of a group called the Physicians Ad Hoc Coalition for Truth, an organization of 600 doctors nationwide who have been providing an enormous public service by working to get the true medical facts out about partial-birth abortions. In a statement they issued on May 12 of this year, they said, as follows: `If maternal conditions require the emptying of the womb'--and these are not my words; these are the words of physicians--`If maternal conditions require the emptying of the womb postviability, the standard would be to induce labor and deliver the child. By definition, the postviable child delivered early is simply a premature baby. Senator Daschle's legislation never addresses the reason why it may ever be necessary to kill a premature baby, including those in the process of being born,' as is the case in partial-birth abortion, `in order to preserve the health of the woman.' 
The Catholic Diocese in Sioux Falls, SD, Reverend Carlson, made a statement saying, `The substitute bill allows abortions, including partial-birth abortion procedures in the last weeks of pregnancy, because in the case of certain serious illnesses a physician may have to `terminate' a pregnancy after viability to save the mother, yet in such cases a physician can simply deliver the child. Nothing in the medical literature indicates a need to abort or kill a child in such cases.' 
See, that is the issue here. By definition, you are saying `viability.' Viability by definition means that the child can survive outside the body of the mother. Then why kill the child? 
Mr. President, let me repeat the latter part of the statement that was made by these physicians. The Daschle legislation never addresses the reason why it may ever be necessary to kill a premature baby, including those in the process of being born in order to preserve the health of a woman. It does not address that. That is the flaw, the main flaw, as I see it, in the amendment, as well-intended as it is. 
I remember having a debate with one of my colleagues a couple of years ago when I was out managing this same bill. It was very interesting, and I ask Members to reflect for a moment. We all know in the partial-birth-abortion procedure, first of all, it does not always happen in the 7th, 8th, and 9th month. Sometimes it happens earlier than that, and, of course, the Daschle amendment would not protect those children. 
I remember in the debate having a very interesting dialog with one of my colleagues in which I pointed out that in order to ensure the opportunity to take a child's life through partial-birth abortion, you have to turn the child in the womb and deliver the child breach, or feet first, and in the process, stop the child's head from coming into the world. Now, my colleague that I was debating said, `That is fine. That child is not born yet because the head is still in the birth canal.' I said, `OK, I do not agree, but fine. Let me turn it around. 
What happens if the child comes into the birth canal head first and only 10 percent of the body comes into the world, for example, just the head?' And the answer was, `That is life, that is life.' 
So now what we have done is define a certain part of the baby's body as being life and another part of the baby's body as not. There is no logic here. There is absolutely no logic here. I am not trying to sensationalize this. These are facts. You turn the child around because if the baby is born head first, you cannot use the needle and destroy the child. So 10 percent in the world, head first, it is a child according to the critics; 90 percent in the world, feet first, it is not. Does anybody really believe that? Does anybody really in here, never mind up here, in here, does anybody believe that? If you believe that, you ought to vote against the partial-birth abortion ban; you ought to vote for Daschle if you really believe that. 
Why is it necessary, ever, to kill a premature baby? That question has not been answered yet in this debate, including those in the process of being born in order to preserve the health of a woman. How does it help the health of a woman to restrain a child from coming the rest of the way through the birth canal--that is what a partial-birth abortion is, restraining a child from coming into the world so you can kill it. That is the purpose. 
As Senator Moynihan said, it is bordering on infanticide. Indeed, it probably is infanticide. This is not abortion. It is probably misnamed. It is killing a child in the hands of the doctor. Nothing impersonal about this one. There are many impersonal ways to commit abortions. We all know, we have all heard about them. Nothing impersonal about this one. You are holding the child in your hand when you do it. 
With all the problems we have in the world and in our country--you name it, race problems, poverty problems, problems of protecting ourselves and national defense, anything, all the problems we have, infrastructure--do we really want to spend time doing this to our children? Do we? 
In May 1997, in the Washington Post, and again on the Senate floor, Senator Daschle said every effort should be made to save the baby. I know he means that. But with all due respect, the amendment is trying to have it both ways. It does not focus on the baby, it focuses only on the mother. 
How can you say you are for saving a baby when your amendment explicitly authorizes an abortionist to kill a baby? The assertion is that the Daschle amendment somehow requires doctors to try to save the life of the viable baby that they are aborting. Yet, the language to this effect, which includes a wide open health exception, appears on page 4 of his amendment in the nonbinding findings. I say you put this in the nonbinding findings, but you do not have it in the main language of the amendment. 
This language would not have the force of law. It would, if it were in the main bill, in the amendment, but it is not. It is in the language. So if we want to truly write some protection for the viable fetus into this proposed criminal statute, we could put it in the statute itself, not in the nonbinding finding section and certainly not with a wide open health exception. 
We all know and respect and support, I believe, the principle of self-defense. If the health of the mother is a 
problem and the life of a mother is a threat, try to save both. What is wrong with that? Why do we say we are going to say something is viable and then kill it? If you say it is viable, if you make the admission, which this amendment does, that this child is viable any time after the sixth month, if it is viable, then when you abort it you are killing it because you said it is viable by your own definition. 
This is really a pretty logical debate here, Mr. President. Sometimes we get off on other tangents. After viability, doctors can terminate the pregnancy without killing the baby. It happens all the time. They can do this by delivering the baby by cesarean section or directly through the birth canal. Sometimes they must do that in order to protect both the mother and the child. That is not an abortion. It is a premature delivery. It happens every day in America. There is no reason why it cannot happen here. 
Dr. Harlan Giles, a professor of high-risk obstetrics and perinatology at the Medical College of Pennsylvania, performs abortions by a variety of procedures before viability, and in sworn testimony before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio in November 1995, Giles had this to say about abortions after viability. This is a doctor who performs them:  
[After 23 weeks] I do not think there are any maternal conditions that I am aware of that mandate ending the pregnancy that also require that the fetus be dead or that the fetal life be terminated. In my experience for 20 years, one can deliver these fetuses either vaginally, or by cesarean section for that matter, depending on the choice of the parents with informed consent . . . But there's no reason these fetuses cannot be delivered intact vaginally after . . . labor, if you will, and be at least assessed at birth and given the benefit of the doubt. 
That is the doctor's own words who perform abortions. 
Mr. President, the question that I ask to the proponents of the Daschle amendment is the same one I have been asking over and over and over again, year after year, on this issue, with those who support partial-birth abortion on demand. And it is on demand and we know that. I repeat the question in a moment. 
We know that because of the statements made by an individual who performed them, and I stood on the Senate floor a year and a half ago or 2 years ago, and took flak from every direction, from my opponents on the other side of this issue, accusing me of making that up, that it was only a few hundred abortions a year this way, done in this manner, when, in fact, we now know it is thousands, and that they admitted they lied. 
But to the individual's credit, he told the truth now. But the question is, why is it necessary to kill a partially born baby? Will somebody come out on the floor of the Senate and answer me that question, when you have a baby in the birth canal, 90 percent born but for the head, somebody give me one reason why we have to take that baby's life in order to protect the mother's life or health when you literally restrain that child from coming the rest of the way out of the birth canal. 
Nobody has been able to tell me that. Why not just deliver the baby alive. And I will tell you why, Mr. President, because you have a problem when the baby is alive, don't you? And you know what another real dark secret is here? And they do not talk about it much. Do you know what happens oftentimes? You get the baby in the position, the abortionist is prepared with the needle, the head is still in the birth canal and, whoops, the baby comes out. You look around and you do it. 
That is not abortion, Mr. President. Do not let anybody tell you it is. That is killing an innocent child, a live, born child, and it happens. That is the dirty dark secret, one of them, about partial-birth abortion. Why not just deliver the baby. Her body, her shoulders are already out of the womb and in the birth canal. Why not just complete the delivery? Why kill her before completing the delivery? 
Unfortunately, that is what this amendment will allow. Why propose an amendment that explicitly authorizes abortions to kill viable children? That is not saving lives. And I know what the intent here is by the Senator, but we are killing viable children in seventh, eighth, and ninth months of pregnancy. We are protecting the mother but why not protect the child, too? It is not necessarily one against the other. 
In his May 2, Washington Post opinion article Senator Daschle cited certain conditions for termination of pregnancy such as hypertension, kidney failure, coma, breast cancer, et cetera. However, what was not said was why the Senator and the supporters of the amendment believe that it would ever be necessary to kill that viable baby because of the medical conditions that he cites. 
Think about it. Why would you have to kill the child for any of those reasons: hypertension, kidney failure, coma, breast cancer. Remove the child alive. It can be done. It is done every day. 
Once again, let me point out that physicians, not Senators, physicians, across America address these complicated pregnancies day in and day out and they do it by delivering babies. This amendment, even though it is not intended to do that, would give abortionists the legal authority now under law to perform abortions in these cases whenever they want to without any consideration to the law. 
Before the Senate closes debate, and I know we are getting close--for the benefit of my colleagues, I am shortly going to yield--before the Senate closes debate on this amendment, I hope that we will have an answer to the question that I have posed. I would really sincerely like to hear the answer as to why this child must be terminated, killed, taken dead from the womb of the mother when, in fact, you could perhaps save both? 
I have one final point. Those proponents of this amendment assert that it would provide some limitation on postviability abortions because it includes what they say is a narrow health exception. The Senator's amendment says that postviability abortions are permitted if an abortionist certifies that a woman is threatened with some `risk,' no matter how remote, of a `grievous injury' to her health. Unfortunately, the `grievous injury' exception does not protect one single viable unborn child, not one. Not one. And if the intent of the authors of the amendment and the proponents of the amendment is to save lives, babies' lives, the amendment does not do it. If it is the intent to save mothers' 
lives at all costs, I think it does do that and I support that part of it, saving mothers' lives, but it does not do anything to save a baby's life. 
Dr. Warren Hern, a leading third-trimester abortionist, who has written a major treatise on the subject of the `grievous injury' exception, in an interview published on May 14, yesterday, in the Bergen County Record, said:  
I will certify that any pregnancy is a threat to a woman's life and could cause grievous injury to her physical health. 
In other words, no matter what the grievous injury it is the health exception that the abortionist will use. That is not what the Senator from South Dakota intends but is the result of this amendment. Any doctor who wishes to do it can do it. 
So we have a leading third-trimester abortionist who basically says, hey, pass that thing. Then I can kill all kinds of babies and not have to worry about a thing. Just pass it. He is an expert, and he is saying this will allow him to perform an abortion on a viable child any time he wants to. So you could not ask for more compelling testimony, in my opinion, that this amendment, the Daschle amendment is a prescription for abortion on demand even after viability, and it is the main reason that it should be defeated and that we should pass the ban on partial-birth abortions as prescribed by the bill introduced and supported by the Senator from Pennsylvania. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. 
Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the resolution of ratification reported by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I want to specifically commend the distinguished chairman, Senator Helms, for his outstanding leadership in moving this resolution promptly and responsibly. 
I also want to commend the Foreign Relations Committee for including condition No. 9, which would require the administration to submit any agreement that would multilateralize the ABM Treaty to the Senate for advice and consent. This is an extremely important issue, Mr. President, and this provision ensures that the Senate retains its constitutional prerogatives to advise and consent on international treaties. 
By way of background, there is an existing statutory requirement, with precedent, that any substantive change to an international treaty must be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent, as prescribed under the Constitution. 
The Clinton administration has spent the better part of the past 4 years negotiating changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile [ABM] Treaty. Foremost among these changes are a demarcation agreement that would restrict the performance of certain theater defense programs, and a multilateralization agreement that would expand the ABM Treaty to include the Republics of the former Soviet Union. It is this multilateralization agreement that condition No. 9 would address. 
Mr. President, condition No. 9 has become necessary because the administration refuses to submit the multilateralization agreement to the Senate for advice and consent. They have rightly conceded that both a demarcation agreement and the CFE flank limits agreement are substantive changes requiring approval of the Senate, but they adamantly refuse to submit multilateralization for approval. 
The administration asserts that the executive branch alone has the authority to recognize nations and determine the successor states on treaties whose participants no longer exist. They also argue that multilateralization is merely a clarification, not a substantive change to the ABM Treaty. 
It is a very significant change that will fundamentally alter both the nature of the treaty and the obligations of its parties. It is most certainly a substantive change, and as such, it must be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. 
Mr. President, let me elaborate on exactly why a multilateralization agreement would represent a substantive change. The ABM Treaty was signed by the United States and the Soviet 
Union. It was premised on the policy of mutual assured destruction and it codified the bipolar strategic reality of the cold war. All negotiations on compliance and all discussions concerning amendments to the treaty were to be bilateral in nature, with any decisions being approved by each side. The negotiating ratio was 1 to 1, the United States versus the Soviet Union. 
However, one of these two parties has now ceased to exist. There is no longer a Soviet Union. If the treaty is multilateralized, and thereby expanded to include multiple parties on the former Soviet side, it will dramatically change this negotiating ratio, both theoretically and practically. 
Instead of the 1-to-1 ratio that the treaty was premised on, it will become at a minimum a 1-to-4 ratio, of the United States versus Russia, Khazakstan, Ukraine, and Belarus, and perhaps even a 1-to-15 ratio of the United States versus all 15 of the former Soviet Republics. We just don't know and the administration isn't saying. 
Under a multilaterlization agreement, each of these former Soviet Republics would have an equal say in negotiations, even though they clearly would have unequal rights and unequal equipment holdings. For instance, only the United States and Russia would be permitted to field an ABM system, but other nations would be free to deploy ABM radars and other related components of a system. Further, while the ABM Treaty prohibits defense of the territory of a nation, the term territory is being redefined to mean the combined territories of all former Soviet Republics who choose to join the treaty. 
What does this mean? It means that instead of the treaty applying to the territory of an individual nation, it applies to a number of nations, unevenly and in a manner that is very detrimental to the United States. For example, Russia could legally establish new early warning radars on the territory of other States, well beyond the periphery of Russia, while the United States is restricted to its own borders. Compounding this inequity, the territory and borders of the so-called former Soviet Union could change over time because the multilateralization agreement allows the admission of additional republics even after entry into force. 
The bottom line, Mr. President, is multilateralization would by definition and practice create a fundamental asymmetry in the ABM Treaty. Rather than having two parties with equal offensive strategic forces and defensive capabilities, this agreement would create a tremendous imbalance. For us to negotiate any changes to the treaty, such as an agreement to permit multiple sites or to change the location, we would now need to convince all the participating Republics of the former Soviet Union rather than just one. 
In essence, each of those countries would be able to veto our position at any time. And they would individually leverage the vote in the Standing Consultative Commission for more foreign aid, or trade recognition, or concessions on a variety of issues. Whenever we finally met any single Republic's demands, another could instantly leverage similar concessions. When would it end? Never. This scenario is very troubling. It is troubling there are people in the Senate who would be willing to accede to that kind of situation. At the very least, it will cause huge complications in our process for negotiating changes to the treaty. 
There can be no question, an agreement to multilateralize the ABM Treaty is a substantive change to the ABM Treaty, plain and simple. It must be submitted for advice and consent. Condition 9 merely says that before the CFE Flank Limits Agreement can take effect, the President must certify that he will submit the ABM Treaty multilateralization agreement to the Senate for advice and consent. 
Nothing in this condition will require any renegotiation of any provision of the CFE Flank Limits Agreement or, for that matter, require any renegotiation of any provision of the ABM Treaty multilateralization agreement. This condition will not affect any other country or any other treaty or the cause of strategic stability in any respect. That is a fact. 
Contrary to the parochial appeals of the administration, it is not going to kill NATO expansion. It will not kill START II. And it will not kill the CFE Treaty. In fact, all the President has to do is send us a letter this afternoon certifying he will submit the agreement to the Senate for advice and consent and we will be done with it. Case closed. 
I am pleased the Senate has seen fit, thanks to the tremendous leadership of Chairman Helms, to adopt this very important condition. Senator Helms, as he does so many times and often on the floor of the Senate and in private meetings on issues, stands sometimes alone. I am proud to be standing with him on this very important issue, and I think future generations will thank him for his leadership when we get to the point where this treaty does take effect. People will be thanking him for his leadership on the multilateralization issue. 
I thank the Chair.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Ignazio M. `Carlo' Carluccio who passed away on April 22, 1997, 3 months to the day after celebrating his 100th birthday in Hampton, NH, with his entire family and his close friends. 
I had the great honor and privilege to meet Mr. Carluccio on October 29, 1996, at his home in North Salisbury Beach, MA, just across the border from Seabrook, NH. I was attending a function at a lobster pound owned by Bruce Brown, a long-time mutual friend of both Mr. Carluccio and myself. While in the area, I wanted to pay my respects to Mr. Carluccio, especially since his grandson Dino has worked in my office for the last decade. 
When I met Mr. Carluccio in his home, he was in excellent health, witty, and sharp as a tack. Indeed, it was hard to believe at the time that he would shortly be celebrating his 100th birthday. During my visit with him, I was fascinated to learn many details of his truly remarkable life, some of which I would like to share with my colleagues and the American people today. 
Ignazio Carluccio was born in the small town of Benevento, Italy, in 1897. He was the son of Antonio Carluccio, and the grandson of Ignazio Carluccio. He had one brother and four sisters, three of whom still reside in southern Italy. His grandfather was the proprietor of the Gran Caffe dell'Unione, the most popular gathering place in the center of Benevento with regular outdoor musical entertainment. It was this experience as a young boy, growing up around his grandfather's cafe, that would eventually shape and inspire Mr. Carluccio's future in America as a talented musician and a proprietor of his own small business in a similar small community far away from his homeland. 
Before leaving Italy in 1921 for America, young Ignazio Carluccio learned to play the violin at a conservatory in Milan, and would often perform his own solo concerts in the beautiful parks along the bay of Naples. At that point, Ignazio's family had moved from Benevento to Naples, where his father now operated his own local cafe. I am told that there are still a few people in Naples who remember his violin performances. 
Ignazio Carluccio loved the challenges that life presented, and he knew a lot about taking risks. Whether it was simply entering the local bicycle races along the treacherous, yet scenic Amalfi Coast between Naples and Sorrento, or his service during World War I in an Italian aviation division, Mr. Carluccio was not deterred by the physical harm he encountered. He recovered only to take an even greater risk--the monumental adventure of leaving everything behind except for his violin and a few family mementos and heading for America, never turning back in the eight decades that followed. 
Earlier this year, Mr. Carluccio reflected on those first few years following his arrival in Boston on a passenger ship from Naples. He said, `Early on, I could not speak English, but I made it. It was a heckuva time.' 
Mr. Carluccio was persistent and determined following his arrival in America--he worked as a haberdasher and became the first concert violinist for the People's Symphony in Boston. He selected a middle name for himself, something uncommon in his native Italy, but not in his new country. He chose `Mario' because he wanted to be known as `I.M. Carluccio' which sounded like `I am Carluccio.' How clever for someone trying to master the English language, Mr. President. 
He met his wife, Alphonsine Giguere, backstage during one of his performances, and married her in 1928. In 1934, following the passing of his father-in-law, he took over the drugstore his father-in-law had operated in Leominster, MA, since 1903, earned a degree in pharmacy, and practiced pharmacy for the next six decades until his retirement in 1985. At its peak, Giguere Drug Stores encompassed three shops and represented the largest prescription business in Worcester County, MA. When you were sick and needed medicine, everyone knew that you needed to go see Mr. Carluccio at Giguere's. 
The original corner store was also complete with soda fountains, booths, and peanut machines, and even had musical entertainment performed on the store's roof at one point. It was the local hangout for everyone from school children to local politicians to State police officials. Mr. Carluccio surely must have been proud of the tradition he had carried on from his own grandfather's popular cafe in Benevento, Italy. 
Mr. President, I.M. Carluccio lived the American dream to the fullest. He worked hard, starting at 5 a.m. in his store each morning, finishing late at night, teaching violin on the side to students in the community, putting his five children through college, and simultaneously sending money on a regular basis back to his siblings in Italy. And if that was not enough, Mr. President, he even reminded me last fall that, although he was approaching age 50 during World War II, he wrote a letter at the time to the Secretary of what was then known as our War Department offering his services. What devotion, Mr. President. 
I.M. Carluccio cherished his family and his close friends, and he enjoyed his classic cars, his homemade spaghetti sauce, his violin music, and his favorite cigars--the simple things for a man who lived such a rich, enduring, and multifaceted life. He was a true gentleman to all who knew him. He accomplished so much that we can only hope that, perhaps, he was able to reflect back with pride, in his own quiet, dignified way, as he puffed his final cigars earlier this year. He has left a wonderful legacy which continues to inspire all those who have known him. 
When I met him last fall I, too, was inspired, not only by his longevity, but by his selfless devotion through the years to his Nation, the communities in which he made his home, and to his entire family--three sons, two daughters, nine grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren, nephews, and nieces. Let me say also say here that I am proud that Mr. Carluccio's three grandchildren who carry the Carluccio name--Carlo, Dino, and Mario--are all constituents of mine from New Hampshire. I am honored to represent them in the U.S. Senate. 
Mr. President, I hope Mr. Carluccio's legacy will inspire all those who hear of it today. I am proud to do my part through this statement to ensure that the life of Mr. Carluccio is properly recognized as part of our American history. The story of this great Italian-American centenarian has already been recognized on many occasions at the State and local level, and through the countless birthday greetings Mr. Carluccio received through the years from Presidents, Senators, Congressmen, and State and local politicians. But it is appropriate and deserving that today, we make Mr. Carluccio's life story part of the official, permanent Record of the U.S. Congress. God bless Mr. Carluccio and his entire family.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Like the previous amendment offered by my colleague from Washington, Senator Gorton, this is a very reasonable amendment. It simply requires the courts, when they make an award under IDEA, to take into consideration what impact that award will have on all of the students in the district or in the particular classrooms. For example, we have cases where a $1,000 IDEA program or plan, educational plan costs $13,000 or $14,000 in legal fees. There are millions of dollars in legal fees spent in all 50 States, all over America, that are taken out of the classroom. These are dollars that you cannot use for teachers, you cannot use for computers, you cannot use for textbooks or, frankly, for infrastructure or schools or buildings. 
The issue here is whether or not you want to have these dollars go to the students or go to the lawyers. That is the simple issue. This is a very reasonable amendment. There is nothing unreasonable about it. 
I think the process here where we say we cannot amend a bill to strengthen it, to make a better bill is a bad process and one for which I wish we had not set the precedent. I urge my colleagues to think about it because at some point in the not too distant future you are going to have another piece of legislation coming through here, and you are going to be on the other side. You are going to want to offer an amendment and you are going to have to say to yourself, well, when I had the opportunity before, I opposed that opportunity for another colleague. Sure, I can offer the amendment but the deal by the leadership is to oppose the amendment because we have a deal. The answer is very simple. You can vote for my amendment and take dollars out of the pockets of lawyers and put them into the classroom for the students or you can oppose my amendment and favor the lawyers. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to indicate, first and foremost, that I understand what the sponsors of the bill are trying to do. I support the concept of reforming the IDEA law. I do not fault them for trying to make the changes. What I fault is the process in which we bring the bill to the floor with a locked-up agreement. One of the greatest aspects of the U.S. Senate is that we have the opportunity to debate, and hopefully sometimes have a couple of people listen to what we say and influence an outcome. I realize that does not happen very often around here. But in this particular case, we do not have the opportunity to influence the outcome because we are told: A deal has been struck between the House and the Senate, minority and majority, White House and everybody else. It is just one happy old time here, everything is done and we do not need to debate it, we do not need to suggest any changes. 
Perhaps an analogy might be if we had an agreement to spend $1 billion on cancer research and somebody told us if we spent another $50 million we could cure cancer, I think we would be prepared to amend the bill to add the $50 million to the $1 billion in a hurry. So I do not support this kind of process. I do not think it is right, and I think that we can strengthen a bill and, if somewhere along the line the President specifically decides to veto the bill with the strengthened provision, we have a constitutional process--the Founding Fathers thought it out very clearly--which says that bill would come back here, to the Senate and House, and we could override his veto or not. So I do not think anything is lost by allowing Senator Gorton and myself the opportunity to offer amendments in good faith. 
You might say, You are offering your amendments. Yes, we are, but we are offering them with just about everybody out there against us, even though I believe our ideas are good. 
Senator Gorton made some very interesting points on his amendment, and I rise in strong support of that amendment, which is the business before us. He made the interesting point that he did not feel U.S. Senators necessarily knew more about what was happening in the various school districts in Washington State or in New Hampshire, for that matter, than the people in those districts did. I could not agree with him more. I bring perhaps a different perspective than many of my colleagues here in the Senate. I spent 6 years in the classroom as a teacher. I also spent 6 years on a school board. I know what Public Law 194 is, and I know the good things that that law has done for people who are in need of special education. It has done wonders for many, many students who were in need. 
The Senator from Iowa made specific reference to one individual who had been helped under this program. I applaud that. That is not what we are talking about. What we are talking about is this basically distorting the process to write individualized education plans for people who perhaps should not have IEP's; who really are not in the same category as the young man who was mentioned by the Senator from Iowa. 
I took the opportunity, even though this is not a bill that is in the jurisdiction of any of my committees--that is Senator Jeffords' committee--I did something that perhaps is not always done around here, I wrote to all the school districts in my State and I asked for input on this legislation. I informed them I felt there was a good opportunity, that Senator Jeffords and others were moving the bill through the process here, that it was going to improve the special education program or IDEA as we know it, and I think Senator Jeffords has done that. He has improved it. But the question again goes back to my original point. Can we improve it more? I think Senator Gorton's amendment does that. I would like to explain why I think that is the case. I would like to explain the rationale for the amendment, which is intended to ensure that the education of all students not be compromised. 
This is an important issue. I wish we had the opportunity for more debate, but unfortunately we do not have that. The problem the Gorton-Smith school safety amendment addresses is, I believe, one of the most serious problems in all of the legislation. A safe school environment is a precondition for learning. 
I listened to my colleague, for whom I have the greatest respect, Dr. Frist, the Senator from Tennessee. He used some medical examples and indicated that there are times when these unexplained medical occurrences occur. I understand that. I respect that. I do not claim to challenge his medical knowledge. But I hope we might speak from the teacher's point of view, because that is what this is all about. We are not talking, here, just about helping children who need help. That is one part of it. There are children who need help. But there are also children, for whatever reason--whether it is because they need help or because they got an IEP that they should not have gotten, an individual educational plan--they are disrupting the classroom. And there are other students in that classroom. 
When I am standing before that classroom, trying to teach 25 other students, and this student blurts something out and disrupts the class, or waves a gun in class, or brings drugs into class, or shouts obscenities, or whatever else the student may decide to do, it really, as far as the other 25 students in the class are concerned--I do not really think that they are overly concerned at that point, when the classroom is disrupted and education is disrupted, as to what the cause is, or what the problem may be specifically with this child. It is a problem. If it is a medical problem, it ought to get medical attention. If it is a discipline problem, it ought to get disciplinary attention. That disciplinary attention ought to come from the decisions of the teacher, parents, school board, school administrators--not from the Federal Government. Not from the U.S. Senate. 
So, the school safety amendment is a commonsense addition to this bill. That is all it is. It simply ensures that the rules governing discipline in schools may be formulated in such a way as to treat all students uniformly. Without this amendment, S. 717 will preserve the double standard that exists under current law. Students will see there is one standard for students diagnosed with disabilities and another one for those who do not have such a diagnosis. 
Recently, my office received a call from a school board chairman in New Hampshire complaining that a student in one of the districts had brought a gun to school. He reported that because the student had been diagnosed with a disability, the school board was powerless to intervene. It goes without saying that without the diagnosis, the situation would have been different. 
I ask you, Mr. President, if you are standing in that classroom trying to teach those other students and a kid waves a gun around, at that point, do you really care specifically what his problem is? When somebody walks into a bank and waves a firearm at a clerk, at that point in time, are we really concerned about how difficult his or her childhood may have been, or are we concerned about dealing with the now, what is of utmost urgency, and that is the violence that is pending, immediately and then deal with the other problem? Doesn't that make more sense, I say to my colleagues? That is all Senator Gorton is trying to do. That is all his amendment does. 
If you read on page 157 in the bill, basically what it says is that if you have that student waving that gun, you can get that student out of the classroom, according to the Federal Government now dictating to the school district. You can get the student out of the classroom for 45 days. That is very nice that the Federal Government and the Senate and the House and the President have given the school districts a directive that, yes, if you have a kid waving a gun around in Mrs. Jones' class, let's say in the sixth grade, you can take the kid out of school for 45 days. That is very good of the Federal Government to allow that to happen. I applaud them for letting that happen. 
In addition, to show the kindness of the Federal Government even more, if you provide an IEP, an individual education plan, for that student who is waving a gun around--you have to do that--you have to provide that help for this student while he or she is out for 45 days and then, after the 45 days, you have to bring the student back into the classroom again. Now, that is real nice for the Federal Government to get into that kind of micromanaging. 
As a teacher who has the responsibility for educating the students and, in this particular case, the safety of the students, we need a better way. I do not want the Federal Government to make that decision. I want the teacher on the spot, the administrators on the spot to get that student out of the classroom and to find out whatever the problem is. If it is a medical problem, fine, then deal with it as a medical problem outside the parameters of the school district. The school district is not a hospital, it is not a social service agency, it is an educational institution, and we have lost sight of that. Everybody in America knows it, the school districts know it, the students know it, in some cases. 
I believe honestly that without this amendment we will eventually be forced to revisit this problem. This is not going to resolve the problem despite our best intentions. We are going to be sending the message that the Federal Government is not a help but an impediment to efforts to provide students with a safe learning environment. By sending that message, we will give citizens who want safe schools for their children reason to doubt that the Federal Government considers their concerns worthy of serious attention. 
I do not believe we should send that message, Mr. President. 
Throughout this debate, we have heard that any successful effort to amend this bill, no matter how worthy, is going to imperil the entire legislation. I ask my colleagues to think about that for a moment. How does it imperil this legislation to say to a local school district, if you have somebody waving a gun around in a classroom, or doing drugs in a classroom, or in other ways disrupting the classroom, how does it imperil this legislation to say that we want to add an amendment on this bill that says that the school district, the teacher, the principal, the enforcement official, the police department, whatever it takes in that local community, should be able to address that problem as they would if any other student were causing it. Deal with the other problems, 
the problems behind this incident later, but get the child out of the classroom. That is all Senator Gorton and I are asking with this amendment. 
It is not unreasonable, Mr. President. Schools should not be forced to adapt their own behavior policies on the basis of IDEA. This is a reasonable amendment. I encourage my colleagues to search their conscience, in spite of the effort to stop all amendments, in spite of the effort to say this will destroy the bill, I plead with my colleagues to support the Gorton amendment because of the reasons I have given. 
Bear in mind, we all understand the rules, we understand the constitutional provisions of what we do in the Senate. We all understand that if a bill is defeated, it can be defeated because the President vetoes it, it can be defeated because the Senate or the House defeats it, but in this case, if the Senate passes it with this amendment and the House passes it with this amendment, who knows, the President may sign it with this amendment. We do not know the answer to that. And if he does not sign it, we can override his veto, and if we do not override his veto, we go right back to where Senator Jeffords is now. So what have we lost? A little time, that is all. 
But I guarantee you, if you talk to those teachers out there in those inner cities and other locations where these kinds of things are happening, it would be very interesting to hear their remarks in terms of how they feel about this. 
Let me close by saying, again, I understand and respect what Senator Jeffords is trying to do. This is an advancement of current law in the right direction. I applaud that and support that, but I resent the fact that we cannot make an attempt, where there are deficiencies overlooked, where we are denied the opportunity to make the attempt to reform them because we are going to `undo' some compromise on the legislation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve any time I have.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Vermont working with me on this amendment. I do not intend to use the full 30 minutes on my side. If it helps to yield back some time on both sides to expedite things, I am more than pleased to do that. 
This, again, Mr. President, is another opportunity to strengthen this bill. Like the Gorton amendment, it is just a commonsense amendment that simply underlines a commitment to fairness and equity that I believe every Member in this body shares. My amendment would require a court making an award under the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act to take into consideration the impact the granting of the award would have on the education of all children in that State or locality. 
The problem that the Smith amendment addresses is a very real one. Again, talking with school boards, having served on a school board, I can tell you that litigation costs are consuming a lot of resources that would otherwise be dedicated to education services or infrastructure development. 
In one instance, a school district was forced to pay $13,000 in attorney's fees as a result of a dispute over less than $1,000. I simply ask my colleagues if that is reasonable. 
I ask unanimous consent that Senator Gorton be added as a cosponsor to my amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, Senator Gorton, in discussing his previous amendment, which did not relate directly to attorney's fees, has provided me a copy with some of the litigation costs in various school districts in his State of Washington. I will not go through them all, but if you added all of the litigation costs up in 1 year, the 1994-95 school year, it would be almost $1 million in litigation costs just on special education, $330,000 in Seattle, alone. 
Now, if you add up all of those thousands and thousands of dollars and you end up with a total in excess of $1 million, if you are a teacher or an administrator or a private citizen thinking of your own school district, you might ask `How many teachers, how many textbooks, how much infrastructure could you provide for $330,000?' 
We have an adverse reaction around here when we try to get anything done to knock any attorneys out of a dollar or two. There was a Washington Post story recently quoting lawyers bragging--and I will not cite names here, I do not think that is important--but there was a law firm in the city that got $2.4 million, according to school budget records, just on special education, just on this law. In fact, one person was quoted as saying, `Winning those cases is like taking candy from a baby.' 
I might just say, why is that? Well, I took the time, Mr. President, to talk to my school districts--not all of them, but I wrote to them and got a lot of input back and attended some school board meetings. I attended school board meetings, about one a week for 6 years, when I served on the school board in another life before I came here to Congress. Believe me, I have heard a lot of reasons and a lot of things about what is wrong with this law as well as what is good with it. We know there are good things about it. 
The Manchester school district, which has 100,000, roughly, citizens--not 100,000 students--a district of a little over 100,000 people, pays litigation costs on this issue alone of between $110,000 and $125,000 every year. That is the cost of three teachers. This may be justified, but sometimes it is not, is the point I am making. 
Using the example I cited in my last speech of the youngster with a gun in the classroom, if somebody determines that youngster must have an individual education plan, and the school district says, `Now, wait a minute. Hold on. This kid has disciplinary problems. He does not have medical problems. He has disciplinary problems. We want to discipline him. We want to get him out of this classroom.' But somebody disagrees. Maybe the parents, maybe somebody representing the parents, maybe the Civil Liberties Union--whoever--but somebody disagrees. So sometimes when the school district looks at the ramifications, they think, `Well, if we go to court and fight this and lose, it could cost us $300,000. If we give in and we cave in and say, `Well, OK, the kid is waving a gun around, he must have a medical problem somewhere, something is wrong, he is waving a gun around a classroom, we need an IEP,' we might as well cave in because that will cost $100,000, and it is better to pay $100,000 than $300,000.' 
That is exactly what happens, Mr. President, over and over again, year after year, district after district, all over America. They simply throw up their hands and look at it simply on the basis of a bottom line. `If I go to court and I lose, I will owe $300,000 in legal fees. If I go to court and win, maybe I will not owe them. But if I lose I will have to pay, and for the sake of $100,000 IEP, knowing that the legal fees' estimate may be three times that, why, then, would I take the risk?' That is exactly what happens, Mr. President. I have sat as chairman of the school board and seen it happen and participated in those decisions. They were bottom-line decisions. 
Now, let me tell you why this hurts children in those schools. Maybe I am mistaken, but I think we are trying to reform this law because we want to help students get a better education. Now, the question you must ask the question you might want to ask is: Is it fair to provide this kind of education, this kind of alternative, at the expense of other students? If it is going to cost $300,000 to go to court, then I have to think, if I am a school board chairman, well, how about the other kids? What happens to them? Let me tell you what happens: Those dollars go to the lawyers. That is what happens. And we are letting it happen. 
I thought the point of a civil rights law was to protect people from discrimination, especially minorities, not to provide minority group members with benefits not available to the rest of us. That is what I thought. Maybe I am somehow mistaken in that regard. 
So, all my amendment does, all it does, is it simply requires a court, in making an award under the IDEA legislation, to take into consideration the impact the granting of that award would have on the education of all the children, all the children, in the school district--not just one, all of them. 
I might say to you, is it fair to take education away from kids who want it, who need it, who deserve it, who ask for it, for the sake of someone who is a discipline problem? Not someone who has a handicap or someone who has a need. I want to make that clear, because I will be accused otherwise. That is not what we are talking about when we talk about kids who have legitimate needs. We are talking about these outrageous individual education plans that are written, and the outrageous examples of the kind that I gave you, a kid is selling drugs on the school ground, you have a kid waving a gun in the classroom, you have a kid shouting obscenities in the classroom, and instead of worrying about getting the kid out of there and out of that environment which is destroying the educational opportunities of other students, we are worried about what the background is, what the reason is for it. There is a justification for finding out the reason, but get them out of the school classroom where these problems are occurring. 
We are not talking about a child with Down's syndrome here or a child who is blind or deaf or who needs some special education to help that child learn. We are not talking about that. I voted for hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer dollars to help those children as a school board member and as a Senator. I am talking 
about some type of reasonable restriction on outrageous legal fees that come right smack out of the pockets of those good kids, good kids who simply want to learn, those good kids and decent parents who say, `You know, I am sending my child into school. I know the teachers are imperfect. We are all imperfect. We are human beings. I do not expect them to be perfect. I do not expect the school or the administrator to be perfect or the classroom environment to be perfect, but I am asking they be free from the threat of violence, they be free from the threat of drugs, free from the threat of outrageous outbursts of obscenities and other things that may cause an impact on my child or their child's education.' That is all parents are asking. What is so unreasonable about that? 
Who are we in the Federal Government or the U.S. Senate or the House of Representatives or the White House to tell the school district that they can't correct this? Who are we to do that? If you can find that in the Constitution, Mr. President, somewhere, anywhere, even implied, I will withdraw the amendment. It is not there. It is absolutely not there. We need to do something about it. 
There was a principal from a school in New Hampshire who wrote to me saying that because of litigation costs, `funding of other regular education programs is being seriously jeopardized.' He describes himself, this principal, as a member of a generation that sought to extend equal opportunity to all. He concluded, with regret, that as a result of excessive litigation the IDEA has become `a law gone crazy. The students that are disadvantaged now are the regular education children.' 
I include in regular education children those who have a disability, who need help. Let me repeat that: I include in regular education, children in that category, those children who have a special need, who need extra help--not the ones that are causing these problems that are so outrageous in these classrooms. 
I wish I could say this was just one mere anecdotal example out of millions and that it was not a big deal, but it is not. A study that was conducted by the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations shows that the IDEA is the fourth most litigated law in its study of unfunded mandates--unfunded Federal mandates. Is it any wonder that some lawyer from Washington, DC would say `winning those cases is like taking candy from a baby?' It is not. 
I have talked to the school board members. They throw their hands up in the air. It is costing them money by the hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars, money that could be spent on educating, yes, the truly needy special needs kids, as well as the people in that classroom. 
Again, for emphasis, I repeat what I said earlier. Can you imagine being in a classroom, as a teacher or as a student, with that kind of outrageous behavior occurring, and then knowing as a school board member that you have to tolerate it unless you want to break the bank with legal expenses? 
So, basically, what this amendment does that I am offering, it simply allows the court to pull back on these court costs, to have the flexibility to say, look, $13,000 for a $1,000 IEP or $350,000 for a $10,000 IEP, those kind of fees are outrageous. They are not going to be tolerated because we are not going to let some lawyer who wants to fatten his wallet do so at the expense of decent children in some school district in Anywhere, USA, from having the opportunities of getting what he or she deserves in that classroom. 
That is wrong, Mr. President. That is absolutely wrong to let that happen. Yet, it is happening and we are encouraging it to happen. We are encouraging it to happen because we have some deal struck that no one wants to break and, therefore, we can't offer an amendment. `Yes, you can offer an amendment, Senator Smith, but everybody is going to oppose it. If you get five votes, good luck.' Well, I just ask the American people to look very carefully at the votes, frankly. Those of you out there in the school districts around America, look at who votes on the Gorton amendment and Smith amendment and see whether they are there for you or not, because that is what it amounts to. 
I don't care what anybody tells you on the floor of this Senate, it is absolutely not true to say that this bill will be defeated if this amendment passes or the Gorton amendment passes. That is not true, because it can be defeated here and the President could veto it, but we can override the veto. That is the constitutional process. 
The need to address the problem of litigation costs seems all the more pressing at a time when some of my colleagues have begun calling for the Federal Government to take over the job of building and maintaining the schools from State and local governments. They want to take it over. Can you imagine that? The U.S. Senate, in this vote, is going to use the power of the Federal Government to prevent you from getting that child waving the gun or using the drugs out of the classroom but that same Federal Government is going to take over the job of maintaining school buildings. Can you imagine that? 
Do we really want to do for public schools what we have done for public housing? I think some do. I don't. Perhaps we in Congress would do better to ease the burdens of excessive regulation and litigation so that States and localities can devote more of their resources to repairing or replacing crumbling school buildings. 
You know, it might be a good idea--I hadn't thought of it; it just came to mind--when the lawyers get the big fat settlements or legal fees by winning these cases, which they take with great glee--`like taking candy from a baby'--maybe we ought to have an amendment that says they ought to give 90 percent of it back to the school district. Maybe they get an IEP or two for some of these kids that really need it. But that would be wrong. That is in violation of capitalism, I guess, isn't it? 
Well, all you have to do, Mr. President, is look and see where all the money goes from the legal community and who they are giving it to. There are a lot of lawyers in here and they do pretty well. So it is tough to beat the lawyers in this body. 
I ask my colleagues simply to search your consciences, read the two amendments, the Smith and Gorton amendments, read what they do and ask yourself, is it the end of the world if this passes and this bill takes a few more weeks running through the process of getting changed? That is all we are asking. If the process around here is to strike a deal before we get stuff to the floor, I am going to be the first Senator out on the floor the next time that somebody who votes for this bill says, `I would like to offer an amendment.' I am going to say, `Excuse me, why are you offering an amendment? I thought we had a deal here. Isn't that the way you want to govern--strike the deal before you bring the bill to the floor so nobody can make any amendments?' 
This amendment would make this legislation a responsible piece of legislation if we were to pass it. That is all I ask. I am not asking for anything else. I am asking for the Senate to adopt this amendment to strengthen this bill, to take money out of the pockets of lawyers and put it into the educational opportunities of young girls and boys throughout this country. That is all my amendment does. If you want it in the pockets of lawyers, vote against me. If you want it to be spent for the schoolchildren, then vote for me. That is it, pure and simple. 
Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to 10-year-old Joshua Gagnon from Merrimack, NH, for being chosen the New Hampshire champion by the Champions Across America Program of the Children's Miracle Network. 
These champions are children who have triumphed over life-threatening health problems. Joshua, along with champions from other States, will represent the 7 million children treated at children's hospitals each year. 
Joshua was only 3 years old when his family discovered his illness. An MRI revealed that he suffered from the Dandy Walker syndrome, which required an extensive shunt that extended from his brain to his stomach. In the past 7 years the shunt, which is susceptible to clogging, has required three replacements. 
Another surgery Joshua had undergone was to correct a condition known as Streeter's dysplasia. The Genesis fund, which funds the National Birth Defects Center, made it possible for Joshua's webbed fingers and toes to be reshaped by a plastic/reconstructive surgeon. Even though he only has use of his ring finger and his pinky finger on his right hand, Joshua writes very well and loves to assemble model airplanes and cars. 
Like any other boy his age, Joshua has many hobbies, such as reading, riding his mountain bike and playing basketball. He is very inquisitive and his sense of humor gives his mother many reasons to laugh. 
Mr. President, I want to call attention to the uniqueness of children's health care and the importance of non-profit hospitals for children. Joshua is an inspiring example for children and their families to fight the battle and beat the odds. He and the other champions show children in New Hampshire and across the Nation how to pursue a happy life, despite their illness. I am proud to represent Joshua in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Arthur and Roena Moses from Sanbornton, NH, on the celebration of their 50th wedding anniversary. 
Arthur and Roena were united in marriage on March 2, 1947, in a double ring ceremony at the Congregational Church in South Danbury, NH. After a motor trip honeymoon around New England, the couple made their home in Sanbornton and have lived there for the past 50 years. 
Arthur and Roena raised four children, Eugene, Gail, Jeffrey, and Barry Moses. Roena Moses grew up in South Danbury. She attended local schools and graduated from Franklin High School in 1945. She worked in the Franklin Public Library, and then for Cormier Hosiery until she retired in 1985. Today she spends her time knitting garments for newborn babies, and enjoys doing puzzles, camping, playing games, and visiting with all her friends. Roena has also contributed to the arts and crafts program at the Shaker Village in Canterbury, NH. 
Arthur has lived his whole life in Sanbornton. He grew up at a farm and was a farmer for 40 years. He also worked for the New Hampshire Department of Transportation [DOT] in the maintenance division 3. Arthur retired in 1985 after working for 25 years at the same Tilton DOT location. 
Arthur and Roena both enjoy camping. For the last several years Roena has been elected president and trail boss of the North American Family Campers Association [NAFCA] where she and her husband are charter members. Their journeys have taken them all over the United States, making friends wherever they go. 
On March 2, 1997, Arthur and Roena celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary in the vestry of Sanbornton's First Baptist Church. 
Mr. President, Arthur and Roena Moses provide an inspiring example of the joys of marriage. I am pleased to congratulate them on the celebration of their 50th wedding anniversary and I wish them luck and happiness in the years to come.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Geraldine Sylvester of Dover on her retirement after 25 years of service to Dover and the State of New Hampshire. Geraldine has ended a distinguished career as a State health leader, city councilor, businesswoman, educator and mother. 
Gerry has been my friend for more than a decade. She grew up in Milton and graduated from Nute High School. She and her husband Bob raised 5 daughters and 2 sons and now have 16 grandchildren. 
Geraldine served seven consecutive terms as a Dover city councilor beginning in 1970. In 1974-75 she also served as mayor. Geraldine officially retired as director of New Hampshire's Office of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Prevention in December 1996, which was the single State authority for substance abuse problems in New Hampshire. Geraldine was appointed for this post in 1983 by former Gov. John Sununu, and continued her service under Governors Judd Gregg and Steve Merrill. 
Gerry is a woman of many talents who approaches any challenge with determination. She served in miscellaneous local, State, and Federal positions, such as the National Advisory Committee on Alcohol and Drug Abuse and Mental Health Problems. In 1980 she was a delegate to the National Republican Convention, chairwoman of the New Hampshire Small Business Advisory Council in 1978, and from 1976 to 1981 she became trustee of the New Hampshire Youth Development Center. 
Gerry and Bob are also humanitarians. Their compassion is illustrated in the fact that, for 12 years, the Sylvester home was a group home for physically and emotionally distraught minors in the seacoast of New Hampshire. 
Gerry and Bob founded GFS Manufacturing in 1971 in the garage of their house. Through the energy, dedication, and drive of Gerry and her family, the business grew and prospered. In 1978 they were named citizens of the year by the Greater Dover Chamber of Commerce. 
Mr. President, Geraldine Sylvester has dedicated her time, talent, and energy to serving the residents of Dover in an exemplary way. I am proud to honor her outstanding community commitment, which is so important to the future and prosperity of Dover. We are indeed indebted to Gerry for her efforts. I thank her for her 25 years of dedicated service, commend her for an extraordinary job and say that I am privileged to call her my friend. I wish her every happiness and health for the years to come as she embraces retirement.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the town of Nottingham on its 275th anniversary. On May 10, 1997, at the 275th anniversary celebration, the Nottingham Historical Society and the anniversary committee will be reading the Royal Charter of May 10, 1722, which founded the town of Nottingham. 
When the charter was formally issued in 1722, there were 132 persons who were allowed to draw lots of land to establish the town. Now, Nottingham is a quaint New England town of 3,002 people, still dedicated to the Yankee ingenuity that formed the town in colonial times. 
Nottingham was at the forefront of America's industrial history. In 1727, the townspeople decided to build the first sawmill on the Tuckaway River which was the beginning of 17 water powered mills for the purpose of sawing lumber, grinding grain, and fulling, a process of cleansing and working up a nap on rough, woolen homespun cloth. 
The rugged land was too rocky for the planting of crops and the land had to be cleared to allow the family's provisions to be raised, and to provide winter food for the livestock. Charcoal was produced for sale in the seacoast towns like this one; it was used as the fuel in the furnaces for making iron and for heating and cooking in city fireplaces. The ironmills along the two-mile streak--also known as New Portsmouth--required large amounts of charcoal, too, for building furnaces and making iron. The name of today's Smoke Street still indicates how much charcoal was produced in the former Summer Street of the 1700's. 
In spite of the hardships of nature in the cold northeast, Nottingham started to grow. By the late 1760's the Nottingham Square included a school house, a church, a meeting house, and a store. Landowners were building homes which were substantial. The Butler Inn, for example, and many other colonial and federal style homes remain in good condition today. 
Nottingham also has a place of honor in our Nation's military history. Gen. Henry Dearborn led Nottingham in the march of the Minutemen to the Battle of Bunker Hill in the American Revolution. Three other brave Revolutionary War generals, Joseph Cilley, Thomas Bartlett and Henry Butler, remained in Nottingham to become leading citizens and many of their descendants are still actively involved in the improvement of Nottingham today. 
During the Civil War, Nottingham residents provided many able-bodied men to fight and supplied the Union Armies with food and clothing. From the Civil War to the gulf war, many members of Nottingham's families have served their country proudly and honorably in all branches of our Nation's services. 
Nottingham's residents today serve in professional, semiprofessional, trade, and service occupations. Though individualistic, these townspeople are family-oriented and prudent. They always strive for the betterment of their community and are willing to contribute their time and talents on behalf of their neighbors. 
I congratulate all the dedicated and patriotic residents of Nottingham on this historic milestone and wish them an enjoyable year of celebration and remembrance. They all should be very proud of the town's heritage and 275 years of distinguished history. I send them my best wishes for continued success and prosperity. Happy Birthday, Nottingham.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to 21 students from Gorham High School in Gorham, NH, who were recently selected to compete in the national finals of the `We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution' program to be held April 26-28 in Washington, DC. These high school students competed on the State level on February 10 for the opportunity to represent New Hampshire at the national competition, and will be among more than 1,200 students from 49 States and the District of Columbia to participate. 
The distinguished members of the team representing New Hampshire are: David Arsenault, Jan Bindas-Tenney, Melissa Borowski, Alyssa Breton, Mire Burrill, Kevin Carpenter, Todd Davis, Rebecca Evans, Brad Fillion, Cindy Gibson, Patrick Gilligan, Sean Griffith, Reid Hartman, Sarah King, Michelle Leveille, Monica McKenzie, Ashley Thompson, Michael Toth, Julie Washburn, Tuuli Winter, and Melanie Wolf. 
All 21 New Hampshire students will be tested on the Constitution and Bill of Rights before simulated congressional committees to demonstrate their knowledge of constitutional principles and their relevance to contemporary issues. The competition in Washington will consist of 2 days of hearings; and the 10 finalists, with the highest scores, will compete for the title of national winner on Capitol Hill in a congressional hearing room. 
Michael Brosnan, a teacher at Gorham High School, also deserves special recognition for helping these students prepare for the intense constitutional testing. Raymond Kneeland the district coordinator of the `We the People . . . the Citizen and the Constitution' program, Holly Belson, the State coordinator, and Howard Zibel, of the New Hampshire Bar Association, all contributed a significant amount of time and effort to help the students reach the national finals. As a former teacher myself, I applaud all of them on their commitment to enriching the lives of these students. 
The `We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution' program provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an informed perspective about the history and principles of our Nation's constitutional government. I wish these young constitutional experts from Gorham High School and their teacher, Michael Brosnan, the best of luck in preparing for the April national finals. We are proud to have them representing New Hampshire, and wish them luck as they prepare to be America's leader in the 21st century.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, first of all, I will comment on the remarks made by the distinguished Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, during the time that I was in the chair regarding the terrible tragedy of the floods in North Dakota, Minnesota, and the West. He did an outstanding presentation in terms of the extreme acts of heroism that have taken place in that region of the country. 
One of the great things about America and the American people is the capacity that they have to reach back in times of great crisis--whether it be war, flood, earthquake, or whatever --and help their neighbors. Certainly, Senator Dorgan captured in great detail and with a great personal touch that terrible tragedy. Of course, our hearts and prayers are with them as they go through this terrible time.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Also, Mr. President, I want to comment on a piece of legislation that two of my colleagues, Senator McCain, and the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, introduced regarding the prevention of the Government shutdown. 
We went through this game, as you know, last year, and wound up having the Government shut down and innocent people, who were doing a good job in their capacity working for the Government, were caught in this whipsaw of conflict between the Congress and the President. 
Senator Hutchison and Senator McCain have brought forth this amendment, this idea, which essentially will see that that does not happen. I am a bit surprised, given the amount of criticism that we took from the President on the Government shutdown--he gave us most of the blame, although he, I think, deserves equal credit, if you will--at the opposition, stated opposition to this amendment by the President. I hope the President could support a proposal which eliminates the threat of a Government shutdown as we work toward getting a budget agreement. 
Basically, it locks in place spending at last year's appropriation levels until we do it, and not shut down the Federal Government. I hope the President will reconsider that and endorse this proposal which I believe will be attached to the supplemental, and see that we do not have a Government shutdown again, and that Congress and the President get together and do what the American people want them to do, which is come to a budget agreement that balances the budget, that really balances the budget by the year 2002--no smoke and mirrors--and that we get entitlement reform, we get some tax relief for the American people, and do it all. 
If there is gridlock because we do not get that agreement, then the people who are trying to run the Federal Government, from passing out the Social Security checks to immigration, visas and so forth, that we do not get those people again caught in that conflict. 
I commend my colleagues for that and am pleased to be a supporter of it.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, earlier this week I introduced a piece of legislation that no doubt will create some discussion, if not controversy, around the country. It involves the term limits for judges--Federal judges. 
This is something that, of course, would change the Constitution, so it would be a constitutional amendment. For over 200 years we have had lifetime appointments for judges, so I did not expect to have 100 Senators and all Members of the House, and everybody writing in, all over America, supporting this proposal, as soon as I introduced the proposal. 
However, I do hope, as people think about it and carefully consider it, they begin to realize how important I think this change to our Constitution would be. I think, frankly, Jefferson and Hamilton would support the amendment if they were here today, because if they could look back on history and see what has happened in the Federal Judiciary, I think they would agree with me it is time we put term limits on judges. 
Senator Shelby of Alabama has joined me in this effort. We call it Senate Joint Resolution 26. It is a constitutional amendment for term limits for judges. When I introduced the amendment a couple of days ago I did not have the opportunity, because of debate on the Chemical Weapons Convention, I did not have the opportunity to make a few remarks. I want to take this time to do that. 
Mr. President, the Framers of our Constitution intended that the judicial branch, which was created by article III in the Constitution, would have a limited role. That was their 
strong belief, that the role be limited, and that they be an equal partner in the three parts of our Government. They believed in the necessity of judicial restraint, and they recognized, and said so, the danger of judicial activism. 
Now, in Federalist No. 48, James Madison wrote that to combine the judicial power with executive and legislative authority would be the very definition of tyranny. Madison's own words--`The very definition of tyranny.' To repeat, to combine the judicial power with executive and judicial authority would be the very definition of tyranny. 
Thomas Jefferson said, `The very notion that the Supreme Court should have the final word on constitutional questions is a very dangerous doctrine, to consider the judge as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions.' He also said, `It is one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy,' meaning government of the select few. Very interesting that Jefferson and Madison, of all people, would be saying that. 
It is interesting to look at the debate as the Constitution was written. Some people like to decide what they think the intent of the Founding Fathers was as we look at these court decisions that have been made over the past couple hundred years, but it is interesting to look at what they said. Sometimes what they said, what they actually said, the Founding Fathers, and what other people think they meant are not one and the same and are totally different. 
Another founder, in Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton, argued that the judicial branch `will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution. Courts have neither force nor will but merely judgment, and can take no active resolution whatever.' 
That was Hamilton. 
Even as he advocated the ratification of the Constitution, and he was one of the strongest advocates as the Federalist Papers prove, he also issued a warning. The courts, he said, must declare the sense of the law. If they should be disposed--they being the justices, the judges--to exercise will, will, instead of judgment, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body. 
So, what a judge's personal view is, what his or her pleasure is in terms of a decision is irrelevant, is not the issue. It is what the best judgment in terms of the interpretation of the Constitution is. Mr. President, 200 years after Alexander Hamilton issued this warning, it is abundantly clear that the abuse of judicial power that he feared has become a reality. If Hamilton were here today, I believe he would be the first to recognize it. 
Instead of applying law as they find it in a neutral manner, which is a judge's role, exercising what Hamilton called their judgment, activist judges are in effect substituting their own policy views, in what Hamilton called their will, for the policies established by the people through their elected representatives in the political branches of the Government. 
Now, Mr. President, I have been in the Congress for 13 years and I have thought a lot about this. Thirteen years ago I thought about introducing an amendment to do this, but I did not. I sat back and said, Maybe this will change, maybe I am wrong. Maybe Hamilton was wrong. Maybe it is not as bad as I think. The truth of the matter is, it is worse than I thought. 
Finally, the last 2 or 3 weeks I finally made up my mind that the time has come, and I think there is a lot of proof to show and to demonstrate that the time has come. Let me give some examples, and this is not meant in any way to impugn the integrity of the three justices that I will mention. 
They were fine individuals who acted as they saw fit to interpret the Constitution. I want to make a point here. Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun have all taken their personal opposition to the death penalty and read it into the Constitution. 
Now, the Founding Fathers discussed capital punishment as they wrote the Constitution. They mentioned capital punishment in the Constitution. The death penalty is explicitly mentioned and its constitutionality is unquestionable in the due process clauses of both the 5th and 14th amendments to the Constitution. Yet, these three Justices rendered decisions time and time again because of their personal opposition to the death penalty. Whatever anyone's view is of the death penalty is not relevant when a matter comes before the Court, if the intent of the Founders and the Constitution itself says that the death penalty is constitutional. What a personal view is--for or against it--is irrelevant. Yet, decisions were made because of their personal opposition to the death penalty. That is judicial activism. 
Evidently taking their cue from Supreme Court Justices who feel free to ignore the plain meaning of the Constitution, judges on the Federal courts of appeals have also engaged in what amounts to legislating from the bench. 
More examples: 
Two U.S. courts of appeals--the ninth and the second circuits--have discovered in the post-Civil War 14th amendment a heretofore unknown constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide. They have just discovered this. 
Now, that is a pretty bizarre reading of the 14th amendment that simply cannot be justified by the language, it cannot be justified by the meaning, and it cannot be justified even by the history of the constitutional provisions in question. Yet, the ninth and second circuits, two U.S. courts of appeals, have discovered that, now, in this post-Civil War 14th amendment, we now have a constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide. Where does it say that in the Constitution? It doesn't matter to these judges whether it says it or not. Likewise, Federal district judges have repeatedly abused their authority by blocking the implementation of entirely constitutional measures enacted through State ballot referenda simply because they disagree with the policy judgments of the voters. Now, again, that is not the role of a Federal judge. Just since 1996, a single Federal district judge, who had been an activist with the ACLU before going on the bench, blocked the implementation of the California civil rights initiative. However you feel about the initiative, for or against, isn't the issue. The California voters passed it in the State. Earlier this month, in reversing the judge's order, the U.S. Court of Appeals made the compelling comment that `A system which permits one judge to block, with a stroke of a pen, what 4,736,180 State residents voted to enact as law, tests the integrity of our constitutional democracy.' 
Who said that, because a judge is appointed to a court of the Federal Government, they are omnipotent, that they are flawless, that they are perfect? I don't recall that in the Constitution. I don't recall that in the discussions of the Founders. Judges are human beings, and they can be wrong. Consider the Dred Scott case in 1857, if you think judges are perfect. There will be some out there, probably from the American Bar Association, who will notify me over the weekend, or on Monday, that they are, because I am sure they are opposed to this amendment. But in 1857, the Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney was sitting on the Court when a black former slave by the name of Dred Scott tried to bring a case before the Supreme Court for his freedom. Taney wrote the deciding majority decision, and he said Dred Scott couldn't sue in Federal Court because he was `property,' not a human being. Now, was that Justice right in that decision? No, he was not right, but he did it and there was no recourse because he was a lifetime appointee. 
There are many more examples, Mr. President, of activist judges who have taken control of prisons and school districts. There was the famous Kansas City case, where a judge raised the taxes of the city of Kansas City to pay for school busing. Activist judges have ordered tax increases, and they have created new rules to protect criminal defendants that result in killers, rapists, and other violent criminals being turned loose to continue to prey on society. 
Almost every time you hear about some horrible murder, a violent crime against another member of our society, almost every time, if you read below the headline, you will find that this person was out on parole, or was released by a judge and given a second chance. He probably had a difficult childhood, so we have to give him another chance to kill or rape somebody else, or beat somebody else up, or abuse some child. We have to give him a third chance and a fourth chance. Time and time and time again, over the last 30, 40 years, these judges have put these animals back on the street to prey on us and prey on us and prey on us. But they are perfect, these judges--lifetime, no touch; you can't do anything about it. It is time, Mr. President, that we stop it. 
Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese estimates that over 100,000 criminal cases each year cannot be successfully prosecuted because of these court-created rules. You can't even prosecute some of these people because of these rules. Judicial activism has become such a severe problem that one of the leaders of the House, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, has even suggested that we ought to consider using the constitutional power of impeachment to remove activist Federal judges from office. 
Now, I understand Congressman DeLay's concern. It is a justifiable concern, but I think there is a better way to do this, which is to limit their terms--limit their terms. That way, after a Federal judge has served 10 years--and that is what my amendment does, limit the term to 10 years--if the President wants to reappoint a judge who does some of these horrible things I have talked about, and that person can get through the Senate confirmation process, good luck. But at least we would have had the opportunity, as the elected representatives of the American people, to say, hold on, this person has made decisions that are ridiculous and we are not going to tolerate it. 
The term limits for judges amendment would end the life tenure for judges on the district court, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court--all three levels of the Federal judiciary. They would be nominated by the President, and with the advice and consent of the Senate they would be appointed for 10-year terms. They could be reappointed. The good thing about this proposal, Mr. President, is that no President of the United States would have the opportunity to reappoint a judge because, as we all know, the President's term is limited to two terms, 8 years. He or she could also serve up to an additional 2 years of a President who left office, if that person were the Vice President. So the maximum they could serve would be 9 years and 364 days. Therefore, that same President would not have the opportunity to reappoint a judge. 
Now, my amendment does not remove current judges from office--we do have a grandfather clause--but it would get things started, and we would begin to have this opportunity to see some change. 
Activist judges are routinely violating the separation of powers by usurping legislative and executive powers. This is a widespread abuse of judicial authority, and it is serious enough to warrant a constitutional response. Term limits for judges would establish a check on the power of activist judges, and no longer could they abuse their authority with impunity. Under the term limits for judges amendment, judges who used their offices by imposing their own policy views, instead of interpreting the laws in good faith, could be passed over for new terms by the President, or rejected for reappointment by the Senate if the President persisted in offering the name up. 
The term limits for judges amendment would make the President and the Senate more accountable to the people for their judicial selections. Now, you are going to hear the argument--and probably many listening to me now are already thinking it--that `this is just going to interject politics; politics is now going to be in all the court decisions, and all judges are going to make decisions based on politics so they can be reappointed.' 
Stop and think about that argument. If a judge is good and if a judge is honest and has integrity and makes a decision in his or her mind based on what is right, under the Constitution, if that's the case--and I would think that all of us would like to think that every judge fits that mold--but if that's the case, then, why would a judge make a different decision if that judge knew they were only going to be there for 10 years or life? What difference does it make? The point is, if they are good and they think it is a right decision under the law, then you make your decision whether you are going to be there 1 day or 100 years. What difference does it make? 
The opposite has happened, Mr. President. What has happened now is that judges, knowing that they can't be touched, knowing that they have a lifetime appointment, are now making decisions that are political. They are imposing their will upon the American people, rather than actually judging the Constitution and interpreting the Constitution as the Founding Fathers suggested. 
With all due respect to the criticism, the modern-day judiciary is too independent and too unaccountable to the taxpayers and to the people who pay their salaries and pay for their courthouses all over America. They are insulated by life tenure and free, for all intents and purposes, from any threat of impeachment. You have to commit a high crime to be removed from office as a Federal judge; we all know that. Very few judges in history have had that happen. 
These activist judges, because of almost impunity, feel free to impose their political will on all of us, without having to answer to anybody. I believe that judges appointed for 10-year terms would be far more likely to follow that law rather than imposing their political will. The best way to go for a judge serving a 10-year term, who would like to serve another 10, would be to follow the law and not his or her own political agenda. Follow the law. That is what we put you on the bench to do, to follow the law. That applies to a conservative judge as well as a liberal judge. No conservative agenda, no liberal agenda. Follow the law. If you follow the law, you will get reappointed. If you don't follow the law and you follow your agenda, you don't. 
It is interesting, when you talk to those who oppose this amendment, they are very aggressive in saying, `Well, these judges are fine people and you are impugning the integrity of judges.' There will always be--unless Congress changes it--nine slots on the Supreme Court. The world is not going to come to an end if one judge leaves and another takes his or her place. We are not irreplaceable. So that is not a valid argument. It is very bogus. If one judge leaves--or if it is the Supreme Court, one Justice leaves--another judge or Justice takes his or her place. 
So what? It doesn't have to be the same person for life making these decisions. 
So, Mr. President, I just want to notify my colleagues that I welcome their support. I don't expect the door to be beaten down over the next few days. But I am going to be very, very aggressive and very, very persistent in taking this case to the American people that it is time for a change in our Constitution. No one wants to amend the Constitution unless it is absolutely necessary. But I think if every American citizen would look at what has happened with some of these outrageous judicial decisions by activist judges who have gone far beyond what the intent of the Constitution was, they would recognize that it is time for a change. 
Hamilton said it, Madison said it, and Jefferson said it; three pretty distinguished Founding Fathers, if I do say so myself. They warned us. I read for you their quotes. We know how they felt. 
I think it is time that we pursue this. I intend to take this case to the American people because I have seen polls on this that indicate that over 85 percent of the American people support term limits for judges. We have term limits for the Presidents. A lot of people favor trying to pass term limits for Members of Congress. Why not term limits for judges? Why does the world come to an end, and why does constitutional democracy of the United States of America come to an end because we don't have lifetime judges? That is ridiculous. The argument is silly. 
The Founding Fathers warned us on the possibility of this. And some will say, `OK. Why didn't they put in the Constitution that we have term limits?' Because they could not possibly imagine what judges would have done in the past 200 years. 
But I guarantee that if Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison could vote today they would be voting for this amendment, and they would be supporting this amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Evelyn Marconi of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, for being honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Rotary Club of Portsmouth. 
Evelyn has been my friend for more than a decade. I can think of no one more deserving of the recognition she is receiving by the Portsmouth Rotary Club. 
She has given her life to public and community service. Evelyn has served on the Portsmouth City Council for 10 years, four of those years as assistant mayor. In 1989 she was nominated for the prestigious Norris Cotton Republican of The Year Award. 
Evelyn has also been a cornerstone of business in Portsmouth and is known to everyone as she owns and operates the landmark Geno's Coffee Shop. In 1980 former U.S. Senator Gordon Humphrey recognized Evelyn's business leadership and appointed her as a delegate to the Small Business Conference where she participated in the Women in Business and Capital Formation and Retention. She also was a delegate to the New Hampshire Constitutional Convention. 
Evelyn's community involvements range from organizing fundraisers to keeping the local Pierce Island Pool open for the children, to being a member of several foundations, committees and executive boards and serving as the first woman president of the Navy League of the United States. 
Among her neighbors Evelyn is known as a compassionate and concerned person who makes chicken soup for the sick, helps out with babysitting and works to secure anonymous donations of food or clothing for the underprivileged. Evelyn has been known to go out in a blizzard to deliver food to shut-ins when the city's `meals on wheels' was canceled due to bad weather. 
Evelyn is always willing to take responsibility, whether to organize rides to the cancer treatment center for local patients, giving rides on election day to any voter, chairing committees or helping people in need. Whatever she commits to, she always does an outstanding job. 
Mr. President, Evelyn has dedicated her time, talent and energy to serving the residents of Portsmouth in an exemplary way. I am proud to know Evelyn, and to honor her outstanding community commitment, which is so important to the future and prosperity of Portsmouth. We are indeed indebted to Evelyn for her efforts in business, public service and community dedication. Congratulations to my friend, Evelyn Marconi, for this distinguished recognition. I am honored to represent her in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for his tremendous leadership on this matter. He has been steadfast. I have been in a number--several hours and days--of meetings with him as he has tried very hard to get this treaty into a position where it could be acceptable to some of us--to all of us. But in this case, Mr. President, I have to maintain my opposition to this convention. 
Contrary to the assertions of its proponents, this treaty will not advance our national interests, and as a Member of the U.S. Senate, I must put the national and sovereignty interests above all others when it comes to votes here on the Senate floor. This is a flawed accord that will undermine our security and create a massive, unfunded regulatory burden on U.S. companies. And the Senate should reject it. 
Let me make clear, I do not object to the goal of eliminating chemical weapons, although those of us who have taken a position in opposition to this treaty will be accused of that, and have been. In fact, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I have consistently supported funding for our Nation's chemical demilitarization program. Certainly, we all support the goal of eliminating chemical weapons. 
But this treaty will not accomplish that goal. Sometimes we forget that fact as we debate these issues that have a great-sounding name. It does not even come close. For the benefit of my colleagues, I want to highlight some of the most egregious problems with this treaty. 
First of all, it is not a global treaty. Its advocates would have you believe that it is. It is not global. In fact, many nations believed to have active chemical weapons programs, such as Iraq, Libya, North Korea, and Syria, have not even signed on to the treaty and they are not bound by any provisions. 
Additionally, other confirmed or suspected chemical weapons nations, such as India, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia, have signed the treaty but do not seem very likely to ratify it or even comply with it. 
For the life of me, I cannot understand how anyone could possibly stand here on the floor of the U.S. Senate and say this is a global treaty if the most heinous anti-American regimes on the face of the Earth are not even a party to it. They are going to be making chemical weapons, and nobody can do anything about it. That is like saying we have a global treaty outlawing terrorism, but Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Lebanon are not a part of it. Why not have another treaty and outlaw terrorism? Well intended; great goal. Why not just pass a treaty and we will outlaw it? That will be the end of it. 
It is absurd, not to mention patently false, to allege that this Chemical Weapons Convention is a global treaty. Iraq used chemical weapons on its own citizens in the last decade--on its own people. How can we have a global treaty banning chemical weapons without Iraq? Could somebody please answer that question for me? It is not global. And we are not banning chemical weapons in Iraq. We are inspecting the devil out of Iraq and we still do not know what they are doing and what they can and cannot do. 
Mr. President, not only is this treaty not global, it is not verifiable according to the U.S. intelligence community, not according to Senator Smith, but the U.S. intelligence community. 
In testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee, former Director of Central Intelligence, James Woolsey stated:  
The chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale. 
This is not exactly a ringing endorsement for this treaty, particularly when it is coming from a person who is representing an administration that supports it and that is bringing it here to the Senate. Let us be honest, there is no way we are going to be able to verify compliance, and everybody on this floor knows it. The proponents, as well as the opponents, know that. 
The United Nations Special Commission on Iraq was established following the gulf war to oversee the dismantling of Iraq's chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons programs. There have been over 1,000 inspectors searching every nook and cranny in Iraq for the past 5 years, yet we continue to uncover new evidence and new revelations regarding Iraq's programs to develop weapons of mass destruction. 
I say to my colleagues on the floor, now that you have seen all these inspections, you all feel very comfortable, I am sure. Now you have the full knowledge that Iraq does not have any chemical weapons or any biological weapons or any nuclear weapons. Everybody feels real comfortable with that. We have inspected them, so everybody is certain. Right. 
Iraq is the most heavily monitored and inspected country on 
Earth. We have more access to Iraq than the chemical weapons treaty will ever provide for any country. If we cannot determine after 5 years just how large and sophisticated Iraq's chemical weapons program is, how on Earth are we going to be able to verify compliance for the dozens and dozens of countries supposedly bound by this treaty? The answer is simple. We cannot. We are not going to be able to do it. 
We will move into classified session later on, tomorrow, to more fully examine the intelligence community's assessment. I urge my colleagues to come to that session and listen to the facts from our intelligence community. 
Noncompliance is not something to take lightly. Without adherence by all parties, no treaty is worth the paper it is written on--never has been, never will be. But we cannot verify this treaty. We know for a fact that some of its signatories have routinely and repeatedly violated other treaties in the past. So they have a track record. 
Russia has the world's largest chemical weapons arsenal. The former Soviet Union routinely violated its arms control obligations whenever it was convenient, whenever it was in their best interest. Russia remains in violation of the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention and the CFE treaty. Thus, it is clear that the cold war pattern of noncompliance did not end when the Soviet Union ended. 
Russia has also made clear that it has no intention of ratifying the chemical weapons treaty or complying with its provisions unless the United States provides a massive aid package to pay for destruction of its arsenal. Mr. President, where I come from in New Hampshire, this is called blackmail. That is what it is. And I object to it. We are already committed to spending $12 billion to eliminate our own chemical weapons arsenal. Are we supposed to foot the bill for Russia's as well now? 
Let us not forget we are already giving Russia billions of dollars in ransom for the START I and START II treaties, even though they have yet to ratify START II. With the hard-line Communists and nationalists gaining 33 percent of Parliament seats in the recent Russian elections, can anyone actually believe that this situation is likely to improve? I do not think so. 
Russia is not implementing the 1990 bilateral destruction agreement in which it pledged to substantially reduce its chemical weapons arsenal. The DIA stated Russia is moving so slowly that no meaningful reduction of its arsenal is likely to occur in the next decade. These are facts that the proponents do not want you to hear, Mr. President. The DIA has expressed skepticism regarding the veracity of Russia's data declarations. It appears highly likely that Russia has grossly underreported its chemical weapons arsenal. 
Finally, it has been widely reported in the international publications that Russia is developing new binary weapons that are highly lethal, yet contained none of the chemicals--none of the chemicals--listed on the treaty's schedules. If this is true, Russia will be capable of circumventing this treaty in a very significant and, frankly, destabilizing way. We will be considering this issue in more detail during the closed session, but I want to say here and now that this is a very, very big problem and it ought to be looked at very closely. 
It gives me no pleasure to take the floor of the Senate and raise these troubling issues. I would like to be for this treaty. I wish it banned all chemical weapons. But the fact of the matter is, it does not, and I have a constitutional responsibility to look carefully at these issues and act in a manner that I believe advances our national security. 
This treaty is deeply flawed--deeply flawed. No amount of public relations spin, no amount of pressure from the White House or from anybody else can change that issue. Certainly it is not going to change this Senator's mind. 
I know that many of my colleagues think that since the cold war is over arms control issues do not matter anymore. I know many Members who would just as soon focus on issues that seem to be drawing more attention in the polls. But as the stewards of national security, we do not have that luxury. We cannot afford to sweep these issues under the rug for the convenience of political expediency. 
Mr. President, in addition to these important national security considerations, I want to highlight for my colleagues the enormous burden that this treaty will place on U.S. businesses. Under the treaty, there would be two basic types of inspections: routine and challenge. Routine inspections are to be directed at sites producing chemicals that present the greatest risk of diversion to weapons uses. A nation could be subject to up to 20 routine inspections per year, and a specific site up to two routine inspections. Challenge inspections would occur by request by a party to the treaty and can take place with very little advance notice. There is no limit to the number of challenge inspections that can take place. 
The United States also, Mr. President, will be obligated to pay 25 percent of the operating expenses of this organization. Does that sound familiar? Think of the United Nations and other 
international organizations where we wind up footing most of the bill. Membership on the Executive Council is determined by a rotating regional formula, with the majority of seats allocated to third world countries. The United States would not necessarily be represented on the council at all times and there is no U.S. veto, as there is in the U.N. Security Council. 
This represents a new open-ended entitlement for another United Nations-style bureaucracy. I cannot believe that we are going to agree to pay 25 percent of the cost when we are having so much difficulty injecting fiscal discipline into the existing foreign aid bureaucracy which Senator Helms has been trying to change for years. Why should we pay such a grossly disproportionate percentage when Russia, who has the world's largest stockpile, pays 5.6 percent--while we pay the 25 percent? 
It is estimated that somewhere between 3,000 and 8,000 companies, perhaps more, will be affected by this treaty--3,000 to 8,000 U.S. companies. The treaty creates a massive program of reporting requirements for companies, companies that produce or use regulated chemicals. 
I would ask my colleagues, do you really think the rogue nations, the North Koreas, the Libyas, the Irans, or the Iraqs, and others, are going to be subject to this? Do you really think they care that we are harassing our own companies? They are probably getting a good laugh out of it, Mr. President. 
The individual companies are required to assume all costs associated with this compliance, including filings, escort and administration of routine inspections, challenge inspections, and in some circumstances, American businesses may even be required to shut down production during the inspection period. Failure to comply with the regulations could result in a company being fined up to $50,000 per incident--per incident. 
The Defense Department has estimated the cost imposed on a company with a large facility could be as high as $500,000 per inspection, while small businesses should expect inspections to cost between $10,000 and $20,000, all on U.S. businesses on something that does not ban chemical weapons in other countries. 
Each international inspection team will be accompanied by representatives of the U.S. Government. According to the administration, it is possible the representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency and OSHA could also serve as escorts to come into your business and have a good look at what we you are doing--maybe something very personal, very private, something you would not want your competitors to have. But under the treaty, the EPA can walk right in, have access to the whole facility, perhaps even take a few samples, a few products. Who knows--take some records. 
It is clear, Mr. President, that this treaty and the accompanying implementing legislation that the administration has requested represents a massive, unfunded mandate on U.S. businesses. It is staggering. I cannot believe that this Senate is prepared to do this injustice to businesses here in America and, frankly, injustice to ourselves as a nation. At a time when your constituents are crying out for relief from onerous and burdensome regulations, here we go again. The problem is, other nations who get to inspect our facilities have a lot more to gain than we do by inspecting theirs. The limited military-related intelligence that we may gain is far outweighed by the industrial and commercial intelligence that other nations will derive from our companies. That is why nations like Iran are signing on to this treaty, because they want that information. They will have access to that information, if not directly, certainly indirectly even if they are not one of the inspectors. 
Most chemical manufacturers have not considered the effect of this treaty. Frankly, I am disappointed in some of those manufacturers because they have not thought it through. But they will be back, Mr. President. If we pass this, they will be back and they will be back with tears in their eyes because they are going to be very, very sorry that they supported this treaty. 
In fact, I know of one example where an individual called my office purporting to represent the CMA in support of the treaty. 
When questioned on the details of the treaty and the implications for U.S. businesses, the individual became frustrated, claimed ignorance, and stated that the CMA told him to make the calls. He admitted not knowing much about the treaty and quickly ended the call. That is pretty sad, Mr. President. 
If that is the kind of expertise being brought to bear in this lobbying campaign we are faced with, I think it raises more serious questions as to the merit and true nature of this endorsement by CMA. 
Additionally, while CMA's support is an important factor to consider, it is important to recognize that CMA does not even represent a majority of the businesses affected by the treaty. According to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, 60 percent of the companies affected by the treaty are not CMA members. 
In fact, most of these non-CMA companies are smaller businesses who are most likely to be harmed by the increased regulatory burden. They have the most to lose. Yet, they are the ones that are overlooked by the treaty's proponents. 
Mr. President, since last fall, when the Clinton administration abruptly requested that the Senate defer consideration of the treaty, I have worked very closely with my colleagues in the Senate, including Senator Kyl and Senator Helms and others. I have attended numerous meetings with the President's National Security Adviser to explore possible conditions to protect U.S. national security, and, to their credit, the administration and others did work hard to address many of those concerns, and many have been addressed. But there are still some that I just cannot, in good faith, allow to go unchallenged. 
In the end, we are not able to agree on all of these issues. That is the nature of democracy. We discuss issues, debate policy, find common ground, and compromise where we can. We compromised 28 times. 
It is important to understand, though, that reasonable people can and do disagree on the merits of this treaty. I want to make it very clear that I have no problem with any of my colleagues in terms of how they arrived at their votes. That is their vote, and I respect that, I recognize that. In fact, it is healthy. While I strongly oppose this treaty, I don't impugn anyone's motives or character for taking an opposing viewpoint. Having said that, it is regrettable that those of us deeply troubled by the lack of participation in this treaty by Iran, Syria, Libya, and North Korea, and by the inherent unverifiability of the treaty, by the fact that nations such as Iran will gain access to sensitive data on our chemical defenses. Now, people have said that is not going to happen. Well, we will see. If this treaty passes, we will see, because they can be part of the inspection team and can have access to that information. 
Anyway, we are accused of being somehow in favor of chemical weapons because we take this position. It seems that when those of us who are conservatives want to stand by our principles, we are `crazy people' or something. But when you are liberal and you stand by your principles, you are thoughtful and considerate and compassionate. Well, maybe I am missing something somewhere. 
It is very easy for the media and the advocates of the treaty to demagog this issue. Some in the media have demagoged it. Some in the media in my own State are demagoging me and the treaty. That is their prerogative. But they are not here on the Senate floor--I am. Some in the media in my State may not like that fact, but I am here as an elected representative for the State of New Hampshire. I am sworn to uphold the Constitution and to defend the national security interests of the United States. Yes, if there is a treaty violating those, I am going to be opposed to it. 
While I wholeheartedly support the objective of banning chemical weapons, this doesn't ban chemical weapons. If somebody can stand up here and tell me how we are going to get access to all of Iraq and be certain that we are not going to have chemical weapons there, and all of Libya and North Korea, and can prove that 
to me, I will support the treaty. That is why we have this amendment, this provision on rogue nations. I don't believe this requires that the Senate rubber stamp any treaty dealing with chemical weapons. We have some very respected people, including four former Secretaries of Defense--that was testified to here before--who oppose this treaty. 
In the medical world, the wrong medicine can kill a patient even if it is prescribed with the best of intentions. The same holds true with national security. I have no doubt that the advocates of CWC believe that it will cure the plague of chemical weapons. But that is the wrong medicine and it won't work. 
I want to conclude my remarks by summarizing some of the more important arguments against this treaty. 
First, it is not global. 
Second, it is not effectively verifiable. 
Third, there are no technical means to detect undeclared stockpiles of chemical agents or weapons. 
Many of those who have signed the treaty are either unlikely to ratify it or to comply. Does anybody really believe that Iran will be a responsible party to this treaty? When is the last time we had access to all of the countryside in Iran and all of the industry and buildings in Iran? Why should we believe that this treaty is going to make us do that? 
Article X of the treaty will require us to share detailed information on our own chemical weapons defenses with all other signatories to the treaty, good and bad signatories to the treaty, friends and enemies. 
Thousands of U.S. businesses, many of them vulnerable small businesses, will be exposed to costly annual reporting requirements that they can't afford. Direct costs to U.S. industry are estimated to be over $200 million a year. 
It goes on and on and on, Mr. President. It is just incredible. 
Challenge inspections, which basically you could not do under our Constitution, are unlimited in number and may violate the fourth amendment, which guarantees the rights of individuals and their property against unreasonable search and seizure. 
Mr. President, it is clear that this treaty falls short of achieving its objectives and its goals. In fact, it doesn't even come close. As we will see later in the classified session, the stakes are high. We have little to gain and a great deal to lose. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this treaty. I yield the floor.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Jane McCaffery, a teacher at Lincoln Street School and Main Street School in Exeter, NH, on receiving the Continental Cablevision's 1997 National Educator Award. 
As a former teacher myself, I commend her outstanding accomplishment and well-deserved honor. 
Continental Cablevision designed the Educator Award program in 1989 to encourage teachers to use Cable in the Classroom, a cable industry initiative which provides schools with free cable connections and access to more than 500 hours of commercial-free educational programming each month. Jane was chosen for this distinguished honor from among educators in all of the communities that Continental Cablevision serves in New Hampshire. 
Under the direction of Jane, Exeter elementary students, teachers and their work are showcased in `Booktalk,' an ambitious weekly cable TV program. The program encourages students to read and invites families to participate in activities related to their children's reading. It also raises community awareness about the elementary curriculum. Jane and an Australian crocodile puppet explore one curriculum theme each week and feature a reading by teachers, students or guests, ideas for families to further pursue the learning theme, and many creative presentations. 
New Hampshire has always been fortunate to have many talented teachers, but Jane McCaffery is certainly a role model among the teachers of the Granite State. I am proud of her commitment to education and congratulate her superb achievement. It is an honor to represent her in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1003, the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997. 
I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S. 304, the Senate companion bill to H.R. 1003. As a cosponsor, I was especially gratified to learn of the overwhelming bipartisan vote of 398 to 16 by which H.R. 1003 passed the House of Representatives on April 10, 1997. 
With its resounding votes to pass both the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act and H.R. 1122, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997, the House of Representatives has taken two major actions aimed at restoring respect for the sanctity of human life in our great Nation. I trust that in the weeks ahead, the Senate will join the House by passing both of these bills by large majorities and sending them to the President. 
Mr. President, before he passed away last November, Joseph Cardinal Bernadin left a moving testimony to the sanctity of life. `I am at the end of my earthly life,' Chicago's Cardinal wrote in a letter addressed to the U.S. Supreme Court. `Our legal and ethical tradition has held consistently that suicide, assisted-suicide, and euthanasia are wrong because they involve a direct attack on innocent human life,' Cardinal Bernadin continued. `Creating a new `right' to assisted suicide,' the Cardinal concluded, `will . . . send a false signal that a less than perfect life is not worth living.' 
Mr. President, by enacting H.R. 1003, the Congress will be moving to defend the sanctity of human life by preventing the use of Federal funds and facilities to provide and promote assisted suicide. This is indeed a worthy goal and I am honored to be a part of this effort.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today I am introducing what I believe to be a very sensible piece of legislation which will allow a number of members of the clergy of all faiths to participate in the Social Security Program. Before 1968 a minister was exempt from Social Security coverage unless he or she chose to elect that coverage, and in 1968 ministers were covered by Social Security unless they filed an irrevocable exemption from the IRS on the grounds that they were opposed on basic religious principles to participate in any public insurance program. So a member of the clergy who is eligible for this exemption is an `individual who is duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed member of a church, or a member of a religious order which has not taken a vow of poverty.' 
About 260,000 ministers are affected by this exclusion. This legislation which I have offered would simply permit ministers and the few members of religious orders who have not taken a vow of poverty to secure that coverage. Modestly paid clergy would be among those most likely to need Social Security benefits when they retire. But earlier in their careers many chose not to participate in the program. They had good intentions. They were doing it on principle. But they didn't fully understand the ramifications of the exemption. Since 1968--once in 1977 and another time in 1986--ministers were given a temporary opportunity to revoke their exemption from Social Security; that is, they would have the opportunity to have a window whereby they could come back under the Social Security System. 
This was brought to my attention by the distinguished bishop in Manchester, NH, Reverend Bishop O'Neil. He brought this matter to my attention--that there are a number of hardships for individuals who may or may not have any retirement income as a result of this. 
So this legislation simply provides another open season, a 2-year period whereby those who are clergy who may wish now to be under the Social Security System may take advantage of this opportunity to revoke their exemption. 
That is all the bill does, and I think it is fair in that again these are very principled members of the cloth who have decided now that they would like to have the opportunity to get into the program. 
So it is a 2-year open season during which the members of the clergy could opt into the system. The application for benefits must be filed before the clergy member can become entitled to benefits, and those who choose coverage would be subject to self-employment taxes. And their earnings would be credited for Social Security and for Medicare purposes. And, of course, no one who is at retirement age now would be allowed in. These would be people who are not yet at the retirement age. 
Based on the experience in 1986 and the trends in the number of clergy since then, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that maybe as many as 1,500 to 1,600 members of the clergy would take advantage of the open season and enroll in Social Security. That is based on past performance. That is what happened in 1986. The bill was scored by the Congressional Budget Office. I have had it scored. It is a short-time revenue raiser because people would be paying into the system but, of course, it is going to ultimately be like any other Social Security beneficiary in the sense that we will be paying out more than comes in. 
This legislation has the endorsement of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops. It is an issue of fairness. I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this legislation which I would like to see passed this year so that we could begin the open season process so that members of the clergy could opt in now to the Social Security System. I hope that many of my colleagues will join me as quickly as possible in cosponsoring the legislation so that we can get it out of the Finance Committee and here on the floor so that we can begin to correct this inadequacy, this unfairness where many members of the clergy are affected.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank the 
Senator from Arizona for his kind words, and also for his cooperation in working with me on this issue. 
Mr. President, there were some concerns which I had raised, and they have been addressed thanks to the cooperation of Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, Senator Shelby, Senator Bob Kerrey, and certainly Sandy Berger with the National Security Council of the President of the United States. 
I think because of the willingness to address the concerns that I have raised we were able to resolve this matter tonight. 
Let me first of all say clearly and for all the world to see and know that this issue has never been about the qualifications of Pete Peterson to be the Ambassador to Vietnam. It has been about the accounting process and how best to go about getting a fullest possible accounting for our missing. 
In regard to former Congressman Pete Peterson, he was a POW in Vietnam for a number of years, suffered greatly at the hands of the Vietnamese, as did my colleague Senator McCain. I am sure the accommodations as Ambassador will be a little better than he had on his last trip over there as a POW. But I have worked with him on the United States-Russian Commission. I like him. I respect him. He is an honorable and decent man, and he will be I believe a good ambassador. 
My concerns have been addressed in the past on this floor in terms of the problems that I believe we have with the Vietnamese. I am hopeful now, with this clarification that we have been able to receive from the White House, and with the support of Senator McCain, Senator Shelby, and others, that Ambassador Pete Peterson will be able to seek this information and finally get this information from the Vietnamese. 
It has always been my concern that rather than to say that the Vietnamese are fully cooperating and then we will send an Ambassador over there, I think it is more honest to say we don't have all of the information, the Vietnamese can provide more information, and let's send the Ambassador over there to get it. I think that is more honest. I believe that is what we have resolved here tonight. 
Mr. Berger was kind enough to indicate by letter that the President commits to continue to press the Government of Vietnam to cooperate on full accounting, and that they have established the mechanisms to do it with the Vietnamese to provide information that the Vietnamese have only available to them. I interpret that to mean that there is a lot of information that the Vietnamese can unilaterally provide, as the League of Families has so often said under its leader, Andrew Griffiths, that we want the information whatever that may be that the Vietnamese can unilaterally provide. We all know, and I think this compromise indicates, that there is information still that the Vietnamese can unilaterally provide. I hope that the Ambassador will be able to encourage the Vietnamese, and finally hopefully persuade the Vietnamese to provide it. 
I want to be specific in four areas that I believe are the major areas of information. 
One, the Politburo records concerning U.S. POW's: These records are important. Vietnamese officials have not provided them. And we believe they can provide many of them. They may have lost some. But we think there are some they can provide. DOD analysts have testified under oath that access to these records has not been provided. 
So I hope that Ambassador Peterson will pursue that venue very directly with the Vietnamese. I have ever assurance that he will. 
Second, North Vietnamese military records on U.S. POW's and MIA's from the country of Laos: As you know, North Vietnam occupied Laos during the war. We lost a lot of American fliers in Laos during the war, and the Vietnamese have not been forthcoming about a lot of the shootdown records pertaining to U.S. losses in Laos. 
The so-called Group 559 shootdown record turned over in September 1993 contains only summary information, and the DOD analysts--not Senator Smith--have concluded that `It is clear that this record was compiled after the fact from original records.' So we need those original records. I hope that along the lines that the analysts have testified in their testimony last year that we would be able to get that information from the Vietnamese. 
It is clear that the Vietnamese did have direct knowledge of these losses. We know that. Hopefully now they will provide it. We deserve to know the fate of these United States POW's who were shot down in Laos and captured by the Vietnamese, and in some cases killed by the Vietnamese in this instance. But in the province in Northern Laos which I personally visited, none of them really in that area have been accounted for at all from the Communist side. We know that they have information because some of these people were captured and filmed. 
Third, the unilateral action by Vietnam in 461 cases unaccounted for: These are records that we believe based on our best information the Vietnamese could provide more data, and we have had testimony from again the intelligence community saying that they believe based on our information that they could get that information. 
Finally, Mr. President, the prison camp records pertaining to U.S. POW's: I think we are not interested in what somebody did as a POW or didn't do as a POW in getting those documents. They can be screened and carefully taken care of by the intelligence community, should we get them. What we are interested in is what happened to some of these people who were in the prison system who were not returned, who were seen on film and on tape--sometimes used for propaganda--and have never been accounted for. So we believe that the Vietnamese would know something about those people, and certainly what happened to them. We would hope that they would provide that information. 
So those are the four areas that I have focused on and on which I hope the Ambassador will focus on. I think that is what is referred to in the letter here from Mr. Berger. 
I think also when the Intelligence Committee--I thank Senator Shelby for his cooperation in this regard because basically he looked into this matter for me and we have now come to a conclusion that there is further information that the intelligence community really didn't have input into the certification process, and, therefore, they need to have that information. 
If you read the testimony on the House side and some other testimony where analysts have spoken, they have talked about the fact that this access is important, and there are two documents--the so-called 735 and 1205--that come out of the Russian archives which are very controversial. And we are now pursuing those in the United States-Russian Commission where Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, myself, and others were members, and Pete Peterson was a member. We are still pursuing that information. 
So I want to again conclude on a couple of points and then yield to anyone else who may wish to speak on this matter. 
Pete Peterson is an outstanding public servant. He served his country well. He went through hell in Vietnam, and the fact that he now is willing to go back and pursue information on POW's, on his fellow colleagues, POW's and MIA's, fellow comrades in arms, I think is a tribute to him and the type of person that he is. 
I want to say again what has been distorted, as usual in the media so many times, specifically the Boston Globe, and other places where apparently untruths were hyped by the papers, they had it all wrong. I was never opposed to Pete Peterson in any way, shape, or form being the Ambassador. My concern is with what I just addressed, which is we need to try to get the fullest possible accounting. We have not gotten the fullest possible accounting, and with the Ambassador going to Vietnam he will do that. I am all for it. 
Let me just also say in regard to Mr. Hoang, who I talked with who is now out of the country and is not here, I hope and believe that should Mr. Hoang come back into the country that he ought to come before the Governmental Affairs Committee and answer any and all questions put to him regarding not only Vietnam but anything else regarding these matters in terms of how policy was developed. But at this point he is not in the country to do that. 
So let me again thank everyone involved in working this decision out. One of the nicest things about the Senate, even though it is frustrating if you are on the other side of something, is that you get the opportunity to work together. 
I remember the first day I was on the floor in 1991. Senator Mitchell, then the majority leader, came over to me and introduced himself. He said, `Hello,' and said, `Bob, welcome. It is nice to have you. I wish we could have gotten a Democrat, but we got you. But let me just say this. We will work with you over here. It is not like the House, not because we want to but because we have to.' That is OK. I mean that is the way the process works here. When you have a concern, people on the other side work with you to get it resolved. You do the best you can, and sometimes it works out. And more often than not it does work out even though you take some flak. 
So I am very pleased with those on all sides of this issue who worked with me to address my concerns. Especially I am grateful to Sandy Berger who I called this morning and asked to prepare a letter. I gave him the concerns that I had. He responded before the end of the day to Senator Lott with the concerns that I raised. I can't thank him enough. 
I think the fact that the nomination will go through tonight is to a large extent due to the willingness of the administration, specifically Mr. Berger to address my concerns. I am very grateful to them for that. 
I wish Ambassador Peterson the best of luck. I look forward to working with him as Ambassador to Vietnam to get more information on our missing men and a few women in Vietnam.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to George Roorbach of Franconia, NH, former president of Crown Worsted Mills, for his outstanding service as a volunteer executive in Krasnodar, Russia. 
George worked on a volunteer mission with the International Executive Service Corps, a nonprofit organization which sends retired Americans to assist businesses and private enterprises in the developing countries and the new emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. 
George helped provide managerial and technical assistance to improve the lives of people in Krasnodar, Russia. He assisted Kubantex, a wool fabric manufacturer, to set up a business, marketing and financial plan. George was ambassador for our country and has represented our democratic believes and methods of a free market economy. 
His outstanding patriotic engagement provides active assistance for people in need and helps build strong ties of trust and respect between Russia and America. George's mission aids to end the cycle of dependency on foreign assistance. 
I commend George for his dedicated service and I am proud to represent him in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to 16 dedicated volunteers from New Hampshire who willingly devoted countless hours and tremendous energy to provide free medical and dental care to the people of the Dominican Republic. Last month, the volunteers of the Medical Mission Team traveled to the Dominican Republic where they operated free medical and dental clinics for a week and treated numerous people who normally cannot afford medical care. I commend all 16 volunteers for their genuine concern and true commitment to such an honorable cause. I am very proud of their unending support for the needy people of the Dominican Republic. 
Months of careful planning and preparation allowed the Medical Mission Team to venture into different areas of the Dominican Republic to treat a variety of patients. The team members included: Dr. Mark McDonald; his wife, Ruth; and daughter, Jill; Jack Meibaum; his wife, Joanne Parkington; and son, David Parkington; Dr. Marianne Hopkins; and her husband, Dr. Andrew Hopkins; Werner Muller; and David Gabrielli, all from Concord; Claire Roberge, of Epsom; Don Gagne, of Penacook; Doug Tabor, of Boscawen; Gordon Barrett, of West Swanzey; and Lisa Ann Wiener and George Rogers, both from Bow. 
Prior to the February mission trip, the volunteers met regularly in the evenings to learn minor medical care, repair pieces of dental equipment, build specially designed dental units, and plan the details of the clinics. Jack Meibaum, a contractor; Dr. Mark McDonald, a Concord dentist; and others salvaged old dental equipment and spent many hours in their basements updating and improving the equipment for the medical work they would perform. 
After discussing the trip with New Hampshire businesses and organizations, and several pharmaceutical companies, Jack and Mark solicited critical donations for the trip. The Bow Rotary Club donated funds for a dental equipment compressor, A & B Lumber in Concord sold the compressor to the team at cost, and the Concord Tire Co. generously gave donated money for medical and dental supplies. Siemens X-ray Co. also donated a portable dental x-ray machine and numerous national pharmaceutical companies provided free or discounted medical and dental supplies. In the end, the team had so many supplies that they even had difficulty getting the large, overstuffed suitcases of supplies through customs with the local officials at the Puerta Plata Airport in the Dominican Republic. 
Five of the volunteers--Mark, Jack, Doug Tabor, Don Gagne, and Claire Roberge--made up the first team to arrive. During their first 3 days, the team made daily trips to a small church in Moca where they worked tirelessly unpacking bulky dental equipment that had been shipped separately in a crate from New Hampshire. I was honored to have helped get this crate shipped to the Dominican Republic after the team asked for my assistance. 
In addition to numerous other tasks, Jack and Mark set up the portable dental units making certain the air and water pumps worked on the dental units while Don, Claire, and Doug constructed a stand for the indispensable dental light. Doug's construction expertise was very helpful, Jack and Mark demonstrated their engineering brilliance in building equipment, and Claire and Don were energetic and happy to do even the most mundane tasks. All five volunteers 
worked until they were exhausted to ensure the equipment would run efficiently when used for the clinics the following week. 
The remaining team members arrived on Friday, February 21, bringing more medical supplies, and helped make the final preparations for the long-awaited clinics. 
For an entire week, the medical and dental teams treated the needs of numerous Dominican patients. Jack cleaned teeth for hours, Mark and Don filled cavities, and Jill, Lisa, and David sterilized dental equipment and developed dental x rays. At the medical clinic locations, Marianne, a pediatrician, and her husband, Andrew, who is also a doctor, treated endless lines of needy patients rarely taking a break even for lunch. Mothers came in with babies that had parasites, an elderly man complained of arthritis, a young boy's cut and infected feet were cleaned, two little girls were treated for asthma, and other sick Dominicans asked for assistance. Joanne, Claire, Werner, and George worked quickly to compile each patient's medical history and check their temperature and blood pressure. The medical team had prepared so thoroughly that they even brought preprinted medical charts. Lisa, Jill, David, and Ruth performed a puppet show for the waiting children and Gordon, a professional photographer, documented everyone's efforts. The demand for dental and medical care was truly overwhelming. The team worked long hours each day to ease the pain and anxiety of so many people. 
On the first day of the medical clinic, a young woman came in with her very sick 2-year-old boy. According to his mother, the little boy had cut his head while playing in one of the typically filthy ditches that carried trash and sewage. He was sick from an infection. Twice during the next 2 days, Marianne treated the little boy for the terrible infection that had spread through his body. The medical team was very concerned that he would not be able to fight off the infection until Tuesday morning when Marianne could hook him up to an IV. They had witnessed their worst fear--a dying child. 
Just 2 days later in the morning, as the medical team had just set up a second clinic in Moca, the little boy made an appearance. He walked into the clinic with his mother following behind. Upon seeing the phenomenal progress the little boy had made, the entire medical team began clapping exuberantly. Soon the clapping changed to cheers and words of relief that echoed their greatest feeling of accomplishment--saving a life. I was very impressed with this story, relayed to me by one of my staffers, Anna Matz, who volunteered her time to participate in the mission. 
For a over a week, these New Hampshire volunteers poured endless energy into helping the many Dominicans that ventured into the clinics. Their work was exhausting but very fulfilling. Toward the end of the week, the dental and medical clinics became mobile and operated in neighborhoods where children and families were the most sick. At one point, the medical team went into a barrio, a very poor neighborhood, and knocked on each door asking if any family members needed medical care. 
While the 16 New Hampshire volunteers worked day after day, several American missionaries and a few native Dominicans provided support and assistance. Paul and Eileen Allyn, American missionaries in Santa Domingo, oversaw the teams' every need with Marge and John Gudmunsun, other missionaries. Denny, Rafael, and Vladimir, young Dominican men, accompanied the team as translators and provided an occasional laugh. 
Many Dominicans, for whom pain is a way of life, got a little relief last month as these dedicated New Hampshire citizens gave their time, devotion and compassion to the needy people of this Caribbean island. I am proud of their work and congratulate them on a job well done. They truly embody the real spirit of voluntarism, and I am proud and honored to represent them in the U.S. Senate.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a fellow Navy man, Capt. Giles Roderick Norrington, who will be reaching a milestone this Friday, March 14, 1997--the 24th anniversary of his release from captivity in North Vietnam. 
On May 5, 1968, Captain Norrington was shot down on a reconnaissance mission over North Vietnam while piloting his RA5C aircraft. He was held in various prisons in North Vietnam where he endured great physical and mental hardships as a POW for 5 years. During those difficult times, Captain Norrington and his fellow POW's never lost faith in their country. They persevered and they returned with honor. All Americans owe these brave men a great debt of gratitude for their sacrifices on our behalf. 
Indeed, Captain Norrington's service and loyalty to his country has been commendable, not just during his captivity in North Vietnam, but throughout his 34 years of active duty naval service. After his retirement from the Navy, he dedicated himself to his community as an outstanding member of the Rotary Club of Bailey's Crossroads in the State of Virginia. Recently, his fellow Rotarians expressed their continued support for Captain Norrington by electing him as their next vice-president. 
On Friday, March 14, 1997, Captain Norrington will be surrounded by his family and close friends who will be gathering to pay tribute to him. As a Vietnam veteran who also served in the Navy, I consider it an honor and privilege to share in this tribute, and I look forward to thanking Captain Norrington personally for his heartfelt service to our great Nation and to his own community.

Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maine for yielding. I take this opportunity to thank Senator Hatch for his tremendous leadership, day after day, on the floor of the Senate, leading the battle on behalf of the American people and for the future generations of America who are going to have to pay the price if we don't get this done. If we lose this vote today by one vote, which is what the predictions are, and projections, then the headline tomorrow should be: `It Was Business as Usual in Washington Again. The American People Lost.' 
Mr. President, 80 percent of the American people want the budget balanced. If you think, in 1969, the last time we had a balanced budget, the year after that the debt was $369 billion, and the people said then, `We don't need an amendment, all we need to do is get the job done, have the courage to do it.' The debt is now $5.3 trillion. 
The President says we do not need an amendment; we just have to have the courage to do it. He submits a budget to us out of balance which will add half a trillion dollars to the debt in the next 5 years, $70 billion out of balance in the last year. It is business as usual in Washington.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the New Hampshire Pearl Harbor Survivors Association. Those brave men stood tall in perhaps one of the most tragic moments in American history. Against overwhelming odds, these great Americans fought to defend the United States. Their heroic actions were an inspiration to the people of the United States and help propel our Nation to victory in World War II. 
Mr. President, I wish to honor the New Hampshire Pearl Harbor Survivors on the occasion of their 25th anniversary. They are our American heros and we applaud them for defending our country. I also wish to commend these brave men for touring New Hampshire schools and talking to our young Americans in an effort to keep Pearl Harbor memories and history alive. Those who fought in the war and were victims of the Pearl Harbor attack deserve a special place in our history books. 
My father was a Navy pilot who died in a war-related incident during World War II. I have a special place in my heart for these courageous men. 
When United States Army and Navy commanders in the Pacific area had received a final war warning on the 27th of November 1941, Hawaii was not mentioned and American authorities thought that the Philippines or Malaysia would be the possible target. Any potential attack on Pearl Harbor was therefore interpreted as a form of sabotage and no effective security patrol was established. Antiaircraft batteries around the harbor consequently had no ready ammunition and USAAF aircraft on the ground were easy targets as they were unarmed and grouped together on airfields for easier protection against saboteurs. 
On Saturday, December 6, 1941, many Army and Navy personnel were on the usual weekend shore leave when the destroyer Ward radioed that it had sunk a submarine early Sunday morning. The information, though, was delayed in reaching the high command and consequently the harbor gate had not been closed. 
At 7:55 a.m., on December 7, 1941 the first Japanese bombers attacked United States airfields and the fleet. Virtually the entire U.S. fleet of 94 vessels, including 8 battleships, was concentrated at Pearl Harbor and the disposition of troops, airplanes, and antiaircraft guns made effective defense almost impossible. When the last attack had ended about 2 hours later, the Japanese won a significant tactical victory since they had been practically unopposed. Within 2 hours, 2,403 American servicemen and civilians were killed and 1,178 wounded. When the news of the attack reached the people of the United States, our country went into shock. Japanese capabilities had been underestimated and information about the fast-moving developments had been relayed too slow to the commanders in Hawaii. 
Pearl Harbor is a very poignant chapter in our history. We must seek to remember the grave sacrifice so many Americans made there. As a veteran, I am very proud to honor the outstanding patriotism of the New Hampshire Pearl Harbor Survivors on their 25th anniversary.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to commend George Bald, the economic development director for the Pease Development Authority and a Rochester community leader, on being named the Rochester Business Leader of the Year. I congratulate him for his record of excellence in business and community development. 
George Bald's record of achievement is certainly worthy of this outstanding honor. In 1978, he was elected mayor of Somersworth where he served until 1984. He had a bold plan for the Rochester area which spearheaded the development of a new municipally owned industrial park while utilizing an existing park. George's next endeavor was as head of the newly established economic development department where he became known for exceptional economic success. Through his leadership, Rochester was effectively promoted as an attractive business location. He also strengthened relations with existing industries. Thanks to George's efforts, Rochester became the corporate headquarters of Cabletron Systems and during his tenure thousands of new jobs have been created. 
George also helped establish a solid foundation on which the city of Rochester will continue to grow. From 1991 to 1993, he became city manager and in 1994, George was entrusted the position of economic development director for the Pease Development Authority. He served on the Industrial Affairs Council at the Chamber of Commerce and the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
His outstanding community support is demonstrated in his participation with the Heritage Trust and his service on several boards of directors such as the Frisbie Memorial Hospital, the Rochester Visiting Nurses Association, the Gafney Home and the Somersworth Housing Authority. George is a former vice president of the New Hampshire Association of Industrial Agents, a member of the American Economic Development Council and a director of the Northeast Industrial Developers Association. Equally important, his friends know him for his integrity and dedication and as a man who is willing to go the extra mile to help his community. 
I wish to congratulate George for his recognition as Rochester's Business Leader of the Year, and I am proud to represent George in the U.S. Senate. He has certainly earned this praise from the business community he has sought to help over the years. Congratulations George.

 Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Colin Rizzio for his outstanding math expertise, which led him to uncover an error on the SAT exams. His quick insight has gained much national recognition in the last few weeks including an appearance on `Good Morning America' and on the `Today' show. Colin is a 17-year-old senior at Contoocook Valley Regional High School in New Hampshire. He is an above-average student who kept a cool head under testing conditions. Colin discovered an error which had been overlooked by internal and external math specialists while he was taking the SAT last Columbus Day. He took the time to consider different possibilities the math question offered and revealed the error. Thanks to Colin, the test will now be rescored and students' scores will go up nationwide as the flawed math question has been tossed out. 
As a former teacher, I am always heartened by stories of students who go the extra mile for educational integrity. Colin is the type of student who asks `What if?' In this case, his inquisitive nature gained him much notoriety. 
It is students like Colin that contribute to the future of the Granite State and I am proud to be his Senator. I congratulate Colin on his outstanding achievement and I wish this exemplary student all the best for his future educational endeavors.
