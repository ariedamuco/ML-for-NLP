 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am introducing the Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 1998. This legislation would provide block grants to the states to provide educational programs that focus on and are tailored to the needs of gifted and talented students. 
The needs of gifted and talented students are often misunderstood. Too often we believe that all we need to do for gifted and talented students is to put them on an accelerated course of study. However, that is not sufficient. Gifted and talented students think and look at the world in a unique way. Therefore, their educational agenda must be tailored to the thought processes gifted and talented students employ. Currently, our nation's education system does not do so. This is due in part, to a lack of resources available in schools across the country. 
My legislation, which has been offered in the House of Representatives by Congressman Elton Gallegly of California would provide block grants to state education agencies to identify gifted and talented students from all economic, ethnic and racial backgrounds--including students of limited English proficiency and those with disabilities. Funding would be based on each state's student population, but each state would receive at least $1 million. 
This legislation would leave the decision on how best to serve these students to state and local officials. I have always believed that state and local officials, working with parents, are in a much better position than bureaucrats in Washington to know what their students need to succeed. I have also always believed that the most effective education spending is that which goes directly to the students. That's why this bill caps administrative costs at 10 percent. 
So while the funds in this measure can't be used for bureaucracy, it can be used for items such as professional development for teachers; counselors and administrators; innovation of programs and services for high-ability students and for developing emerging technologies such as distance learning and other initiatives. It is my hope this measure will give educators the resources and the flexibility they need to meet the needs of gifted and talented students. 
Mr. President, our nation's gifted and talented are among our great untapped resources. We must focus on the needs of these students so that their particular gifts can flourish and be fully realized. I am aware Mr. President that at this late date, this measure will not pass. However, I hope introduction of this bill will help shed some light on the needs of the gifted and talented and force a much-needed national conversation about the tremendous potential that we are allowing to go undeveloped. While this measure will obviously not receive any further action before the end of the 105th Congress, it is my sincere hope that introduction of this bill will be the beginning of a new era in educating the gifted and talented.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Otto von Bismarck, former Chancellor of Germany, once said, `Laws are like sausages. It is better not to see them being made.' Yet even Bismarck would have gagged over how this bill evolved. 
Several times in recent years, I have disparaged the process of eleventh-hour budgeting because it inevitably leads to one thing: a rising tide that lifts all spending. All the Republican programs get higher funding, all the Democrat programs get more funding. The budget busts apart at the seams. The taxpayers are the losers. 
And it's not just the budget process. Bismarck would have croaked had he seen how the normal legislative process--bad as it is--was bypassed, becoming a free-for-all. It's as if the Clinton Administration and the Congress had a power outage, and the looters came from everywhere and picked the taxpayers' pockets clean. The legislative process was stripped of its integrity. 
This isn't an `omnibus' bill; it's an `ominous' bill. 
Many of us in this body have brought the good news home to our constituents. We have delivered the first balanced budget in a generation. We created surpluses as far as the eye can see. The debt is finally being paid down. Our children have a brighter future because of it. And Social Security will be saved for the Baby Boomer generation. This is the vision we had when we passed the bipartisan Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
I intend to vote against this bill. The reason is because it threatens that vision. A vision we committed to just one year ago. Specifically, there are three reasons I oppose it. First, it threatens what we accomplished last year. It compromises the Balanced Budget Act. This bill proves that the Clinton White House and Congress can never resist the temptation to spend money, even though we've promised to save the money for Social Security and to pay down the debt. That signifies a total lack of fiscal discipline. 
Second, it squanders the surplus. It would soak up $21 billion of it in the coming year alone. This is just one month after the announcement of the nation's first surplus in 29 years. Both sides were patting each other on the back. Meanwhile, we couldn't wait to spend it. We could have and should have found offsets for this money. I predict that in coming years, this will be Congress' way around the budget agreement--Call any program an emergency and the budget agreement is by-passed. 
Third, the bill, is a budget-buster. Maybe not technically, maybe not now. But in pushing $4.1 billion of spending decisions into next year, it's the first die cast in ensuring another rising tide of spending next year. In addition, it's not really clear what the budgetary impact is of all the legislative mushrooms we're passing in this budget. The funding for these programs is like fertilizer. And next year these mushrooms become BIG mushrooms. And that creates further budgetary pressures for more spending. 
In short, Mr. President, this process shows we have reverted to the same attitude, the same mindset, the same practice, that brought us monumental debt levels in the first place. 
Moreover, I deplore the intellectual dishonesty of the President of the United States. For nine months, I have been applauding his stated commitment to save the surplus to ensure the viability of Social Security. Then he pushes for a budget that spends $21 billion of that surplus in just one year. The following day, the President appears in the Rose Garden and announces we've agreed to a budget deal, and saved Social Security in the process. 
Mr. President, this cynical statement by the President, and the precedent it sets, hasn't saved Social Security. It has threatened Social Security. It has opened up the flood gates. It ensures future raids on future surpluses. And the President now has no moral authority to use those surpluses exclusively for Social Security. He squandered that moral authority. 
It is also intellectually dishonest of the President to oppose tax cuts, using the argument that tax cuts would jeopardize Social Security, yet assume that spending the surplus would not. 
These reasons, Mr. President, constitute why I am seriously disappointed in this process, and in this budget. I regret my vote against it because there are many provisions in this bill that I fully support. Some of them I am even responsible for. 
For instance, there is approximately $300 million for Iowa farmers in additional relief. The relief package includes AMTA payments, disaster assistance and new operating loans. In addition, there is tax relief for farmers, including Permanent Income Averaging, accelerated health insurance premium deductibility, and a 5-year net operating loss carry-back. 
There are other provisions I fought for and support. Chief among them are: 
Home health care funding; Education funding for new teachers; Head Start funding; IMF reforms and funding; Extension of Chapter 12 bankruptcy provisions for family farmers; LIHEAP funding at levels beyond the administration's request; Anti-drug funding; and, Roads and highways funding, at the highest levels in history. 
These are all provisions that I worked hard for, supported and that I believe are essential. However, they could have been paid for without this revival of the practice of incrementally mortgaging the future. 
The easy thing for me to do would be to vote for this bill. But when the process of governing breaks down and puts our commitments and our future at risk; when Congress's recent fiscal discipline falls apart; and, when our elected leadership abdicates its responsibilities of governing, it's time, in my view, to say `no.'

Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with my colleagues from Montana and Mississippi about this very important issue. The development and use of alternative fuels are important to this nation, and we must encourage their use and development. 
Wind energy has long been recognized as an abundant potential source of electric power. A detailed analysis by the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest Laboratory in 1991 estimated the energy potential of the U.S. wind resource at 10.8 trillion kilowatt hours annually, or more than three times total current U.S. electricity consumption. Wind energy is a clean resource that produces electricity with virtually no carbon dioxide emissions. There is nothing limited or controversial about this source of energy. Americans need only to make the necessary investments in order to capture it for power. 
The Production Tax Credit, section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code was enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. This tax credit is a sound low-cost investment in an emerging sector of the energy industry. I introduced the first bill that contained this tax credit, so you can be sure that I am sincere in my belief in the need to develop this resource. This tax credit currently provides a 1.5 cent per kilowatt hour credit for energy produced from a new facility brought on-line after December 31, 1993 and before July 1, 1999 for the first ten years of the facility's existence. Last Fall, I introduced a bill to extend this tax credit for five years. My legislation, S. 1459, currently has 22 cosponsors, including half of the Finance Committee. The House companion legislation, introduced by Congressman Thomas, currently has 90 cosponsors, including over half of the Ways and Means Committee. These numbers are a strong testament to the importance of the section 45, and renewable fuels in general. 
In addition, I plan to work to expand this tax credit to allow use of the closed-loop biomass portion of this tax credit. Switchgrass from my state and other Midwestern states, eucalyptus from the South, and other biomass, can be grown for the exclusive purpose of producing energy. This is a productive use of our land, and will be an important step in our use and development of alternative and renewable fuels. 
I was very pleased to see that Congress expressed its understanding of the importance of alternative and renewable fuels by extending the ethanol tax credit in this year's T-2 legislation. These tax credits are a successful way of promoting alternative sources of energy. These tax credits are a cheap investment with high returns for ourselves, our children, our grandchildren and even their grandchildren. Congress needs to again pass this important legislation to ensure that these energy tax credits are extended into the next century.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased that Congress has once again extended the Generalized System of Preferences as part of the omnibus appropriations bill. The GSP is important for many reasons. For instance, from a foreign relations standpoint it allows the U.S. to assist developing countries without the use of direct foreign aid. 
It is also of great importance to American businesses. Many American businesses import raw materials or other products. The expiration of the GSP has forced these companies to pay a duty, or a tax, on some of these products. That's what a duty is: an additional tax. By extending the GSP retroactively, these companies will not be required to pay this tax. This tax is significant and can cost U.S. businesses hundreds of millions of dollars. So, Mr. President, it is very important that the GSP be extended and it is very appropriate that the Senate consider it as part of this bill. 
It is essential to remember, however, that since its inception in the Trade Act of 1974, the GSP program has provided for the exemption of `articles which the President determines to be import-sensitive.' This is a very important directive and critical to our most import-effected industries. A clear example of an import-sensitive article which should not be subject to GSP and, thus, not subject to the annual petitions of foreign producers that can be filed under this program, is ceramic tile. 
It is well documented that the U.S. ceramic tile market repeatedly has been recognized as extremely import-sensitive. During the past thirty-years, this U.S. industry has had to defend itself against a variety of unfair and illegal import practices carried out by some of our trading partners. Imports already dominate the U.S. ceramic tile market and have done so for the last decade. They currently provide approximately 60 percent of the largest and most important glazed tile sector according to 1995 year-end government figures. 
Moreover, one of the guiding principles of the GSP program has been reciprocal market access. Currently, GSP eligible beneficiary countries supply almost one-fourth of the U.S. ceramic tile imports, and they are rapidly increasing their sales and market shares. U.S. ceramic tile manufacturers, however, are still denied access to many of these foreign markets. 
Also, previous abuses of the GSP eligible status with regard to some ceramic tile product lines have been well documented. In 1979, the USTR rejected various petitions for duty-free treatment of ceramic tile from certain GSP beneficiary countries. With the acquiescence of the U.S. industry, however, the USTR at that time created a duty-free exception for the then-minuscule category of irregular edged `specialty' mosaic tile. Immediately thereafter, I am told that foreign manufacturers from major GSP beneficiary countries either shifted their production to `specialty' mosaic tile or simply identified their existing products as `specialty" mosaic tile on custom invoices and stopped paying duties on these products. These actions flooded the U.S. market with duty-free ceramic tiles that apparently had been superficially restyled or mislabeled. 
In light of these factors, the U.S. industry has been recognized by successive Congresses and Administrations as `import-sensitive' dating back to the Dillon and Kennedy Rounds of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yet during this same period, the American ceramic tile industry has been forced to defend itself from over a dozen petitions filed by various designated GSP-eligible countries seeking duty-free treatment for their ceramic tile sent into this market. 
The domestic ceramic tile industry has been fortunate, to date, because both the USTR and the International Trade Commission have recognized the `import-sensitivity' of the U.S. market and have denied these repeated petitions. If, however, just one petitioning nation ever succeeds in gaining GSP benefits for ceramic tile, then all GSP beneficiary countries will be entitled to similar treatment. This could eliminate many American tile jobs and devastate the domestic industry. Therefore it is my strong belief that a proven `import sensitive,' and already import-dominated product, such as ceramic tile, should not continually be subjected to defending against repeated duty-free petitions, but should be exempted from the GSP program.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the Medicare home health care provisions in the omnibus bill the Senate passed today over my dissenting vote. Along with a bipartisan group of my colleagues, I've worked since early this year to persuade the Senate to revisit home care. Now that we've done so, I have mixed feelings about the product. First, let me tell you what is good about it. 
It is good that we listened to our constituents and took action on this issue. The Aging Committee held a hearing on this issue in March, and it was clear then that we had a major problem on our hands. From then to now, believe me, every step has been a struggle. As late as last Thursday, this issue was declared dead here in the Senate. But last minute calls from a number of us to the leadership led to the issue being taken up, and that's a good thing. 
It is good that the bill delays the 15-percent across-the-board cut in home health payments that was slated to occur in October 1999 if HCFA missed the deadline for the new Prospective Payment System (PPS). It's HCFA's fault, not that of home health providers, that PPS won't be ready in time, so the cut would have been unfair. The bill delays the cut until October 2000, and PPS should be ready by then, meaning that the across-the-board cut will never occur. We will all need to monitor the development of PPS closely, but this delay buys us some important time. 
The final good thing I can say about the bill is that it does provide modest relief to low-cost agencies, such as most Iowa providers. It moves them about one-third of the way up to the national median. That's all. 
So what's wrong with it? In short, its increase in payment to low-cost agencies is far too small. The negotiators accepted the House view that all high-cost agencies should be held harmless. This tied up money which should have been used to provide more equity to low-cost agencies, the `good guys' who provide home care without unnecessarily burdening Medicare. 
Because the bill provides so little relief to low-cost agencies, those agencies are still at risk of closure. If an agency can't stay in business for at least another year, the delay of the 15-percent cut scheduled for October 1999 will not help it. For me, saving those agencies--in order to preserve access to home care for those they serve--was the foremost reason to act this year. We did not do what we needed to do. 
In a sense, the new law makes that bad situation even worse. If existing agencies must close their doors, especially in lightly populated rural areas, we could hope that new agencies would open to take on their patients. But the Senate receded to a House provision putting such new agencies at a marked payment disadvantage, making it unlikely that any will open. This should be a matter of grave concern to all of us. 
The bill that I drafted with Senators Breaux, Baucus, and Rockefeller, S. 2323, was a hard-fought compromise among differently situated States. As evidence that it was a good compromise, it garnered a majority of Finance Committee members as cosponsors, including those from States with relatively high- and low-cost agencies. It also greatly simplified the Interim Payment System, providing for more uniform payment for agencies, and eliminating the distinction between old and new agencies. If anything, the provision in the omnibus bill makes our earlier bill look even more attractive, because today's bill further complicates home health payment, and makes payment even less uniform. 
Finally, Mr. President, I cannot resist pointing out the flaws in the process by which this provision was developed. The process was profoundly undemocratic. After many months' discussion, a strong majority of the Finance Committee agreed on an approach to this issue. We were then told that, out of the whole Senate, only a single Senator from a State with a tremendous number of agencies, many with very high costs, would object to this consensus approach. Unlike other Senators from similar States, who recognized the need for some high-cost agencies to accept some reductions as part of a compromise, this Senator had not cosponsored any of the reasonable reform bills or otherwise contributed to the discussions during the course of the year. While that Senator cited fiscal responsibility as the reason for his objection, it was no secret that his constituents included so many of the highest-cost home health agencies--the defense of which would seem to be the antithesis of fiscal responsibility. 
Precious days passed while no action was taken, and no explanation was offered. We Finance Committee members were essentially strung along, learning to our dismay each day that the bill had not been brought to the floor, where the objecting Senator would have to defend his position, if he dared. In the end, a deal was cut in a rushed, secret negotiation at the eleventh hour. Members who had labored for months to find a workable compromise were not invited to participate, while the alleged objector was. That Senator's State's high-cost agencies were thus given virtual veto power. It should be no wonder that we ended up with what we did. 
Here in Congress, a good process does not guarantee a good result, but a bad process almost certainly guarantees a bad result. It pains me that the seniors and disabled who rely on the Medicare home health benefit will have to bear the consequences of the Senate's bad process. 
While noting the errors of the Senate on this issue, I would be remiss not to note the responsibility of the home health industry and the Clinton Administration. The industry spent months pursuing unrealistic approaches and failing to unite behind reasonable reform. We'll never know how differently this debate might have turned out if they had been willing to make some hard choices earlier in the process, rather than do the impossible by attempting to please all their constituents. Similarly, we will never know how the issue would have played out if the Administration had participated as full partners. Throughout the year, they were willing only to provide technical assistance, never offering reform ideas of their own, no matter how much Members of Congress from both parties pleaded. I will never understand why they decided that home health care was Congress' problem and not theirs. I hope that the industry, the Administration, and Congress will all approach this issue differently next year. 
The prospect of dealing with this issue again in 1999 is not one that many of us relish. But I'm afraid that we will have to do it. In fact, what I really fear is that our best, most efficient home health providers will not be around when we return to this issue. We simply did not do enough for them this year. Let's not kid ourselves that we did.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to see this historic piece of legislation will pass the Senate. After much careful work with Senator D'Amato, the Treasury Department, and the Justice Department, as well as our colleagues in the other body, we have crafted a bill that I believe will lead to much improved coordination in fighting money laundering. I want to thank everyone involved for their hard work on this legislation. 
The bill will hit the criminals where they feel it the most--in their pocketbooks. By implementing a strategy on a national level, hundreds of communities across our country will no longer be held hostage by these criminal enterprises. As you know, money laundering involves disguising financial assets so they can be used without detection of the illegal activity that produced them. Through money laundering, the criminal transforms the monetary proceeds derived from the criminal activity into funds with an apparently legal source. Money laundering provides the resources from drug dealers, terrorists, arms dealers, and other criminals to operate and expand their criminal enterprises. Today, experts estimate that money laundering has grown into a $500 billion problem worldwide. 
The Money Laundering and Related Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1998 will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and other relevant agencies, to coordinate and implement a national strategy to address the exploitation of our Nation's payment systems to facilitate money laundering and related financial crimes. I look forward to the delivery of this first strategy next February, and believe it will be a valuable document not only for law enforcement agencies, but also for Congress as we look to react to the increasingly inventive ways criminals take advantage of our financial system. I hope this legislation will be the beginning of a serious effort by Congress to impact the growing threat of money laundering not only to our Nation, but worldwide.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment in the form of a substitute to H.R. 3433. 
Many people with disabilities who have been out of the workforce are eager to return to work. However, because of the risks of losing cash benefits and health insurance provided through the Social Security Disability Insurance program and the Supplemental Security Income program many beneficiaries are discouraged from entering or re-entering the workforce. The intent of these programs was never to demoralize or dishearten Americans who are ready, willing and able to work. We must look at ways to overcome this attitude. 
Thanks to the disability reform proposal developed by Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy many of the barriers facing people with disabilities will be addressed. Several provisions in the Jeffords-Kennedy substitute to H.R. 3433 tackle the problems of loss of cash benefits and health insurance which can prevent beneficiaries from being able to support themselves once they begin working. The substitute legislation would provide working individuals with disabilities access to additional services under the Medicaid program, such as personal assistance and prescription drugs. These services are vital to many people on SSDI and SSI. Furthermore, this proposal would provide improved access to rehabilitation opportunities for beneficiaries of both the SSI and SSDI programs. 
The most encouraging parts of this proposal are those that eliminate work disincentives and facilitate self-sufficiency among those with disabilities. This legislation prohibits using work activity as the only basis for triggering a continuing disability review. Moreover, the proposal put forth by my colleagues, Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy, would expedite the process of eligibility determinations of individuals who have been on disability insurance but who lost it because they were working. Also, the Jeffords-Kennedy substitute creates incentives for both disabled beneficiaries and providers of vocational rehabilitation to secure jobs for those who want to work. It is my hope that this will eliminate shuffling these people from vocational rehabilitation programs to state programs without them being able to make any real progress. 
Finally, I want to say how glad I am to see that a component of the Jeffords-Kennedy substitute includes a proposal to ensure that local prisoners will not receive Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. I sponsored legislation in the beginning of the 105th Congress to prevent this needless waste of taxpayer dollars by closing a loophole in the law. Criminals should not be allowed to `double dip' and receive Federal money earmarked for the purchase of food and clothing while they are part of a prison system which provides these necessities already. This proposal would protect the financial soundness of the Social Security Disability Insurance program for the people it is meant to assist. 
The work Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy have put forth on this bill characterizes the bipartisanship necessary to pass the proposal into law. I am glad to lend my support to the Senate substitute legislation to H.R. 3433. I look forward to passage of this legislation.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Medicare Home Health Fair Payment Act of 1998, which is a first step toward addressing the crisis in Medicare home health care. This is not a perfect bill, but it's a good bill, and it is the best we can do at this moment in time. And it's a good example of the Senate listening to the American people. Let's pass it right now. 
The Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, highlighted the problems with the home health Interim Payment System (IPS) in a hearing on March 31st of this year. For more than six months since that day, I have been working to find a solution to these problems, because I believe that it's Congress' responsibility. It's true that the IPS legislation was primarily HCFA's product. And HCFA's implementation of the IPS has been questionable in many respects. But even if HCFA proposed it, there's no denying that Congress passed the IPS. So I have argued all year that it is incumbent on Congress to fix what's wrong with it, this year. 
What's wrong with the IPS? In short, it bases payment on an individual home health agency's historical costs from Fiscal Year 1994. That means that if the agency had high costs per patient in that year, it can receive relatively high payment this year. That would be fine if HCFA knew that the agency had sicker patients this year, but the sad truth is that HCFA has no idea. So IPS has been a windfall for some agencies, but crushing for agencies with low historical costs. We have a lot of those in Iowa, where we still know the value of a dollar. Many of those hit hardest are the `little guys,' the small businesses that are the lifeblood of the program in rural areas. 
For months, I have worked with a bipartisan group of Finance committee members, including especially Senators Breaux, Baucus, and Rockefeller, on fixing IPS. In July we introduced the product of those efforts, the Home Health Access Preservation Act, and that bill clearly influenced the new Finance bill. I thank Chairman Roth and his fine staff for their willingness to work with us to find a viable approach. In the final months of this session, they have really gone the extra mile. 
Now, this bill doesn't give anyone everything that they want. Senators Roth and Moynihan rightly focused on creating something that could actually pass this year, and so the bill is a product of compromise. One of the key features is that the bill is paid for, so that it will not add another burden onto the already-burdened Medicare Part A trust fund. The offsets used are fair ones, and should not be controversial. 
I am familiar with the bill the House is voting on today. Should both bills be passed, with all due respect to my House colleagues, I urge them to recede to the Senate bill in conference. I have worked on this issue a long time, and I don't believe this bill can be improved upon. 
Mr. President, this bill will not satisfy everyone. It's a compromise, and in fact, it likely will not fully satisfy anyone. But it's the right thing to do, because it will help to keep some of our good home health providers around for another year, so they can make sure our seniors get home care when they need it.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as we take up the conference report to the bankruptcy bill, I want to make clear that this report is a balanced and fair compromise between the House and Senate bankruptcy bills. The fact of the matter is that the process of a conference is a process of joining two bills that have passed both Houses in different forms. 
One of the key differences between the House and Senate was the question of means testing. The House had a very strict formula, while the Senate bill contained a change to a section of the bankruptcy code which directs judges to consider repayment capacity. 
On this point of means testing, the House had one provision formula driven, very much different from the Senate provision that was more subjective in the decision of a judge of whether somebody should be in chapter 7 or chapter 13. But, obviously, even in the Senate bill, we had penalties and incentives for people who should be filing under chapter 13 but, in fact, filed under chapter 7. We had these differences on means testing between the House and the Senate. 
Under the conference report that is now before us, a debtor can file in any chapter of the bankruptcy code, and before a debtor can be transferred from chapter 7 to chapter 13, a judge will review the merits of each case. 
Mr. President, I think this is important to understand because we provide that every single person who wants their day in court with due process will get it, because under the conference report, each debtor will receive an individual hearing and get a chance to press his or her own case. In other words, the conference report maintains the judicial scrutiny that I think was the distinguishing factor of the Senate bill's means test. Of course, we have a flexible means test before us today that is a product of the conference compromise. 
When the Senate considered my bankruptcy reform bill, I spoke at length about the need for reform, and I would like to restate those points as we go to final consideration, after this conference report was overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives just a few hours ago. 
The need for this bill is based upon the statistics of bankruptcy, and those statistics speak for themselves. The number of bankruptcy filings has skyrocketed in recent years. In 1994, the total number of nonbusiness filings was just over 780,000, probably thought to be too much at that time, and maybe the number was too high at that time. But in 1996, this figure jumped to 1.1 million, and, astonishingly, the 1997 figure was almost 1.35 million. Of course, the trend is continuing. 
There is no letup in the dramatic increase in the number of personal bankruptcies being filed even this very day in this country, because filings for the first quarter of 1998 are over 20,000 higher than for the same time last year. They are almost 90,000 ahead of the first quarter of 1996. Unfortunately, the future looks even bleaker. A study released just a few days ago predicted that the number of personal bankruptcies will exceed 2.2 million by the year 2001. 
If there is any better reason or rationale for the adoption of this conference report by this body before we go home for recess, it is that the high number of personal bankruptcy filings is continuing to shoot up at a tremendous rate, unjustified for the economic conditions we are in. We think 1.4 million is too high. In 3 years--in 2 1/2 years--they will be well over 2 million if we don't do something about it, and I think this legislation will do something about it. 
The interesting and alarming thing is that this unprecedented increase in the filings for bankruptcy comes at a time when our economy is very, very healthy. Disposable income is up, unemployment is very low, 
and the interest rates are very low. 
Here is something that just does not make sense, then. Common sense and basic economics would say that when times are as good as they are now--almost the longest peacetime recovery this country has ever had--when the economy is flourishing, that bankruptcies should not shoot up as well; that is, unless there is something wrong. And there is something wrong. 
The bankruptcy code is flawed. There is need for reform. There is not any shame connected with bankruptcy anymore. There is lack of personal responsibility. There is lack of corporate responsibility, as well as credit card companies are pushing credit cards into mailboxes every day. And the bankruptcy bar is not adequately counseling people as to whether or not they should even be in bankruptcy, let alone discouraging them from being in chapter 7 when they should be in chapter 13. But with all of these put together, Mr. President, in my view, the main problem in our bankruptcy law, quite simply, is that current law discourages personal responsibility. 
Let me start out by saying that most people who declare bankruptcy because of their low incomes, their inability to pay, probably are correct in doing so. When I say that, that does not counteract what I just said about assuming personal responsibility or not having some shame connected with bankruptcy. But as far as our present law is concerned, and their ability to repay, I would have to say that that is probably where they should be. 
But that does not mean that we do not have a responsibility through our society and through the standards set by our Government to do something about the fact that so many people are in bankruptcy in the first place. We will have to deal with that sometime other than in this legislation, because this legislation is dealing with the fact that those who have the ability to repay ought to not get off scot-free. But if you do not have the ability to repay, then, of course, that is another consideration. You have to deal with that in some ways differently than what we do in this legislation. 
Estimates vary, but about 80 percent of the people who declare bankruptcy are in desperate straits. And then under the principle that we have had for the last 100 years in our bankruptcy laws, particularly if this is in situations beyond their control--like natural disaster, death, divorce, medical problems--then they may need to get a fresh start. 
The problem is, Mr. President, as I have already hinted, some people use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool. They do it to get out of paying off debts which they could pay off. And that is what is pushing the desire for bankruptcy reform. We have a bankruptcy system that lets higher-income people write off their debts with no questions asked and no real way for creditors to prevent this from happening. And this legislation deals with that unjust situation--unjust for creditors, unjust for consumers, because consumers pay it, and too just for people who have the ability to repay. 
As I said so often last year, we had a record number of Americans filing for bankruptcy. Of course each bankruptcy case means that someone who extended credit in good faith will not get paid. While estimates differ as to the exact number, American businesses are losing about $40 billion a year as a result of consumer bankruptcy. 
You might say, well, big banks and big businesses are in somewhat of a stronger position since they can offset these losses by increasing the amount that they charge other customers. That is an important point, Mr. President. Under the best of circumstances, where a big business can stay afloat in the face of large losses due to bankruptcies, then it is simple: Honest customers pay the price because there is no free lunch. This is like a hidden tax--a hidden bankruptcy tax--which consumers pay, people who play by the rules pay. Because, as businesses end up writing off their debts in bankruptcy, the consumers make it up. 
So my legislation would reduce this tax by requiring those consumers who can afford to pay, who have the capacity to make good on their debts, or even some portion thereof, to do so. But that is the situation with big businesses that can pass it on. They can survive in the face of huge bankruptcy losses. They stay in business. They get consumers coming to their door. The consumers pay. But there are a lot of small business people who have to close their doors because maybe they cannot afford to absorb the loss of so much income and consequently do not have the ability to pass it on to their consumers. The Bankruptcy Reform Act limits complete debt relief to only those who cannot repay their debts. Those who can repay their debts are required to do that. And of course, that is common sense. 
That is one important aspect of the legislation, the means testing provisions of it. There was a compromise between the House and the Senate. The House had that very strict formula that decided whether a person was in bankruptcy 13 or bankruptcy 7. We had a subjective judgment with encouragement for people to be in chapter 13 and penalties to those who went into 7 when they had the ability to repay and should have been in 13. But it was very subjective, and it took motions by creditors. It took action by trustees to bring that about, and it took penalties against lawyers who were not properly counseling the debtor. So we joined these together to have the bright line of the House version of who should be in chapter 13, but we also make sure that every debtor gets their day in court with due process to make sure they have been treated fairly. 
So we move on to another hot-button issue. On this issue the Senate prevailed. The conference report still provides that child support obligations must be paid during any bankruptcy proceeding. 
You can see here in this chart, under the conference report, child support and alimony receive first priority. Child support must be paid in full before debt forgiveness. You can see across here, under current law child support/alimony is seventh in priority. We move that to first in priority. You can see that under present law there is no requirement to pay child support before debt forgiveness in chapter 13. Child support must be paid in full before debt forgiveness. Under the conference report, bankruptcy trumps wage garnishment for child support. Under the conference report, bankruptcy does not trump wage garnishment for child support. And lastly, and added to child support, collections are exempt from automatic stay. 
The reason that it is important to put child support claimants at the top of the list during bankruptcy proceedings is that most bankrupts do not have enough money to pay all creditors in full. So somebody is not going to be paid. This bill makes it more certain that child support will be paid in full before other creditors can collect a penny. That is real progress in making sure that children and former spouses are treated fairly. 
I know this was very much a concern of many members of the Judiciary Committee, including my distinguished ranking member, Senator Durbin of Illinois, and other members of the committee. I know it is very much a concern of people at the White House. I hope, first of all, that they understand there was no intent of changing this in the original legislation, but I guess it is the way combinations can work, that there was some suspect that this could happen, 
but I hope that we make it very, very clear that families and children and spouses are first. We have moved it from seventh to first. 
Also, the conference report provides that someone owed child support can enforce their obligations even against the exempt property of a bankrupt. This means that wealthy bankrupts can't hide their assets in expensive homes or in pension funds as a way of stiffing their children or their ex-spouses. This is another example of how this legislation will help--not hurt--child support claimants. And rightly so. 
This conference report states that debtors receiving child support don't have to count that income when calculating a repayable schedule. 
Outside the bankruptcy context, when there are delinquent child or spousal support obligations, State government agencies often step in and try to help collect that child support. The conference report exempts these collection efforts from the automatic stay. The automatic stay is a court injunction which automatically arises when anyone declares bankruptcy, and it prevents creditors from collecting on their debts. 
Now, if this legislation were to pass, State agencies would be in a much better position to collect past due child support. In practical terms, that means that State government agencies attempting to collect child support can garnish wages and suspend driver's licenses and professional licenses--plenty of incentive for people to get on the stick and keep their social obligations to the families they have been a part of, benefited from, and to the children that they ought to love in the first place. 
Clearly, this will help State governments in catching deadbeats who want to use the bankruptcy system to get out of paying child support. In fact, the district attorneys who actually collect child support strongly support this conference report. So any argument that this conference report is bad for child support is empty political rhetoric. 
If I could go to another chart, the conference report also maintains tough fines against creditors who misuse their new powers to harass or intimidate honest consumers, rather than to stop abuses. I think the chart shows what we are doing. I can tell you that this was a very key feature of the Senate bill. Whenever we give creditors a new tool, we also give debtors a new shield to rein in potential creditor abuses. If it is wrong for a debtor to avoid personal responsibility, it is wrong for creditors to misuse the bankruptcy code in an unethical way, as well. 
I think it is amazing that we hear from our Democratic friends that we should oppose this conference report, as I think we will, because we limit the ability of unscrupulous trial lawyers to bring class actions against the bankruptcy code. Now, I think that is a very telling point. It seems that those who oppose this bill do not really oppose it because they are worried about consumers. They might oppose it because they want to help trial lawyers clean their pockets. I hope my colleagues will keep this in mind as we consider this conference report. 
There is another example of how the conference report gives debtors important new tools to defer, to deter and punish abusive creditor conduct. In the last few years, there have been a number of reports about creditors coercing debtors into agreeing to paying their debts even though the debt could be wiped away in bankruptcy. The bankruptcy code allows debtors to reaffirm debts if they choose to do so voluntarily. The problem is that some companies have been threatening consumers in order to force reaffirmation. The conference report gives every debtor the right to a hearing before a bankruptcy judge who will review the agreement to make sure that there has been no coercion. This is a crucially important change to protect consumers. 
I want to make one last point in regard to this chart. We have `truth in advertising' requirements for bankruptcy lawyers. It seems to me this is very, very important. In the original debate on this bill before it went to conference, 2 or 3 weeks ago, the point was made that some lawyers with the bankruptcy mills were advising people through advertising that they had the ability to avoid paying alimony and other things. `Truth in advertising' is very important in any business. It is just as important in the legal profession. 
Debtors get new rights to court hearings to stop unfair debt collection practices. 
It promotes out-of-court settlements by punishing creditors who refuse to negotiate. We think there ought to be the willingness and the obligation, when somebody who is greatly in debt and wants to work something out without going through the costly and adversarial environment of the court, they ought to be able to. That incentive is in here. 
And it requires credit card companies to point out the dangers of making only the minimum payments. 
Finally, the conference report makes important changes to help prevent the collapse of the financial sector when a party to a swap or a repurchase agreement defaults on an obligation. These changes were suggested by our Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin. As President Clinton put it, we are in a serious financial crisis and we need to reduce systematic risk in the financial markets now. 
This conference report, I think, is balanced and fair. I am sure that we will hear that it is not. Obviously, it is not entirely to my liking. No conference report is to everyone's liking. The essence of this legislative process, when a House and a Senate pass different versions of the bill, is that there be compromise. Actually, the differences in these versions was greater than you would normally have between pieces of legislation passed by the respective bodies and much more difficult to do. 
I want to repeat for our colleagues, as well as for his constituents in Illinois, Senator Durbin has been very, very cooperative throughout this process. We have had a bipartisan bill through the Senate. The process of compromise detracted from that, I am sorry to say. I was hoping that we would have a bill by the last week in July so we could have the whole month of September to work on the tremendous differences between the House and Senate. But things didn't work out the way I wanted them to and I am sure they didn't work out the way our distinguished Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, wanted them to work out, so this bill came out during the third week of September. 
Now here we are about ready to adjourn for the year and to go home and campaign. That process was not handled in the spirit of bipartisanship that I had planned a year and a half ago when I started working on this legislation, and that has been the practice not only through the Senate, but through conference in previous times. Some of that probably was within my control, but most of it was outside of my control. So the extent to which the last step did not encompass the spirit of bipartisanship that I had anticipated a year and a half ago, I apologize to my friend, the Senator from Illinois. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the issue of private contracting in the Medicare program is very important to my constituents in Iowa. I have received hundreds of letters asking Congress to repeal the provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requiring physicians who enter into a private contract with beneficiaries to opt out of the Medicare program for two years. Seniors in my state believe it is not the role of the federal government to interfere with relationship with their physician. They want to have as many choices and options as possible. I want to make sure their freedom is protected. That is why I want to thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for recognizing the importance of this issue to our nation's seniors and for agreeing to address this problem next Congress. I want to offer my support to help with these efforts as a cosponsor of Senator Kyl's legislation and as the Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging and senior member of the Senate Finance Committee.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on the occasion of its 25th anniversary, I would like to congratulate the Iowa Northland Regional Council of Governments (INRCOG). Organized January 1973, INRCOG was the first council of governments formed in the State of Iowa. 
As a voluntary association of local governments serving the member jurisdictions in Black Hawk, Bremer, Buchanan, Butler, Chicksaw and Grundy Counties, INRCOG has long been recognized as a leader among service and planning organizations. Responsible for coordinating, assisting, and facilitating programs in community and economic development, transportation, housing, environment, safety, planning, administration and transit, INRCOG's services have benefitted all governmental bodies in the INRCOG region and the State of Iowa. 
Through INRCOG's intergovernmental communication and cooperation have flourished and public-private partnerships have been enhanced. The ability of Iowa communities to plan for their own future has been enriched. I wish them many more years of successful service for the success of Iowa's communities, for their efforts will continue to strengthen the backbone of America's governmental system, thus enriching the lives of our citizens.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to clarify one section of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act with my colleague, Senator Thurmond. 
I want to clarify further the intent of the language in section 371. This section deals with the ability of the children of U.S. Customs employees living in Puerto Rico to attend the Department of Defense school in Puerto Rico. It is my understanding that the Customs Service will not be required to reimburse the Department of Defense for the cost of dependents attending the DOD school in Puerto Rico. Is this the Senator's understanding?

Mr. GRASSLEY. That was my understanding as well. I would like to make one additional point which I believe you just made in your comments. I understand that the intention of the Conference was that the children of all Customs Service employees would be eligible to attend the DOD school in Puerto Rico. The Conferees did not intend to limit this eligibility to a single category of Customs Service employee. The Statement of Managers language in the Conference Report refers to Customs Agents. Some may interpret this to mean that only children of agents were eligible to attend the DOD school.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first, I commend the chairman for all his hard work on this very complex and extremely important bill. 
One project that is of continuing interest to me is the cost reduction proposal for Terfenol-D, the smart alloy used in Navy advanced sonar systems. These essential cost reductions will enable significant cost and operational effectiveness enhancements of U.S. Navy surface ship, submarine and torpedo undersea warfighting capability. Furthermore, this program is essential if the U.S. Navy is to have a competitive advantage and not be at a disadvantage compared to the Chinese, Japanese and Russians as they invest in TERFENOL-D manufacturing technology advancements. 
As the chairman recalls, funding for this important project was included in the FY 98 Defense Appropriations bill only to be line item vetoed by the President. Due to the importance of the project, funds were included again in the FY 99 bill. However, because of the confusion caused by the line-item veto and the subsequent opinion by the Supreme Court, I would like to clarify with you that the full $3.0 million appropriated by the Congress in FY 98, line-item vetoed by the President and then nullified by the U.S. Supreme Court, continues to be available for its stated purpose of cost reduction for Terfenol-D. Moreover, it is my understanding that the $2.0 million currently provided in FY 99 is in addition to the $3.0 million provided in FY 98 for a total of $5.0 million over two years for this extremely important cost reduction initiative.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, I am introducing the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1998. As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, it is my responsibility to review federal court processes and procedures. Every two years or so, the Congress receives an official request from the Judicial Conference, the governing body of the federal courts, that include changes in the law the Judicial Conference believes is necessary to improve the functioning of the courts. 
After reviewing the latest official request from the Judicial Conference, Senator Durbin, who is the ranking member of the subcommittee, and I worked together in putting together a modification of this request to introduce as legislation. We are introducing this legislation today. 
The bill contains four different titles including numerous changes in subjects such as judicial financial administration, judicial process improvements, judicial personnel administration, other personnel matters and federal public defenders. While many of these items may not be essential for the court system to operate, they will certainly help the system function better, and hopefully, more effectively. 
Mr. President, it is my hope that we can consider this bill and pass it during these last few weeks of this Congress. I will work with Senator Durbin to try and make that happen. I urge my colleagues to support us in this effort.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, before we accept this amendment--I understand that we will do that, and I prefer that we do--I commend the Senator from Connecticut for his hard work on this issue. I have to say that I think the Senator is on to something here. We ought to encourage parents, obviously, to save for education and to protect these savings in bankruptcies. So philosophically we are all on the same page. 
The problem in a situation like this is the devil is in the details, especially when it comes to making changes to the bankruptcy code. 
I want to express my concern that the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut could unintentionally open a loophole for abuse. I understand that the Senator from Connecticut is also concerned about this and that he does not want any unintended consequences of his amendment which would allow for more bankruptcy abuse. 
Accordingly, I intend to continue working to improve this amendment so that it accomplishes its goal without giving crooks an opportunity to hide and shield their assets during bankruptcy proceedings. 
I had similar concerns about the amendment that Senator Hatch offered to protect retirement savings. I think we worked hard and good and accomplished a lot with Senator Hatch to tighten up that amendment. 
As a result, the amendment that we passed to protect the retirement accounts is better and less subject to abuse. I am sure that we can improve the amendment by Senator Dodd in the same way. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, before I speak on this amendment, I want to make clear that everybody in this body ought to know that this issue is before us both as part of the bill and now on a motion to instruct because of the hard work of the Senator from Wisconsin. He is to be commended for that because there is abuse in this area and our bill reflects that. 
So I say to the other 99 Members of this body--and also it would include people who are helping Senator Kohl on this amendment--Senator Kohl should be recognized as a leader in this area to bring some uniformity to our bankruptcy code among the 50 States to stop a very serious abuse. I have been trying to work with the Senator from Wisconsin, supporting his amendment to cap homesteads since he offered that amendment in the subcommittee markup. In fact, he was the very first Senator to be recognized in our subcommittee when we had the markup of this bill. He was successful there. 
In the last Congress, I accepted Senator Kohl's amendment to cap homesteads at $500,000. This principle actually passed the Senate unanimously at the end of the 104th Congress, but the House failed to act on the technical corrections bill to which the homestead matter was attached. 
In this Congress, the idea of capping homesteads is a genuine bipartisan one, and I know both the Senator from Wisconsin and the junior Senator from Alabama are strong supporters of the $100,000 cap currently in this bill. But the fact is that the other body has passed a bill which does not have homestead caps. In other words, we have a key difference between House and Senate bills on this point. 
Obviously, I support the Senate bill, which I have worked on so hard with Senator Durbin, but I don't want to go into the conference situation with my hands tied in any way. Some have tried to get me to do this on other provisions in this legislation, and to do so prior to conference. I have resisted all efforts in this area. I am compelled to resist this effort of instructing conferees. However, I am not going to object to this sense of the Senate going into my bill since it restates what is already in the legislation, and I think that restatement is a perfectly legitimate thing for us to do this way. And so from that standpoint, I compliment Senator Kohl for his continued hard work and his efforts. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment will be accepted. And I would like to say, after listening to Senator Feinstein's statement, as well as studying the legislation in great detail, we can enthusiastically back this and fight for its retention in conference as well. I was not that certain when I visited with the Senator privately, but I would like to state publicly that we think she has a very good idea here and that we can work to keep it in conference. I cannot guarantee anything, but at least I feel very strongly about it. 
It kind of backs up some of the things that we have done on disclosure in the managers' amendment as well. Those things will probably be much more controversial in conference than what the Senator from California is trying to do. She, from my standpoint, through the year that we have worked on this legislation, and being prodded also by the Senator from Illinois about the problems that we have or the potential problems we have with credit card companies, and they not being too careful in their anticipation of who they take on to give credit to, does back up the study that the Senator from California has called for. 
She does not give new statutory authority to the Federal Reserve. She does give the Federal Reserve authority, after the study, if the Federal Reserve wants to do it, to issue regulations that would require additional disclosure to consumers, then, within their existing statutory authority, if the board finds necessary, `to ensure responsible industrywide practices and to prevent resulting consumer debt and insolvency.' 
This is all based upon a study which we believe, based upon our year's consideration of this legislation, probably is a very worthwhile thing for us to have and to promote. So with those ideas in mind, we accept the amendment and congratulate the Senator from California. Most importantly, we thank her for her cooperative attitude toward our resolving a lot of differences we have had with her original legislation.

Mr. GRASSLEY. I listened to everything that the Senator from Florida has said and of course, have had to be considering the points of view that he makes, as well as a lot of my colleagues, and will be happy to continue working with him. 
Mr. President, my subcommittee has been looking at the need for increased or decreased numbers of judges across the country. 
I've been looking at the middle district of Florida for some time, and have corresponded and met with the chief judge. 
At this time, I am still not clear on what the needs of the district are or how its caseload is being managed. For instance, how are the many senior judges in the district helping with the caseload? I asked the chief judge this, and all I got were the judges certification papers that didn't say much of anything about caseload. It mostly mentioned what conferences they attended. I would ask the proponents to explain to us how the senior judges and magistrates help in reducing the caseload? Do the proponents realize that the senior judges in the middle district don't even take full cases? 
Nevertheless, I will continue working with my colleagues regarding judgeship needs. I will soon be releasing a subcommittee report on our efforts to review the circuit courts. 
The bottom line I've been advocating is that if we increase judges, we need to also decrease judges where they're not needed. I know this is a new concept, and one that has been met with some resistance. But, I intend to continue this effort in the next Congress.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all I want to thank everyone in this body for the overwhelming vote of confidence on the work that Senator Durbin and I have done on this bankruptcy bill. Getting to this point has been a very tough process involving a lot of compromise and a lot of refinement. 
You heard me say on the first day of debate that for the entire time that I have been in the Senate and on this subcommittee on the subject of bankruptcy--maybe not on every subject, but the subject of bankruptcy--there has been a great deal of bipartisan cooperation, first of all between Senator Heflin of Alabama, now retired, and myself. Sometimes I was chairman when Republicans were in the majority. When we were in the minority, I was ranking member and he was chairman. But this legislation has always passed with that sort of tradition. 
So I want to say to all of my colleagues that I not only thank them for their support but, more importantly, thank Senator Durbin, who worked so closely with me on this legislation, and that tradition has continued. I thank him for carrying on that tradition, because I don't think we would have had the vote that we had today if it had not been for the bipartisanship that has been expressed since he first took over leadership for his party on our subcommittee. 
I also want to give commendation to his staff, Victoria Bassetti and Ann McCormick; and also to Senator Hatch's staff, Maken Delrahim and Rene Augustine; and also my staff, John McMickle and Kolan Davis, because without the long hours of staff work that went into this bill, we would not have had the great compromise that we had to make this vote possible. 
Mr. President, I'm pleased that we've come to the point where the Senate has passed the Grassley-Durbin consumer bankruptcy bill. Getting to this point has been a tough process involving a lot of compromise and refinement. Of course, I thank Senator Durbin for his help and suggestions for improving the bill. I think that Chairman Hatch also deserves a great deal of credit as well. 
The bill we voted is a very fair and balanced piece of legislation with broad support. The administration, in its `statement of administration policy,' encourages the Senate to pass this bill. The Judiciary Committee was almost unanimous in passing the bill, and many changes have been made to the version of the bill reported by the committee to accommodate the concerns of the minority. So, this is a bill I think we can all support regardless of party. Again, Senator Durbin has been instrumental in making this bill truly bi-partisan. 
As I've said numerous times on the floor during the debate on bankruptcy reform, the American people are four-square in support of meaningful bankruptcy reform. The fact is that some people use bankruptcy as a convenient financial planning tool to skip out on debts they could repay. This has to stop. 
Mr. President, there's no such thing as a free lunch. Bankruptcies of convenience are like shoplifting. Honest consumers have to pick up the tab for losses due to bankruptcy just as they pick up the tab for shoplifting. Bankruptcies of convenience impose a hidden bankruptcy tax of $400 per family of four. My bill will cut that tax. 
Mr. President, it's not just consumers paying higher prices who stand to lose from bankruptcy abuse. Small businesses, a vital component of our healthy economy, can be crippled by bankruptcy losses. That's why the National Federation of Independent Business supports bankruptcy reform. 
Let's cut the bankruptcy tax. Let's restore personal responsibility to the bankruptcy system. Let's help protect American consumers and small businesses. 
Mr. President, I want to thank the people from the administration, because they have followed the course of this legislation. They have issued a statement of administrative policy in support of this legislation.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might consume at this point. 
The bill that is before us, and it is reported by the Judiciary Committee, penalizes lawyer misconduct. I think these penalties are very fair. They are very narrowly focused. Of course, penalties are very necessary. Many lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy view bankruptcy as an opportunity to make big money for themselves. This profit motive causes bankruptcy lawyers to promote bankruptcy as the only option, even when a financially troubled client might obviously have the ability to repay some debt. 
This profit motive creates a real conflict of interest where bankruptcy lawyers push people into bankruptcy who do not belong there, and they do it because they get paid up front. I think that any reasonable person would say that lawyers who file bankruptcy cases which are not substantially justified ought to be required to help defray the costs of their frivolous cases. That is all my bill does. Senator Feingold's amendment would gut this reasonable effort to control the bankruptcy bar, which is seriously out of control. 
The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act contains reasonable lawyer misconduct penalties which will cause lawyers to think twice before they, willy-nilly, cart somebody into chapter 7 and pocket a nice profit in the process. Some bankruptcy lawyers, in their rush to turn a profit, operate what are known as bankruptcy mills--nothing more than a processing center that happens to be for bankruptcy. There is little or no investigation done as to whether an individual actually needs bankruptcy protection or whether or not a person is able, at least partially, to repay their debts. 
Recently, one of these bankruptcy attorneys from Texas was sanctioned by a bankruptcy court. The practices of the bankruptcy mills are so deceptive and so sleazy that last year the Federal Trade Commission went so far as to issue a consumer alert, warning consumers of misleading ads that promise debt consolidation. So I think there is a widespread recognition that bankruptcy lawyers are preying on unsophisticated consumers. 
Yesterday I spoke about the bankruptcy lawyer who had written a book. I had this chart up. I spoke about this bankruptcy lawyer who had written this book entitled, `Discharging Marital Obligations in Bankruptcy.' This author, a bankruptcy lawyer, actually said that he is going to counsel you on how to avoid your obligations to pay defense costs, alimony, and child support. So it is all about how high-income people can get out of paying child support and alimony. 
I think it is outrageous that bankruptcy lawyers are helping deadbeats cheat divorced spouses out of alimony and children out of child support, so that is why we want to vote this amendment down. I think my colleague, Senator Kyl, wanted time. 
I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Kyl.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island is very much a modification of an amendment he proposed which would require bankruptcy judges to consider whether a creditor had used sound underwriting practices and standards when considering whether to dismiss or convert a chapter 7 to chapter 13. The modified amendment now requires judges to consider whether a creditor acted in good faith when considering whether to convert or to dismiss that case. 
It is my understanding from discussions that have gone on between Senator Reed's staff and my staff, and from what Senator Reed has said, now, as he has introduced his amendment, that the good faith standard in the modified amendment also includes many of the underwriting considerations in the original amendment. So, accordingly, many of the objections to the original amendment still apply to this modified amendment presented by the Senator from Rhode Island. 
At the outset, as with other amendments which relate to lending practices, I urge my colleagues to vote `aye' on a motion I will make to table this amendment because the Banking Committee should have a chance to consider this issue. But, since this amendment affects the means-testing provisions of S. 1301, I would like to describe how this amendment will be difficult to apply in practice, should it be adopted. 
Under the bill as written now, judges are directed to consider repayment ability, and given the power to dismiss or convert chapter 7 cases if a debtor could repay some portion of his or her debt. This is the very foundation of this legislation. This is what makes this bill, this year, different than any bankruptcy legislation we have had in the 100-year history--and this is the 100th year that the first national bankruptcy code was passed, on an ongoing basis. 
This amendment also requires judges to consider whether a creditor acted in good faith, including a creditor's lending practices. I don't think anyone knows how this amendment will work in the real world. There are questions raised by this amendment but not answered by the amendment: 
How would a judge even find out what the creditor's underwriting practices are? 
What is `good faith' in the context of section 707(b)? 
Procedurally, who would have the burden of producing evidence about underwriting practices in good faith? 
And if a creditor had properly extended credit to the debtor whose chapter 7 case is pending, but had recklessly offered credit to other people, is a judge supposed to factor that in as well? 
What if there are two pending motions asking for dismissal or conversion--one motion by a creditor who has sloppy underwriting practices or who acted in bad faith, and another motion by a creditor with tight underwriting standards who acted in good faith? In this case, should a judge deny both motions? 
Mr. President, what these questions show is that the amendment offered by the Senator from Rhode Island should be rejected because it is not good bankruptcy policy. There are too many unanswered questions and, of course, the underlying question regarding which underwriting practices are sloppy and which underwriting practices are not sloppy needs to be addressed not by the Judiciary Committee, not on the floor of the Senate, but in the laboratory of jurisdiction of that subject where legislation is perfected, and that happens to be the Senate Banking Committee. 
There are already penalties for creditors who refuse to act in good faith. We made sure they were in this bill. They are a very important part of making this a well-balanced piece of legislation. 
We talk so much about personal responsibility and making it tougher to get into bankruptcy that maybe people viewing this debate have sensed over the last week that all we are going after is the debtor, but that sometimes creditors don't act in good faith. This bill is balanced because it has penalties against creditors. For instance, if a creditor refuses to negotiate in good faith, then that creditor can't object to the discharge of his or her debt. This is already in the bill. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to vote `no' on the Reed amendment and eventually get this bill to final passage, because this is a very needed bill. We have 2 weeks to work out some differences between the House and Senate. The other body's bankruptcy bill is considerably different from ours. And I don't say that in a denigrating way; it just is different. The process of negotiating for provisions somewhere between the House and Senate provisions--also we have to consider the White House, because we want a bill that the President can sign--takes 2 weeks to get done, and we need to get this bill passed. 
I hope the Senator from Rhode Island is aware that the 20-percent figure was raised to 30 percent in the managers' amendment. I need to clarify that point because that 30-percent figure is also something that the White House was involved in working out as well, because the White House had raised some concerns about our 20-percent figure. 
There also was some willingness on the part of the White House to consider some points of view we had about the 
30-percent figure, and they even modified their original position, to some extent, to satisfy me. 
I think it is odd that the Senator from Rhode Island is critical of lenders extending too much credit. When the credit union bill was on the floor, there was an amendment to strike the Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act, of course, requires banks to extend credit to low-income people. 
I don't think that any of us can argue with the social responsibility of a bank to be fair to all people and all sectors, with the understanding that they have a responsibility to the stockholders of that bank and other people who are saving, but, within the concept of good financial prudence, to lend accordingly to all sectors of a city, all types of people who have the ability to repay. 
We had this community reinvestment amendment offered, and we had many Members talk about the need to make sure that credit is widely available to low-income people. What in the heck do you think credit cards are about? They are about giving people who maybe would not have that opportunity elsewhere an opportunity to borrow--again, within the concept of personal responsibility for debt. 
Now, through this amendment, we hear that we should, in effect, deny a creditor the ability to collect on a debt if the creditor extended credit to low-income people. On the one hand, a month ago we had a bill before us that we were trying to modify to make it reasonable, and the other side, which was opposed to that, said we are hurting low-income people with that amendment. And now with this amendment they are saying that low-income people are people taken advantage of. 
It seems to me that you can't have it both ways. I believe that borrowing and I believe that lending decisions are best made by individual Americans and not second-guessed by bankruptcy judges or political leaders in Washington, DC. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. REED addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have had a chance now for a second time to hear the explanation of the amendment from the Senator from Rhode Island. I think he is a person who always acts in good faith on his amendments and other legislative activity. He is a very active member of the Aging Committee, which I chair, and I have had a chance to observe him there as being a very serious Senator. So I do not raise any questions with the motives of the Senator because I think he even sees a need for bankruptcy legislation. 
But I still have to point out that I think the amendment, even if the intent is good, is just unworkable. I do not know whether we could have an amendment written to accomplish his goals that could be perfected enough to be workable--I should not draw that conclusion; that is a possibility--but I do believe that the language we have before us would fall into that category, because the modified amendment still requires bankruptcy judges to review underwriting standards. That is what the Senator from Rhode Island said earlier on the floor. 
So I do not think that we know how this amendment will work. I do not know how you can make even a commonsense determination of whether lending practices are in good faith unless the judge begins to second-guess many credit-granting decisions. 
As I have said, if the Senator from Rhode Island believes that there are too many credit card solicitations, then I think I should refer him to a letter that I read into the Record last week, which I am going to insert in the Record at this point as well, a letter from the junior Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Faircloth, who chairs the subcommittee of banking where I made an argument, from a procedural standpoint, that this amendment should be considered there, and that he has offered to hold hearings on this subject matter, and maybe even the goal that the Senator from Rhode Island seeks can be accomplished, but, more importantly, accomplished in a studied approach.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I had asked one of the smartest people in the Senate on this issue, Senator Domenici, to debate it. And there is going to be some discussion of this amendment tomorrow before we vote on it. At that time, Senator Domenici will speak about it for our side. But I also want to address the issue shortly, but not from the standpoint of the merits of where interest rates ought to be, but just the issue of whether or not it is appropriate to do this on this bankruptcy legislation, as well as the whole issue of whether or not Congress should try to interfere with the issue of the Federal Reserve deciding what the interest rate should be. Because I think it is fair to assume that we want to make sure that interest rates are appropriate. But who should make that decision? 
So I offer this advice to my colleagues on this amendment offered by my colleague from our State of Iowa, Senator Harkin. 
While we are all for lower interest rates, I think this amendment should be opposed because of the traditional separation of the Federal Reserve from the political process. What we generally speak of is the independence of the Federal Reserve System. For short, we all speak of the independence of the Fed. 
This country has a very long history of protecting the work of the Federal Reserve from political manipulation. Since the 1930s, Congress has gently refrained from passing legislation in an attempt to influence monetary policy. In fact, according to the Congressional Research Service, in the past 25 years, Congress has acted on only five occasions on legislation that affects the Federal Reserve System. Most of these actions have been in the form of nonbinding resolutions or report language. So congressional action of a statutory nature has been rare, and when it has been done whenever Congress has spoken on this issue, it seems it has had a very tempered approach. Maybe we ought to say that this sense of the Senate is a tempered approach in the sense that it doesn't change statute, but still it is an attempt by a political body to influence a part of our government that we have always tried to keep immune and separated from politics. 
There is a sound reason for keeping the Fed independent of this political process. It is because we in this body, whether we want to admit it or not, tend to think too much for the short-term. We tend to think in terms of the next election rather than the next generation. Too often, it is even more personal than that--what can I do to increase my chances of reelection? These short-term policies, as we too often find out, can lead to long-run disasters. 
While increasing the money supply can put more people to work prior to an election, of course, it can lead to crippling inflation in the long run. The Fed appropriately is not subjected to the pressures to do something potentially reckless for the purpose of short-term gain. This policy has served us well for generations and the U.S. economy remains the envy of the world because of it. In fact, in this decade alone, many nations have followed the lead that the United States has practiced for over 60 years. They have done this by bringing more independence to their own central banks. Great Britain, under a new labor Prime Minister, has moved to make the Bank of England more independent. Other European Union nations in their new union have committed to an independent central bank upon the creation of that monetary union which starts January 1, 1999. 
Furthermore, every nation that has faced a monetary crisis in recent memory has attempted in the name of reform to keep its central bank from political influences. We saw it in Mexico just 3 1/2 years ago when the peso declined so rapidly in Mexico. They have moved in that direction. We see it today in Japan, Korea, and Thailand. A major reason for each of their economic problems, of course, is the cronyism in bank lending practices and political influence over the banking systems. Maybe another way to say it is too much of an incestuous relationship between their corporations and their government, between their bank and their government, to a point where there was no arm's length transactions; the marketplace did not work appropriately. Nobody had to make a sound business judgment because there was always somebody there to bail them out. 
These people now, after the crisis in Southeast Asia, have begun to see the wisdom of a central bank, free of political influence. We should recognize the wisdom of it, as well. 
As I said earlier, we are all for low interest rates. The relatively low interest rate environment that we currently enjoy has allowed millions of Americans to purchase a home for the first time. It has kept the cost of doing business for small business and farmers down. It has helped the Federal Government reduce its budget deficit by reducing the costs of the national debt. 
Instead of pointing fingers at the Fed, Congress should instead focus on the things that are within its authority that lead to lower interest rates, like balancing the budget and reducing Government borrowing. We have been on this course now for the last 3 or 4 years. So, September 30th of this year for the first time we can tell the people we finished the fiscal year not only with the budget balanced but with paying down, probably 60-billion-some dollars, on the national debt. 
During this 30-year period of irresponsible Federal spending in which the national debt has been run up to $5.4 billion, and without the changes made in the last 3 or 4 years, at the end of the Clinton administration the debt could have gone to $6.7 billion--at least that is what we were projecting in the 1994 budget resolution discussions. During this period of time of 30 years the Fed has been a counterbalance to an irresponsible Congress, trying to make sure that inflation was kept down as a result of fiscal policy that would tend to drive interest rates up for the Federal Government because the Federal Government always stands first in line for credit and is always willing to pay more and will pay more than any other borrower would pay or have to pay. 
Congress has sole constitutional authority over the fiscal policy of this country, and in many respects fiscal policy has had as big an impact on interest rates as monetary policy. For instance, interest rates will remain relatively high as long as the Federal Government is competing with borrowers for money. That is why I find it interesting that often the same Members who want to direct monetary policy at the Fed tend to vote against sound fiscal policies such as balancing the budget and reducing Government spending. 
If a Congress did its job of managing fiscal policy better, maybe we wouldn't have to worry so much about what the policy of the Federal Reserve is. Now we are in a position of balancing the budget, paying down some on the national debt, not having the Federal Government eating up all of the total credit that is needed, the Federal Reserve job will be much, much easier. 
In short, I oppose these efforts to subject the decisionmaking of the Federal Reserve to the vagaries of the political process. By most accounts, the Fed has been largely responsible for this period of unprecedented economic growth fueled by both low interest rates and low inflation. So I say that we should stay on course that Congresses for the past 60 years have laid out for us, and that is keeping the Fed free of political influence that has led to economic calamities in so many other parts of the world.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my colleague from Iowa has accurately stated what the Constitution says and what we can do. I don't have any dispute with that. The only dispute I would have is whether or not it would be wise for Congress to do that after we have had such a success of building confidence in the economy when there is an absence of congressional manipulation of monetary policy. I fear if there is a perception in the private sector of Congress from time to time making an impact upon monetary policy, that is going to build in protection for people who are investing and, consequently, drive interest rates up. We don't want that to happen. 
I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to talk about the procedure of this minimum wage bill on a very, very important bankruptcy reform bill we have. The substance may be very important, but the procedure is what we want to consider as we ask our colleagues to vote on this amendment. 
We are on the first major change in bankruptcy legislation in 20 years--very needed change. So what is the minimum wage bill doing on this bill? This bill was voted out of committee 16-2. The author of this minimum wage amendment was one of those two people who voted against it. Obviously, by putting minimum wage on this, it is a poison pill to defeat this legislation. 
This is an anchor that is going to take this bill to the bottom of the ocean if this amendment is adopted. We must not let this amendment be adopted if we want a strong bankruptcy bill, any bankruptcy bill, out of this Congress. 
We have about 2 weeks left to get this bill worked up, with wide differences between the House bill and the Senate bill. If we adopt this amendment on minimum wage, I am sure the majority leader will take this bill down. 
I am asking my colleagues not to vote for this amendment because of the merits or demerits of minimum wage, but because this is a poison pill that will destroy the bankruptcy reform legislation that has so much going for it. When a bill comes out of the Judiciary Committee 16-2, it has a lot of bipartisan support, and you know it will go. This is one way that one opponent of this bankruptcy bill can stop it. 
Now, as important as a minimum wage increase might be to help some families in America, this bankruptcy bill is also very important to help lower-income families in America because there is not a single family in America--low-income or high-income--that is not paying part of the costs of bankruptcy; $40 billion costs to the economy every year, $400 for a family of four. So every family that the Senator from Massachusetts is trying to help through an increase in minimum wage, he is hurting by stopping the reform of bankruptcy. We must reform bankruptcy. This is a hidden tax on the poor of America. 
By passing this legislation, reducing the tax, we will help the very same families that the Senator from Massachusetts wants to help.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send to the desk a joint resolution. This joint resolution is being introduced with the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, who is now in the chair, to address a very important issue. It is not an easy one to grasp on its face. This is largely because of an effort by some to misrepresent the facts of the case. In offering this resolution and asking my colleagues to join me in supporting and passing it, I would like to make some things very clear. 
What this resolution expresses is the sense of the Congress for supporting existing procedures for determining the safety and efficacy of drugs made available to the public. 
Specifically, it puts the Congress and the administration on record opposing the legalization of dangerous drugs such as marijuana, heroin, and LSD. 
As we consider this language, we are likely to hear from many of the drug legalization lobbies. They are going to try to misrepresent their true goals and the meaning of this resolution. We have already seen some of these tactics in the House earlier this week. They are going to tell you that this resolution opposes sick people. They are going to tell you that they only want to make medicine available to the desperately ill. They imply, of course, that the rest of us are opposed to helping the sick. But the agenda here is not about helping sick people; it's about drug legalization. 
Let's look at who's lobbying against our resolution. Since this is supposed to be about medicine, who's lobbying Congress? It is not the American Medical Association. It is not the American Psychiatric Association. It is not the American Cancer Society, the Glaucoma Society, the American Pediatrics Association, or any professional association of treatment specialists and scientists. It is the Drug Policy Foundation which opposes it, and the Marijuana Policy Project, the magazine High Times, and the marijuana legalization lobby, NORML--the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. All of these groups are drug legalization lobbies. And have been for years. None of these groups are medical associations or have any scientific expertise. What they rely on is anecdotes, scare tactics, and misinformation. Now, what is the agenda here? Is the goal medicine or legalization? 
Their agenda and their goal is not medicine, but it is legalization of drugs. 
Let me note who's supporting our resolution. It is the Nation's drug czar. It is Gen. Barry McCaffrey. It is national parent groups, like National Families in Action and Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America. It is the Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education, or PRIDE. It is supported by virtually every anti-legalization group across the country in every state in the Union. They know the answer to my question. 
But, let's consider another point. How do we normally make a dangerous drug with a high potential for abuse available as a legitimate medicine? Normally we do so with scientific validation. We do so by prescription. We control the quantities, the quality, and the distribution. We do not permit self-diagnosis and treatment. We do not license private citizens to manufacture the drugs in their kitchens or bathrooms. But what is happening with the efforts to make marijuana and other Schedule I drugs legal? 
In most states where this effort is afoot, there is no prescription requirement. There is no scientific validation required. There are no controls and no supervision. People are authorized to grow marijuana, for example, at home. They are authorized to self administer it in any dose for any length of time for any ailment they think necessary. This does not mean for the terminally ill or those with desperate conditions. It means for any condition, from migraines to athlete's foot. Is this the way we treat Valium or anti-depressants? Is this the way we treat heart medicine or blood pressure medicine? Is this about medicine or about legalization? The answer is all too clear. 
Our resolution addresses the effort by the drug legalization lobby in this country to get marijuana and other dangerous drugs on the streets, in our homes, and in our schools. These groups have been trying to do this for years. Sadly, they have been somewhat successful. 
They have failed because the public won't have anything to do with legalization. The public overwhelmingly opposes efforts to legalize. Knowing this, the legalization lobby has hit upon a subterfuge to slip legalization through by calling it a medicine. It is a cynical and deceptive campaign. 
What is being done here by these groups is to manipulate the public's concerns for the desperately ill. In efforts across the country, well-funded lobbying groups are promoting initiatives to declare marijuana and other dangerous drugs medicine. They are exploiting compassion to push their drug agenda. This effort is as fully sincere as anything we saw from the tobacco companies in their efforts to sell cigarettes.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, drug use among kids is growing dramatically. In the last few years, after a decade of decline, drug use is on the rise among 12- to 17-year-olds. The age for first use of illegal drugs has dropped. Today, the first-use of marijuana by 12- to 17-year-olds is the highest since we've been keeping records. The same is true for cocaine, heroin, and hallucinogens. We need to be talking seriously about how to stop this. This is why we ask our colleagues to support our resolution.

Let me see if I understand just what that means. If, for example, I was taking insulin to control diabetes, the parallel would be for me to be authorized to make it at home or to have three or four of my friends make it and give it to me when I wanted it.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are now, as I understand it, on the bankruptcy bill. As the Republican manager for this legislation, I want to speak to an amendment which was offered Friday by the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, but also to speak generally about the behavior of the bankruptcy bar as it relates to the amount of bankruptcies that are being filed, which were at a historical high of 1.4 million last year. That was a 30-percent increase. There was probably a 25-percent increase in 1996 over 1995. As we all know, there is an explosion of filings for consumer bankruptcy. 
I have blamed some of that on the law of 1978. That is why we have this bill before us, to change the law so it is not so easy to go into bankruptcy. 
In 20 years, I have had hundreds of people talk to me about it being too easy to go into bankruptcy. It ought to be harder, in their judgment. I have not had one person say to me that it ought to be easier to go into bankruptcy, and I have had people who have gone through bankruptcy tell me how easy it is to get into bankruptcy. 
I think the law of 1978 is at fault to some extent. I think the situation we have with Congress with 30 years of deficit spending, that Government doesn't have to live within its income, sends a signal to people in this country that it is all right for individuals to live beyond their income and avoid paying for it. 
We have had a general lack of shame or personal responsibility that used to be associated with paying bills or not paying bills and the filing of bankruptcy. That is no longer the situation, although that can be somewhat to blame for Government not setting a good example in this area. 
I also think there is more than just the downfall of personal responsibility. We have heard lots of speeches about how the credit industry, particularly the credit card industry, has not been very careful in the number of requests they have granted for bankruptcy, or the willy-nilly approach--I know they will say it is not willy-nilly. There is a very careful study they have of who ought to be mailed a credit card or not mailed a credit card. But as a practical matter, they have been pretty darn fluid with the number of credit cards that have been going through the mail. 
All of these are reasons why we have this legislation before us. All of these are reasons why this bill was voted out of committee on a vote of 16 to 2. All of these are reasons why a very strong bill passed the House of Representatives by a veto-proof margin. And all of these, I think, are reasons that, hopefully, on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week we will pass this bill by a very substantial margin. 
As I indicated, we have as one of the amendments that we will be voting on tomorrow an amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin. 
In my earlier statements on the Senate floor, I have alluded to the role of the overly aggressive bankruptcy lawyers plague in fomenting the current crisis in our bankruptcy system. Last Friday, Senator Feingold offered an amendment which will insulate bankruptcy lawyers from fines when they encourage bankruptcy abuse. 
As reported by the Judiciary Committee, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act fines--in other words, penalizes--bankruptcy lawyers who steer high-income people who can repay their debt into chapter 7. Under the bill, in the narrow circumstance where a chapter 7 trustee is successful in getting a chapter 7 case dismissed or converted to chapter 13, the lawyer for high-income bankruptcy will be fined if his or her case is not substantially justified. That is our bill. 
This fine will reimburse the chapter 7 trustee for expenses incurred while detecting abuses of the bankruptcy system. I think any reasonable person will say that lawyers who file bankruptcy cases which are not substantially justified ought to be required and will be required to help defray the costs of these frivolous cases. That is all this bill does. Senator Feingold wants to cut this reasonable effort to control a bankruptcy bar which is seriously out of control. 
Mr. President, in order for my colleagues to understand the importance of imposing some reasonable controls on the conduct of bankruptcy lawyers, I want to give a little background on the conduct of bankruptcy lawyers. 
Today, many lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy view bankruptcy as an opportunity to make big money for themselves. This profit motive causes bankruptcy lawyers to promote bankruptcy as the only option even when a financially troubled client has an obvious ability to repay his or her debts. In other words, this profit motive creates a real conflict of interest where bankruptcy lawyers push people into bankruptcy who don't belong there simply because they want to make a quick buck. 
As one of the members of the National Bankruptcy Commission noted in the Commission's 1997 report, many who make their living off the bankruptcy process have forgotten that declaring bankruptcy should have a moral dimension. 
As I have already said, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act contains reasonable penalties for lawyer misconduct. These penalties will cause lawyers to think twice before they willy-nilly cart their client off to bankruptcy court and pocket a nice profit. Bankruptcy lawyers get paid ahead of anybody else if there are assets or, obviously, they charge before they are going to help you. 
Some lawyers, in their rush to turn a profit, operate what are known as bankruptcy mills. These bankruptcy mills are nothing more than processing centers for bankruptcy. There is little or no investigation done as to whether an individual actually needs bankruptcy protection or whether or not a person is able to at least partially repay some of his debt. 
Recently, one of these bankruptcy attorneys from Texas was sanctioned in bankruptcy court. According to the court, this attorney had very little knowledge of bankruptcy law, but advertised extensively in the Yellow Pages and on television. Apparently, his advertising worked, because he filed about 100 new bankruptcy cases a month. Most of the work was done by legal assistants with very limited training. The court concluded that the attorney's services `amount to little more than a large scale petition preparer service for which he receives an unreasonably high fee.' 
The practices of these bankruptcy mills are so deceptive and sleazy that last year the Federal Trade Commission went so far--our Federal Trade Commission--as to issue a consumer alert warning consumers of misleading ads promising debt consolidation. 
Mr. President, I think there is a widespread recognition that bankruptcy lawyers are preying on unsophisticated consumers who need counseling and help in setting up a budget and who do not need to declare bankruptcy. Bankruptcy lawyers are the fuel which makes the engines of the bankruptcy mills run. It is not surprising that bankruptcy lawyers are leading the charge against this bankruptcy reform legislation. 
I want to point to some other evidence of lawyers playing a prime role in this effort to get people into bankruptcy and to avoid the payment of debt. 
We have previously heard complaints from some on the Senate floor about whether our bill does enough to protect child support and also to protect alimony during bankruptcy proceedings. I have already spoken to that topic on a previous occasion, but for now, I want to point out that some bankruptcy lawyers actually advertise that they can help deadbeat dads get out of their child support and other marital obligations. One bankruptcy lawyer has even written a book entitled, as you can see, `Discharging Marital Obligations in Bankruptcy,' by James P. Caher, Esquire. 
I think it is outrageous, Mr. President, that bankruptcy lawyers are helping deadbeats to cheat to force spouses out of alimony and to cheat children out of child support. That is a recipe for promoting poverty and human misery. Those who want to help the collection of child support during bankruptcy proceedings should join me in rejecting the Feingold amendment to protect bankruptcy lawyers. Those who are concerned about protecting child support should join me to ensure lawyers who engage in predatory conduct are subject to stiff fines. 
Those who are concerned about protecting child support should join me in moving child support from No. 7 in the bankruptcy priority list to No. 1. This is the only way to get people's attention. This is the only way to restore professionalism to the bankruptcy bar.

Mr. GRASSLEY. In this article, bankruptcy lawyers are advised to send out letters to anyone who has visited them recently asking about bankruptcy. This form letter encourages people to declare bankruptcy because if Congress passes bankruptcy reform, `Bankruptcy will be much more difficult, more expensive and probably [even] embarrassing.' 
I hope this bill does make bankruptcy more embarrassing--and more difficult. In fact, I plead guilty that that is a motive behind our legislation. The American people want people who voluntarily incur debts to pay those debts as agreed. Bankruptcy should be difficult, and the moral stigma that used to be associated with bankruptcy ought to be resurrected. 
Do we say that never is anybody entitled to a fresh start? No, you never say `never.' We have not in 100 years. The bankruptcy code, the national bankruptcy code, is 100 years old--when it was first passed. There has always been a concept that, maybe because of natural disaster, maybe because of a lot of illness, maybe even in some cases because of divorce, but things beyond your control, that you ought to have a fresh start. And we do not detract in this legislation from that 100-year tradition. 
But we do say no to bankruptcy lawyers who advise this way or bankruptcy lawyers who send out notices that say, `You had better file for bankruptcy right now because Congress might pass a bill and make it more difficult to do it.' Or we respond positively to the FTC sending out a warning to people: `Beware of people in the bankruptcy bar who are not acting in a responsible manner.' 
I will give you another example of what is wrong with our bankruptcy system. A few weeks ago, the Washington Times quoted a local bankruptcy attorney advising his clients, `. . . anybody who's going to file better do it now. Get in while the getting's good.' 
What has happened to the notion of bankruptcy then as a last resort? What has happened to any sense of personal responsibility? How can anyone describe filing bankruptcies as `getting in while the getting's good'? Mr. President, the getting may be good for the lawyers when someone else files for bankruptcy, but the rest of us have to pay the price--a $40-billion-a-year cost, $400 per family of four. That means any family of four is paying $400 more every year for increased costs of goods and services, because there is no free lunch when it comes to bankruptcy; somebody pays. The consumers of America are paying. It is a hidden tax. 
Our bill will never do away completely with that hidden tax, but this legislation will reduce that hidden tax and hopefully be a small step towards the reestablishment of the principle of personal responsibility. 
So the rest of us have to pay the price. This kind of attitude about bankruptcy represents some of what is wrong with our bankruptcy laws and why the current laws need to be changed. Not only do the current practices of bankruptcy lawyers do a disservice to their clients, they also cheat society as a whole. The integrity of the bankruptcy system depends in part upon the honesty and the competence of bankruptcy lawyers. 
The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act makes necessary changes to correct abuses of the system by bankruptcy lawyers. It requires that attorneys investigate the financial resources of their clients. The bill holds attorneys responsible if they do not honestly determine that their clients really need bankruptcy protection. 
In other words, we are just asking that lawyers do what they are trained to do, and that is to counsel people, counsel people in a responsible way. And just willy-nilly putting people into bankruptcy through some bankruptcy mill is not that sort of responsible jurisprudence. 
If we want to keep bankruptcy available to those who really need it--in other words, the fresh start that for 100 years people have been entitled to--we have to address these misuses of the system by bankruptcy lawyers. This bill does exactly that. And in order for this bill to work, we need to reject the Feingold amendment and keep the incentives for responsible lawyer conduct currently in the bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, during the last week of the August recess, I traveled around Iowa launching a statewide antidrug coalition effort. I have been working on putting this program together for the last 2 years. It is an effort to bring together elements from all across my State from all areas of life to deal with the growing drug problem. I have spoken often about this problem here and in many of my public speeches. While we often hear about drug use in our inner cities, we are, perhaps, a little less prepared to learn about major drug use problems in our rural areas. Well, it's here and it is every bit as serious as drug use in our major urban centers. On my trip around Iowa, a young man named Josh, all of 15 years old, joined me. 
Josh began using drugs at 11 and was an addict before he was a teenager. He began using marijuana. His friends told him it was `cool.' He moved from that to just about every drug you can name. His story is becoming all too common. Last April, I held a field hearing in Cedar Rapids. The star witness at that hearing was a young woman of 17 who was a methamphetamine addict at 15. She was not only a user, she was also a pusher. 
Today, methamphetamine use in Iowa is twice the national average. Iowa is the target for Mexican criminal gangs pushing this drug every bit as much as San Diego or Los Angeles. Iowa and other States in the Midwest are also becoming home to an epidemic of meth-producing laboratories. 
Many of these are located on farms or in small towns little prepared to be drug-producing emporiums. 
If you talk to local sheriffs or police officers in even tiny towns, the story is shocking. I had a letter recently from a policeman in Ottumwa, Iowa, the home of Radar O'Reilly. What he tells me is that meth is now a major problem in this community of 30,000. It's not just a problem of users. It is increasingly a problem of producers. Many of the meth addicts have gone into the business of making their own. It's all to easy. If they can't get advice on how to make meth from their friends or contacts, why, they can simply pull it down off the Internet. Try it, if you don't believe me, it's that easy. You can put a small lab together in your kitchen. 
You can use common household chemicals or chemicals used in agriculture, a frying pan, coffee filters, and a microwave. 
Police have found labs in trailers, in vans, and sport vehicles. According to the policeman from Ottumwa, hardware stores there are having a problem keeping supplies of drain cleaner in stock because it is popular with the kitchen-lab crowd. Farmers across Iowa are having trouble with people stealing anhydrous ammonia. Anhydrous ammonia is used as a fertilizer to help fix nitrogen in the soil to grow corn. It is also used to produce meth. Local addicts and producers are stealing it from farms. County farm bureau organizations are having to issue advisories to farmers how to spot these thefts. This is only one of the chemicals. Many of these are carcinogenic. They are all dangerous and polluting. 
This means the lab sites are toxic and dangerous and expensive to clean up. In many cases, the toxic waste materials are dumped into the ground or poured down the kitchen sink. 
One of the major farming magazines in Iowa, Wallaces Farmer, devoted most of its September issue to this problem. Wallace Farmers does not normally deal with drug questions. But the most recent issue has a 20-page special on how meth is tearing apart the heartland. This should tell us something about what's happening. This story is increasingly common not only in Iowa but throughout the Midwest and the West. It is a problem moving eastward. 
Along with cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and inhalants, we are seeing a resurgence in drug use in this country. I will have more to say on this later. Like our earlier epidemic, most of this increased use is occurring among the young, between the ages of 12 and 20. 
Drug use among this age group has doubled in the past 5 years. We are well on our way to recreating the drug epidemic of the 1960's and 1970's. 
There are some people who seem to welcome this development. The financier, Mr. Soros, is spending some of his fortune to promote drug legalization. He has convinced others to join him. He has a lobbying group that uses funds to promote legalization in the States, internationally, and to give the idea intellectual legitimacy. He is joined in the argument to make drugs legal and therefore available by worthies like Milton Friedman and William F. Buckley, Jr. Hollywood, TV, and our recording industry recognize the market potential of this and have begun pushing drugs in movies, music, and entertainment. 
Now, many of these people will tell you that they don't mean to sell drugs to our kids. They mean it for adults. I have a problem with that, but it's not the central concern. The chief problem is, few adults actually start using drugs. That's a risky behavior we find almost exclusively among young people before the age of 20. By divorcing this reality from the argument to legalize, these people are little different from tobacco company executives. At least, privately, the tobacco companies were prepared to acknowledge that the primary market for new smokers was teens and preteens. They did not hide behind polite fictions and intellectual smoke screens. 
What we are seeing in my State today and across this country is the fruits of these labors. The most recent reports on teenage drug use continue a disturbing cycle. That is why I began work to fight back. While I think there are many things government can and must do to deal with this problem, it is not solely or even wholly something that government can do. We need parents, schools, business, and other folks at the community level engaged in dealing with this problem. We need to be doing a lot more. This is not just a money problem. Resources are necessary but they are not sufficient. This is a people problem and we need to engage people to fight back. If we don't we are going to find ourselves in a drug problem every bit as serious as our last one. We are perilously close to that now. 
In closing, let me read something that Ben Stein, host of a TV game show, wrote recently about his young son. He took him to what he thought was a safe retreat in rural Idaho, far from his native Los Angeles, for a summer vacation. What he discovered there was that his 11-year-old was being exposed to drug use every day. The source of that was other kids. The users and pushers were kids telling kids that drugs were cool. After all, that was the message everywhere. They were also providing the drugs. Stein wrote how it made him feel:  
I don't like being under siege about my boy's future. . . . I wish I had some help here from my Hollywood, my home, my workshop. I'd like some help from `The Simpsons' and `South Park' in telling my son that dope smoking is for losers and fools, that being high is stupid and unnatural and unhealthy, and that the cool people take life as it comes, sober and healthy and in some control of their own destinies. 
There are a lot more people out there under siege. We need to be doing something about that. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today we introduce two bills that will help farmers. These bills take another step in insuring the viability of family farming into the next century. 
This first bill clarifies the laws regarding both Section 521 and Subchapter T agricultural cooperatives. Recent action by the Internal Revenue Service hinders farmers' attempts to form value-added cooperatives and to use these cooperatives as a source of income and stability. Specifically, the IRS changed its position of allowing cooperatives, in connection with their marketing functions, to manufacture or otherwise change the basic form of their members' products without jeopardizing the cooperatives' status. 
Farmers value-added cooperatives were designed to encourage farmers to own the businesses that process their products, and to give them the benefit of the finished product. These cooperatives help create new products that benefit farmers. The IRS is choosing to differentiate between using a machine process and using a biological process to manufacture the finished product. There should be no difference--there isn't for business, there isn't for farmers, so there shouldn't be for the IRS. 
The second bill that we are introducing today will take Aggie bonds out from under the private activity bond cap. Aggie bonds are an important tool for first time farmers. Removing them from the existing cap will greatly enhance the opportunities for beginning and less established farmers and ranchers to acquire affordable, low cost credit for agricultural purchases. Most industrial revenue bonds are typically issued for millions of dollars, underwritten, rated and sold to investors. Aggie bonds, which cannot exceed $250,000, are not underwritten, are not rated, and are not sold to investors. Rather, they are sold to local lenders who finance beginning farmers with a lower than normal interest rate. Several states would like to start offering Aggie bonds but cannot because their volume cap is already used for non-agricultural projects. Many other states, including my state of Iowa, cannot meet the demand for Aggie bonds. 
These are two bills that will help farmers now, and always. These offer immediate help, and are part of the tax code restructuring that we must enact to make the playing field fair to America's farmers. I want to thank Senator Moseley-Braun for working with me on these important pieces of legislation.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for bringing this issue up. It is one that had a close vote in the committee. I presume it has a legitimate place in discussion on the floor of the Senate because of the very close vote. However, I opposed it in committee, and I intend to oppose it here on the floor of the Senate. 
I would say that in this area, Senator Durbin and I have tried to respond to some of the concerns that Senator Feingold has had. We did include in our legislation, as a result of his proposals in committee, that when a lawyer was substantially justified in feeling that this person should be placed in chapter 7, the penalties that we have in the bill otherwise applicable to lawyers who would put people in 7 that should be in 13, would not be applicable if the judge found so. 
But this amendment--and I apologize to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin--just goes too far. I think we need to look at some of the basic reasons why we have legislation. Not everybody would agree with my long list of reasons that we ought to have legislation; but, obviously, I have talked about the lack of personal responsibility. 
Second, we have had Congress for 30 years setting a bad example for the individuals of America because we have had 30 years of deficit spending. What sort of a signal does that send to the people of this country? If the government can do it, surely they can do it. Hopefully, we will get over that hurdle this year. For the first time in 30 years, we will have a balanced budget. Hopefully, I think we are going to pay down something like $63 billion on the national debt, and hopefully even more than that. 
We also have the credit card industry that we have talked about here in the last several days on this bill. Maybe they are not careful enough about who they encourage to use credit cards and go into debt with the credit card purchase of goods and services. But we have a very aggressive bar. That is my feeling--that the bankruptcy bar is not counseling their clients like they used to of whether or not they could go into bankruptcy. We even hear that it isn't the lawyer that can get people into bankruptcy, it is a legal aid, a legal assistant, who can, through the forms that are made and the electronic filing of collecting a fee, very quickly get people into chapter 7. We are trying to deal with the behavior of the bankruptcy bar in the sense that we want them to get to the point where they are counseling people. Should they be in bankruptcy at all? And, second, should they be in chapter 7, or chapter 13? 
So, obviously, if we feel that there has been some abuse of the present practices of the bar, we want to make sure that we have disincentives for people to go into 7, if they go into 13. And we have used disincentive penalties against the legal profession, if they should have been in 13 against the lawyers, I should say, who advise. 
We have responded to some of those concerns that Senator Feingold has already raised. But we can't respond to all of them. 
I strongly oppose this amendment, because one of the key features of our bill is that it holds debtor lawyers accountable for their actions. We do this by imposing fines when they steer clients into chapter 7 who otherwise can repay their debts. 
We all have heard stories about the bankruptcy mills which recklessly send people into bankruptcy and process people in bankruptcy like sometimes we process cattle. Any meaningful reform must address the issue. The Grassley-Durbin bill does that--S. 1301, the bill before us. 
This amendment by Senator Feingold, in my estimation, would effectively nullify the new financial incentives for debtor lawyers to act responsibly. This amendment completely takes away the fines that bankruptcy lawyers must pay when they recklessly steer people to have the ability to repay their debts into chapter 7 and away from chapter 13. These fines will be an effective and meaningful way to ensure that lawyers advise clients responsibly. 
If adopted, this amendment will allow bankruptcy mills to continue turning out knew bankruptcy cases. Under this amendment, a debtor's lawyer who is deliberately ignorant of a debtor's ability to repay his debt gets off scot-free. Perhaps we should call this amendment the `Bankruptcy Mills Protection Act.' 
I oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to do so. 
The amendment will not provide true financial incentives for chapter 7 trustees to go over all of the filings that are in chapter 7 and find out which ones can be removed to chapter 13, because this work of the public trustees--chapter 7 trustees--is one of the two major tools that we have to make sure that people who have the ability to repay debt do it rather than getting off scot-free, as most often happens in chapter 7. 
The Feingold amendment won't provide a penny when a 707(b) motion is acceptable and the case is then dismissed. In that case, there won't be a chapter 13 case to allow trustees to collect expenses. 
I ask my friends to help us keep this bill tightly written so that there is, in fact, a change of behavior among bankruptcy lawyers to advise clients to be responsible for debt--to maybe not go into bankruptcy at all, or if bankruptcy would be charted to chapter 13 as opposed to chapter 7. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRASSLEY. We hope very much that Members on both sides of the aisle will come to the floor and offer amendments on the bankruptcy bill. Both sides have reached an agreement on the number of amendments to be offered. All we have to have is time agreements on those amendments, and if a vote is necessary on those amendments, have a vote. 
Senator Durbin has worked very hard with me for his part, for the Democratic Members, as I have for the Republican Members, to get a very good bankruptcy bill before this body. It was hard work for the last year putting a bill together. I really appreciate his cooperation, including getting it through the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 16-2, then additionally accommodating some other Members who are not on the Judiciary Committee, the committee of jurisdiction over bankruptcy. 
We accommodated several Members, both on the Judiciary Committee and not on the Judiciary Committee, through the consideration of their amendments in some negotiating sessions we had last week to limit the number of amendments, also to accept, as I have indicated, in the managers' amendment many of the ideas that people have. 
So since Senator Durbin and I have worked together in a cooperative and very much bipartisan way on this legislation, we hope that at these almost midnight hours of this session, as well as midnight hours of the consideration of this legislation through the process of a year and a half, that we would not have Members stalling by not coming to the floor and offering their amendments. 
So we hope very much that people will come over and do that. We are ready for those considerations. The floor leaders of both parties very much want to see this legislation pass. And we ought to do that because, as Senator Durbin and I have described for the Members of this body, there is very much a need for this legislation, and particularly since we have this tradition of bipartisanship on the issue of bankruptcy, not only between Senator Durbin and myself but historically over the last decade and a half between his predecessor, Senator Heflin, now retired from the Senate, and myself. We want to keep that tradition going. There is just now the one simple process of Members coming over here and offering amendments that we have all agreed should be considered. 
There is no controversy at this point, except should an amendment be adopted or not. There is no controversy of whether or not this bill should eventually come to a vote. There is no controversy about what amendments should be offered. Hopefully, there is no controversy over how long we should discuss these amendments--a thorough discussion but with time limits--and eventually get this bill passed and get it to the conference committee. There Senator Durbin and I are going to need a lot of time. 
There is a tremendous difference between our bill and the House bill. Senator Durbin and I need the rest of this session. And we hope that the rest of this session that we are talking about isn't October 1. We hope it is from this date of September 17 to the end of the session to work out the differences between the House and Senate. So that is why we want Members to come. 
In the meantime, I say to Senator Durbin, I thought I would --yes, let me yield to Senator Durbin.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we probably have fewer Republican Members with amendments to offer, but I have also been on the phone to talk to those people, as well, to come to the floor to expedite this process. The Senate majority leader and Senator minority leader really want this bill to be passed. 
As I said, we need a long time to conference--our bill is quite a bit different from the House bill--to work out the differences and get a bill to the President before we adjourn. 
Mr. President, I would like to discuss several provisions of the consumer bankruptcy reform act which will greatly enhance the ability to collect child support from people who owe child support. When the Judiciary Committee marked-up the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, I joined with Senators Hatch and Kyl to add an amendment to the bill which would protect and enhance the status of child support claimants during bankruptcy proceedings. 
The bill, which were reported out of the committee on a bipartisan vote of 16-2 now provides that child support obligations must be the first obligation paid during any bankruptcy proceeding. Under current law, child support is paid 7th so that often there just aren't funds available to pay to ex-spouses and children. I think that this bill will be tremendously helpful for those who are owed child support. 
And the National district Attorneys Association agrees with me. This organization represents more than 7,000 local prosecutors throughout the United States, many of whom must enforce child support obligations under title IV-D of the Federal Social Security Act. 
On September 2d, 1998, NDAA President John R. Justice wrote me to express the association's belief that this legislation will `substantially assist' efforts to collect child support for the children and spouses of debtors who have filed for bankruptcy. This letter went on to note that association supports the act because S. 1301 contains `enormous enhancements to support collection remedies' and represents a `major improvement to the problems facing child support creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.' 
The reason it's important to put child support claimants at the top of the list during a bankruptcy proceeding is that most bankrupts don't have enough money to fully pay all their creditors. So, somebody's not going to be paid. This bill makes it more certain that child support will be paid in full before other creditors can collect a penny. That's real progress in making sure that children and former spouses are treated fairly. 
Also, the amendment accepted by the committee provided that someone owed child support can enforce their obligations even against the exempt property of a bankruptcy. This means that wealthy bankrupts can't hide their assets in expensive homes or in pension funds as a way of stiffing their children or ex-spouse. This is another example of how this legislation will help, not hurt, child support claimants. 
Outside the bankruptcy context, when there are delinquent child or spousal support obligations, State government agencies step in and try to collect the child support. S. 1301 exempts these collection efforts from the automatic stay. The `automatic stay' is a court injunction which automatically arises when anyone declares bankruptcy and it prevents creditors from collecting on their debts. 
But, now, if this legislation passes, State agencies would be in a much better position to collect past due child support. In practical terms, this means State government agencies attempting to collect child support can garnish wages and suspend drivers licenses and professional licenses. Mr. President, clearly, this bill will help State governments catch deadbeats who want to use the bankruptcy system to get out of paying child support. 
Taken together, these changes will significantly advance protection for child support claimants in the context of bankruptcy proceedings. This is why the National District Attorneys Association, an organization which represents many of the prosecutors who must enforce child support obligations, supports this bill. And these changes provide yet another compelling reason to support S. 1301.

Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, because we have about 12 amendments pending on this bill, I want to thank the Senator from Rhode Island for coming over here and helping to expedite the process of the Senate on a very important bill. I thank Senator Reed for coming over and doing that. 
Having said that, knowing the personality of the Senator from Rhode Island, that he is very sincere about his position and very sincere in determining that this is a problem to needs to be dealt with, I suggest there are two issues relating to this amendment. One would be the immediate issue of whether or not it is needed; second, the extent to which this really falls in the jurisdiction of the Senate Banking Committee. 
I don't find fault with the Senator from Rhode Island offering this amendment to my bill, but a reason for my opposition is that I do not like to usurp the authority of other committees. 
I think experience has shown that price controls, as indicated in this amendment, are counterproductive. In the end they are very harmful to the people they are trying to help, particularly the consumer, and in addition to that, somewhat harmful to the general economy. 
I feel this amendment should be opposed. This amendment has the destabilizing effect of imposing price controls on credit card lenders by prohibiting the imposition of a fee or canceling the account of an account holder because the account has not incurred financial charges. 
The credit card industry is extraordinarily competitive. People might not realize it--on the other hand, they might realize it because they get so many of these solicitations--but in the banking industry alone, there are 6,000 credit card issuers. They are all in competition, competing with each other for new credit card holders. Everybody here on the Senate floor right now is in somebody's computer and in a few days they will get some sort of a solicitation. That is how competitive it is. Whether that is right or wrong is another thing, but the competitive environment makes that determination. 
This intense competition provides consumers with enormous benefits. For instance, it has resulted in a decline of the average credit card interest rate in the past several years. Just as important, the competition results in industry choice for the consumer. As I said, consumers can choose from literally thousands of different cards, each with a different array of pricing and benefit features. 
As a result, the extraordinarily competitive environment in which credit card issuers operate, consumer credit actually dictates credit card prices much more efficiently than we can do through almost any Federal law. Any lender who offers undesirable pricing features will swiftly fall behind the competition because the consumers can and will choose other products. By contrast, this amendment would harm consumers by restricting consumer choice. 
In addition, we have a record going back to 1991 when another Senator--still a Member of this body--tried to 
impose price controls on lenders and it precipitated a severely negative impact on the stock market. For example, in 1991, when the Senate opposed price controls on credit card lenders in the form of an interest rate ceiling, the stock market reacted, dropping 120 points in a single day. Clearly, in this time of already volatile market activity, we don't want to repeat things of that nature. I am not suggesting that would be what would happen in the case of the amendment that is before the Senate, but, obviously, we should be very cautious. 
Now, probably a more important point for Members to consider in supporting or not supporting this amendment would be, as I said, whether it is in the jurisdiction of the Senate Banking Committee. We have the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Faircloth, chairing the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions of the Banking Committee. He has indicated to me that he will hold hearings on credit card solicitation practices and also on lending practices. 
I know many Members feel the credit card companies have been sloppy and overly aggressive in the way they offer credit. I say there is substance to that argument. That is why I have appreciated my comanager of this bill, Senator Durbin, bringing this to our attention as part of this legislation. I think it has been amply discussed, and I share some of those concerns as well. I do think it is more appropriate for the committee of jurisdiction to do that. I am certainly not here to tell Members that credit card companies have been totally responsible in the way that they offer credit. But the fact is that these are issues which need to be explored by the authorizing standing committee and its subcommittee. 
The amendment of the Senator from Rhode Island is a Banking Committee issue. We happen to have before the Senate a bankruptcy bill which came out of the Judiciary Committee where we don't have the expertise that we ought to have on this issue. I would like to follow the regular order of the Senate and let the subcommittee with real expertise examine this. 
I have a letter from Senator Faircloth that I wish the Senator from Rhode Island would consider. It is addressed to me. 
It is my understanding that a number of amendments relating to credit cards will be offered to S. 1301. Most, if not all, of these amendments will relate to matters in the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. I Chair the Financial Institutions Subcommittee of the Banking Committee. 
I share the concerns that many have regarding multiple credit card solicitations and solicitations to minors. In fact earlier this year, my Subcommittee held a hearing on bankruptcy issues, with representatives of the credit card industry testifying. I have requested and received GAO reports on such practices as high loan to value loans and the sending of `live' loan checks. 
As for many of the proposed amendments relating, however, none have been passed by the Committee. In fact, none have been considered by the Committee. Further, none of the proponents of the amendments have requested hearings on any of their legislative proposals. 
During consideration of the bankruptcy bill, please know that I would be more than willing to hold a hearing or hearings on any of these proposals in my Subcommittee where they rightfully should be considered under regular order. 
Sincerely, LAUCH FAIRCLOTH, 
Chairman, Subcommittee on Financial Institutions.  
I give that to my colleagues for consideration. Again, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for coming. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. REED addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I introduce the Long-Term Care and Retirement Security Act. This bill is an important first step in helping Americans prepare for their long-term care needs. A companion bill to the Long-Term Care and Retirement Security Act has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Nancy Johnson. 
Longer and healthier lives are a blessing and a testament to the progress and advances made by our society. However, all Americans must be alert and prepare for long-term care needs. The role of private long-term care insurance is critical in meeting this challenge. 
The financial challenges of health care in retirement are not new. Indeed, too many family caregivers can tell stories about financial devastation that was brought about by the serious long-term care needs of a family member. Because increasing numbers of Americans are likely to need long term care services, it is especially important to encourage planning today. 
Most families are not financially prepared when a loved one needs long-term care. When faced with nursing home costs that can run more than $40,000 a year, families often turn to Medicaid for help. In fact, Medicaid pays for nearly two of every three nursing home residents at a cost of more than $30 billion each year for nursing home costs. With the impending retirement of the Baby Boomers, it is imperative that Congress takes steps now to encourage all Americans to plan ahead for potential long-term care needs. 
The Long-Term Care and Retirement Security Act will allow Americans who do not currently have access to employer subsidized long-term care plans to deduct the cost of such a plan from their taxable income. This bill will encourage planning and personal responsibility while helping to make long-term care insurance more affordable for middle class taxpayers. 
This measure will encourage Americans to be pro-active and prepare for their own long term care needs by making insurance more affordable. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I consume. 
We have the chairman of the appropriate subcommittee willing to work with Senator Reed to address this problem in the Banking Committee. My opposition to this is not so much a matter of substance but of procedure and not usurping the authority of that committee. It does need to be studied. I can tell you that in the Grassley-Durbin amendment, we have enhanced disclosure requirements to help consumers. 
While I respect the Senator's view on price controls, my view is that forcing a credit card company to offer credit when it has made a business determination that it would lose money will only force increased prices on other consumers. This is something that the Banking Committee needs to take a very serious look at and do it before we do something that may help some but may also hurt others. 
Mr. President, I am going to ask that this amendment be tabled after the Senator from Alabama speaks. I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Alabama.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I introduce the Civil Service Long-Term Care Insurance Benefit Act. This legislation is an important first step in helping Americans prepare for their long-term care needs. 
I am pleased to have my colleague Senator Graham of Florida join me as a cosponsor of this legislation, which has also been introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative John Mica. 
The Civil Service Long-Term Care Insurance Benefit Act will establish a program under which long-term care insurance may be obtained by current and former employees of the federal government. The premiums will not be subsidized by the government and will be paid for entirely by the employee or retiree. However, this legislation will make long-term care insurance more affordable to by using the government's purchasing power to negotiate volume discounts. 
It is my belief that the participation of a large employer such as the federal government in the long-term care insurance market will act as a catalyst to encourage other large employers to offer similar plans. This legislation will establish a larger market for long-term care insurance and help ensure the availability of competitively priced, high quality insurance products. 
This measure will encourage Americans to be pro-active and prepare for their long term care needs by making insurance more widely available and affordable. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an organization that has served the U.S. Senate well for 20 years. The organization I want to talk about is the Employee Benefit Research Institute or EBRI, as we call it. EBRI is observing its 20th anniversary today, September 14. Created with the help of a handful of employee benefit consultants and actuaries in 1978 who wanted to fill the void that existed relating to data about employee benefits, EBRI has increased its membership to include representatives from pension funds to Fortune 500 companies, labor unions, and trade associations. 
With this broad representation, EBRI has the ability to influence policymakers and elected officials throughout the country. But EBRI uses its influence wisely. EBRI does not lobby Members of Congress or other governmental agencies. Rather, its mission is to provide objective, nonpartial information on the issues of economic security and employee benefits. EBRI does its job very, very well. 
As Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I can personally attest to the value of EBRI's work and the expertise of its staff. Last year, the CEO of EBRI, Dallas Salisbury moderated a panel forum consisting of 6 experts who discussed the role of employment in retirement income. This forum led to a Senate hearing on the issue of the implications of raising the retirement age, as well as a number of articles in newspapers and magazines on the need to consider whether older Americans have sufficient opportunities to stay employed. 
More recently, EBRI was actively involved with its educational partner, the American Savings Education Council (ASEC), in the planning of the first National Summit on Retirement Savings. This Summit was part of an initiative I introduced in the Senate called the Savings Are Vital to Everyone's Retirement or SAVER Act. The Summit attracted international attention and has put the Department of Labor, ASEC, and state and local governments on a course toward enhancing the awareness of Americans about the need to save for retirement and how to go about it. 
I know my colleagues value the work of EBRI just as much I do. In the years ahead, I am sure we will continue to rely heavily on the research and the publications produced by EBRI. The issues EBRI concerns itself with--employee benefits and income security--are receiving more national attention than ever before. EBRI's contributions as an objective provider of information will help make the job of ensuring Americans have health and income security in retirement easier to achieve.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I think that we need to consider once again the very important issue of bankruptcy. Senator Durbin has cooperated very well in the subcommittee's work and the committee's work to bring the bill this far. 
Why are we introducing a bankruptcy bill? Why do we need major bankruptcy reform? I think it is pretty simple that under the current system an individual can avoid paying the debts that he has incurred with few, if any, questions asked even if that individual has some ability to repay all or a portion of those debts. 
This much too easy bankruptcy system encourages irresponsible behavior and costs businesses and ultimately consumers they serve millions of dollars a year, adding up to $40 billion a year in added cost to product and service. 
They have to raise their prices to cover this. You, as a consumer, pay this. That is $400 for the average family--a hidden tax. You can see this being possible because individuals can declare bankruptcy under chapter 7 where debts are rarely repaid. Or there is the choice of chapter 13 which requires debtors to repay a discounted portion of their debts. And obviously--and this bill does that--Congress should encourage the use of chapter 13 where creditors will at least receive something, whereas under chapter 7 rarely anything. 
Our bill imposes a means test for people who declare bankruptcy. If a person can repay all or some of their debts now, or even over an extended period of time, they will either have to file under chapter 13 or stay out of the bankruptcy system entirely. This will mean that the businesses which extended credit in good faith will not be left with absolutely nothing. 
Our bankruptcy reform bill imposes a means test by letting creditors file motions under section 707(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. These motions would raise evidence concerning a debtor's ability to repay debt. 
Under current law, creditors--the people with the most to gain or lose--are expressly forbidden from doing this. By opening the doors to creditor involvement, businesses can become masters of their own destiny. 
Of course, in order to prevent abusive court filings--we don't deny that there can be some abuse of this privilege, but we have included penalties if a court dismisses a creditor's motion and determines that the motion was not substantially justified. 
Our bankruptcy reform bill contains a unique feature which will provide important assistance to small businesses which may not be able to afford to press their case in bankruptcy court. The chapter 7 public trustees--these are the private individuals who administer bankruptcy cases and who are in the best position to know whether debtors can repay their debts--are allowed to bring evidence and motions to the bankruptcy judge. If the judge grants a motion to dismiss a bankruptcy petition or to transfer the case to chapter 13, the attorney for the debtor will be fined and the fine will be paid to the chapter 7 trustee as a reward, as an incentive for detecting an abuse of the bankruptcy system by a debtor and by the counsel for that person that owes money. 
Thus, a well-informed cadre of bankruptcy trustees with a meaningful financial incentive will be empowered under this legislation to find debtors who could repay and get them into chapter 13 or out of the bankruptcy system entirely. 
A recent survey of chapter 7 trustees indicated that over 80 percent of the trustees would use this power if it were given to them. Empowering chapter 7 trustees will help small businesses since the effect of transferring or dismissing a case will be that creditors will collect more and bills will be paid. There will be less of an incentive to go into chapter 7 willy-nilly if there is somebody looking over the shoulder to see that it has been done right. We then avoid those people who might be shady, those people who might be using bankruptcy as part of personal financial planning. Under this procedure, small businesses would need only to sit back and let the trustee seek his reward and would not have to spend a dime to litigate the case. 
This is important legislation. It will help all consumers because it will help businesses collect debts that will otherwise remain unpaid and be passed on to the people who pay their debts and never declare bankruptcy. This bill is about basic fairness. It is about time that Congress provides fairness for all consumers. 
Madam President, I think it is very important that we consider on this latter point that I made about the trustees being able to review these bankruptcy cases, that we make very clear that this ought to encourage the bankruptcy bar, to some extent, to be very careful, whereas we feel some are not so careful now in its present environment of the last 20 years of counseling people into bankruptcy in the first place or into chapter 7 as opposed to chapter 13. I don't think a lawyer is going to want to take a chance on being penalized for putting somebody in chapter 7 that should have been in chapter 13; or even putting somebody in bankruptcy that shouldn't have been there in the first place. We feel that we need to get the bankruptcy bar back to the point where they are advising people; that in every instance a person might feel that they want to go into bankruptcy, that it might not be justified. 
I yield the floor. I want to give my good friend, the Senator from Illinois, an opportunity to speak on this subject.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to say a few words today before we have our cloture vote on S. 1301, and that is the Consumer Bankruptcy Protection Act. That is going to occur, as stated by the Chair, at 5 o'clock. We are going to vote at that time on whether we can even consider this very important piece of legislation that is called the Consumer Bankruptcy Protection Act. 
As I said yesterday, I think the necessity of having a cloture vote and the objection to taking this bill up was a desperation tactic. If the opponents of reform want to fight reform, let's have a fight about the merits of bankruptcy reform. I would like to get to the bill. I would like to have everybody vote for cloture on the motion to proceed, and then we are there debating this legislation. When we get to the bill, I want to assure everyone that I am going to work hard to further accommodate concerns expressed by members of the minority. I have proceeded in this fair way since we started to consider bankruptcy reform, and we have been at this at the subcommittee and committee level probably almost a year to this point. 
In subcommittee, when we marked up the bill, I personally saw to it that many of the changes which my distinguished ranking minority member, Senator Durbin, wanted were inserted into the bill, and at the full committee markup I worked with Senator Hatch to ensure that a number of Democratic amendments were offered. I did not accept these provisions because I supported them or thought these provisions were the best policy choice. I accepted these amendments out of a desire to accommodate the concerns of the Democratic Members. So there is no reason for them to filibuster this bill at all. If the Democratic Members want to be respected, then it seems to me that the members of that party also have to act responsibly when those of us in the majority go out of our way to accommodate the concerns of the minority. There is no need to clutter up the bill with amendments that are totally irrelevant or unrelated to the issue of bankruptcy. 
For instance, I have heard that the issue we just left, campaign finance reform, might be offered. I have heard that the minimum wage bill might be offered. I have heard that it is health care reform, that any or all of these could be added to this bill. 
That is why we have to vote for cloture now and, later on, on the bill. Otherwise, without imposing cloture, the bill becomes a vehicle for people who oppose reform to load this bill up with excess baggage. 
As I have said repeatedly here on this floor, the American public overwhelmingly favors bankruptcy reform: 68 percent of the people in a national poll; in my State of Iowa, 78 percent of the people. So let's stop playing games and get to the business of the country. The cloture vote is one of the key votes on bankruptcy reform. A vote against cloture is a vote against a piece of legislation that deals head on with an issue of extreme national importance. The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act that we have before us, or will have before us if we vote cloture, is fair and balanced. It passed out of the Judiciary Committee on a 16-to-2 vote. How could a bill that got out of committee 16 to 2 be subject to a filibuster? So, let's get to the bill and, hopefully, pass it. 
The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act is a bipartisan effort. It is a bipartisan effort which keeps the best of old law while curbing abuses. S. 1301 continues to help those who need the protection of the bankruptcy laws but implements measures to screen out those who use the bankruptcy system to avoid paying debts that they can afford to repay. 
The fair nature of this bill is represented by the overwhelming bipartisan support that it received in committee. The near unanimous consensus of the committee action reflects a belief that something must be done to curb the skyrocketing rate of bankruptcies, which reached an all-time high last year, and that this bill is thus a necessary step in restoring common sense to our bankruptcy laws and the system of bankruptcy. 
As the prime sponsor of this bill and chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over bankruptcy, I went out of my way to make sure the minority was treated fairly. At my hearing we invited every witness the minority requested. And every time my distinguished friend, Senator Durbin, sought to insert language into the bill, I personally saw to it that his desires were accommodated. The only time that I could not accommodate his desires was sometimes he asked for certain language to be deleted. 
American business lost around $40 billion last year as a result of bankruptcies. This translates into a hidden tax of $400 per family. We need to cut this hidden tax and put more money into the pockets of American families. We do this by reducing or eliminating the costs that we have of goods and services in America to every family of four by a figure of $400. 
Efforts to burden this bill with minimum wage and other completely unrelated amendments ought to be resisted. This bill is too important and time too short to allow political stunts and unrelated side issues to impede or delay its passage. As I said, 68 percent of the American people support bankruptcy reform. In its letter to the Judiciary Committee, the administration of President Clinton indicated its support for reform, and I thank the President and his people for helping this legislation along. I think there is a real consensus that now is the time to act. We have a fair, effective, bipartisan bill which deserves to be considered. As I said, we are willing to work with the minority to accommodate their concerns even further. 
It comes down to this. Do the Members of this body support bankruptcy reform? Will they vote for cloture today? And will they also follow on voting for cloture of the bill itself? I ask my colleagues to vote `yes' at 5 o'clock. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. I probably will not use all that. I can yield back some time. I will comment briefly. 
First of all, in order to get to the point where Senator Durbin needs to be to get consideration of his amendments, we have to get through this cloture vote and a cloture vote on the bill so we can get down to talking about these very serious matters. 
Many of the things that Senator Durbin has stated that he is interested in changing I would not want to say right out that I agree with every one of those. Some of them, I think, maybe go a little bit too far, but I have not seen--maybe I shouldn't say I haven't seen any, but I have seen few issues that he brought up in the course of the last year as we constructed this bill, that it wasn't possible for us to work out a lot of differences, particularly for those things that are included in the bill. 
As I said in my opening remarks, some things that he wanted removed, we didn't remove. I look forward to that opportunity, if we get it by getting through two cloture votes, to sitting down with Senator Durbin and some of his colleagues on his side of the aisle who now have an interest in this legislation to see what we can work out and even minimize the number of votes or the length of debate we ought to have on this bill. 
I will make one comment about one of the things Senator Durbin made reference to about opposition from the National Foundation for Consumer Credit to some of the ideas of Senator Sessions. To Senator Sessions' credit, he did work out some compromises that needed to be done. We have a letter dated August 6 from the National Foundation for Consumer Credit that says that they support those provisions of the legislation as well, and there is a copy of that letter to Senator Durbin. 
I think we have a process here that has worked so well. If you would stop and think--and Senator Durbin has worked in this spirit--for the years I have been on this subcommittee, either as chairman or as ranking member--and I served 16 years with the predecessor of Senator Durbin, and that was Senator Heflin from Alabama--there has not been a single piece of bankruptcy legislation to get through this body in that 16-year period of time that didn't have the cooperative effort of the Democrat chairman or ranking member and the Republican chairman or ranking member, depending on who was controlling the committee at that time in history. That reputation has been continued through Senator Durbin at this point. 
If we can just get everybody on Senator Durbin's side of the aisle to be in that same spirit that has promoted good bankruptcy legislation through this body for that period of time, we can be successful, not only with this piece of legislation, but also to emphasize that this is a needed piece of legislation. Even Senator Durbin, working with us, has helped us develop the first major change in legislation to be considered on the floor of this body since the passage of the 1978 bankruptcy law. 
I hope that the spirit that former Senator Heflin of Alabama and I have worked in, and has been continued by Senator Durbin and me thus far, can be fully accepted by people from his side of the aisle. I know he has to satisfy a lot of interests. I even have, I say to Senator Durbin, some interests on my side that are not satisfied with the legislation we brought out of committee. So I have some problems with which I have to work. 
The point is, if, since 1981, this effort can be successful, it can be successful this time. I just plead with everybody who might want to filibuster this for some extraneous issues that probably can be brought up in some other way on other bills that would satisfy the Senate majority leader, we can get there. 
I urge, as Senator Durbin has, a very positive vote on this. I hope it will be followed, assuming we are successful this time, with a positive vote later this week on cloture on the entire bill. 
I yield the floor, and I yield back what few seconds I have remaining.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might consume. I thank the Senator from Utah, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, not only for the kind remarks he made about my participation in this process on the bankruptcy law, but also to say that it would not have been possible to get it out of the Judiciary Committee without some compromises, which he helped shape in the process, and also in making it a better bill as well. So this is a cooperative effort not only in the subcommittee, but also at the full committee level. The 16-2 vote by which the bill was voted out of committee, I think, speaks better than anything I can say or even that the Senator from Utah can say about how badly needed this legislation is and what a significant compromise it is in order to get that type of a margin out of the Judiciary Committee, which the chairman has already referred to as a committee that can be very controversially oriented from time to time. This is a piece of legislation that speaks to how cooperative that committee can be when the need calls for it to be. 
Mr. President, as I recall, we are in a situation on this floor where there was an objection to the bill coming up. So the distinguished Senate majority leader had to move that this bill be brought up. So we have a debate going on now on a motion to proceed that is fairly uncharacteristic of most processes of moving legislation on the floor of the Senate. So I want to use this opportunity that we have of the Senate deciding whether or not we should even debate the merits of this bill to once again give reasons to my colleagues why we should move beyond the motion to proceed to actual consideration of this legislation. We will have that vote, as I am going to refer to in a minute, hopefully tomorrow. 
So I rise today to speak again on the importance and the need--the very justified need--for fundamental bankruptcy reform. Last week, as I stated, a member of the minority party objected to allowing the Senate to consider this bill that was voted out of committee 16-2--even to debate it. Tomorrow, we are set to vote on whether to proceed to the bankruptcy bill. If we don't have a positive vote on this, then bankruptcy will not be on the agenda this session. It is badly needed legislation. It would be a sad consequence of that vote to not be able to move forward. 
In my view, the fact that there is an objection to even considering bankruptcy reform shows just how scared and how reactionary the opponents of bankruptcy reform are. The opponents of reform know that the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act will pass overwhelmingly if allowed to come to a straight vote. I think hearing the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Chairman Hatch, say that just a few minutes ago fortifies what I have just said. 
The opponents of reform know that the polls are absolutely clear on a broad public support for bankruptcy reform. There is 
no way that a minority of the Senate can fool 68 percent of the people nationally who say that we need bankruptcy reform. And there is no way that a minority of the Senate can fool 78 percent of the people of my State of Iowa who were surveyed in a poll on the need and their support for bankruptcy reform. So the American people know that our bankruptcy system is, in fact, out of control. Obviously, the people know that it is out of control much more than even a small minority of the minority in this body know it is out of control. If they know it is out of control and badly in need of reform, they would let us proceed to this bill. So I hope that Congress will respond to what the people want and move forward to consider and pass--pass overwhelmingly, as it did out of committee--the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act. That is what representative democracy is all about. 
As I said on Thursday of last week when we were set to take up the bankruptcy reform bill, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform bill is a bipartisan piece of legislation which passed out of the Judiciary Committee by an overwhelming vote of 16-2. The goal of the bill is simple and it is important: to restore personal responsibility to our bankruptcy law, and to put an end to the many bankruptcies of convenience which are filed every year in the United States. 
In recent years, the number of bankruptcies has, in fact, very much skyrocketed. Every year since 1994, records have been broken in terms of the number of bankruptcies filed. Now we are at the point that we had 1.4 million personal bankruptcies in 1997. So if this trend continues, Mr. President, we must all shudder to think about the harm to our economy and to the moral fabric of our Nation--to the economy, with $40 billion of costs. There is no free lunch when it comes to bankruptcy. There might be for the person that declares bankruptcy, but as we know, in our society, somebody pays; $40 billion is being paid by somebody in America and that figures out to about $400 per family of four in America per year. Just think of that. You, Mr. President, could be spending $400 less for your goods and services if we did not have this high number of bankruptcies that we have. 
But more important, what does it do to the moral fabric of our great country when, somehow, you can live high on the hog and not worry about who is going to pay for it. You don't have to; you go into bankruptcy and somebody else pays for it. There ought to be, and is, a rule for America which is that we all ought to be personally responsible for the actions we take. That is applicable not just to moral issues of family and marriage, but it also involves the economic world we are in as well, and that is, in fact, if you enjoy something, you want to pay for it. 
The interesting and alarming thing is that this unprecedented increase in bankruptcy filings comes at a time when our economy has been generally healthy. Disposable income is up, unemployment is low, and interest rates are low. There is something that just doesn't make sense about this situation. Common sense and basic economics say that when the economy flourishes, bankruptcies should not be so high. 
I had an opportunity over the weekend to look at an old U.S. News and World Report from 1991 with the predictions of the decade of the 1990s coming up. At the time that magazine came out, we were in the middle of the recession of 1990. That recession was caused by one of the big tax increases that President Bush proposed. It wasn't quite as big as the tax increase that President Clinton got through in 1993, which was the biggest tax increase in the history of the world, but that tax increase had a detrimental impact on the economy and we were in a recession--recession 
that, thank God, we have had years of recovery since without going into another recession. 
But in that magazine it made light of the fact that there was a 135,000 increase in personal bankruptcies that year because of the recession. That is when we had the number of personal bankruptcies well below 800,000 at that particular time. 
Let's just think. There is going to be a recession around the corner someday, hopefully not for 3 or 4 years down the road, as the economy is going fairly strong. But it could be happening within a year from now if things in Southeast Asia and Russia don't turn around, maybe, and as the stock market is also indicating. We would be thinking in terms of half a million to 1 million bankruptcies just because of the economy turning south, if we are concerned about 135,000 increases in bankruptcies in the year 1990 as an example. 
It is an unprecedented time in our economy. Why is it an unprecedented time, then, for the number of personal bankruptcy filings? I don't know. I have said how it could be related to the bank's sending out so many credit cards for people to be invited into more debt. It could be because the Federal Government had 30 years of deficit spending. Hopefully, we have that behind us now with this year paying down $63 billion on the national debt for the first time in 30 years. It could be because the bankruptcy bar is very loose in their advice, or the lack of advice, on whether people ought to go into bankruptcy or not. There doesn't seem to be the shame that is connected with bankruptcy as there used to be. There is probably a lot of other reasons. At least we have those reasons to consider and those reasons to deal with. Another reason is the 1978 bankruptcy law that made it possible to get into bankruptcy. Hopefully, we have that turned around with the passage of this legislation as well. 
In the opinion of this Senator, of course, one of the main bankruptcy crises is, as I just stated, the overly liberal bankruptcy law of 1978. Remember, since 1978 I have had hundreds of people tell me it is too easy to get into bankruptcy. And it shouldn't be that easy. I have not had one person tell me that it ought to be easier to get into bankruptcy. And I even have had some people tell me who have been through bankruptcy that it is too easy to get into bankruptcy. That sort of attitude of the public is what is behind the 68 percent nationally and the 78 percent of the people in my State in polls who say the bankruptcy laws should be reformed. 
Quite simply, current law discourages personal responsibility. I want to say that again. Current law actually discourages personal responsibility. As a result, bankruptcy has become a first option, not as a last resort for many with financial difficulties. 
Bankruptcy is seen as a quick and easy way of avoiding debt. Bankruptcy is now a matter of convenience rather than a matter of necessity. The moral stigma that used to be associated with not being able to pay your debt is now almost completely gone. I am not saying that bankruptcy law serves no purpose. On the contrary, the ability to have a fresh start--or you might say it is a principle of our bankruptcy law that there are some people who are entitled to a fresh start--it is a vital part of this American system. It is the right thing to do in some instances. But what is important is that we 
structure our laws so that bankruptcy is available to those who truly need protection--people who maybe because of natural disaster, maybe because of a catastrophic illness in their family, maybe because of even divorce--there are several reasons that have been considered legitimate. But we want to make sure that this process is not available to those who want to abuse the system and find an easy irresponsible way out. 
The bill that we will hopefully get to consider after our cloture vote tomorrow strikes a balance between personal responsibility on the one hand and giving people an opportunity to get a fresh start who legitimately deserve it on the other hand. That is why the Judiciary Committee, which can be very partisan at times, approved this bill by a vote of 16 to 2. Mr. President, I will have more to say on the problems with our bankruptcy system if and when we get to consider the bankruptcy bill. 
I want to inform my colleagues about the deceptive practices of bankruptcy lawyers who dupe unwary consumers into declaring bankruptcies. The practices of bankruptcy lawyers have become underhanded so much that the Federal Trade Commission has issued an alert on that process. And in the process of issuing that order, they criticized the bankruptcy bar. 
If and when we get to consider the bill, I want to talk more about how my bill enhances collection of child support. The National District Attorneys Association, as well as numerous other organizations which collect child support, have written to me to praise this bill--S. 1301--and the innovations in the bill for protecting child support. 
Mr. President, supporting this bill is the right thing to do. Approving a vote tomorrow to move to this bill so it can actually be considered is the right thing to do, because the American people are sick and tired of the avoidance of personal responsibility--not only in the case of bankruptcy but so many other areas. It is one we can do something about right now through the passage of this legislation. 
The other body across the Hill has already passed an even more sweeping version of bankruptcy reform, and they have done it by a veto-proof margin. But here we are right now on the floor of the U.S. Senate fending off a filibuster against bankruptcy reform. After the vote tomorrow, if we win and can actually go to the debate of S. 1301, I expect maybe even a second filibuster. I don't think these desperation tactics work, and particularly in the case of something that is so badly needed as bankruptcy reform. 
It is interesting how the same people who criticize this Congress for doing anything are the same ones who are blocking positive bankruptcy reform. I have talked with many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I know there is a real desire to see bankruptcy reform happen this year. That is why the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act received such broad bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee. Quite simply, it is time to restore the sense of personal responsibility that we Americans are famous for to our bankruptcy law. 
I urge my colleagues to support the motion to proceed on S. 1301, and then to support S. 1301 and move to a bill that is going to bring new penalties for abusive bill collectors; it is going to bring new penalties for illegal repossessions; it is going to bring fines for inflated creditor claims; and it is going to bring penalties for deceptive credit practices. 
It seems to me that is a bill that not only will bring about bankruptcy reform so that bankruptcy will be used only when people are really entitled to a fresh start, fitting into a pattern that we have had in our bankruptcy laws between 1998 and 1978--it has only been in the last 20 years that this has turned bad--but to discourage bankruptcy, to reimpose personal responsibility on debt, and that we also do some things that even give some consumer protection in the process. I only stress the new consumer protections to make the point that we are going to have a very balanced piece of legislation pass this Senate, if we get a chance to vote on it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, I want to compliment the Senator from Missouri for his comments. He, along with me and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, was very much in the middle of the work of the IRS commission as representatives of the Senate on that commission, and also working with the legislation as members of the Finance Committee to bring about the consumer-friendly IRS that the legislation is supposed to do. 
Obviously, I am chagrined that there is still an attitude within the IRS that would be interpreting tax law the way that the Senator from Missouri has described it. I think he has accurately described it, because this morning when I was preparing to come to work I heard on WTOP the very news story to which the Senator from Missouri refers. I could only think in terms of, well, maybe it is a joke. Obviously, it is not a joke. 
But I also thought in terms of Mr. Rossotti, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, had to be hearing that same report as we did. And before he got to the office, I hope that he had made some phone calls to make sure that this erroneous interpretation of law would be corrected, because that is what I would expect from Mr. Rossotti. 
To the Senator from Missouri, I will be glad to sign the letter that he has. I would also hope that Mr. Rossotti has this situation taken care of before the letter is received from the Senator from Missouri. 
Also, I would expect that the Senator from Missouri expects Mr. Rossotti, who is not a tax attorney and who was hired specifically by the President of the United States because he came from the business world, from an organization and a business that he formulated that was only successful because he was able to satisfy his consumers--he built his organization from a few employees to several thousand employees. He was willing to give this up because he knew that the challenge of making the IRS a more consumer-friendly organization was a legitimate challenge that had to be met, and he was willing to do that. 
So I see in Mr. Rossotti a person who is going to get this taken care of very quickly so we do not have to worry that when that 62nd home run is hit by McGwire that there is going to be a tax consequence as a result of hitting the 62nd home run. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have just been delayed somewhat in the start of the bankruptcy bill. But I think it would still be appropriate to make some comments, even though in morning business, on the issue of why we need a bankruptcy bill. 
I suggest, first of all, as the Senator from Massachusetts has correctly stated, there were 1.4 million bankruptcies last year. That was a 30-percent increase over the previous year. And the previous year was a big percentage increase over that previous year. So in the last 3 years we have seen an explosion of bankruptcy filings in the United States. 
That is a tremendous economic problem. It is a problem for families that have to go through this. It is a problem for the consumers because bankruptcies raise costs for consumers. And there are lots of reasons for the rise in bankruptcies. In the 20 years since we have last had major bankruptcy legislation, we have seen a dramatic increase in bankruptcy filings, more than under any previous act. And we have had national bankruptcy legislation for 100 years this year. 
In the period of time since we have had the latest bankruptcy legislation that was passed in the year 1978, out at the grassroots of America there has been a feeling that it is too easy to get into bankruptcy. 
I don't want to say that a bankruptcy law, in and of itself, is the only reason we are having a high number of bankruptcy filings. But during this period of time in the last 20 years, I have had hundreds of people tell me that it is too easy to get into bankruptcy. I have had not one person say to me that it ought to be easier to get into bankruptcy. And I have even had some people who have gone through bankruptcy who said it was too easy. 
I mentioned the legislation of 1978 may be one reason for the increase in bankruptcies. I think also the Federal Government itself in that period of time has not set a very good example for personal finances by having 30 years of unbalanced Federal budgets. After all, if the national leadership of America can spend beyond its means for 30 years, doesn't it kind of set an ethic and a tone for the people of this country that maybe debt isn't so bad and it is possible to live beyond your means? 
Hopefully, this September 30, at the close of this fiscal year, for the first time in 30 years we are going to balance the budget and have a surplus. And we are going to pay down at least $68 billion, according to the latest estimates of what we will pay down in that national debt. Maybe we are going to turn that bad example around a little bit so that if people now do not see the Federal Government borrowing money for such long periods of time, maybe families and businesses of America will take a little bit different look at their debt as well. 
Then, of course, we have had the banks of America sending out so many credit cards, maybe not with the idea that they encouraged debt, but at least have left the impression upon the consumers of America that there was another way of doing business than just out of the billfold. I do not think that has set a very good example. I am not saying that there isn't a legitimacy about credit cards and that probably it is very convenient for some people and other advantages, but again, it is a new approach that parallels this high number of filings that we have had and may be another reason beyond the Federal Government's borrowing, beyond a 1978 statute that made it a little easier to go into bankruptcy, another reason why we had 1.4 million people filing for bankruptcy last year. 
Then lastly--and maybe I should not say lastly--but lastly as far as the reasons I would give, and there might be a lot of other reasons that somebody else could give, but there does not seem to be the shame connected with bankruptcy that there used to be. I do not know why. It may be all of the above that I have mentioned--more credit cards, making it easier to get into debt, and you just chip away at people's ethical thinking, the Federal Government setting a bad example, a liberal bankruptcy law passed in 1978. But somehow we have to think in terms of people looking at the moral dimension of their finances, and also then an extension of that moral dimension is a moral look at bankruptcy--right or wrong--and whether or not it is OK to break a contractual obligation to respect debt and meet the obligation. 
One other thing I should say is that I think that to some extent--and it is difficult to quantify all these factors that I give--but I think that within the legal profession there are some lawyers who are not counseling people about bankruptcy the way lawyers used to feel an obligation to counsel people coming to them for help. I guess we think that is a serious enough problem that we put some discouragement in our legislation to the bar just willy-nilly putting people into chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
But I think if we could get the bar itself to take another look at the practice of bankruptcy lawyers, and suggest a little more caution, a little more counseling, a little less use of paralegals in the process of the filing of petitions, and probably a person that is maybe not in a very good position to counsel, that all of these things would help. 
So we have a situation that needs to be dealt with. That is why we offer this legislation. 
Mr. President, I want to provide some overview of the need for bankruptcy reform and how the bankruptcy reform bill before the Senate makes meaningful bankruptcy reforms in a fair and balanced way. In fact, in the Judiciary Committee, the bill passed out of the committee on a strong, bipartisan vote of 16 to 2. So, we have a good bill and one that most Members of the Senate should be able to support. 
Mr. President, the polls are clear that the American people want bankruptcy reform. In Iowa, 78 percent of Iowans surveyed favor bankruptcy reform. And the picture is the same nationally. According the PBS program `Techno-Politics,' almost 70 percent of Americans support bankruptcy reform. Clearly, the time to act is now. 
Let me start out by saying there is some justification for bankruptcy. People hurt by natural disasters, catastrophic illness, divorce, etc., are entitled to a new start. Our society has provided for that. About 80 percent of the people who declare bankruptcy are in desperate financial straits. The problem is that some people use bankruptcy as a financial planning tool to get out of paying debts which they could pay. The convenient use of the existing bankruptcy laws is the driving force behind bankruptcy reform. We have a bankruptcy system that lets higher-income people write off their debts with no questions asked and no real way for creditors to prevent this from happening. The end-result is that everybody else who pays their bills ends up paying for these abuses through higher prices. 
Last year we had a record number of Americans file for bankruptcy. Of course, each bankruptcy case means that someone who extended credit in good faith won't get paid. While estimates differ as to the exact number, American businesses are losing around $40 billion a year as a result of bankruptcies. 
Now, big banks and big business are in a somewhat stronger position to deal with these losses than smaller businesses. Large banks and big business can offset bankruptcy losses by increasing the amount they charge to other customers. That's an important point, Mr. President. Under the best of circumstances, where a big business can stay afloat in the face of large losses due to bankruptcies, other consumers pay the price. Hence, the hidden bankruptcy tax. 
This hidden tax affects consumers who play by the rules. These consumers, the vast majority of consumers, must pay through 
higher prices and interest rates for consumers who write their debts off in bankruptcy. My legislation will reduce this tax by requiring those consumers who have the capacity to repay their debts, or some portion of their debts, to do so. 
But that's the situation with big businesses who can survive in the face of huge bankruptcy losses. What about the small business people who have to close their doors because they can't afford to absorb the loss of so much income. The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act that is before us will reduce bankruptcy losses by ensuring that those who can repay their debts be required to do so. That's just common sense. On the other hand, if you're truly down and can't afford to pay anything, this bill still guarantees complete bankruptcy relief. 
The editorial page of the Des Moines Register stated on march 13, 1997, that bankruptcy `was never intended as the one-stop, no-questions-asked solution to irresponsibility,' But that's just what we have today. And that is just the problem this bill addresses. 
So, as we move forward to more debate on bankruptcy reform, I hope we keep in mind the fact that bankruptcies of convenience impose a hidden tax on hardworking Americans who play by the rules and pay their bills on time. Let's cut that tax. Lenient bankruptcy standards seem to foster a lack of personal responsibility. After all, why tighten your belt and pay what you owe when you can just walk away from debts by declaring bankruptcy? I think my bill makes sense and that's why it passed out of the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 16 to 2. 
Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the history of bankruptcy. Congress' authority to create bankruptcy legislation derives from the body of the Constitution. Article I, section 8, clause 4 authorizes Congress to establish `uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States.' Until 1898, we did not have permanent bankruptcy laws in this country. The previous bankruptcy laws were temporary in nature and were largely enacted as a reaction to a financial crisis. With each successive bankruptcy act and each major reform or our Nation's bankruptcy laws, we've refined our conception of how bankruptcy should promote the important social goal of giving honest and unfortunate American a fresh start. 
The bill we're considering today makes fundamental changes to our bankruptcy laws. These changes are a logical outgrowth and extension of our various bankruptcy reform efforts. From 1898 until 1938, consumers had only one way to declare bankruptcy. It was called `straight bankruptcy' or `chapter 7' bankruptcy. Under chapter 7, which is still in existence, bankrupts surrender some of their assets to a bankruptcy court. The court sells these assets and uses the proceeds to pay creditors. Any deficiency is wiped out. 
But starting in 1938, Congress created chapter 13, which allows a debtor to repay a portion of his or her debts and keep all assets. Under current law, the choice between chapter 7 and chapter 13 is voluntary. In the mid-1980's, Senator Dole and Congressman Mike Synar tried to steer higher income bankrupts--who could repay some of their debts--into chapter 13. My legislation follows the attempts at reform Senator Dole made when he was on the Judiciary Committee. 
Finally, Mr. President, when and if we get to S. 1301, there will be a managers' amendment, which will permanently reauthorize Chapter 12. Chapter 12, which I authored in 1986 because of the farm crisis, is due to expire this October. I hope that, for the sake of the farmers of America, we will be able to get this bill brought before us. We now have a motion to proceed because there was an objection from a Senator, and I hope that all of these Senators will take into consideration that with low farm prices now--and I hope there is not an agricultural crisis long-term although there is a crisis this minute--and that farmers will have special protections under Chapter 12 bankruptcy, like other sectors of our economy have a special procedures for them, so that we will be able to have an orderly handling of that.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, I am joined by my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, in introducing the Motor Vehicle Franchise Contract Arbitration Fairness Act of 1998. 
As the Senate's leading advocate of ADR or alternative dispute resolution, I have attempted to facilitate the use of ADR in a number of ways. In the last Congress, we enacted my legislation to make permanent the use of ADR with and among our federal agencies. This year, we are attempting to enact legislation authorizing federal court-annexed ADR. 
A small percentage of ADR cases involves the use of binding arbitration. In dealing with arbitration, I have tried to emphasize the use of voluntary, rather than mandatory arbitration. Both parties must agree to voluntary arbitration, whereas mandatory arbitration can be forced upon a party, as in the case of some contractual arrangements. The authorization and use of mandatory arbitration has to be carefully considered since the right to trial may be limited or even forfeited. 
One such arrangement can be found in some contracts between automobile or truck dealers and manufacturers. In these contracts, dealers are given a `take it or leave it' clause that forces them to agree to binding arbitration. There is no real bargaining. If the dealer wants the contract, he or she has to agree to the mandatory arbitration clause. 
A number of states have enacted laws to prevent these types of unfair contracts. But, even though these clauses may violate a number of state laws, the Fourth Circuit overturned a lower court and ruled that these state laws conflict with the Federal Arbitration Act of 1925, and are therefore preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. So much for states' rights. 
Historically, Congress has questioned whether arbitration agreements should allow a stronger party to a contract to force a weaker party to forfeit rights to a court as a condition of entering a contract. But, it's been unclear as to what exactly the federal law allows. I believe it's now time to do more than just question these unfair `agreements'. 
The legislation Senator Feingold and I are introducing today would help remedy this current unfortunate situation by allowing only voluntary arbitration clauses between dealers and manufacturers. The bill would continue to recognize arbitration as a valuable alternative to litigation as long as both parties voluntarily agree to it. We want to preserve arbitration as an effective alternative to litigation, but we want to ensure that it's a fair alternative. 
I urge my colleagues to join Senator Feingold and myself in trying to address these unfair franchise contracts.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today several of us from rural States and the leadership of the Senate take a step to help America's farmers as representatives of States with major agricultural economies. All of us introducing this legislation agree that farmers are facing some difficult times. 
While we must do what we can to make sure that farmers survive for the short term, the key to the agricultural economic situation is long-term solutions. While we can't eliminate every risk and we can't control every factor that governs the success of the family farm, there are initiatives that we can pursue that will help smooth out some of the bumps that are in the road. 
That is why today several of us are introducing the FIRST Act, the Family Investment and Rural Savings Tax Act of 1998. As I said at the outset, there are some genuine problems in the ag community. Some parts of the country are experiencing problems that are worse than we are seeing in my own State of Iowa. We can offer reforms that address short-term and long-term needs. 
To address short-term needs and help give farmers that extra support that some will need to get through this year, I have joined with several of my colleagues in supporting legislation that will speed up transition payments, payments that would be made during 1999 and could, upon election by individual farmers, be taken in 1998. In my State of Iowa, that will bring 36 cents per bushel into the farmer's income in 1998 that would otherwise not be there. 
But the focus of this legislation which I am speaking about today, the FIRST Act, is to address long-term need, because what I just described to you, advancing the transition payments, is obviously a short-term solution. 
What we are saying is that we must ensure economic stability for everyone first through the transition proposition I described, and then we must help our farmers plan for the future. 
This measure takes a three-prong approach to assist farmers and families through tax reform. 
The first section of our bill reduces the capital gains tax rate for individuals from 20 percent to 15 percent. This will spur growth, entrepreneurship and help farmers make the most of their capital assets. It will also encourage movement of capital investment from one generation to the other to help young farmers get started. 
This language builds on the capital gains tax reform that we made in last year's Tax Relief Act. 
Secondly, the FIRST Act includes my legislation that creates savings accounts for farmers. This initiative would allow farmers to make contributions to tax-deferred accounts. These Grassley savings accounts, as I call them, will give farmers a tool to control their lives. This savings account legislation will encourage farmers to save during good years to help cushion the fall from the inevitable bad years. The accounts will give farmers even greater freedom in their business decisions rather than giving the Government more authority over farmers and their lives. 
As a working farmer myself, and an American, I know that we want to control our own destiny. We want to manage our own business. We want to make those decisions that are connected with being a good business operator. We do not want to have to wait for the bureaucrats at the USDA in Washington, DC, in that bureaucracy to tell us how many acres of corn and how many acres of soybeans that we can plant. This allows, through the balancing out of income, the leveling out of the peaks and valleys from one year to another, because in farming, it seems to be all boom or all bust. This farmers' savings account that I suggest will give farmers an opportunity to do that. 
Finally, our tax legislation allows for the permanent extension of income averaging. Income averaging helps farmers because when prices are low and when farmers' income goes down, their tax burden will also be lowered. This helps farmers prepare for the especially volatile nature of their income. 
This is a tough time for a lot of farmers. I know there is a great deal of anxiety among farmers about what the future might bring. This proposal will help them to know that we in Congress recognize the particular difficulties they face in trying to plan for the future. I, along with other Members who have worked on this bill, believe that our initiatives will provide farmers with additional financial insurance they need to help face the future. 
The initiatives of this legislation have been endorsed by virtually every major agricultural organization. These organizations know that these measures are what farmers need to have more confidence and security in the future. 
I am very pleased to see the majority leader, Trent Lott, the Senator from Mississippi, taking a strong stand in favor of this. I thank my colleagues who have worked with me on this legislation. We all agree that passing this measure as soon as possible is one of the best things that we can do for our farmers in our States and across the country. 
This legislation is a long-term solution. It helps our farmers and our families survive and to keep control of their own decisions, so that we can let Washington make decisions for Washington but let farmers make decisions for themselves. 
The bottom line, Mr. President, is right now we are facing a variety of troubling circumstances: an economic crisis in southeast Asia, a drought combined with the hot weather in Texas today, fires in Florida, too much wheat coming across the Canadian border, unfairly, to drive down the price of wheat in North Dakota, and the prospect of having bumper crops this year and big carryovers from last year. These are things that are beyond the control of the family farmer. 
Because we in family farming assume the responsibility--each one of us--of feeding, on average, 126 other people, we must keep the family farms strong as a matter of national policy, as a matter of good economics. We do that not because of nostalgia for family farmers but because when there is a good supply of food, the urban populations of this country are going to feel more secure and more certain about the future. 
We want to continually remind people, though, through actions of this Congress that we in the Congress know that food grows on farms, it does not grow in supermarkets. If there were not farmers producing, if there were not the labor and processing people, if there were not truckers and trains taking the food from the farm to the city, we would not have the high quality of food we have, we would not have the quantity of food we have, we would not have the stability that we have in our cities, we would not have the quality of life that we have beyond food for the American people. Let's not forget that food as a percentage of disposable income at about 11 percent is cheaper for the American consumer than any consumer anywhere else in the world. 
This legislation that we are all introducing is in support of maintaining that sort of environment for the people of America, and also as we export food for people around the world. We are committed to it, but also as a Congress we are committed to maintaining the family farm as well. So I introduce this bill for Senator Lott, myself, Senator Hagel, Senator Roberts, Senator Burns, Senator Craig, Senator Shelby, and Senator Sessions. I thank my colleagues for their hard work and support. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998. My Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts has jurisdiction over this matter, and I am very pleased that the ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator Durbin, has joined me in sponsoring this bill. It will require every Federal district court in the country to institute an alternative dispute resolution, or ADR, program. The bill will provide parties and district court judges with options other than the traditional, costly and adversarial process of litigation. 
ADR programs have been gaining in popularity and respect for years now. For example, many contracts drafted today--between private parties, corporations, and even nations--include arbitration clauses. Most State and Federal bar associations, including the ABA, have established committees to focus on ADR. Also, comprehensive ADR programs are flourishing in many of the States. 
ADR is also being used at the Federal level. In 1990, for example, President Bush signed into law a bill that I introduced called the Administrative Dispute Resolutions Act. The law promoted the increased use of ADR in Federal agency proceedings. In 1996, because ADR was working so well, we permanently re-authorized the law. And earlier this year, the executive branch recommitted themselves to using ADR as much as possible. 
Since the late 1970s, our Federal district courts have also been successfully introducing ADR. In 1998, we authorized 20 district courts to begin implementing ADR programs. The results were very encouraging, so last year we made these programs permanent. It's time to take another step and make ADR available in all district courts. 
Mr. President, ADR allows innovations and flexibility in the administration of justice. The complex legal problems that people have demand creative and flexible solutions on the part of the courts. There are numerous benefits to providing people with alternatives to traditional litigation. For example, a recent Northwestern University study of ADR programs in State courts indicated that mediation significantly reduced the duration of lawsuits and produced significant cost savings for litigants. That means fewer cases on the docket and decreased costs. The Federal courts should 
be taking every opportunity to reap the benefits that the state courts have been enjoying. 
Mr. President, the fact of the matter is that ADR works. The future of justice in this country includes ADR. Perhaps one of the signs of this is that many of the best law, business, and graduate schools in the country are beginning to emphasize training in negotiation, mediation, and other kinds of dispute resolution. 
Quite simply, this bill will increase the availability of ADR in our Federal courts. It mandates that every district court establish some form of professional ADR program. It provides the district, however, with the flexibility to decide what kind of ADR works best locally. The bill also allows a district with a current ADR program that's working well to continue the program. 
This bill is the Senate companion to H.R. 3528, which was reported out of the Judiciary Committee today without any opposition. Our bill tracks the original House bill, except for some findings and a few technical changes to improve the legislation. These changes were included in the bill reported out of committee. The House bill received overwhelming, bipartisan support, passing 405-2. 
The Department of Justice, along with the administration, the Administrative Office of the Courts, and the American Bar Association, including its business section, all support the legislation with these improvements. The consensus is clear: ADR has an important role to play in our Federal court system. 
Mr. President, this bill is a step in the right direction for the administration of justice in our country. Increased availability of ADR will benefit all of us. It should be an option to people in every judicial district of the country. This bill assures that it will be.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado for offering my amendment. This is legislation that I originally offered last year as a free standing bill. I would like to say a few words on the amendment and ask my colleagues to support. It is co-sponsored by Senators D'Amato, Sessions, Stevens, and Grams. 
First, let me remind my colleagues of what the amendment does. I have outlined these in letters to my colleagues and in my original statement on the floor. In addition, many of you have heard from various federal law enforcement associations that support this amendment. Its main intent is to address a problem, a gray area, in current law. As it now stands, the situation reminds me of the old saying that no good deed goes unpunished. 
This involves what I call the 7-11 situation. Suppose for a moment that an off-duty Capitol Police officer or a Customs Agent or some other federal officer goes into the 7-11 to buy coffee. While he is there, a robber tries to hold up the store and is threatening the public with violence. Under the present circumstance a not so funny thing can happen. If the off-duty officer intervenes to protect the public and is hurt in the process. Or if someone is hurt in the incident, the officer could lose his workman's compensation or be sued by the felon for injuries because the Federal officer was acting outside the scope of his work. If he was not on duty or if the felony did not occur as part of the duties involved in his job description, he has no protections. 
This is a real concern to serving officers. It puts them in a difficult situation. That is what this amendment fixes. It would give protection to Federal officers in these situations. 
Now, let me make it clear. This does not mean an expansion of the authorities to Federal officers to make arrests in matters reserved to the states. I have checked this with the States' Attorneys General. This amendment also does not authorize Federal law enforcement officers to act like cowboys. Nothing in current law, even when acting on official duty, would permit an officer to act irresponsibly. They are subject to penalties if they should do so under their scope of work and they are subject to the same sanctions here. 
What we have now, however, is a situation where a law enforcement officer has to make a sudden decision. Does he intervene to protect the public, which is what we would all expect? Or does he sit it out to avoid the risk of being sued or losing his workman's compensation if he is injured? I think I know what most of us would expect. I know what most of us believe is the responsible thing to do. We would expect the officer to intervene with a clear conscience and the knowledge that his act of decency and responsibility will not be punished. I would add that this situation, fortunately, is not a common one. It is, however, one that needs to be addressed. 
I hope that we will adopt this amendment today. It has been a long time in coming and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for it. Again, let me remind my colleagues that this language has been a free-standing bill for almost a year and has been available for comment. We have worked with DEA, Customs, and many others on the language. It has been provided to both majority and minority members. Most of these members have been visited by all the major Federal law enforcement associations and unions, which, I might mention, support this legislation wholeheartedly. I offer for the Record a few of the letters that have been written to me and other Members in support. I believe all the Federal law enforcement officers who risk their lives on our behalf deserve this much. We know only too well the risk they take on our behalf.

Mr. GRASSLEY. I rise today to express my concern about some language included in Senate report that accompanies this bill. This language is not in the House report. This Senate language directs the Internal Revenue Service to review the legal standards and decisions the IRS utilizes in determining when fitness services and activities of tax-exempt organizations should be subject to unrelated business income tax. The stated intent of this review is to insure that tax-exempt health clubs are not unfairly competing with for-profit health clubs. I am afraid that the effect of this language will be to harm non-profit community organizations. Is this the intent of the language?

Mr. GRASSLEY. These non-profit community organizations provide a unique variety of programs based on community needs. Some of the programs offered are child care, Head Start, GED classes, job training, substance abuse prevention, delinquency prevention, teen centers, counseling, and health and fitness for all children, youth, families, and adults. They have partnerships with public housing projects, juvenile courts and schools. It is of utmost importance to me that the Congress not urge the IRS to change current IRS policies in a way that will hurt our communities and our families. The IRS has determined that adult fitness is a charitable activity as long as the organization serves a broad segment of the community. does the committee intend that this determination be changed?

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments on the muzzle loader amendment which we are considering. 
The purpose of the amendment is to exempt certain muzzle loading weapons from regulation under the Gun Control Act (GCA), 18 U.S.C. Chapter 44. Under current law, `antique firearms' are exempted from the definition of `firearm' in section 921(a)(3) of the GCA and are, therefore, not subject to the interstate controls, licensing provisions, record keeping requirements, or restrictions on possession that apply to firearms. Thus, antique firearms can be sold interstate via mail-order, no records of their sale are kept, and they may be lawfully possessed by any U.S. citizen. The existing definition of `antique firearm' exempts firearms manufactured in or before 1898, replicas of such firearms that utilize matchlock, flintlock, percussion cap, or other primitive types of ignition systems including primers and battery cup primers and other replica firearms that utilize ammunition that is no longer available in commercial channels. 
In recent years, there has been a strong increase in popularity in hunting and target shooting involving muzzle loading firearms which could not have been foreseen when the current law was written. As in any other sporting equipment, the technology was refined to provide safer and more reliable equipment, much like the compound bow evolved from the original long bow. Most states now offer a muzzle loading hunting season to improve deer herd management. There have been numerous technological improvements in muzzle loading weapons, including safer propellant, safety mechanism, projectiles, and ignition systems. 
As is the case with the compound bow, many of the muzzle loading weapons now produced bear little physical resemblance to traditional antique firearms produced prior to 1898. Significantly, they all require the placing of a propellant down the barrel, pushing a bullet down the barrel on top of the powder, then placing an ignition system behind the powder just as all muzzle loaders have for more than 100 years. Since the BATF has determined that certain of these weapons are not `replicas' under the definition of `antique firearms', they are regulated as `firearms' under the GCA. The BATF has restricted only one inline muzzle loader, the Knight DISC rifle, which is produced in my home state of Iowa, even though Remington states that their muzzle loader is built from their 700 Centerfire. 
The amendment would expand the definition of the term `antique firearm' to encompass these modern muzzle loading sporting firearms used by hunters, target shooters, and other sportsmen. The amendment would include within the definition of `antique firearm' a weapon that: (1) is a muzzle loading rifle, muzzle loading shotgun, or muzzle loading pistol; (2) is designed to use black powder or a black powder substitute; (3) uses any ignition system; (4) cannot use fixed ammunition; (5) does not use the serial numbered frame or receiver of a firearm; (6) has not been converted from a firearm; and (7) cannot be readily converted to fire fixed ammunition by replacing the barrel, bolt, or breechlock. 
The language requiring that the antique firearm not use the frame or receiver of a serial numbered firearm, not be converted from a firearm, and cannot be readily converted to fire fixed ammunition is to prevent the conversion of modern firearms into percussion cap `antique firearms'. BATF is concerned that, without this language, various single shot, bolt action, slide action and semi-automatic weapons, and even certain machine guns, could be converted into muzzle loading weapons and then converted back to fire conventional fixed ammunition merely by replacing the barrel or other components. The weapon could then be sold as an `antique firearm' without any GCA controls. Many components which alter the form and function of firearms are available to be easily converted from one form of firearm to another. However, there are no products currently in commercial trade which would convert a muzzle loader to a firearm or a firearm to a muzzle loader. 
Since the amendment is limited to muzzle loading rifles, muzzle loading shotguns, and muzzle loading pistols, it would not allow grenade launchers, bazookas, machine guns, or anti-tank guns to be excluded from the regulation. Also, since this amendment will be adopted on the floor, there isn't any report language to assist courts and industry in interpreting the status of muzzle loaders. I hope my comments will serve this purpose.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the Community Reinvestment Act or `CRA' as it is commonly known. The CRA requires banks to extend loans and credit to low- and moderate-income Americans who reside in low-income areas. 
Obviously, as we can tell by the tone of the debate in the Senate today, there are strong feelings about whether it's a good idea for the Federal Government to require that credit be extended to people of modest means since these people may not be good credit risks. I would like to focus on some of the comments of those who support the CRA. They claim that credit should be as widely available as possible. The supporters of the CRA argue that requiring banks to open up credit is good for low- and moderate-income people. It gives these people the opportunity to purchase a home, pay for college or better their lives in important ways. 
On last Friday--July 24th--several Senators took to the floor to talk about the value of making credit as widely available as possible. For instance, Senator Kennedy said `In this period of sustained economic growth, it is vital that all families have the opportunity to obtain credit in order to buy a home, start a small business or send a child to college.' Senator Kennedy went on to observe that `There is no capitalism without capital.' These are strong words in favor of making credit widely available. 
It will be interesting, Mr. President, to see if the supporters of the CRA take the same position when my bankruptcy reform bill comes to the Senate floor in September. There is a fringe element which opposes all bankruptcy reform who wish to derail this legislation, which passed the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 16 to 2. One part of the effort to stop bankruptcy reform involves criticizing banks which send out a lot of credit card solicitations. The argument is apparently that the banks have made too many risky loans and that Congress should restrict these lending practices. I've heard that bankruptcy reform which doesn't include such restrictions wouldn't be fair or balanced. 
Mr. President, I find it interesting that many of those who support the CRA, which requires banks to make risky loans to low-income Americans, are also arguing that we should punish banks for issuing credit cards to low- and moderate-income Americans. It seems to me that the opponents of bankruptcy reform can't have it both ways. It's totally inconsistent to push banks to make risky loans to poorer Americans, as the CRA would have it, but then to oppose bankruptcy reform because banks have issued too many loans to poorer Americans. 
I wanted to point out this striking contradiction today, Mr. President, while we're considering lending practices and the CRA and while the memory of the debate is fresh in our minds. I will return to this topic later, when the bankruptcy bill is on the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senator Graham, Senator Hatch, Senator Breaux, Senator Baucus, and Senator Jeffords to introduce bipartisan pension reform legislation. This legislation, the Pension Coverage and Portability Act of 1998, will go a long way toward improving the pension system in this country. 
Promoting retirement income security seems to be on everyone's mind these days if the number of pension bills now pending in Congress is any indication. But I think that our leaders need to understand that pension legislation should be a priority for prompt action by Congress and the President. 
Let me try to explain: For better or worse, the most important component of retirement income is the Social Security program. But our nation is about to experience a demographic shift of very large proportions that will have a very negative impact on Social Security. My state is already feeling the impact of this shift. 
The state of Iowa has the most people over the age of 85 as a percent of the population. Iowa has the third highest percentage of people over the age of 65. There is a popular statistic relating to the incomes of elderly households we hear a lot--that Social Security is the most important source of income for more than 80 percent of elderly Americans. Knowing the demographics of my state, you can imagine how often I hear about Social Security and the feeling that Social Security isn't enough. 
It's hard to tell an 82 year old widow that Social Security was never supposed to be enough. Future retirees seem to understand this, as we have seen a number of surveys indicating that Gen Xers do not believe Social Security will be the most important source of income once they retire. 
But their income will have to come from somewhere. Many workers will be able to rely on increased income from pensions. Unfortunately, right now, one half of our workforce is not participating in a pension plan. 
Mr. President, you know the statistics just as well as I do. Coverage levels have been consistent over the last decade but among small employers, coverage is low. 
In June, the Employee Benefit Research Institute released the Small Employer Retirement Survey. This survey is very instructive for legislators. 
Small employers identified three main reasons for not offering a plan. The first reason is that small employers believe their employees prefer increased wages or other types of benefits. The second reason employers don't offer plans is the administrative costs. And the third most important reason for not offering a plan: uncertain revenue, which makes it difficult to commit to a plan. 
Combine these barriers with the responsibilities of a small employer, and we can understand why coverage among small employers has not increased. Small employers who may just be starting out in business are already squeezing every penny. These employers are also people who open up the business in the morning, talk to customers, do the marketing, pay the bills, and just do not know how they can take on the additional duties, responsibilities, and liabilities of sponsoring a pension plan. 
I firmly believe that an increase in the number of people covered by pension plans will occur only when small employers have more substantial incentives to establish pension plans. 
The Pension Coverage and Portability Act contains provisions which will provide more flexibility for small employers, relief from burdensome rules and regulations, and a tax incentive to start new plans for their employees. One of the new top heavy provisions we have endorsed is an exemption from top heavy rules for employers who adopt the 401(k) safe harbor. This safe harbor will take effect in 1999. When the Treasury Department wrote the regulations and considered whether safe harbor plans should also have to satisfy the top heavy rules, they answered in the affirmative. As a result, a small employer would have to make a contribution of 7 percent of pay for each employee, a very costly proposition. 
My colleagues and I also have included a provision which repeals user fees for new plan sponsors seeking determination letters from the IRS. These fees can run from $100 to more than $1,000, depending on the type of plan. Given the need to promote retirement plan formation, we believe this `rob Peter to pay Paul' approach needs to be eliminated. 
We have also looked at the lack of success of SIMPLE 401(k) plans. A survey by the Investment Company Institute found that SIMPLE IRAs have proven successful, with almost 100,000 participants. However, SIMPLE 401(k)s just haven't taken off. A couple of the reasons may be that the limits on SIMPLE 401(k)s are tighter than for the IRAs. 
Our bill equalizes the compensation limits for these plans; in addition, we have also increased the annual limit on both SIMPLEs to $8,000. 
One of the more revolutionary proposals is the creation of a Salary Reduction SIMPLE with a limit of $4,000. Unlike other SIMPLEs, the employer makes no match or automatic contributions. The employer match is usually a strong incentive for a low-income employee to participate in a savings plan. We hope that small employers will look at this SIMPLE as a transition plan, in place for just a couple of years during the initial stages of business operation--then adopt a more expansive plan when the business is profitable. 
The other targeted areas in the legislation include: Enhancing pension coverage for women. 
Women are more at risk of living in poverty as they age. They need more ways to save because of periodic departures from the workforce. To increase their saving capacity, we have also included a proposal similar to legislation I sponsored earlier this year, S. 1856, the Enhanced Savings Opportunities Act. Like S. 1856, the proposal repeals the 25% of salary contribution limit on defined contribution plans. This limit has seriously impeded savings by women, as well as low- and mid-salary employees. 
I prefer this approach to a catch-up provision. Catch-ups would most likely be voluntary on the part of the employer, do not encourage savings over working life, and do not necessarily help low and mid-salary people. Repealing 415(c) is a simplifier, and will allow anyone covered by a defined contribution plan to benefit. 
The bill also contains proposals which promote new opportunities to rollover accounts from an old employer to a new employer. The lack of portability among plans is one of the weak links in our current pension system. This new bill contains technical improvements which will help ease the implementation of portability among the different types of defined contribution plans. 
Finally, I would like to point out a couple of other provisions in the bill. The first is the new requirement that plan sponsors automatically provide benefit statements to their participants on a periodic basis. For defined contribution plans, the statement would be required annually. For defined benefit plans, a statement would be required every three years. There is a very strong lack of understanding among participants about how their pensions work. There is also a high percentage of people who have done nothing to plan for their retirement. 
Providing clear and understandable benefit statements to pension plan participants would encourage people to think about how much money they can expect to receive in retirement. Further, a benefit statement will help people ensure that the information their employer maintains about them is accurate. Almost 80 percent of employers who sponsor defined benefit plans are providing some type of benefit statement automatically. All participants need these statements. 
This provision joins other proposals in a new section targeted at encouraging retirement education. Education can make a difference to workers. In fact, in companies which provide investment education, we know workers benefitted because many of them changed their investment allocations to more accurately reflect their investment horizons. 
A new provision that I encourage my colleagues to carefully consider targets the problem of participation by proposing an incentive for negative enrollment or `opt-out' plans. My staff and I were familiar with the example set by McDonald's Corp. which utilizes opt-out plans for their employees. But McDonald's was concerned that they might get in trouble with government regulators for operating their plan as an opt-out. President Clinton announced that McDonald's plan was legal--and encouraged other employers to try opt-out plans. This bill includes an incentive for employers to create opt-out plans that we hope will increase participation among low-salary workers. 
This legislation joins a number of other strong proposals now pending in the House and here in the Senate. This legislation includes provisions which reflect some of those same proposals. I want to commend the sponsors of those bills. Our legislation has a lot in common with these other pension bills and we need to push for fast and favorable consideration of, at a minimum, the similar provisions in our legislation. 
We have a window of opportunity to act. The Baby Boomers are coming. The letters from AARP are starting to arrive in their mailboxes. The Social Security Administration is starting to stagger the delivery of benefit checks in preparation for their retirement. Many elderly households rely too heavily on Social Security. Future retirees will not be able to rely on all of the benefits now provided by Social Security. We can look to the pension system to pick up where Social Security leaves off, but we need to act. 
I thank the other co-sponsors of this legislation for all of their work, and I encourage our colleagues to give strong consideration to co-sponsoring this bill. With concerted, bipartisan action, we can improve the pension system. Pensions for today's workers will substantially improve the retirement outlook for millions of Americans. But we have some work to do if pensions are going to fulfill their promise.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Home Health Access Preservation Act of 1998, which I am introducing today. I have been deeply involved in home care issues throughout my career, and that involvement has deepened in the past year. It was 1 year ago that the Special Committee on Aging, which I chair held a hearing on fraud and abuse of the Medicare home health benefit. That led to a roundtable, where we brainstormed on solutions to that problem. That discussion led to turn to a bill, the Home Health Integrity Preservation Act of 1998, which I was proud to cosponsor with Senator Breaux. 
In March of this year, the Aging Committee held another hearing on home health. This hearing focused on the Balanced Budget Act provisions affecting seniors' access to home care. At this hearing, we learned of the serious problems being caused by the Health Care Financing Administration's surety bond regulations, as well as by the Interim Payment System for home health. Like the earlier hearing, this hearing led to two pieces of legislation. The first was Senate Joint Resolution 50, which would have vetoed the surety bond regulation. I was pleased that this effort brought the administration to the bargaining table, and I believe that the surety bond problem will be solved as we work together. 
The second piece of legislation to come out of that hearing is the bill I am introducing today. It addresses a major piece of unfinished business in the home health area, and that is the Interim Payment System. What's wrong with that system? In short, it bases payment on an individual home health agency's historical costs from Fiscal Year 1994. That means that if the agency had high cost per patient in that year, it can receive relatively high payment this year. However, if the agency had low costs in that year, its payments this year is severely limited. 
This approach would be fine if the Health Care Financing Administration knew that the higher-cost agency had sicker patients this year, but the sad truth is that HCFA has no idea. So the interim system has been a windfall for some agencies, but crushing for agencies with low historical costs. In Iowa, we are blessed with many efficient providers, but this system seems to prove the old adage that `No good deed goes unpunished.' In many cases, the providers who are suffering--and more importantly, whose patients are suffering--are those who most want to keep in the Medicare program. 
Another feature of the system is that it treats older and newer home health providers in completely different ways. In some areas of the country, new agencies simply cannot compete with older agencies, while in other areas (such as Iowa), it is the older agencies that are at the disadvantage. This kind of arbitrary distinction just doesn't make sense. 
For months, I have worked with a bipartisan group of Finance Committee members on fixing the Interim Payment System. This bill is the product of those efforts. Believe me, if this 
were an easy issue to tackle, I would have introduced this bill months ago. Instead, we have gone to great lengths to get input from home health providers, as well as from a broad range of Senate colleagues. Those efforts have paid off, and I am gratified to be introducing the bill with seventeen original cosponsors, and maybe more by the end of the day. 
The bill has a number of features, but its basic approach is to abandon our reliance on individual agencies' historical costs. Instead, it would pay all agencies--old or new--based on a 50/50 blend of national and regional average rates from the 1994 base year. This 50/50 blend is the only approach that can win support from all parts of the country. In addition, the bill seeks to provide supplemental payments for patients with long stays as home care recipients. We think it is essential that agencies be compensated for taking these neediest patients. 
The bill is budget-neutral, which in my opinion it has to be in order to have a chance of passage. There is a great deal of concern, which I share, about the automatic 15 percent cut in all home health payment that will occur in October 1999. We did consider an attempt to address that cut in this bill, but the cosponsors have learned from the Congressional Budget Office that, under its methodology, such language would send the bill's costs skyrocketing. We think that this would doom the bill's chances of enactment this year. We do believe that there is a crisis that needs to be addressed this year, and thus we have not included the 15 percent provision in the bill. I will urge the Senate to revisit that issue next year, when we'll have more information on home health cost growth or decline, but for now it cannot be addressed. 
If there was any doubt about the need for action to rectify the Interim Payment System, I believe that it has vanished with the administration's recent indications that prospective payment will not be ready in October 1999, as mandated by Congress. Just this morning, at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, the administrator of HCFA confirmed that the Year 2000 computer problem has made meeting the deadline totally impossible. In fact, at HCFA's suggestion, we have written the per-beneficiary limit numbers into the bill itself, so that HCFA will not need to issue a regulation in order to implement the bill. HCFA just doesn't think it could issue a regulation doing so, in light of its Year 2000 problems. The fact is that we do not know when prospective payment will be ready. We had better do what we can now, to make sure our agencies can hang on until that day. 
Let me make a comment about political realities. Our focus was on creating something that could actually pass this year, and so the bill is a product of compromise. In talking with home health providers, I find that many of them understand the need to be realists. I wish that the big national associations were equally reasonable. It is already the middle of July. This bill's moderate approach is the only one that has any chance of moving this year. If there really is an emergency in home health, which I believe, then everyone needs to get serious right now. Let me be more explicit: I call on the home health industry to recognize that this approach is as good as it's gong to get, and to support it. I call on HCFA to make fixing this system a top, near-term priority. And I call on my colleagues here in Congress to unite around a moderate, feasible formula. Our Nation's seniors and disabled are waiting for us.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding the problems that our farmers are experiencing and what we can do to ease the burden of uncertainty and risk that every farmer faces. 
As those of us from States with major ag economies know, and as my friends on the other side of the aisle have discussed, farmers across the Nation have legitimate concerns about the prices they receive for their products. I know, as do my colleagues who represent ag States, that commodity prices are not good. 
Making that problem worse, in Iowa, for example we are looking at the possibility of a bumper crop and we still have nearly 40 percent of last year's grain in storage, which obviously, will work to keep prices low. 
I am not here to say everything is just fine with the ag economy right now. But I am here to say that in addressing these problems we must take our marching orders from farmers and the folks who represent farm interests such as Farm Bureau, the corn growers and the soybean producers, among others. Opening up the 1996 farm bill, as some advocate, is not the way to legitimately address these very real concerns. And it is not what these very respected farm organizations advocate, and I must say, it is not what farmers in my State have been telling me to do. Nonetheless, we need to do something to alleviate the worries our farmers face. Earlier this year, representatives of all the major agriculture organizations came to Capitol Hill to discuss the problems the ag industry is facing. Frankly, opening up Freedom to Farm did not make their list of priorities. In fact, this list consisted almost entirely of initiatives to support and enhance trade opportunities. Farmers tell me the most important thing Congress can do to ensure the long-term prosperity of the family farm is to open and expand foreign markets for their products. That's why we must give our farmers the opportunity to compete for every sale, in every market in the world. 
In fact, the message that we were sending to the rest of the world when we passed Freedom to Farm is that we intend to compete for every market anywhere in the world and we are going to be a sure supplier in that market. 
We in the Senate ought not be telling farmers what they should want and need. We should be listening to farmers and doing what they tell us is important. That is what my resolution is all about. My resolution is nothing less than a commitment to the American farmer that we have heard you and we share the principles that you support and we will work with you to make those principles a permanent part of farm policy. 
It is a reiteration of the principles of Freedom to Farm. But it is 3 years later a reiteration of what we ought to be doing and an admission that in some places we have come up short as far as the marketing opportunities we promised that they should produce and that there will be markets for that product. 
And as we know, at least in my part of the country, we export about 40 percent of our production, so farmers have to have open markets. They must be overseas. Anybody who wants to price the United States out of the world market is saying that we ought to shut down 40 percent of our productive capability. That is not only intolerable for farmers, but it is economically disadvantageous to small business people of America who depend upon the business that farmers bring to them, both in processing of our agriculture products as well as inputs in agriculture. 
So I do not pretend that there is anything new here. But I do intend to carry out the principles of Freedom to Farm, which is dependent upon market-opening opportunities overseas. There is a crisis in trade policy right now and we need to focus more on it. And some of that crisis is politically oriented. There is not enough activity in this town on market promotion and on setting a political tone that the United States will continue to be a leader in market-opening negotiations around the world, which we have been for the last 50 years, and it is an expression of all of these things coming together, that we have to have more of an emphasis on trade opportunities. 
So this Sense-of-the-Senate resolution states that we in Congress should act on a variety of measures that have been endorsed by agriculture groups as providing the best hope for farmers across the country for sustained economic growth and opportunity. These measures include fast-track negotiating authority for the President, legislation that I introduced establishing farm and ranch savings accounts, sanctions reform legislation, normal trading status with China, stronger oversight on international trade agreements affecting agriculture, additional estate and capital gains tax reform, full deductibility of health care insurance for self-employed individuals, reducing the regulation on farmers, and finally using the CCC and the EEP funds for food aid. 
Mr. President, these are reforms that the leaders of the farm groups we met with have asked for. Many of these items were also promised to farmers when we passed the 1996 farm bill. It is time for Congress to live up to these promises. 
We have heard today and in the days past in the debate on this bill about the serious problems facing American farmers in the northern plains States, particularly the Dakotas. So I met with North Dakota Governor Ed Schafer yesterday morning, and he told me about the serious circumstances in which his farmers find themselves. But he also told me emphatically that reopening Freedom to Farm would be a tremendous disservice to his constituents; that doing so would not give his people the help they need. It is time that we show our solidarity with the American farmer and pledge to give these hard-working men and women fundamental, long-term assistance that they count on from year to year rather than so-called emergency measures. 
I have lived and worked on a family farm all of my life. My son operates our family farm. I know that farmers are independent, and I know they want as little Government interference in their business as possible. The initiatives listed in my resolution will help ensure that independence. It will help make sure that the promises of Freedom to Farm, that the farmer was going to be able to operate according to the marketplace and not according to the dictates of bureaucrats in Washington, DC, are adhered to. 
The 1996 farm bill took positive and necessary steps to bring this about for the American farmer. Some in this body would reverse that progress. Let's show that we really listen to farmers' concerns and put the Senate on record as supporting our farmers in the initiatives they have asked. I strongly urge a `yes' vote on this legislation. It is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. It does not change any policy, but it reaffirms what we did 3 years ago. It acknowledges the problems that come from the Southeast Asian economic situation--less exports going to that part of the world and a deteriorating income situation because of that. 
Now, some people might say, well, what is different than 2 days ago or just yesterday when there were some negative votes for some help for the American farmer offered by people on the other side of the aisle? Well, the difference is this. Those programs would have changed Freedom to Farm. Those programs would have been short term rather than long term. Those programs would not have been budget neutral. Keeping the budget balanced to keep interest rates low for American farmers is very, very important. 
But what has also happened is very bad signals coming from the White House. Now, let me emphasize--very bad signals coming from the White House and coming within the last 24 hours, and so this was not a part of the political environment when we were talking about farm legislation yesterday and the day before. The White House is sending very clear signals through the business community of America that they do not want fast-track trading authority for the President brought up this year. They do not want to vote on it. 
So we are hearing from the White House, for the first time, that the United States should withdraw from leadership in world trade as a matter of fact because of the absence of policy we have had, because we have not had fast-track negotiating authority for the last 4 years. But now there is a signal sent that nothing should be done about fast track. 
To this point, the administration kept telling us we should be pushing for fast-track trading authority because this President wants it, and also because it has been the tradition of this country since World War II to lead in this area. The administration sent signals, both through the legislation and the activity of the White House, that the president wants to continue to get this authority, to continue to lead. 
But now I hear there are meetings going on at the White House with the business community where the administration is sending a signal that, no, now is not the time for fast track. Well, this is the first time in 50 years that now is not the time for the President of the United States, Republican or Democrat, to be a leader in breaking down barriers to free trade so that our farmers can export and be prosperous because of it. 
Now, when we are in this environment, where the administration is sending this signal that they do not want fast-track trading authority, then it is time for us to reiterate Congress' stand, which has been the stand of this Congress since World War II, that we should be a leader in marketing opportunities for our farmers, for our businesses, and for our services in America. 
It is a sad day to hear, particularly for those involved with us in the Senate who are leaders in international trade, that we are not getting the support from the White House that we need to pass fast track. It does not send a very good signal to the people we have been working with around the world for the last 50 years, looking to the United States for leadership, that the United States doesn't want to lead. We are saying to the rest of the world: You lead. We are saying to the rest of the world: We don't see that it is necessary for us to be at the table. We don't think it is necessary for the President of the United States to be at the table to protect our farmers, to be at the table to protect our business interests, to be at the table to protect our producers that want to export. 
This is an intolerable situation. If we do not reverse this policy, the legacy of this administration is going to be that the United States has withdrawn from world leadership in trade barrier reduction. I don't think that is the legacy this President wants. I don't think that is a very good legacy for this country as we go into the 21st century. 
What is so important? It is not just the economic opportunities we lose, but commerce breaks down barriers between people. Commerce promotes peace. Commerce is going to expand the world economic pie for a growing population so we have more for more people rather than less for more people, not only from the standpoint of the quality of their life but from the standpoint of their ability to just survive--just survive. When we have a growing economic pie, we are going to have more political stability in the world and we are going to promote the process of world peace. 
That is what is at jeopardy when a President of the United States is sending a signal--or even his staff is sending a signal--to the business community of America: Forget fast track. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to discuss an important issue that should be addressed by House and Senate conferees meeting to resolve differences regarding the Higher Education Reauthorization Act. 
Various institutions of higher education have tried for a number of years to have the Age Discrimination in Employment Act amended to allow certain types of early retirement plans for tenured faculty. Various Members of this Body have traditionally viewed such an amendment with concern. 
At the same time, some Members of this Body are concerned that potentially meritorious ADEA claims have faced statute of limitations problems based on the application of the Supreme Court decision in Lorance versus AT&T Technologies. 
I understand there have been efforts to address these concerns, and I would like to pose a question to my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy, is it your understanding that the House of Representatives has addressed one or both of these issues in its version of this bill?

Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, it is unfortunate. Lorance established an unworkable system for filing claims under the employment discrimination laws. It held that when a seniority system was allegedly adopted with a discriminatory purpose, the time limit for challenging that system begins to run on the date the system is first adopted--not the date it begins to apply to the individual employee. This could be a `catch-22': by the time an employee is harmed and has standing to bring a claim, the statutory time period for challenging the policy will often have expired. Indeed, in some cases, no current employee would ever be able to challenge a long-standing, but discriminatory employment policy or system. 
This is clearly contrary to the purposes of the age discrimination laws. There is no justification for unfairly closing the doors of justice to victims of age discrimination.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the property rights legislation we are currently considering. The question we have to answer today is simple. Do we want to give to homeowners and farmers the same rights to go to Federal court when their constitutional rights are infringed that we already give to flag burners and neo-Nazis who preach hate. For my Part, I think that hardworking farmers and homeowners ought to have at least as many constitutional rights as Nazis and flag burners. 
For the benefit of my colleagues, I'd like to point out how this bill would change current law to correct the outrageous preference that activist Federal judges have given to flag burning over property rights. The current bill modifies the abstention doctrine, which provides that Federal courts will decline to hear certain court cases if there is on-going litigation in State court or before a State administrative agency. 
Now, on its face, the abstention doctrine sounds good. I believe that Federal courts should decline to hear lawsuits when State governments or State courts are in the process of considering the same issues. This prevents the duplication of efforts and respects States' rights. 
The property rights bill we're considering today would create an exception to the abstention doctrine for people who want to protect their constitutional right to own and control their property. 
The thing to remember, however, is that the Federal courts have already created exceptions to the abstention doctrine. Let's look at some of the cases where the Federal courts have decided not to abstain. In other words, let's look at some cases where Federal courts went ahead and heard a court case even though a State government was in the middle of considering the same case. 
In the case of Collins versus Smith, a Federal court decided not to abstain when a town in Illinois decided against issuing a parade permit to the American Nazi Party which wanted to march in a Jewish neighborhood. The Nazi Party couldn't afford to pay a fee which the town required, and so the Nazi Party was not given a permit to have this march. The Nazi Party challenged this decision as a violation of their constitutional rights and the town was considering whether to waive the fee or not to waive the fee. But the Nazis got tired of waiting and went to Federal court. And the court decided that it would hear the case even though there was a pending State proceeding. 
So, the Nazi Party gets to protect their rights in Federal courts--no questions asked and without having to wait for State proceedings to conclude. But property owners don't have that ability. They can't just run into Federal court. 
Mr. President, I think that's just plain wrong. I believe that hardworking Americans who own homes and hardworking farmers trying to work their land ought to have at least as many constitutional rights as the Nazi Party. If we pass this bill, we'll stop this unfairness. 
Nazis aren't the only ones who get treated better than property owners. Flag burners have it pretty good as well. In Sutherland versus DeWulf, the city of Rock Island, Illinois tried to prosecute someone who had burned an American flag. So the flag burners went straight into Federal court to sue the city government. Even though there were on-going State proceedings, the Federal court decided to hear the case and specifically rules that it would not abstain until after the State proceedings were finished. 
Again, this is unfair. It doesn't make sense to say that homeowners and farmers have to wait to have their day in court but flag burners can get their day in court any time they want. I think that property owners ought to have at least as many constitutional rights as flag burners. 
So, Mr. President, we have a chance today to correct this absurd preference for flag burners and Nazis. Why should they get a special key to unlock the courthouse doors, while homeowners and farmers have to wait outside the courthouse for years until some Federal judge decides it's okay to file a property rights case. For once, let's use some common sense and pass this bill. 
In the last Congress, the Judiciary Committee considered a comprehensive property rights bill. That was a good bill, and the Senate should have passed it. But there was strong opposition from intellectual elitists of the far left who have no regard for the concept of protecting private property rights. Those who spoke against the last property rights bill said it was too broad. 
So, this Congress, we have a more narrowly focused bill. But even this more narrow bill isn't acceptable to the opponents of property rights. 
Given what I've just pointed out about the preferential treatment that flag burners and Nazis get in terms of access to the Federal courts, I think that just shows how extreme and out-of-touch the other side is on this issue. I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an important issue for the taxpayers of this country. My purpose today is to: 
First, inform my colleagues; 
Second, alert future Members of this body; and 
Third, create a historical public record so that future Congresses will not repeat the mistakes of the past. The issue is the integrity of the government's present and future efforts to stop widespread fraud, waste and abuse against taxpayer funded programs. 
The government's strongest and most effective tool against fraud is the False Claim Act. In recent years, the False Claims Act has been under attack from industries targeted by the government's anti-fraud efforts. Since 1986, when Congress passed amendments that I sponsored to toughen the law, more than $4 billion has been recovered through the False Claims Act. Hundreds of billions more in fraud have been saved through the deterrent effect that this law has upon those who would betray the public's interest. 
In addition to the recovery of money and the deterrent effect of this law, the False Claims Act is important for another, perhaps, more important reason. The fact is that the False Claims Act is being used, day after day, by prosecutors to maintain the integrity of countless federal programs funded by American taxpayers. For example, the False Claims Act is being used in the health care industry to ensure that nursing home residents receive quality care--like enough food. 
Nonetheless, this Congress just witnessed an unconscionable assault on the False Claims Act. The law has thus far escaped unharmed. But, there is a `clear and present danger' lurking in the shadows. It is for this reason that I speak today, Mr. President--to chronicle the events that occurred over the past seven or so months. 
The perpetrator of this assault on the False Claims Act was the American Hospital Association (AHA). The AHA used its notable clout to systematically and cleverly orchestrate a major grassroots campaign to `gut' the False Claims Act. In the final analysis, its effort fell apart because the approach taken by the AHA lacked an essential ingredient--`credibility.' You see, the AHA appealed to a great many legislators by using horror stories from hospitals in their respective states and districts. But the horror stories, in the end, had no bearing on what the AHA peddled as the solution--gutting the False Claims Act. 
The correct solution was not to change the law--indeed there was, and is, no problem with the language of the False Claims Act. Rather, the solution was to correct a number of missteps made by the Department of Justice in implementing the law through its national initiatives. The AHA was abundantly aware of this fact. But AHA chose instead to pursue a strategy of bait and switch. The AHA allegedly backed a bill to gut the law simply to strong arm the Justice Department into changing how the False Claims Act was implemented. The strategy succeeded. Unfortunately, it comes at the expense of a serious loss of credibility, in my eyes, for the AHA. 
Before describing the events of the past months, some historical context is in order. The False Claims Act was fathered by President Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln had become frustrated by the widespread fraud against the Union Army by defense contracts during the Civil War. Contractors would sell the same horses twice to the Army; they would sell sand instead of gun powder; and sawdust instead of muskets. 
Included in the anti-fraud arsenal of the False Claims Act was a provision called qui tam. Qui tam is a concept that dates back to feudal times. It allows private citizens who know of fraud against the taxpayers to bring a lawsuit against the perpetrators. In other words, the citizen acts as a partner with the government. As an incentive, the citizen shares in any monetary recovery to the U.S. Treasury. 
Over the decades, the False Claims Act, and especially the qui tam provisions, proved to be effective, 
both in catching and deterring fraud. Think about it, Mr. President: The most effective way to catch fraud or other wrongdoing is to have `insider' information. Insiders help make investigations more targeted, more effective and more efficient. Congress has long recognized the value of insiders. That is why Congress established laws to encourage and protect whistle blowers. We know the value of inside information, and the role it plays in our constitutional system of checks and balances. 
Then, in 1943, things changed. That is when private industry played a role in amending the False Claims Act. The amendments neutralized the law's effectiveness--instead of having a powerful tool against fraud perpetrated against the government we had a toothless piece of legislation. Would-be perpetrators of fraud now had every reason to be celebrating in the streets; and taxpayers had suffered a major blow. 
During the early 1980s, our defense budget was rising rapidly to counter the Soviet threat. It rose so rapidly, in fact, that it was beyond our ability to manage the money properly. As one defense official said, it was as if we opened up the money bags at both ends, laid them on the doorstep of the Pentagon, and told the contractors to `come and get it.' 
Fraud against the government was suddenly out of control. I recall at one point that eight out of the top ten defense contractors were under federal investigation for fraud. Amazing!!! 
Not coincidentally, that is the year Congress restored the teeth to the False Claims Act that were removed some 40 years earlier. It was in 1986 that I sponsored, along with Howard Berman of the House of Representatives, amendments to the False Claims Act intended to put the `bite' back in the statute. Since that time, the law has been a tremendous success. It has recovered more than $4 billion for the taxpayers, and continues to deter fraud in amounts estimated in the hundreds of billions. 
Since passage of the 1986 amendments to the False Claims Act, private industry has been plotting to once again gut the law. Even before the amendments were passed, a major effort was underway by the defense and other industries to undermine passage. Even supporters of my amendments suddenly turned against my bill. There were curious instances, as I read in news accounts, of campaign money being given in close proximity to actions taken by Members to stop my bill. In the final analysis, the public's concern about fraud prevailed. My amendments passed and the False Claims Act has demonstrated itself to be one of the most powerful tools in the war against fraud. 
I knew at the time, Mr. President, that it would only be a matter of time before some industry would mount yet another assault on the False Claims Act. It is for that reason I have come to be ever vigilant. There are many citizen groups around the country that have joined me in this vigil. They have the taxpayers' best interests in mind. 
One such assault occurred in 1990, led by the defense contracting community. It was unsuccessful. One main reason for the failure of the defense contracting community was because that industry lacked credibility. The public grew skeptical of that industry's attempts to exempt itself--under the guise of competitiveness--from anti-fraud statutes. 
This year, the defense industry succeeded in persuading the Department of Defense to propose an exemption for that industry from the False Claims Act. Fortunately, the Department of Justice, with the assistance of the Inspector General's Office at the Department of Defense preempted the plans of the defense industry. 
A major and well orchestrated assault on the False Claims Act came in 1998 from the health care industry, and more particularly, from the hospitals. The hospital industry has a great deal of credibility with members of Congress. We all have hospitals in our states and districts, and we work closely with them in addressing their concerns. 
So, while the defense industry sat back after their attempt failed, the hospital industry took the lead in seeking to carve out an exemption from the False Claims Act for the entire health care industry. The health care industry played heavily on its credibility with the public in pursuing its agenda to exempt itself from the False Claims Act. It was reported to me that all the while, the defense industry watched in awe as progress was made. We all knew that if the hospitals succeeded in carving out an exemption from the False Claims Act, the defense industry would be next in line. And soon other industries 
would be lining up, too. 
The AHA's official and public assault on the False Claims Act began early this year. On January 30, 1998, the AHA met with staff members of the Committee on Aging, which I chair. It was determined at that meeting that the AHA's concerns were not with the language of the False Claims Act, but with the Justice Department's implementation of that law. The AHA alleged that the Justice Department was heavy-handed in its implementation of the law and was not separating innocent billing errors from actual fraud. All this from an industry where a recent survey found that the majority of hospitals pooled did not even have a compliance officer who is responsible (1) for developing and maintaining compliance programs, (2) investigating compliance issues, (3) overseeing Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, (4) overseeing billing and coding, as well as (5) overseeing tax-related issues. 
A few days later, my staff met with the Iowa Hospital Association, which expressed the same concerns as the national association. As a result of these meetings, I took a personal interest in the allegations of the AHA. Consequently, I met with Attorney General Reno on March 3, 1998, to discuss the AHA's concerns. Furthermore, I urged the Attorney General to take whatever action was necessary to insure that the implementation of the False Claims Act was being done properly, and if not, to take expeditious action to correct the situation. She agreed. 
I also met with Congressman McCollum of Florida who had expressed an interest in introducing a bill to amend the False Claims Act. During that meeting, he agreed to a one month reprieve before introducing the bill so that I could, among other things, facilitate a dialogue between the Justice Department and the AHA in the hope of reaching a resolution. Unfortunately, I was dismayed when Mr. McCollum introduced H.R. 3523 on March 19, 1998--a little over a week after our meeting. This changed the debate dramatically. As opposed to concentrating on resolving the concerns of the AHA through dialogue and communication, I was forced to expend my energies protecting the False Claims Act and the Medicare Trust Funds. Sometime later, on April 29, 1998, two of my Senate colleagues, Senators Cochran and Hollings introduced S. 2007, a parallel bill to H.R. 3523. 
The bills introduced in the House and Senate were characterized as innocuous by, among others, Representative McCollum and the AHA. But, the changes were not simple, the changes were not minor and the changes were not clarifying. Quite the contrary, the changes were devastating to the future use of the False Claims Act against the health care industry. So stated the Justice Department, the American Association of Retired Persons and others. Even the Clinton Administration voiced its concern with the bills and was prepared to issue a veto order if it became necessary. 
The House bill demonstrated itself to be popular among House members, Indeed, H.R. 3523 enjoys bipartisan support, boasting 201 co-sponsors. However, the McCollum bill stumbled. 
On June 3, 1998 the Department of Justice issued written guidance on the appropriate use of the False Claims Act in health care matters. This guidance was issued in response to concerns relating to the Justice Department's enforcement strategies in national health care projects. In response, Congressman Delahunt, co-sponsor of H.R. 3523, determined that the written guidance made this new legislation inadvisable. Mr. 
Delahunt then courageously decided to pull back his support for H.R. 3523. Shortly thereafter Congressmen Bliley, Barton, Dingell, Stark, and Berman stated in a Dear Colleague that: `The Department's guidelines are quite extensive and sufficient time must be given to allow for their appropriate implementation. A non-legislative solution is the appropriate manner to address their issues.' 
At this juncture it must be said that the Department of Justice, despite the attacks, despite the rhetoric and despite the misinformation, raised itself up from its bootstraps and, in good faith, issued guidance documenting its implementation of the False Claims Act. And even more amazing, Congressman McCollum, it is reported, still plans to move forward with the bill that would gut the False Claims Act. 
I suppose there are certain people associated with this effort who just don't get it. Who don't mind moving forward despite major questions of credibility. There are many more important issues that I and my staff could have been working on for the last seven months on behalf of the taxpayers. Instead we spent seven months of negative energy trying to put out brush fires as the False Claims Act came under assault. 
How anyone could ever suggest someone would enjoy that kind of politics is beyond me. To say the bill is `innocuous' is beyond me. And that's what I mean, Mr. President, when I talk about major questions of credibility. 
In the Senate, my colleagues, Senators Cochran and Hollings, played a critical role in having the Department of Justice issue responsible guidance to the health care industry without gutting the False Claims Act. In addition, my Senate colleagues worked hand-in-hand with me to develop legislative and report language that assures the future integrity of the False Claims Act and the good faith implementation of the guidance by the Department of Justice. I thank you, Senator Cochran and Senator Hollings. 
All in all, the history of the assault of the False Claims Act sends us on a long and winding road. But it is important to recognize that future attacks on the False Claims Act are undoubtedly around the corner--this despite the fact that the law's success is in many ways unparalleled in the enforcement community. 
Consequently, the False Claims Act is, and will remain, a target of those industries that accept billions and billions of taxpayer dollars annually and balk at strict accountability. I ask only that we, as legislators, remember the history of the assault made upon the False Claims Act by the AHA in the present. I ask further that we agree to be strong despite the strength of an industry, simply because it is the `right' thing to do. Taxpayers deserve no less--and as legislators, we should deliver no less.

Mr. GRASSLEY. For the information of all Senators, when the Senate reconvenes on Thursday, a cloture vote will occur at 10 a.m. Immediately following that vote, a second vote will occur on the adoption of the IRS conference report. 
Following those two back-to-back votes, it will be the leader's intention to begin the anti-agriculture sanctions legislation for India and Pakistan, hopefully under a brief time agreement. Following that legislation, it will be the leader's intention to begin the higher education bill under the consent agreement of June 25, 1998. 
Therefore, several votes will occur during Thursday's session of the Senate, with the first two votes occurring back-to-back at 10 a.m. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there are two people I would like to mention before I make my remarks. I commend the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for improving this bill as it has made its way through the legislative process. Too often, I see bills deteriorate as they are worked on by various subcommittees, committees, and on floors of the Houses of Congress. They sometimes deteriorate in the process to a lesser bill than we originally sought. This piece of legislation started out as a product of the National Commission on the Restructuring of the IRS and, for the most part, the recommendations of the commission were not changed as it went through the legislative process. But there were considerable additions made to this legislation. Senator Roth needs to be complimented for making this a better bill as it is now in this conference report. Each step of the way it was improved, which is the result of the hearings that he had last fall and in the spring of this year. 
The second person that I compliment is not part of the legislative process, but is the new Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, Mr. Charles O. Rossotti. He was appointed by the President last fall and confirmed and has been on the job now 8 or 9 months. I compliment him because he has not waited for Congress to act before making much-needed changes in the administration of the Internal Revenue Service. 
What I sought when I wrote to President Clinton in December of 1996 was to urge that the President appoint a nonlawyer to be IRS Commissioner--the first time that that has been done in four decades. I recommended that it be somebody from the private sector, a nonlawyer, who would know how to run an organization. This person would know how to make the IRS should be: oriented toward serving the taxpayers. I didn't know that the President would take my suggestion so seriously. But he did. He appointed Mr. Rossotti. 
Mr. Rossotti comes from a very successful career in the private sector, having formed a corporation of his own, from a few employees to thousands of employees. He left that environment--a very successful business--to serve the people of this country as IRS Commissioner. Being successful, as he was, would not have happened if he had not tried to serve his customer. So having that attitude come into the IRS will result in a breath of fresh air. It should make the IRS oriented toward consumer satisfaction. I have hope that he his insight will help the IRS respect the taxpayer, and as a result, it will make the collection of taxes much more efficient as well. 
Mr. Rossotti has not waited for Congress to act until he started to institute a lot of reforms. I say that he, from day one, started to carry out the spirit of the commission's recommendations before they were ever enacted into law. He needs to be complimented for doing that. 
On the first day that the Restructuring Commission met in the fall of 1996, various commission members were asked to tell what they thought we ought to try to accomplish through the coming year's work. When they got to me as one of the four congressional members of the commission, I said that I wanted to make sure that the IRS becomes more consumer friendly. If it became more consumer friendly, the taxpayer would honestly enjoy working with the Internal Revenue Service. I hope that is what this legislation does. Obviously, we won't know for several years if that sort of 
reform has been brought about, but that was my goal in the fall of 1996, and I think the commission's recommendations tended to go in that direction. 
As I have complimented Chairman Roth, I think the bill has even gone beyond our committee recommendations in that direction--ultimately, to eliminate the culture of intimidation within the IRS and to make sure that the IRS sets a standard for the taxpayers of this country. This bill will make the IRS deliver accurate information in a timely fashion and in a courteous way. In other words, this bill should make the IRS treat the taxpayer exactly as the IRS expects the taxpayer to treat it. The IRS expect prompt and accurate filing on April 15. 
So today is a very proud day for me. It is a proud day for the U.S. Senate. Maybe it brings a little common sense to Washington nonsense as well. Today, we declare a victory--a victory for the American taxpayer and for Congress. We have done something very good in this legislation. This is Government serving the people at its finest. It is for causes such as this that I am in public service. 
Let me explain why we did what this conference report does. I want to give you an example to explain why we found it necessary to pass a bill that comprehensively restructures and reforms the Internal Revenue Service. One Christmas Day, maybe 5 or 6 years ago, as I sat around the Christmas tree opening presents with my family, the telephone rang. On such a glorious day of good cheer and hope, I answered my telephone in high spirits. The woman at the other end of the line, a constituent of mine, was in tears. Her husband was critically ill and the IRS was coming after them for everything that they owned. I don't mean that they were coming after them on Christmas Day, but it was Christmas Day that this taxpayer of mine was bothered by this thought of dealing with the IRS. 
The taxpayer of mine owned very little, but the IRS was after it. She had no idea what to do. She had nowhere else to turn. So on Christmas Day, that day of hope to us, she picked up the telephone and called me. I have my name listed in the telephone book, so I am easy to get ahold of. She called someone she had never met, someone she only knew by reputation. This woman was at the end of her rope and she had nowhere else to turn. She didn't understand what was happening to her. She only knew that the IRS was harassing her to pay the debt that she didn't know they had, and it was not willing to work with her on that debt. 
Let's think back to the hearings the Senate Finance Committee held in the last year. We heard from victims of the IRS, about harassment and about abuse. We heard from IRS employees about the culture of intimidation at the IRS, which results in taxpayer abuse and keeps good employees from climbing the career ladder. These hearings touched a nerve with the American public, and they did so for a very good reason. We all saw ourselves in those stories--either in the victim, or we knew that it could have been us. 
There are critics of this legislation. To the critics I say this: We have different friends; we talk to different people. I am convinced that the critics have never spoken to a taxpayer facing the loss of his home, wondering where his family will sleep that night. They have never spoken with a woman who had IRS agents screaming and threatening her in front of her family. They have never spoken with the average taxpayer who works hard to make ends meet, pays his taxes on time and doesn't want to spend his kids' college fund on attorneys to fight the IRS. These are the people to whom I talk. These happen to be my constituents. These are the people who send me to represent them. This bill is for those constituents of mine. 
It is for the average American taxpayer, who is neither an accountant nor a lawyer. It is for the average American taxpayer who is not sure how to navigate the system, but who wants to stand up for himself in true American fashion. It is for the IRS employee who wants integrity in his workplace and reward for a job well done. 
This legislation is not a rash effort. It was not hatched overnight. Rather, it is the product of years of study and work. Senator Kerrey and I were honored to serve on the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service. In June, 1997 this commission released an 80-page report of recommendations to radically restructure the IRS. These recommendations were turned into legislation, which Senator Kerrey and I introduced in the Senate, and Congressman Portman introduced in the House. 
There are many people who worked on the effort you see before you today. I have already complimented Senator Roth, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, for holding two series of important oversight hearings. These gave us further insight into the IRS and gave this legislation the momentum it needed. He also has shown great leadership in strengthening the House-passed bill, and navigating it through the conference committee. 
Senator D'Amato and Senator Graham should be thanked for their leadership to provide relief for innocent spouses. Senator Mack should be thanked for his leadership in creating confidentiality between an accountant and his client. And, of course, my friends Senator Kerrey and Congressman Portman must be recognized for their untiring work, for endless hours on endless days, on the Restructuring Commission and this legislation. 
Let's talk about what this bill does. First, it provides oversight and it mandates accountability. It was Justice Louis Brandeis who said, `sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.' This legislation provides sunlight and electric light throughout the IRS. 
First, this bill creates a new Inspector General for Tax Administration within the Treasury Department. This new IG will be dedicated solely to oversight of the IRS. He or she will have all of the powers and responsibilities given by the Inspector General statute. This office will also assume most of the responsibilities now performed by the IRS' Inspection Service. This change moves the oversight function out of the IRS and into the Treasury Department where it can be more impartial and effective. 
This bill also requires that this Inspector General for Tax Administration randomly audit IRS denials of public information requests. I have found, and have heard from others, that the IRS sometimes hides improprieties by claiming the information is protected for taxpayer confidentiality or law enforcement reasons. However, upon further investigation, it has been discovered that the redacted information has nothing to do with either taxpayer confidentiality or law enforcement. It simply admits IRS error and admits IRS error, and it gives them an opportunity to hide from public scrutiny. Claiming taxpayer confidentiality or law enforcement as a reason to redact or fail to release information lets the IRS avoid oversight by Congress, the press and the public. 
To help guide this agency and keep it on track, this legislation also creates an Oversight Board. This Board should be comprised mainly of management experts, who will guide the IRS and keep it honest and well administered. 
In addition, this bill makes it easier to hold IRS agents accountable for their actions--both good and bad. The bill makes it easier to fire bad IRS employees, and easier to reward outstanding IRS employees. It also makes it easier to sue the IRS for the actions of its agents. It expands the cause of action in civil court to permit up to $100,000 in civil damages or harm caused by an officer or employee of the IRS who negligently disregards the rules of that agency. 
Another major achievement of this bill is that it increases taxpayer rights. As an author of the first two Taxpayer Bills of Rights, I am particularly qualified to testify to the importance of this section of the bill--the 
Taxpayer Bill of Rights 3, as we refer to it. This bill will help even the playing field even more between the taxpayer--particularly the average taxpayer who can't afford to spend a lot of money for counsel--and the IRS. It will help taxpayers to understand the process. It will help put customer service back into the Internal Revenue Service. 
Specifically, this legislation shifts the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS is many tax disputes. This bill also gives relief to innocent spouses. Innocent spouses are people who didn't take part in the tax shelter or tax planning that results in a tax assessment. Their marriage has broken down and they are left with little except the IRS pounding on their door--the door of the innocent spouse. It is important that we collect tax when it is due, but also that we don't collect money from people who are not at fault and who don't owe it. 
Another important step--this bill increases the independence of the Taxpayer Advocate. 
The taxpayer advocate is renamed the National Taxpayer Advocate and the local problem resolution officers will become local taxpayer advocates. The local taxpayer advocates will report to the National Taxpayer Advocate rather than to the district director to avoid the intimidation that comes from such relationship with district directors. 
This bill also gives the taxpayer relief from interest and penalties in some situations. For example, this bill suspends penalties while an installment agreement is in effect. It suspends the statute of limitations to file for a refund during times of disability. It gives taxpayers more due process rights before the IRS can levy or seize property, and makes it easier to contest the placement of a lien. And the IRS can't seize a principle place of residence or a small business until it has exhausted all other payment options. 
In addition, this legislation makes important strides towards empowering taxpayers. I sincerely believe that educating the taxpayer is half of the battle. Americans are generally strong, self-reliant people. Letting them know their rights and responsibilities gives them the ammunition to stand up for themselves. For example, this bill requires the IRS to make extra effort to alert taxpayers to the joint and several liability incurred just by signing an income tax form. It requires the IRS to rewrite Publication 1, which is called `Your Rights as a Taxpayer' to more clearly inform taxpayers of their rights to be represented at interviews with the IRS, and if the taxpayer is represented, that the interview cannot proceed without the presence of the taxpayer's representative unless the taxpayer consents. The IRS also must include with the first letter of deficiency a description of the entire process from examination through collection, including the assistance available to taxpayers from the taxpayer advocate at various points in the process. And now any taxpayer in an installment agreement will receive an annual statement of the initial balance owed, the payments made during the year, and the remaining balance. 
This bill also provides greater taxpayer protection during the audit process. It extends the attorney-client confidentiality privilege to some communications between an accountant and a client. This bill makes it impossible for the IRS and the taxpayer to agree to extend the statute of limitations on collection actions beyond 10 years unless there is an installment agreement in place. Then the statute of limitations can only be extended until the end of the installment agreement, plus 90 days. 
Further, the IRS must always inform the taxpayer of his or her right to refuse to extend the statute of limitation and to limit an extension to specific issues. 
These are just some important aspects of this legislation. I think it is landmark legislation, at least landmark for the last 45 years. I am proud to be a part of this effort. This legislation reflects hard work by so many of us. This effort will be rewarded by the sunlight that will shine into the IRS, giving it the oversight that it needs and the accountability that the taxpayer deserves. 
This is a great day. It will be a greater day if down the road a few years I come to the conclusion that this legislation has effectively eliminated the culture of intimidation within the IRS. Today this bill sets a standard for the IRS to treat the taxpayer the way they expect the taxpayer to treat the IRS. In other words, this bill helps the taxpayer get timely information, accurate information, and courteous service--because that is what the IRS expects of the taxpayer on April 15 each year. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. It has come to my attention that some States are engaging in policies or practices that could create interjurisdictional barriers to adoption, such as discontinuance of the registration of waiting families with adoption exchanges outside the State, refusal to share home studies across State lines, and refusal to respond to out-of-state inquiries. The Adoption and Safe Families Act (P.L. 105-89), enacted last year, explicitly established that States shall not take any action that would deny or delay a child's adoption when an approved family is available outside the child's jurisdiction. In light of these recent reports, I urge the Department of Health and Human Services to closely monitor State policy and practice with regard to interstate adoptions to determine compliance with the new law, to immediately report any change of policy or practice in this area to the States, and to impose the full penalty on States which are out of compliance. 
I have been told by some organizations which represent the States' interests that they consider Sec. 202 of Public Law 105-89 to be ambiguous and that the Adoption and Safe Families Act did not necessarily prohibit creating barriers to adoption. Let me make this very clear, while the Adoption and Safe Families Act does not specifically declare that States shall not create barriers to adoption, Congresssional intent is clear that any action that delays an adoption, when an approved family is available, would be a violation of the law. Thus, policies that might result in such delays would be inconsistent with the law's intent. Particularly when viewed in the context of the entire Adoption and Safe Families Act, which is designed to promote and expedite adoptions, there can be no confusion about Congressional intent. In addition, this requirement is not inconsistent with other provisions in federal child welfare law that require States to recruit a diverse pool of potentially adoptive families, nor should it discourage States from developing adoptive families within their own borders. The overall goal is to place children for adoption with approved families without any unnecessary delay. Simply put, the law establishes that States shall not discriminate in adoptive placements on the basis of geography. 
Let me give you examples of created barriers: any refusal to return phone calls from outside the agency's jurisdiction; the suggestion that agencies have a property right which permits them to withhold a homestudy from a preadoptive family; the imposition of conditions on families from outside the jurisdiction which are different in quantity or quality from conditions imposed on families within the jurisdiction; or, the refusal to accept home studies performed by duly licensed social workers from another jurisdiction without good cause to believe those social workers are dishonest or incompetent. 
We have a national crisis on our hands. Thousands of children are waiting for families to adopt them. If we don't recognize this, children will continue to live out their childhoods in foster care. Territory and turf should not come between waiting children and adoptive families. Any barrier created to deny or delay an adoptive placement is an injustice. Although States can spend hundreds of dollars recruiting adoptive families, they need to remember, they do not own these families. Their recruitment efforts contribute to a national recruitment effort for the nation's waiting children, not just their State's children. I recognize that many states are pulling out all the stops for kids. But they cannot do all the work. We all must do everything we can to ensure that children are united with loving, nurturing families, and we cannot let geography get in the way.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, debate concerning drugs and drug policy has reached new levels. The letters and phone calls which my office receive are a constant reminder that the influx of drugs into this country are at the top of constituents' concerns. Our fight against drugs exists on two fronts. Within our border we must educate our young about the dangers of drugs in an effort to reduce demand. 
Along our borders there exists another battle. This battle, to keep drugs from entering the U.S. has become increasingly difficult as drug runners have been employing more sophisticated technologies and techniques. Small planes are using remote landing strips to ferry drugs across the border. In the Caribbean traffickers are using high-speed boats to escape the Coast Guard. I need not reiterate how these preexisting conditions are straining the effort of our front-line law enforcement people on the border. As the methods which drug traffickers along the Mexican border continue to improve, we are beginning to lose ground in our `War on Drugs.' This current predicament calls for an increasing and appropriate role for the U.S. military. 
In recognition of this need, I am joining with Senator DeWine amd Senator Graham in sponsoring an amendment which, has been accepted, to the Department of Defense reauthorization bill. This amendment calls upon the Secretary of Defense to add drug interdiction and counter-drug activities under military operations other than war, in the Global Military Force Policy. This would effectively give counter-drug efforts greater priority than military exercises. In addition, it would come at no extra cost to the taxpayer. Military resources such as AWAC's and other military hardware would be reallocated and instead of being sent out on exercises, they would be used to detect and intercept drug traffickers. 
Elevating the priority of drug interdiction within the Global Military Force Policy is necessary in helping stem the flow of illegal drugs into this country. In conclusion, if we are to `get tough on drugs' in the face of increasingly modernizing drug trade, we must seek to incorporate the U.S. military in our effort.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support the Wyden-Grassle amendment banning secret holds. My colleagues should be aware of our efforts by now, but in case they are not, this is what we are trying to do. My good friend from Oregon and I are offering language that would require any Senator who wishes to place a hold on legislation or a nomination must notify the Senate and the American people of his or her action. 
This can be done either through the Congressional Record or a statement on the floor. I want my colleagues to understand: This amendment does not, I repeat, does not ban holds. With our proposal, Senators can continue to place a hold on any legislation they wish. Our amendment simply requires that they be open about it. 
I firmly believe this amendment will improve the daily workings of the Senate. First, it will make the Senate more accountable. 
Too many Americans think that we in Congress don't take responsibility for what we do. This amendment will give Americans greater peace of mind that their public servants are responsible and accountable. And we cannot function effectively if we do not have the basic trust of the people we work for--our constituents. 
I know in my own experience I have had to spend valuable time trying to find out who had put a hold on legislation of mine. Tracking down a hold is a tremendous waste of time and effort. 
If someone has put a hold on one of my bills, under this proposal I can immediately go to that Senator and talk about his or her concerns and see if we can work things out. When we engage in reasoned debate and give and take on issues is when this body serves the best interests of the American people most effectively. I believe open holds will do much to facilitate this. 
Members may think they could face retribution if they declare a hold. 
However, Senator Wyden and I have both practiced open holds, and I can tell my colleagues that there is no reason for them to fear retribution or reprisal. I have never faced any repercussions from stating my intention to place a hold and I would imagine Senator Wyden would say the same. 
Senators need to know that voting against this amendment will not make it go away, because Senator Wyden and I intend to pursue this reform until we succeed. And I know we will succeed because this is the right thing to do. 
It is right to be open with the American people and it is right to be open with your fellow Senators. It is time we made this reform because the secrecy surrounding holds is not required by Senate rules or the Constitution or any other instrument of Government that I know of and it has been allowed to go on much too long. Our proposal is simple, reasonable and fair. I know there are some who say we need to study this issue a little longer. I reject that notion. This is not a complicated change we are proposing. 
In closing, I just want to urge my fellow Senators again as emphatically as I can to support this amendment. I have heard many of my colleagues express to me and to Senator Wyden that they believe this reform is necessary. Now those of us who support openness and accountability in government have an opportunity to act on those convictions. I urge a yes vote on the Wyden-Grassley open holds amendment.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I introduce the `Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act of 1998 with my colleagues, Senators Reid, Hollings, and D'Amato. This legislation will enable seniors to receive rehabilitative services based on their condition and not on arbitrary payment limits. A similar version was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Ensign earlier this year. 
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is a very important accomplishment and one that I am proud to say I supported. However, in our rush to save the Medicare Trust Fund from bankruptcy, Congress neglected to thoroughly evaluate the impact the new payment limits on rehabilitative services would have on Medicare beneficiaries. 
The BBA included a $1500 cap on occupational, physical and speech therapy services received outside a hospital setting. According to a recent study by Muse & Associates, these limitations on services would harm almost 13 percent (or 653,000) of Medicare beneficiaries because these individuals would exceed the cap. While many seniors will not need services that would cause them to exceed the $1500 cap, others, like stroke victims, will likely need services beyond what the arbitrary caps will cover. Unfortunately, it is those beneficiaries who need rehabilitative care the most who will be penalized by being forced to pay the entire cost for these services outside of a hospital setting. 
The bill I am introducing would repeal the cap, which is scheduled to go into effect in January 1999. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services would be required to implement a prospective payment system that would recoup any savings lost from the repeal of this provision by January 2000. In essence, the bill attempts to accomplish the primary goal of the $1500 cap, budgetary savings, but without harming the Medicare beneficiary. Payment is based on the patient's condition and not on an arbitrary monetary amount. Help us repeal the $1,500 cap, establish a system that makes sense, and still achieve the budget savings sought from the BBA without reducing Medicare benefits.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to this year's Defense bill to address the unexcusably lax procedures for disposing of surplus military equipment which currently exist. There have been several media reports indicating that these procedures are unacceptably loose. To examine this issue, I chaired a hearing on the proper disposal of military surplus before the Judiciary subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. I was alarmed at the ease with which hostile foreign nations like China can purchase classified military items from depots right here in America. 
Mr. President, my amendment makes several much-needed reforms. First, the amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to assign codes to military equipment. These codes determine whether the equipment can later be resold to the public as surplus or if the equipment must be destroyed before it can be resold as surplus. Further, the amendment gives the Secretary of Defense the authority to take whatever steps he deems necessary to fulfill this responsibility. Finally, my amendment creates a new export control law which closes loopholes in current law which arms smugglers use to avoid prosecutions for exporting military surplus. Importantly, this new export control law has the support of the administration. 
The problem of lax disposal procedures isn't new. The first congressional hearings on this topic were conducted in the early 1970s. At that time, Congress received testimony that the Pentagon's program for ensuring the proper disposal of surplus items was in shambles. 
Mr. President, after my hearing, I can say that the disposal process is still badly in need or reform. My hearing showed that there is a cavalier attitude toward the disposal of surplus equipment that presents a real danger to our national security and to the safety of the American people. In one case, the Pentagon lost track of surplus equipment valued at 39 million dollars. That's a lot of stuff to lose in just one transaction. 
It seems to me that disposing of tanks or missiles or classified military equipment in a way that keeps them out of the hands of hostile foreign nations or terrorists is really central to the military mission, and so I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. 
Under current practice, the Pentagon has decided the answer to the question of what to do with surplus parts is to sell them to the highest bidder, with practically no controls in place. The few controls that are in place, which are supposed to make sure that 
military-grade surplus doesn't end up with terrorists or hostile nations, continue to be an abject failure by any reasonable standard. 
Mr. President, the depots which sell sensitive military surplus have become thriving terrorist flea markets. In fact, the Pentagon even has a world wide web homepage to advertise military surplus for sale--some of it classified. Who knows, right now some of Saddam Hussein's henchmen could be browsing this homepage looking for spare parts or new weapons. 
One way to measure whether an agency takes a problem seriously is to look at how that agency disciplines its own employees when their misconduct contributes to that problem in other words, how does the Pentagon react when one of its own employees breaks the rules on disposing or dangerous military surplus? By that standard, it appears to this Senator that the Defense Department doesn't take security breaches at military depots very seriously. For instance, it's my understanding that the chief of a depot in Crane, Indiana was not seriously reprimanded for allowing over 70 grenade launchers to be sold without being properly destroyed. To date, only about 30 of those launchers have been recovered. What's the result? Every once in a while, law enforcement seizes one of these missing grenade launchers from a gang of criminals. Pentagon sloppiness is making criminals even more dangerous and well-armed. 
In another case which caused problems for law enforcement, the Justice Department had to drop illegal export charges against an arms smuggler who had tried to send armored personnel carrier parts to Iran. The Justice Department had to drop the charges because the defense logistics agency had assigned the wrong code to the equipment. 
Another indication that the Pentagon doesn't take the issue of properly disposing of surplus very seriously is that no one from the office of the Secretary of Defense would come to testify at my hearing--despite repeated requests that someone appear who could speak for the Defense Department as a whole. That's why my amendment puts the responsibility for disposing of surplus in the office of the Secretary of Defense. Congress needs to have someone to look to if there is to be genuine accountability. 
Finally, I'd like to sum up the situation we have here. Despite congressional oversight going back to Senator McLellan's 1972 hearings, nothing has really changed. Therefore, it's clearly time for Congress to step up to the plate and take action. That's why I am offering this amendment to the DOD authorizations bill to give law enforcement an enhanced ability to catch arms smugglers who are targeting military surplus. 
But helping law enforcement is only part of the solution that's merely reactive. What we really need is for the Pentagon to get its house in order and prevent this problem from happening in the first place. So, my amendment requires the office of the Secretary of Defense to take control of the surplus issue. 
I think it's fair to say that if classified or highly sensitive military technology is being sent to foreign nations and terrorists, we have a clear threat to national security. We have dangerous weapons going from our own military depots into the hands of criminals. My amendment would give law enforcement the tools they need and would hold the Department of Defense accountable for solving this problem. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment, and I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I will announce today's business. Today, the Senate will resume the defense authorization bill. It is hoped that Members will come to the floor to offer and debate amendments to the defense bill under short time agreements. 
As ordered, at 3 o'clock, the Senate will begin 2 hours of debate on the nomination of Susan Mollway to be U.S. district judge. It is expected that the first vote of today's session will occur at 5 p.m. on the confirmation of that nomination. 
As a reminder to all Members, a cloture motion was filed on Friday to the DOD bill. The cloture vote will occur tomorrow, Tuesday, June 23, at a time to be determined by the two leaders. Under rule XXII, Senators have until 1 p.m. today to file first-degree amendments. The cloture vote will not necessarily be the first vote of Tuesday's session, so Members may expect early morning votes on amendments to the defense bill. 
The majority leader would like to remind all Members that the Independence Day recess is fast approaching. The cooperation of all Members will be necessary for the Senate to complete work on many important items, including appropriations bills, the Higher Education Act, the Department of Defense authorization bill, the conference reports on the Coverdell education bill and the IRS reform bill, and any other legislative or executive items that may be cleared for action. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, before I start to debate this issue, I should say thank you to my colleague from Oregon for his leadership in this area. He has worked very hard on it. I have been very happy to be supportive of him--and I am fully supportive of him. I have told him how secret holds have affected me and now both he and I practice what we preach--that is, we declare our intentions to put a hold on a piece of legislation if we decide to take that action. Obviously, being open about placing a hold has worked for us and it is a sound practice. 
I want to state the proposition that eventually what is right is going to win out in the Senate. I know that constituents are skeptical about right winning out in this body, and I suppose sometimes it takes a long time for right to win out; but I believe if you feel you are in the right, and that you are pursuing the right course of action and, particularly, as in this case, when your opponents don't have a lot to say about what you are trying to do, I think you can be confident that you are pretty much on the right course. There wasn't much opposition to this expressed on the floor of the Senate last year. My guess is that there won't be a lot expressed this year either, and eventually we will win. I think we will win this year. But if we don't, we are going to win sometime on this proposition because it is so right and because we are not going to give up. 
I know persistence pays because it took me about 6 years, ending in 1995, to get Congress covered by a lot of legislation that it exempted itself from. A lot of laws were applicable to the rest of the country and were not applicable to those of us on Capitol Hill. That was wrong. It was recognized as being wrong. So I presented the motions to accomplish the goal of getting Congress to obey the laws everyone else had to follow. They were hardly ever argued against on the floor of this assembly. But in the `dark dungeons' where conference committees are held, somehow those provisions were taken out--until after about 6 years of discussing the issue of congressional exemptions, and the public becoming more aware of this shameful situation, finally there was enough embarrassment brought to Congress that we could not keep that exemption from those laws any longer. So we passed the Congressional Accountability Act early in 1995. It was the first bill signed that year by the President of the United States. We have ended those exemptions that were so wrong. 
I still remember that, early on in that period of time, how my colleagues would just say privately to me, `What a terrible catastrophe it is going to be for the Congress to have to live under these laws that apply to the rest of the Nation'--laws like civil rights laws, worker safety laws, et cetera. We have had to live under those laws for 3 years now, and it hasn't harmed us at all. It has been good for the country to have those of us that make laws have to actually understand the bureaucratic morass and red tape you have to go through to meet those laws, and some of the conditions on employment, some of the working conditions in the office, some of the wage and hour issues that private employers have to go through. We understand those now. We have to be sympathetic to their arguments more because we have to live under those laws. 
Well, that is one example of right ultimately winning. That brings me to what is right about this. There are plenty of reasons for holds, and there is nothing really wrong with holds. There is nothing that our legislation says is wrong with holds. But the reasons can be purely political. Sometimes holds are put on for one colleague to use as leverage with another colleague, to move something that maybe another individual is blocking. There can be truly flawed legislation, and maybe there such holds legitimately allow more time to work things out. However, other holds can be purely a stalling tactic. A hold could be all could be for all of those reasons and more. It doesn't matter what the reason is. We don't find fault with those reasons. We only say that the people that are exercising the hold, for whatever reason, ought to say so, and why. 
It is going to cause the Senate, I think, with our amendment, to be run more openly and efficiently. It is going to lift one of the veils of secrecy. It is not going to lift all of the veils of secrecy in a parliamentary body. I don't know that I would call that all of them be lifted. I am not sure I could even enumerate all of the layers of secrecy that might go on. But this is one form of secrecy that is not legitimate. 
As I said, we do not ban holds or the use of them, for whatever reason they might be made. We just stipulate that they must be made public so that we know who is putting the hold on. We would like to know why the hold is being put on, but that is not even a requirement in our legislation. Just tell who you are. You don't even have to say why. It is pretty simple. It is pretty reasonable. 
A lot of my colleagues, I think, fear retribution. If they are putting a hold on for a legitimate reason, why should they have to fear that? Maybe the greater good of the body, the greater good of the country would be their motivation. They might think they would experience some sort of retribution and that is why they may not want their hold to be known. I say that, after 2 or 3 years of practicing open holds myself, there is no fear of a hold being known. I can tell you this: I probably was somewhat nervous the first time I announced that I was going to make public in the Congressional Record why I was putting a hold on. I thought that maybe I was opening myself up to a lot of retribution, a lot of trouble that I don't need. I probably don't use holds very often. You could probably count the number of times on one hand that I would use a hold in the course of a Congress. Regardless, the times that I have done it, I can tell you that there is no pain. No harm came to me. There is no retribution that came to me as a result of it from any of my colleagues. And 98 others beside Senator Wyden and myself could do that, and they don't. 
I can tell you about the problems I have had finding out who has a hold, why they have a hold; and then we have had these rotating holds where somebody has found out and some friend will put a hold on in his place. You run those things down. It is not a very productive way to be a Senator. If I can go to the Congressional Record and find out who doesn't like my proposition, who doesn't like this nominee, et cetera, I can go to that individual and just talk up front about the reason, and I think it will even speed up the work of the Senate. If each Senator can be a little more efficient, then the Senate is going to be a little more efficient body as a whole. 
So this is one of those things that, from every angle--every reason for making a hold open is a good reason. Look at all of the prospective opposition to it and the reasons for the opposition. First of all, people don't very freely express opposition to it. But when they do express an argument against making holds open, it is not a very good reason to be against it. When you have these public policy arguments for making holds open that are good, good, good, why should we waste any time? They just ought to be adopted; they ought to be a part of the practice and make the public's business more public. That is what the Wyden-Grassley amendment is all about. I hope my colleagues will support us in this effort. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to draw attention to a problem in our drug control program. It concerns something that the Department of Defense (DoD) is not doing. And frankly it's embarrassing. Today, the men and women of federal law enforcement constantly put their lives at risk in an effort to fight the increasing flow of illicit drugs into our country. Not only do we face the threat of an increase of drugs in our children's schools and on our streets, but our law enforcement officers continue to face a rising tide of violence at our borders and in our cities as a result of the drug trade. We continue to see the flow of narcotics across the Southern tier of the U.S. to include Puerto Rico. Law enforcement personnel and their commitment to the mission to fight the war on drugs work many long hours, sometimes late into the evening and are subject to changes in their schedules at a moments notice. The families of these officers also feel the pressures of the job they perform. This brings me to the point I would like to make. 
The front lines of the U.S. Customs Service are not just a problem of gun-toting drug thugs. They face more than long hours and risky situations. While they deal with all these things, they must shoulder the additional burden of coping with bureaucratic bumbledom. This added load is a result of DoD officiousness and unwillingness to cooperate. The language of instruction in Puerto Rico public schools is Spanish and not English. Therefore, the only affordable English-language school option for U.S. Customs' personnel is the DoD school. However, current legislation and DoD policy is creating a hardship for Customs' employees and their families. This unnecessarily affects our counter-drug efforts by undermining morale. 
It is my understanding that the children of these law enforcement personnel have been attending DoD schools in Puerto Rico for more than 20 years. Throughout the years, changes in legislation and DoD policy have placed numerous restrictions on Customs and other Federal civilian agencies. Customs has recently augmented its workforce in Puerto Rico under its Operation Gateway initiative in light of the continuing and heightened threat of narcotics smuggling and money laundering in the Caribbean Basin. I supported this initiative. This session I will also stress the need for better coordination of our interdiction strategy, particularly the need to develop a `Southern Tier' concept. This initiative will strive to focus resources in a more comprehensive way to protect our southern frontier. Puerto Rico is crucial to this strategy. Current legislation and DoD's policy requirements are, however, obstacles to the effective implementation of this aggressive enforcement initiative in terms of recruitment and retention of Customs employers because as I stated earlier, there are no English speaking public schools in Puerto Rico. 
I think it is ridiculous that Customs' efforts in Puerto Rico--the men and women who deal daily with difficult and dangerous situations--should find their attention distracted by something like this.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, recently, we have seen the culmination of one of the most successful undercover operations in history by the United States Customs Service. This effort, known as `Operation Casablanca,' has infiltrated and dismantled a group of international bankers, mostly in Mexico, who have been laundering drug money. The threat of drug trafficking is serious enough. But to have their financial advisors leading their effort to facilitate the smuggling of illicit narcotics is much worse. Complicit bankers devising schemes can make it much easier to move and hide the ill-gotten gains of drug cartels. 
As this latest law enforcement operation illustrates, we must be sure that we are taking the necessary steps to protect the citizens of our nation. We must prevent drug traffickers and organized crime groups from obtaining the profits of their illegal activities. Much has been done and said about the movement of illegal drugs into the United States. But the opposite side of the business does not always get the publicity, and is just as important. We need to go after the profits from drug sales and other illegal enterprises. 
Last week, Representative Leach, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services introduced legislation to amend title 31, United States Code. The bill H.R. 4005, `the Money Laundering Deterrence Act of 1998,' would improve methods for preventing financial crimes. And as Operation Casablanca shows this legislation, is timely and needed. We need to tighten up our financial control capabilities to prevent criminal enterprises from abusing our financial and banking systems. The bill is supported by the American Banking Association (ABA), the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve. Today, Chairman Leach's bill has already been marked up in the House. 
I call for my colleagues to help support this companion legislation. I hope this would be a continuation of efforts by Congress to go after the growing threat of money laundering not only to our nation, but worldwide.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am puzzled. In the last week or so, we have seen U.S. Customs' agents wrap up one of the most successful undercover operations in history. This effort, Operation Casablanca, has nailed a bunch of international bankers, mostly in Mexico, who have been laundering drug money. These white collar drug thugs have violated United States law, Mexican law, and international law. They have violated their trust. They have abetted one of the nastiest businesses on the planet. And they have conspired to do all of this to make an illegal dollar. Drug traffickers are bad enough. But their financial advisers and bankers are truly despicable. Thus, the Customs' undercover operation that exposed some of these low lifes is to be celebrated. My hat is off to the agents and informants that risked their lives to help defend our institutions and bring these pinstripe bandits to justice. 
But I am still puzzled. What has me scratching my head is the reaction of the Mexican Government to this event. Instead of joining hands in congratulating efforts to protect the integrity of our international banking institutions and our shared concern to stop drug trafficking, what have they done. The Foreign Minister of Mexico has called the law enforcement people the criminals. She has raised the banner of so-called national sovereignty to provide cover to criminal activities of Mexican nationals. Mexico has called for the extradition of the law enforcement people in this operation, claiming they have violated Mexican law. What is wrong with this picture? Let me count the ways. 
First, money laundering is the illegal act we are talking about. It is, by its nature, an activity without borders. It is also illegal in every legitimate country on the planet. 
Second, the bankers in Mexico who engaged in laundering drug money, did so with knowledge of the illegality of their acts. They did so in a manner aimed at avoiding detection. They did so in defiance of bank regulations and Mexican law. 
Third, these bankers engaged knowingly in using their expertise to violate United States law. And they provided the facilities of their banks to move money around the globe in violation of international law. 
Fourth, we know they did this because it's on tape. We know they did it knowingly because the indictments spell it out. 
Fifth, they used their expertise to try to improve the ease with which the money was laundered. They provided advice on how to avoid Mexican law. 
They acted with criminal intent and used the interconnectivity of the modern banking system to hide their acts. They committed these acts in this country, in Mexico, and elsewhere, either in person or by using computers. 
Now, the Foreign Secretary in Mexico would have it that in exposing these activities and in tracking the process, United States agents violated Mexican sovereignty and law. It would seem, in her view, that this means the undercover operatives committed criminal acts by engaging in money laundering. But in this country and most others, a criminal act involves intent. There is no criminal intent involved here by U.S. law enforcement. Just the reverse. Thus, law is not offended. 
As to sovereignty, well, if we insist on this point, whose sovereignty is violated? Sovereignty is not meant to be a shield for criminality. It would be a fine world if that were the principle. It is not. I can think of few more useful tools for drug traffickers, money launderers, and thugs of every description than to find a safe haven in some country willing to use its sovereignty to harbor international criminality. What has happened here, is that bankers have violated the laws of this country by using the international banking system to freely commit crimes. They have done this in person in this country and they have done it electronically across borders. These are the criminals, not the law enforcement people who have corralled this gang of crooks.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coverdell amendment. I sincerely hope that the Senate will adopt this important amendment. I think the main concern on this side of the aisle is not about the importance of an antitobacco campaign and an education program so teenagers will not smoke in the first place. This is very important, and it should be well funded. But money above and beyond that ought to go into fully funding existing programs rather than creating a whole new scheme of programs. Creating new Federal programs is a goal of this administration. It is important that we not just create the programs for their sake, but that we make sure that it is used wisely. There will be a lot of new revenue generated by this bill and we must not use it all to create new Federal programs. 
We cannot put an obligation on the people of this country to support programs that we do not know, down the line, how much they are going to cost, just because there is a big new bonanza of money available. 
The purpose of this legislation is to keep teenagers from starting to smoke in the first place. This must remain our focal point. This is one important reason that I support the Coverdell amendment, because it will put excess money into existing programs and not create a whole new list of programs. Another is that this amendment will combat illegal drug use--which also kills our children. We should not address one without addressing the other. If we say that we are going to help our children, then we simply cannot walk away from an opportunity to help them fight against illegal drugs. This is not one against the other--either we fight youth tobacco smoking or we fight illegal drug use. Quite the contrary, this amendment means that we do both. 
We are in the process of considering monumental legislation. We are engaged in a major debate about what to do about tobacco. Many of the arguments in favor of this bill focus on keeping kids from starting to smoke. I believe this is a very important objective. But there is more we can do with this bill to help our kids. When you talk to young people about what concerns them, when you look at what they tell pollsters, you learn what most concerns them. If we are going to engage in all of this talk of what to do for young people, it might be a good idea to listen to what they have to say. 
Young people today are very concerned about the availability of illegal drugs and of the violence that is all too common in our schools. Whatever else we might say about tobacco, it is not the source of the violence that threatens so many young people. While it has serious health consequences, those are not immediate. Smoking tobacco may give you heart disease or cancer in the future. The use of illegal drugs and the bad things that they do are not a problem of tomorrow, those are problems this very day, they are immediate problems, and the availability of these drugs is what most concerns kids. 
We hear very little of this in this debate. I think we make a mistake in not consulting what our young people are telling us. They are telling us that we must also address the use and availability of illegal drugs if we are to protect their health. That is why I am supporting amendments to the tobacco bill that will bring the issue of illegal drugs into the discussion. I wish every time the President took time to discuss tobacco and kids, he would bring the issue of illegal drugs into the discussion. And I wish that the President of the United States would never be seen with a cigar in his mouth if his campaign against tobacco is to be credible. 
Seeing that he is not likely to do that, I believe that we in the Congress must talk about illegal drugs. I therefore draw to my colleagues' attention these amendments and ask them to join me in voting for them. That includes the Coverdell-Craig amendment on drug-free neighborhoods and others that strengthen our efforts to deal with illegal drug trafficking and use. These amendments put drugs back into the debate, and they should be there. They should be there every time he talks about tobacco. They should be there every time he talks about children s health. The President should also talk about not only drugs being illegal and not that they are bad because they are illegal--but they are illegal because they are bad. These amendments give support to increasing our prevention, treatment, and interdiction programs for the issues that most concern our young people. 
I also call to mind an important point. In the years that we made `Just Say No' a critical element of our counterdrug efforts, we saw a significant decline in illegal drug use among our young people. And we also saw something else. `Just Say No' had a halo effect. Kids not only stopped using illegal drugs, but they also stopped using tobacco and alcohol in impressive numbers. 
In the last several years, in the absence of a coherent antidrug message, drug use is on the rise--use of all drugs--especially among young people. Tobacco use is also on the rise. We must address these threats to the health and well-being of our children. And the situation is worse than we think. 
As the most recent national drug strategy hints at and other studies confirm, we have been under reporting drug use for years. That means there are more addicts than we thought; there are more users than we thought. We need to keep this in mind as we talk about teen smoking. We cannot afford to leave a problem that kids say concerns them most out of our discussions. We cannot look young people in the face and tell them that we are doing all this on tobacco for their sake and ignore illegal drugs. This is a landmark opportunity to do both, and we owe it to our kids to do as much as we can. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on Saturday, April 18, 1998, an article ran in the Rochester Post Bulletin in Rochester, MN that illustrates very well the tremendous child care challenges facing families. This is a story about a child with disabilities and her parents who are having increasing problems finding quality child care. Mr. President, I will ask that this article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks. 
Mr. President, at the age of six months, this young child--Christina Barth--developed infantile spasms or epilepsy. Christina is not alone. More than two million Americans have some form of epilepsy. More than one fourth of them are children under the age of 18. 
Upon her diagnosis, Christina was treated with many different types of medication. Unfortunately, none of the treatments worked successfully. Then, at the age of three, Christina underwent a partial lobotomy on the right side of her brain. The surgery successfully treated her disease for almost two years. But then, the symptoms developed on the left side of her brain. Since that time, Christina has lived with epilepsy. 
Now Christina is 11 years old. She attends a special education class at Gage Elementary School. She functions on the cognitive level of an 18-month-old child. Her family hopes and prays that a cure for epilepsy will be found someday. 
Like most other families with special needs children, Christina's parents face daily challenges in caring for their child. Identifying high quality child care is among the most difficult challenges her parents face. 
Finding a child care provider--whether it be a commercial day care center or an in-home care giver--is becoming more and more difficult. This point was made by a witness who recently testified before the Finance Committee about the challenges of finding child care for a child with disabilities. 
Most child care providers tend not to enroll special needs children because often the child needs one-on-one care. And, the fear of the unknown presents an added risk to an already demanding job. 
In Christina's case, a state funded agency has helped her family locate an in-home care giver that cares for Christina while her parents are at work. 
But, Mr. President, access is only the first hurdle in finding child care. Quality is equally important. Unfortunately, in Christina's case, her child care providers have not been adequately trained to handle or even recognize when Christina has an epileptic attack. 
At one time, Mr. President, the agency that placed the providers with Christina called her parent's to warn them of an employee and told them to call the police if she came to their home. 
This raises a question Mr. President. Who is watching the watchers? 
Mr. President, in the national debate about child care it seems to me that not enough is being said about the challenges facing families with children who have disabilities. 
Child care policies must address issues of access and quality as it relates to special needs children. Many of the bills introduced this year do not address special needs issues. In fact, Senate bill 1610 asks for more than 20 billion dollars through fiscal year 2003 to improve the affordability of child care and an additional three billion dollars through fiscal year 2003 for enhancing the quality of child care and early childhood development. However, there are no provisions regarding an increase of availability, affordability, and quality Of child care for children with special needs. 
It is our duty, Mr. President, to make sure that these special needs children and their parents have the same opportunities as other children and families. Today I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure that children with special needs are not left out or forgotten in any legislation regarding child care that comes before this Congress.

This resolution tells the U.S. Trade Representative two things: The elimination of trade restrictions imposed on U.S. agriculture exports should be a top priority in any trade talks with the E.U. And no trade negotiations should occur, at all, if they will undermine our ability to eliminate these trade restrictions in the next round of ag talks at the World Trade Organization in 1999. 
Mr. President, on Monday the president announced in London that the United States and European Union will begin negotiating a new bilateral trade agreement. While I generally applaud any initiative to further reduce barriers to trade, I was dismayed to see agriculture included on the agenda in only a very narrow sense. The many outstanding trade barriers the Europeans have erected to our agriculture exports have been left off the bargaining table. 
Currently, the trade in agriculture between the U.S. and E.U. is very one-sided. The Europeans keep out our pork. They keep out our beef. They keep out our feed grains that are genetically modified. Their protectionist policies hurt our farmers. And the Europeans desperately want to keep these policies in place at the expense of our farmers. 
So it's understandable why the Europeans want to avoid discussions on agriculture. But I'm surprised the Clinton Administration is willing to move forward with this trade agreement and ignore all the problems we have in agriculture. They appear so anxious to move the trade agenda forward, perhaps to account for their inability to gain fast track authority, that I'm afraid the prospect for further liberalization of agriculture trade will be damaged in the process. 
In 1999, a new round of agriculture negotiations are to begin at the World Trade Organization. These negotiations will be critical to setting the rules for global ag trade for the next several years. It is a chance to build on what was begun in the Uruguay Round Agreement--which was the first major trade agreement to address agriculture tariffs, subsidies and nontariff trade barriers. 
The United States has much to gain in these talks. We have the most productive, efficient agriculture system in the world. Our farmers can compete with the farmers of any other country. So if trade barriers to ag exports are removed, our farmers will export more of their production, their income levels will rise, rural communities will prosper and the trade deficit will be reduced. 
The Europeans, on the other hand, fear open competition in agriculture. They continue to impose high barriers to U.S ag products and to heavily subsidize their own farmers. Many Europeans view the next round of talks as a threat to their agriculture industry. They would rather avoid the negotiations. 
So we must use all available leverage to gain concessions from the Europeans. But I'm afraid we will surrender some of our leverage in this new bilateral agreement. In other words, if we give away concessions now, we'll have less leverage when we turn to the ag talks in 1999. 
And that would give the Europeans, who don't want free trade in agriculture, the upper hand. And reduce the likelihood that agriculture trade barriers will be eliminated in the 1999 talks. That's what this resolution says. Do nothing that will weaken our negotiating position in 1999. 
But the resolution also says something else. It says make the elimination of restrictions on agriculture exports a top priority in any discussions with the European Union. To me, this is just common sense. 
The United States has a trade surplus in agriculture products. The rest of the world wants to buy the food and fiber our farmers produce. So there is no doubt that our farmers produce safe, wholesome, high-quality products. Yet the European Union does everything it can to keep these products out of their countries. Products sold all over the world are not allowed into the European Union. So doesn't it make sense that the U.S. would seek to negotiate to remove these trade barriers? 
But these barriers are not on the agenda for the upcoming trade negotiations. And I think that is wrong. I think it is unfair to our farmers. It tells them that their issues aren't important. We're just going to sweep them under the rug. And go on to negotiate other trade issues. 
Well, Mr. President, now the entire Senate is on record. The Senate has stated firmly: Our farmers deserve better. We will not stand by idly and let you ignore the problems of our farmers any longer. 
I hope the administration takes notice of our actions here today. And I hope they immediately press the European Union to put agriculture back on the bargaining table. 
Again I thank my colleagues for supporting this resolution.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wanted to make a few brief remarks on S. 2037, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which would implement the World Intellectual Property Organization treaties. The amendments adopted in Committee make some significant improvements to the original bill. For example, the bill now includes provisions clarifying educational institution and library liability and use exemptions, as well as provisions dealing with distance learning. The Committee also adopted provisions addressing concerns regarding pornography and privacy. Further, I worked with Senator Kyl to make sure that our law enforcement and intelligence people are able to carry out their duties in the best, and most effective, manner possible. 
It was important to me that the bill be clarified to ensure that parents are not prohibited from monitoring, or limiting access to, their children in regard to pornography and other indecent material on the Internet. I don't believe anyone wants to restrict parents' rights to take care of their children, or to take away tools that might be helpful for parents to ensure that their kids aren't accessing sites containing pornography. The interests of the copyright owners had to be balanced with the needs of consumers and families. I think that the Committee made a significant improvement to the bill in defense of this important protection for our families. 
Also, the Committee worked on changes which protect individuals' right to privacy on the Internet. I've heard concerns about software programs, probes, contaminants and `cookies,' and how they obtain personal and confidential information on Internet users and then convey it to companies for commercial purposes, sometimes without the users even knowing that this is happening. Even if users are aware a `cookie' or one of these other techniques has been sent to them, I think we'd all agree that Internet users should have a choice on whether to give up their personal information or not. While some argue that this is a non-issue because `cookies' and `cookie-cutting' do not violate the provisions of the bill, I've heard otherwise. In fact, I've heard about a case where a computer game company admitted that it surreptitiously collected personal information from users' computers when they were playing the game via the Internet. So I was not convinced that there did not need to be a clarification in the bill on this subject. The intent behind the bill is now clear that an Internet user can protect his or her privacy by disabling programs that transmit information on that user to other parties, or by utilizing software programs like `cookie-cutters' to do this. 
I'd also like to make a few remarks on the clarification Senator Kyl and I worked on dealing with the law enforcement exceptions in the bill. The changes Senator Kyl and I made substantially improve the bill's language by making it clear that the exceptions will protect officers, agents, employees, or contractors of, or other persons acting at the direction of, a law enforcement or intelligence agency of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, who are performing lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activities. Further, the bill's language was clarified to indicate that the exceptions also apply to officers, agents, employees, or contractors of, or other persons acting at the direction of, any element or division of an agency or department of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, which does not have law enforcement or intelligence as its primary function, when those individuals are performing lawfully authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activities. I'd like to note that the Committee report makes clear that these exceptions only apply when the individuals are performing these activities within the scope of their duties and in furtherance of lawfully authorized activities. Our law enforcement and intelligence people must have the opportunity and the tools to carry out their duties effectively. This language was crafted with the input and support of representatives from the law enforcement community, the Administration, as well as the content providers and other parties. I'd like to especially thank Senator Kyl and his fine staff for their hard work on this important clarification to the bill. 
I want to thank Senator Ashcroft and his staff for all the hard work and long hours they put into this difficult negotiations process to improve this bill. Their efforts in working for a balance of interests in the bill are to be commended. I'd also like to thank Chairman Hatch and Senator Leahy, and their staffs, for their hard work on the bill.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will help fight class action lawsuit abuses. This bill, which Senator Kohl and I are introducing today, will go a long way toward ending class action lawsuit abuses where the plaintiffs receive very little and their lawyers receive a whole lot. It will also preserve class action lawsuits as an important toll that bring representation to the unrepresented and result in important discrimination and consumer decisions. 
My Judiciary Subcommittee held a hearing last Fall that exposed and discussed the problem of certain class action lawsuit settlements. Let me give you an example of a class action lawsuit settlement that I find particularly disturbing. In an antitrust case settled in the Northern District of Illinois in 1993, the plaintiff class alleged that multiple domestic airlines participated in pricefixing beginning at least as early as January 1, 1988. This pricefixing resulted in plaintiffs paying more for airline tickets that they otherwise would have had to pay. 
The settlement in this case gave a coupon book to all of the plaintiffs. These coupons varied in amount and number, according to how many plane tickets the plaintiffs had purchased. These coupons can be used toward the purchase of future airline tickets. The catch is that the plaintiff still has to pay for the majority of any new airline ticket out of his or her own pocket. This means that only $10 worth of coupons can be used towards the purchase of a $100 dollar ticket; up to $25 worth of coupons can be used towards the purchase of a $250 ticket; up to $50 worth of coupons can be used towards the purchase of a $500 ticket, and so on. In addition, these coupons cannot be used on certain blackout dates, which seem to include all holidays and peak travel times. 
The attorneys, interestingly enough, did not get paid in coupons. The plaintiffs' attorneys got paid in cash. They got paid $16 million dollars in cash. If the coupons were good enough for their clients, I wonder why coupons were not good enough for the lawyers. 
Another egregious class action lawsuit settlement was discussed by one of the witnesses in my subcommittee hearing. Ms. Martha Preston was a member of the class in Hoffman versus BancBoston, where some of the plaintiffs received under $10 dollars each in compensation for their injuries, yet were docked around $75 or $90 for attorneys' fees. This means that attorneys that they had never met, who were supposed to be representing their best interests, agreed to a settlement that cost some of the plaintiffs more money than they received in compensation for being wronged. 
These lawsuit abuses happen for a number of reasons. One reason is that plaintiffs' lawyers negotiate their own fees as part of the settlement. This can result in distracting lawyers from focussing on their clients' needs, and settling or refusing to settle based on the amount of their own compensation. 
During our hearing, evidence was presented that at least one group of plaintiffs' lawyers meets 
regularly to discuss initiating class action lawsuits. They scan the Federal Register and other publications to get ideas for lawsuits, and only after they have identified the wrong, do they find clients for their lawsuits. Rather than having clients complaining of harms, they find harms first, and then recruit clients with the promise of compensation. 
The defendants are not always innocent, though. Plaintiffs' lawyers say that they are approached by lawyers from large corporations who urge them to find a class and sue the corporation. The corporations may use this as a tool to limit their liability. Once this suit is initiated and settled, no member of the class may sue based on that claim. In other words, if a corporation settles a class action lawsuit by paying all class members $10 as compensation for a faulty car door latch, the plaintiffs can no longer sue for any harm caused by the faulty door latch. this is one way of buying immunity for liability. 
The Preliminary Results of the Rand Study of Class Action Litigation states that, `It is generally agreed that fees drive plaintiffs' attorneys' filing behavior, that defendants' risk aversion in the face of large aggregate exposures drives their settlement behavior. . . . In other words, the problems with class actions flow from incentives that are embedded in the process itself.' 
The Glassley/Kohl Class Action Fairness Act does the following:

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1244, The Religious Liberty and Charitable Donation Protection Act, which I introduced in October of last year. 
When I held hearings on this bill before my subcommittee, I learned that churches and charities around the country are experiencing a spate of lawsuits by bankruptcy trustees trying to undo tithes or charitable donations. Under provisions of the Bankruptcy Code originally designed to fight fraudulent transfers of assets or money on the eve of bankruptcy, bankruptcy trustees have begun to sue churches when one of their parishioners declares bankruptcy, charging that tithes are fraud. 
Of course, this puts the fiscal health of many churches at serious risk. Most churches and charities don't have big bank accounts. Having to pay back money that has been received and already spent is a real hardship for churches which often live on a shoe-string budget. S. 1244 will protect against that. 
Protecting churches and charities from baseless bankruptcy lawsuits will protect key players in the delivery of services to the poor. What do churches do with tithes? What do charities do with contributions? 
They feed the poor with soup kitchens. They collect used clothing and help provide shelter for the homeless. And they do it with a minimal amount of Government assistance. In this day and age, where Congress is seeking to trim the Federal Government to its appropriately limited role, we must protect the important work of churches and charities. Mr. President, S. 1244 is a giant step in that direction. 
This bill doesn't amend Section 548(A)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. This means that any transfer of assets on the eve of bankruptcy which is intended to hinder, delay or defraud anyone is still prohibited. Only genuine charitable contributions and tithes are protected by S. 1244. Accordingly, a transfer of assets which looks like a tithe or a charitable donation, but which is actually fraud, can still be set aside. For example, if someone who is about to declare bankruptcy gives away all of his assets in donations of less than 15 percent of his income, that would be strong evidence of real fraud and real fraud can't be tolerated. 
Mr. President, my legislation also permits debtors in chapter 13 repayment plans to tithe during the course of their repayment plan. Under current law, people who declare bankruptcy under chapter 13 must show that they are using all of their disposable income to repay their creditors. The term disposable income has been interpreted by the courts to allow debtors to have a reasonable entertainment budget during their repayment period. But these same courts won't let people tithe. So, a debtor could budget money for movies or meals at restaurants, but they couldn't use that same money to tithe to their church. This is a direct and outrageous assault on religious freedom. And I think it's quite clearly contrary to Congress' intent in enacting chapter 13. I doubt anyone would have supported the idea that debtors could pay money 
 to a gambling casino for entertainment but could not give the same money to a church as a tithe. 
Mr. President, S. 1244 is necessary at this time because the Supreme Court struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as unconstitutional last summer. A badly-divided panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has recently ruled that RFRA protects tithes, even after the Supreme Court case. But that decision is being appealed to the Supreme Court. No matter what the Court does, we need to pass this bill now, and to subject churches to uncertainty and harassment by bankruptcy trustees. 
Mr. President, I think it's important to remember that my bill protects donations to churches as well as other types of nonprofit charities. I did this because many well-respected constitutional scholars believe that protecting only religiously-motivated donations from the reach of the Bankruptcy Code would violate the establishment clause of the first amendment.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to close on this note. When I chaired a hearing on tithing and bankruptcy before my subcommittee late last year, I heard from the pastor of Crystal Free Evangelical Church. This church is the one fighting right now in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals to keep the bankruptcy court out of its church coffers. Pastor Goold testified in a very compelling way about the practical difficulties his church has faced because of the Bankruptcy Code. As Pastor Goold put it, when there's a conflict between the bankruptcy laws and the laws of God, we should change the bankruptcy laws because God's laws aren't going to change. 
Whether someone believes in tithing or not, it's clear that many Americans feel that tithing is an act of worship, required by divine law. It's completely unacceptable to have the bankruptcy code undo an act of worship. 
Exhibit 1 UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN, 
School of Law, Austin, TX, May 6, 1998. 
Hon. Charles E. Grassley, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator Grassley: The question has arisen whether S. 1244 and H.R. 2604 would protect unincorporated churches. The answer is yes; unincorporated churches would be protected. 
These bills protect organizations defined in 170(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, which includes any `corporation, trust, or community chest, fund, or foundation' organized and operated exclusively for charitable, religious, or other listed purposes. The Internal Revenue Code defines `corporation' to include an `association.' 26 U.S.C. Sec. 7701(a)(3). An unincorporated association may also be a `fund.' 
The language of 170(c)(2) dates to shortly after World War I. Related sections drafted more recently use the word `organization,' which more obviously includes unincorporated associations. See, e.g., Sec. 170b and 502-511. The implementing regulations under 170 and 501(c)(3) also used the word `organization.' 26 C.F.R. 1.170 and 1.501. `Organization' does not appear to be a defined term. But Treasury Regulations define `articles of organization' in inclusive terms: `The term articles of organization or articles includes the trust instrument, the corporate charter, the articles of association, or any other written instrument by which an organization is created.' 26 C.F.R. 1.501(c)(3)(b)(2) (emphasis added) `Articles of association' clearly seems designed to include unincorporated associations. 
The clearest statement from the Internal Revenue Service appears to be Revenue Procedure 82-2 (attached), which sets out certain rules for different categories of tax exempt organizations. Section 3.04 provides a rule for `Unincorporated Nonprofit Associations.' This Procedure treats the question as utterly settled and noncontroversial. 
Tax scholars agree that 170 includes unincorporated associations. The conclusion appears to be so universally accepted that there has been no litigation and no need to elaborate the explanation. The leading treatise on tax-exempt organizations states: `An unincorporated association or trust can qualify under this provision, presumably as a fund or foundation or perhaps, as noted, as a corporation.' Bruce R. Hopkins, The Law of Tax-Exempt Organizations Sec. 4.1 at 52 (7th ed. 1997). 
Borris Bittker of Yale and Lawrence Lokken of NYU says: `Since the term corporation includes associations and fund or foundation as used in IRC 501(c)(3) is construed to include trusts, the technical form in which a charitable organization is clothed rarely results in disqualification.' Boris I. Bittker & Lawrence Lokken, 4 Federal Taxation of Income, Estates and Gifts 100.1.2 at 100-6 (2d ed. 1989). 
Closely related provisions of the Code expressly cover churches. I.R.C. 170(b)(1) states special rules for a subset of organizations defined in Sec. 170(c), including `a church, or a convention or association of churches.' I.R.C. 508(c)(1) provides that `churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches' do not have to apply for tax exemption. These provisions plainly contemplate that churches are covered; they also prevent the accumulation of IRS decisions granting tax exempt status to unincorporated churches. These churches are simply presumed to be exempt. 
There are tens of thousands of unincorporated churches in America. I am not aware that any of these churches has ever had difficulty with tax exemption or tax deductibility of contributions because of their unincorporated status. I work with many church lawyers and religious leaders, and none of them has ever mentioned such a problem. There are no reported cases indicating litigation over such a problem. If unincorporated churches were having this problem, Congress would have heard demands for constituent help or corrective legislation. 
The fact is that legitimate unincorporated churches that otherwise qualify for tax deductibility under 170 and for tax exemption under Sec. 501(c)(3) are not rendered ineligible by their failure to incorporate. There is so little doubt about that that neither Congress, the IRS, nor the courts has ever had to expressly elaborate on the rule that everyone knows. This is a question that can be safely dealt with in legislative history affirming Congress's understanding that unincorporated associations are included in 170(c)(2) and Congress's intention that they be protected by these bills. 
I consulted informally with Deirdre Halloran, the expert on tax exempt organizations at the United States Catholic Conference, and with tax professors here and elsewhere, who confirmed these conclusions. Ms. Halloran would be happy to respond to inquiries from your office if you need a second opinion. 
Very truly yours, Douglas Laycock.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act of 1998. This bill gives farmers another tool to manage the risk of price and income fluctuations inherent in agriculture. It does this by encouraging farmers to save some of their income during good years and allowing the funds to supplement income during bad years. This new tool will more fully equip family farmers to deal with the vagaries of the marketplace. 
Farming is a unique sector of the American economy. Although agriculture represents one-sixth of our Gross Domestic Product, it consists of hundreds of thousands of farmers across the nation. Many of whom operate small, family farms. These farms often support entire families, and even several generations of a family. And they work hard every day and produce the food consumed by the rest of the country, and around the world as well. 
Yet farming remains one of the most perilous ways to make a living. The income of a farm family depends, in large part, on factors outside its control. Weather is one of those factors. For instance, I have heard on the Senate floor recently that the income of North Dakota farmers dropped 98% last year because of flooding. Weather can totally wipe out a farmer. And, at best, weather can cause farmers' income to fluctuate wildly. 
Another factor is the uncertainty of international markets. Iowa farmers now export 40% of all they produce. But what happens when European countries impose trade barriers on beef, pork and genetically-modified feed grain, as examples. And what happens when Asian governments devalue their currencies. Exports fall and farm income declines. Through no fault of the farmer, but because of decisions made in foreign countries. 
Mr. President, the 1996 farm bill took planting decisions out of the hands of government bureaucrats and put them back into the hands of farmers. Farmers now have the ability to plant according to the demands of the market. The farmers I talk to are pleased with this change in philosophy. They would rather make their own decisions and rely on the market for their income, instead of the government. 
But the sometimes volatile nature of commodity markets can make it difficult for family farmers to survive even a normal business cycle. When prices are high, farmers often pay so much of their income in taxes that they are unable to save anything. When prices drop again, farmers can be faced with liquidity problems. This bill allows farmers to manage their income, to smooth out the highs and lows of the commodity markets. 
In that way, this bill is complementary with the philosophy of the new farm program. Business decisions are left in the hands of farmers, not bureaucrats at the Department of Agriculture, and not elected officials. The farmer decides whether to defer his income for later years. The farmer decides when to withdraw funds to supplement his operation. 
Mr. President, I will take just a moment to explain how the bill works. Eligible farmers are allowed to make contributions to tax-deferred accounts, also known as FARRM accounts. The contributions are tax-deductible and limited to 20% of the farmer's taxable income for the year. The contributions are invested in cash or other interest-bearing obligations. The interest is taxed during the year it is earned. 
The funds can stay in the account for up to five years. Upon withdrawal, the funds are taxed as regular income. If the funds are not withdrawn after five years, they are taxed as income and subject to an additional 10% penalty. 
Essentially, the farmer is given a five-year window to manage his money in a way that is best for his own operation. The farmer can contribute to the account in good years and withdraw from the account when his income is low. 
This bill helps the farmer help himself. It is not a new government subsidy for agriculture. It will not create a new bureaucracy purporting to help farmers. The bill simply provides farmers with a fighting chance to survive the down times and an opportunity to succeed when prices eventually increase. 
Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this bill, especially Senator Baucus, the lead Democratic cosponsor. I look forward to working with him on the Finance Committee to ensure passage of this important effort for our farmers.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Dodd in submitting a common-sense Senate resolution to raise public awareness of the need for all Americans to plan ahead for their long-term care needs. 
Earlier this year, the Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, held a hearing to explore the challenges of providing long-term care for the baby boomer generation. A key message from that hearing was that policy makers need to encourage personal responsibility for financing long-term care. 
It is difficult to pay for long-term care even when one has worked hard and saved for retirement. It's impossible when a family is not prepared. Unfortunately, many seniors and their families find out too late that they have not saved enough. Today's average cost of nursing home care is about $40,000 a year. When individuals are faced with a chronic or disabling condition in retirement, they often quickly exhaust their resources. As a result, these individuals turn to Medicaid for help. In fact, the care for nearly 2 out of every 3 nursing home residents is paid for by Medicaid. 
As policy makers, our job is to develop policies for public programs that can deliver efficient and cost-effective services. Yet, equally important is the role of private long-term care financing. We must inform everyone about the importance of planning for potential long-term care needs. And, we must provide incentives now for the baby boomer generation to prepare financially for their retirement. 
As Congress works to prepare for a growing demand for long-term care services, the role of private long-term care insurance must not be ignored. Over the past ten years, the long-term care insurance market has grown significantly. The products that are available today are affordable and of high quality. 
This common-sense proposal has also been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congress Shays where it has received strong bi-partisan support. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to so-sponsor this worthwhile proposal. And, I look forward to the passage of this resolution this year.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the first amendment that I am offering today will simply place a counsel--a lawyer--in the National Taxpayer Advocate's office. 
The purpose of doing this is to give the Taxpayer Advocate ready access to legal opinions and legal judgments, Currently, the Taxpayer Advocate must put requests into the Office of Chief Counsel. 
In order to make the Taxpayer Advocate more independent, which is what this bill does, it logically follows that the Taxpayer Advocate should have its own legal counsel. This will guarantee it fast, confidential legal advice to help those taxpayers in greatest need. Because it is the taxpayers in greatest need who go to the Taxpayer Advocate. 
The second amendment should not be controversial. It applies only to Iowa. It is only a pilot project. We created an identical pilot project in Montana last year. A nationwide project like this was recommended by the IRS Restructuring Commission. My amendment is only a pilot program and it is only for Iowa. 
This project would simplify reporting for some Iowa businesses. It would give a try to a program that would allow them to report taxes on one form. This gives businesses more time to conduct business, and spend less time on paperwork. 
Mr. President, these amendments have been cleared by the other side, and I ask that they be adopted by consent.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced Senate Bill 2031, the Home Health Integrity Preservation Act of 1998. I am pleased that Senator Breaux cosponsored this bill. This legislation will be an important tool in combating the waste, fraud and abuse that has threatened the integrity of the Medicare home health benefit. 
Although the majority of home health agencies are honest, legitimate, businesses, it is clear that there have been unscrupulous providers. Last July, the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, held a hearing on this topic. The hearing exposed serious rip-offs of the Medicare trust fund, and highlighted areas that need more stringent oversight. 
In response to the hearing, Senator Breaux and I followed up with a roundtable discussion on home health fraud. The roundtable brought together key players with a variety of perspectives. Participants included law enforcement, the Administration, and the home health industry. 
The roundtable yielded a number of proposals which were shaped into draft legislation and circulated to a wide variety of stakeholders. In response to comments, the draft was changed to address legitimate concerns that were raised. The result is a balanced piece of legislation that includes important safeguards against fraud and abuse of the system, but does not stifle the growth of legitimate providers. 
The Home Health Integrity Preservation Act of 1998 would do the following: It would modify the surety bond requirement in the BBA so that only new agencies need to obtain surety bonds. Because HCFA's surety bond rule goes far beyond Congress's intention to keep bad providers from entering Medicare, many existing agencies with no history of fraud have been unable to obtain bonds. This provision would force HCFA to return to Congress's original intention. It also reduces the amount of the bond needed to $25,000. 
It would heighten scrutiny of new home health agencies before they enter the Medicare program, and during their early years of Medicare participation. 
It would improve standards and screening for home health agencies, administrators and employees. 
It would require audits of home health agencies whose claims exhibit unusual features that may indicate problems, and improve HCFA's ability to identify such features. 
It would require agencies to adopt and implement fraud and abuse compliance programs. 
It would increase scrutiny of branch offices, business entities related to home health agencies, and changes in operations. 
It would make more information on particular home health agencies available to beneficiaries. 
It would create an interagency Home Health Integrity Task Force, led by the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services. 
It would reform bankruptcy rules to make it harder for all Medicare providers, not just home health agencies, to avoid penalties and repayment obligations by declaring bankruptcy. 
This legislation is an important step in ensuring that seniors maintain access to high quality home care services rendered by reputable providers. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort by cosponsoring this important legislation.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, based on recent remarks by the President, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. If the story as reported is true, it is an unfortunate commentary. In a recent meeting with religious leaders, Mr. Clinton asked them to withdraw their support for a legislative effort to hold countries to account that engage in religious persecution. Mr. Clinton, it seems, does not like legislation that imposes sanctions. Well, that's not precisely right. What he does not like is sanctions that he didn't think of. When he wants sanctions on Iraq, for example, he is all for sanctions. But when it comes to other issues he cares less about, well, suddenly he finds them unwelcome. 
What are some of these? Well, he doesn't like mandatory sanctions for violations of human rights. He objects to sanctions to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. He is not partial to sanctions on countries that persecute people for their religious beliefs. And he finds the idea of sanctions on countries that do not do enough to stop the traffic of illegal drugs to the United States burdensome. In a flight of candor with the religious leaders, he allows as how it is difficult to be honest in assessing another country's behavior if sanctions might be involved. `What always happens,' he says, `if you have automatic sanctions legislation is it puts pressure on whoever is in the executive branch to fudge an evaluation of the facts of what is going on.' 
That is refreshingly frank. It is also disturbing. When I look up `fudge' in the dictionary, this is what it tells me the word means: to fake; to falsify; to exceed the proper bounds or limits of something; to fail to perform as expected; to avoid commitment. 
If I am to believe these remarks, what the President is saying is that his Administration finds it necessary to falsify the facts; to avoid commitment; to fake information. His Administration finds it difficult to be honest when it comes to telling the Congress and the public what other countries are doing on critical issues. I guess the question we need to ask now is, what is the fudge factor in the various reports this Administration has submitted on these issues? We need to know this for past reports. And we need to know what this factor is in order to properly evaluate future assessments. 
The reason we need to know this is for what the President's comments suggest. If we believe this report, the President is telling us that his Administration finds it necessary to be less than candid when it comes to enforcing the law. Now, I know that many Administrations do not like the idea that Congress also has foreign policy responsibilities. Many Administrations have fought against sanctions for this or that issue they did not think of. 
They have also fought for sanctions when it was their idea. What is of concern here is the admission that this Administration fights shy of telling the truth in situations where it does not approve of the sanctions. It fudges the facts, presumably, even though the President has the discretion, in law, to waive any sanctions for national security reasons. This then is a candid admission that it enforces the laws it likes and fudges those it does not. I find this disturbing. 
Perhaps the Administration could explain just why it needs to fudge the facts on drug certification, for example. What drug certification requires is that the President assess what other countries are doing to help stop the production and traffic of illegal drugs. This means assessing what they are doing to comply with international law. To make a judgment about what they are doing to live up to bilateral agreements with the United States. 
And to account for what these countries are doing to comply with their own laws. The certification law gives the President considerable flexibility in determining whether these activities meet some minimally acceptable standards. He is not required to impose sanctions unless he determines, based on the facts, that a country is not living up to reasonable standards. And he can waive any sanctions. This gives the Administration a great deal of latitude. I have defended this flexibility. I have argued that just because the Congress and the Administration disagree, honestly, over an assessment, it does not mean that the facts are not honest. Or that the judgment is dishonest. But these recent remarks open up another concern. If the facts are fudged, however, just how are we to determine what to make of the judgment that follows? 
And what is the occasion for employing the fudge factor? What is it being avoided or dodged? What the certification law and many of these others that require sanctions ask for is not terribly complicated or outlandish. They express the expectation of the Congress and of the American public that countries live up to certain responsibilities. And more, that failure to do so involves consequences. This is, after all, the expectation of law and of behavior in a community of civilized nations. The want of such standards or the lack of consequences reduces the chances for serious compliance with international law or the rules of common decency. Are we really to believe that respect for these standards and consequences are to be discarded because their application is inconvenient? Because they reduce some notion of flexibility? That we only have to enforce or observe the laws we like? What a principle. 
I for one do not intend to live by such a notion. I will also from now on be far more interested in knowing just what the fudge factor is in assessments from the Administration. I hope my colleagues will also be more demanding.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I, unfortunately, oppose the amendment by the Senator from Missouri. I say `unfortunately' because the Senator from Missouri has good motives in offering his amendment. They come from the fact that he has been an outspoken advocate for small business in the Senate. He has made a career of promoting an environment very good to small business, and obviously we all know that sometimes the Internal Revenue Service is one Government agency that tends to be anti-small business. We had a lot of information coming out of our hearings that IRS agents are told to go after the small people--forget about the bigger, wealthier people--because smaller people do not have the resources to fight. 
That is particularly true of small business where you have accumulated some wealth in a small business but you do not necessarily have a lot of income. And so you do not have the resources to fight the IRS. So I do not find fault with the motives behind what Senator Bond is trying to do. 
I definitely believe this bill we have before us, including the provisions for an advisory board, has been well thought out. The National Commission on the Restructuring of the IRS created the concept of this Board. We assessed the various pros and cons of separating the IRS from the supervision of the Secretary of the Treasury and making it more independent. We decided that it needed more independence. Next, we had to decide how the independent operation should be governed. To answer this, we came up with the Oversight Board. 
So I thank Senator Bond for his advocacy for small business and his concern about this important legislation. But at the same time I think I must rise in opposition to this amendment. The Commission came up with this idea of having an oversight board for the IRS after months and months of discussion and consideration. It was a recommendation that we on the Commission put in our report because we thought it would keep the IRS on track and improving in the right direction. The Senator from Nebraska and I made this board one of the centerpieces of our legislation, S. 1096, which, of course, was the first comprehensive IRS reform legislation 
introduced in the Senate. 
The National Commission on Restructuring of the IRS--Senator Kerrey and I, two members of the House of Representatives, and 13 other people served on this Commission. Ten of the members were nongovernmental, private sector people who knew about the problems that the private sector was having with the IRS. We fully considered adopting a full-time oversight board at one time, but we came to the conclusion that it was not an advisable thing to do. We decided that this part-time board would be more effective, and I will give you the reasons for that. 
First of all, the purpose of the board is to be advisory, not to manage the IRS. It is meant to function like a corporation's board of directors. It is not intended to get involved in the day-to-day operations of the IRS because the IRS already has a leader--the commissioner. And by the way, this is the first nonlawyer and more specifically nontax lawyer who has been head of the IRS. Mr. Rossotti, or somebody with his background from private sector management, brings to the management of the IRS a person who is consumer oriented, customer oriented. His own private sector corporation had to satisfy his consuming public for the services that he sold or he would not have been in business. He would not have developed a successful business. So to have a nontax attorney for the first time running the IRS is very, very good because it brings somebody in there who knows that organization ought to serve the taxpayers and not be a master of the taxpayers. He has already led the organization in some important changes and I have great confidence that he will continue to make productive changes. He will do a better job because of this legislation. 
In addition, it seems to me that a full-time board would not attract the people who we want to attract to this board. A full-time board too often in this town attracts inside-the-beltway, Washington career people. That is not the type of person we want on the board. 
What the IRS needs is guidance from people who come from the real world of work, people outside the beltway, people who are real Americans. It needs experts in business, management and customer service. It needs people who are willing to take the time in the name of public service to help guide the IRS, through this recovery period it is now in. The IRS does not need people who consider the full-time job of being on the IRS board a good career move. The fact is the people we want to serve on this board will not give up their full-time jobs to do it. 
This bill is not intended to create more bureaucracy. We have too much bureaucracy already. This is generally true throughout Government. But we found it is definitely the case in the IRS. A full-time board would just be one more layer in an organization with way too many layers of bureaucracy already. For these reasons, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment. If we want the IRS to be customer friendly, like a corporation must be, we must give it a corporate-like board. 
I thank the Chair. I yield back the remainder of my time to be reserved.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the point that the Senator from Alabama just raised. That point would be one of agreement. It would be to say that I have had the experience myself of having to get corrective legislation through. People would be surprised to know that a certain tax law that was in place legally for a long period of time was changed by a faceless bureaucrat, who increased the revenue and taxed somebody in a way where they hadn't been taxed before. And then we have a situation where those of us who want to correct what this faceless bureaucrat did find ourselves not only getting the bill written, finding all of the cosponsors that one needs, but also, then, when you actually get to the point of offering the amendment, you have to come up with an offset because there is supposedly a cost, not from the original legislation, but because some faceless bureaucrat is reinterpreting a tax law, which reinterpretation brings more revenue in; and then, if we want to go back to where Congress originally was, we have to dig up revenue and have an offset to correct something that Congress never intended in the first place. 
So you can see that what the Senator from Alabama is trying to do is just to bring a little common sense to the Washington nonsense. I applaud him for doing it and also applaud him for not doing it on this bill. I commit myself to working with him. I would like to, at this point, ask him to see that I am added as a cosponsor to the original bill he put in, which has a number already.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are just talking about common sense. In other words, Congress passes a law. We want to tax at a certain level and a certain group of people. A lot of times those laws have been in place for a long period of time. Congressional intent was followed for a long period of time. And then there is somebody sitting in some bureaucracy--in this case, the Treasury Department--that says, oh, no, that 
is not what Congress intended; this is what they intended. Then he changes it. We don't have a process for reviewing that. This legislation will give a process for that review. But we will not find ourselves in a position of having to correct something that is contrary to congressional intent, but also with the idiotic situation that we somehow have to come up with revenue to offset a change of policy that we never intended in the first place. 
So I applaud the Senator and thank him for not bringing it up at this point. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I find myself this afternoon speaking against a lot of my friends with whom I generally agree most of the time, and so I am somewhat chagrined that I have to oppose my good friend from Alabama and the position he has just taken as he spoke in favor of the Thompson amendment. I rise in opposition to it. 
This amendment is not about conflict of interest laws. That is not its intent. It is about having an employee representative serve on the oversight board. I believe very strongly that we must have the employee representative on this oversight board. As you have already heard Senator Kerrey say, he agrees with that. We both had the honor of serving on this National Commission on the Restructuring of the IRS. We were the only two Senators to do so. I think our year's experience there taught us something, and that is the value of having people who speak for and work with the employees, other than in a management capacity, to show their good intent, that they want Government to function in an efficient manner and to serve the customers well. 
That would be true of Rob Tobias, who is the current President of the National Treasury Employees Union. He served with us on this Commission. I was very impressed with him and with his work. With his hard work and support, the Commission, by a very strong majority--we probably would have had a 
majority otherwise, but such a slim majority that I don't feel we would be here with such a strong piece of legislation as we do now--issued a report that calls for far-reaching reforms at the IRS. The employees organization and their representative contributed substantially to this report and to making sure there were strong, substantive recommendations. 
I believe that he or another employee representative will have the same effect while serving on the IRS Oversight Board. He and the members of his organization want real change at the IRS. The IRS employees care about where they work and how they serve the people. They want the IRS to run smoothly and their customers to be happy with the service they receive. They are caught up today in this culture of intimidation, a culture that says, `We don't care anything about the taxpayers, we don't care how we treat the taxpayers,' whether as a taxpayer or just as an American citizen who is doing business with them. I believe they want to take pride in where they work and the actions of the Internal Revenue Service. The employee representative will help ensure that the oversight board makes this happen. 
For this reason, Senator Kerrey and I included an employee representative on the IRS Oversight Board when we introduced the first IRS restructuring bill last July, S. 1096. For this reason, we offered the amendment that put the employee representative back on the oversight board during the Finance Committee debate because the chairman's mark did not have this in it. 
Now, remember, the House of Representatives passed their bill by a vote of 426 to 4--426 to 4--and that bill in the House had an employee representative serving on the oversight board. We have strong support for this principle. If we are going to have an employee representative then on the oversight board, we need to let him do more than just serve the coffee while the meetings are going on, because if we do not have this language in the bill that the Thompson amendment wants to take out, he would not have the same power that we give to other members of that oversight board. Otherwise, we lose the benefit of that expertise. Otherwise, we lose the benefit of the enthusiasm of the organization and its representative to make real change at the Internal Revenue Service. Let me say, in short, otherwise, we are just simply wasting our time. This is a part-time advisory board. Consequently, it is a good place to use his advice. 
The bill before us, as drafted, sets up additional requirements that the employee representative must meet. I would like to read from the committee report. 
The employee representative is subject to the same public financial disclosure rules as a private life board member. In addition, the employee organization is required to provide an annual financial report with the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. Such report is required to include the compensation paid to the individual employee by the employee organization and membership dues collected by that organization. 
In addition, this person must have been confirmed by the Senate of the United States before serving on the IRS Oversight Board. These laws have been waived for similar purposes before. This is not new; it is not landmark. The point being made-- that everybody should abide by the same laws--albeit true, but remember, as Senator Kerrey said, we make those laws. We are making this policy to make this person an effective member of the IRS Oversight Board. 
I conclude by saying that the conflict of interest laws are designed to alleviate hidden conflicts of interest. Now, this employee representative has no hidden agenda. We know who he works for. And guess what. The employee representative on the board works for an organization that represents employees. 
Again, the issue is not waiver of laws. The issue is having an employee representative being able to serve, and effectively serve, on the oversight board. This, of course, is a back-door way, if this amendment were to be adopted, to get rid of the employee representative. Or, if he wasn't gotten rid of, it would be making him an ineffective member of the oversight board, gutting the main intent that we have of his inclusion on the board, because we think there can be a contribution, a real contribution, made. 
So, in my opinion, if my colleagues would accept my year's work on this issue, being a member of this IRS Restructuring Commission, I ask my colleagues to vote against the Thompson amendment. After my work on the National Commission on Restructuring, I think, regarding the bill we have, and even a much stronger bill that we have now because of the work of the Senator from Delaware on the legislation, improving it very much as a result of the committee hearings, we need to move forward. This would really cause problems if this person is not able to serve on this board. 
So I emphasize again, this was in the House Ways and Means bill. It was approved by the House of Representatives by 426 to 4, to have an employee representative on the board. 
I think all the arguments are very strong. I make no apologies for those arguments and would want to have this amendment defeated, the Thompson amendment. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are here today in the second day of debate on this legislation to discuss a very important issue, and that is the restructuring of the Internal Revenue Service. As my colleagues know, I have worked very hard on this issue--serving on the National Commission on Restructuring of the IRS and joining Senator Kerrey of Nebraska in introducing the first piece of comprehensive legislation that would comprehensively restructure the IRS. In addition, Senators Reid, Kerrey and I introduced the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights III earlier this year. 
There are real problems in dealing with the IRS, and there are real problems at that agency, as shown in the Senate Finance Committee hearings--which were so ably chaired by Senator Roth from Delaware, the chairman of that committee--and not only the recent ones which were probably the most shocking, but also starting last September with hearings that brought out horror stories. 
These hearings about the horror stories were about our Government's treatment of taxpayers. Every time I go home I hear from constituents who tell me about their firsthand experiences with the IRS. Rarely are they good. For this reason, it is not good enough to just try. We have to succeed in this reform. 
I would like to tell you what I learned about this issue in the Restructuring Commission's hearings and deliberations that took place during the fall of 1996 carrying over to the first 9 months of 1997, at these hearings and our deliberations there--but also, as I have already alluded to, the Finance Committee hearings which also were a very good basis for this legislation. Then we have all had some of our own studies of this issue as well. This is what I have learned: The IRS routinely abuses taxpayers, and the rules the IRS lives by are unfair to the taxpayers and not according to the rule of law. 
The structure of the IRS was not set up with its consumer, the taxpayer, in mind. The IRS functions without accountability. The IRS agents are not held accountable for their acts. This breeds a culture of abuse and a culture of coverup, and this is where we stand today. We have a chance to fix this culture. We have one chance to enact real, solid, IRS reform. We in the Senate are supposed to be in the business of improving people's lives. We must pass real, solid and lasting IRS reform. We must set up a system that makes the IRS accountable for its actions, and then we in the Congress, who have constitutional responsibilities of oversight, have, over the next several months, with intensity, but on an ongoing basis, a responsibility to make sure that we continue the oversight work that has been done. We bear some responsibility in the Congress for an out-of-control agency. But I think with proper congressional oversight we will make sure that this does not happen again. 
This legislation before us now makes many strides towards fixing the IRS. For starters, it strengthens oversight of the IRS. It creates an IRS Oversight Board. This Board will be 
 made up of nine individuals who will oversee the administration, the management, the conduct, the direction and even the budget of the IRS. The IRS Commissioner and a representative of the National Taxpayers Employees Union will also serve on this Board. The union representative is especially important. Our IRS Restructuring Commission had a union representative on it. Bob Tobias, the president of the NTEU, was instrumental in the Commission's work. The Commission would not have made recommendations for such strong reforms and made them by such a strong majority if it were not for his involvement. Working with him, I learned that the union also wants strong reforms within the IRS. 
Another important provision of this bill that increases IRS oversight is the creation of a new Treasury Inspector General who will be devoted exclusively to IRS matters. This office will have all the powers and authority granted under the Inspector General Act, resources dedicated specifically and only to the IRS oversight, and independence from being in the Treasury Department rather than being at the IRS. 
This bill also takes an important step in helping Congress' oversight efforts and in making sure that the public and press can assist us in these efforts. This bill requires a new Inspector General for Tax Administration to randomly audit 1 percent of all IRS documents that the IRS redacts before it releases those documents. In our Restructuring Commission hearings we learned that the IRS uses its privacy privilege to hide its own wrongdoing from us in the Congress and, hence, from the public and also from the press. This is illegal, but more important it is deceitful. This bill requires that a small percentage of documents be audited to ensure that the IRS can't hide behind laws designed to protect the taxpayers. 
These provisions, although great, are still not enough. In addition, Congress must continue its diligent oversight efforts. The IRS is important to us now, but will it be important to us even 5 years from now? Or will we be focused on another issue of the day then? We need to commit to have strong, thorough oversight hearings on an ongoing basis. 
This bill also gives taxpayers important new rights. It helps taxpayers know their rights and to navigate the tax collection system. I believe that Americans are smart people. If you give Americans enough information, and if you treat Americans fairly, they can usually take care of themselves. 
This bill empowers taxpayers with important new rights and puts the taxpayers on a more equal footing with the IRS. I say a more equal footing. I think it would be intellectually dishonest for me to say with the passage of this legislation that we have totally leveled the playing field, which the taxpayers ought to expect and which I hope I am surprised some day and I can say that we have, but I don't want to categorically say that today. 
This bill also has innocent spouse reforms so that innocent spouses are treated exactly as they are, and that is they are innocent. 
This bill limits the seizure authority of the IRS. It allows taxpayers to sue the IRS if its agents are negligent in violating the code and the constitutional rights of our citizens. It prohibits the IRS from contacting third parties without prior notification to the taxpayer. It requires that the IRS exhaust all collection options, including installment agreements, before seizing a business or a principal place of residence. 
I could go on and on, but the point is that the bill before us is strong, comprehensive reform. This bill is stronger than its House-passed companion, and we can all thank Chairman Roth and the Finance Committee generally--but without his leadership, it would not have happened--for making this strong, because we do need to pass this legislation. We need to insist that the conference report be equally as strong. And then we need to get it on the President's desk as soon as possible. 
The American people deserve to be treated with respect, especially by their own Government. The American people deserve this bill, and the American people deserve to be represented by Senators who have the courage and foresight to not only enact this legislation, but after it is enacted, to see, through the constitutional responsibilities of oversight, that it is actually carried out. 
When this legislation is passed, I want to be able to say to the American people, `We're on the road to eliminating the culture of intimidation within that agency.' I want to be able to say to the American people, `On April 15th next that you're treated by the IRS with the same courtesy, with the same accurate information and with the same timely response that they expect out of you, the taxpayer, on April the 15th.' 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to talk about `pay and chase' today. `Pay and chase' is a Pentagon term used to describe another misguided policy. With pay and chase, the Pentagon pays the bills first and then tries to track down the receipts later on. Sometimes they find them; sometimes they don't And sometimes, they don't even bother to look. This is not a good policy. It is un-businesslike, and it's dangerous. 
Under current law, payment is not due until a valid receipt is in hand. A certified receipt tells you that the goods and services have in fact been delivered. 
So, to me, pay and chase is a mystery. Why, Mr. President, would anyone--in or out of government--want to pay a bill without a receipt? That defies understanding. It makes no sense. Unfortunately, this is exactly what the Pentagon bureaucrats are urging Secretary of Defense Cohen to do. 
Today, pay and chase is unofficial policy. It's practiced but not authorized by the law. But the Pentagon bureaucrats want Secretary of Defense Cohen to change that and make it O.K: with the law. 
Secretary Cohen made his request in a letter to the Senate dated February 2, 1998.

Mr. GRASSLEY. The Section 401 pay and chase proposal has three parts. 
First, Section 401 would authorize DOD to pay bills without receipts--with no dollar limit. 
Second, Section 401 would require only random after-the-fact verification of some receipts. 
Third, disbursing officials would be relieved of all responsibility for erroneous or fraudulent payments that could result from this policy. 
Mr. President, this is a terrible idea. Section 401 says it's OK to pay bills without receipts. Just do it--$50,000; $500,000; $1 million; $10 million; or $100 million. The sky's the limit. It doesn't matter how big the bill is. Just pay it! And if you make a mistake, that's OK, too. Not to worry. 
Nobody can be held accountable for erroneous or fraudulent payments. This proposal could not have come at a worse time. All reports from the General Accounting Office (GAO) and Inspector General (IG) clearly indicate that DOD's internal controls are weak or non-existent. 
Not only do weak or non-existent internal controls make for easy embezzlement, they invite it. And it seems like embezzlers are on a rampage. That's the subject of a recent article entitled `Embezzlement Growth is Dramatic.' The article was written by Mr. Gary Strauss and appeared on page 1 of USA Today on January 13, 1998.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is what the article says. 
`Lax internal controls' are the cause for `a dramatic increase in embezzlement across the board.' 
`Lax internal controls' will be laxer-if Section 401 goes through. 
Now, Mr. President, there is no magic in a receipt. 
A receipt is not a leakproof defense against fraud--mainly because a receipt is so easy to forge. 
A receipt by itself is not much of a weapon. 
It is just one weapon in the controller's arsenal. 
To be an effective weapon, a receipt must be coupled to other control devices--like separation of duties. 
Unfortunately, at the Pentagon, receipts don't necessarily go hand-in-hand with the other control mechanisms. 
I learned that lesson in my examination of several DOD fraud cases: 
The Lugas case at Reese AFB, Texas; the McGill case in Norfolk, VA; and the Krenik case in the Pentagon. 
In these cases, there was no separation of duties. 
For example, I discoverd that Mr. Krenik's duties literally covered the waterfront. He was involved in every phase of the cycle of transactions from beginning to end. He: developed requirements for goods and services, wrote purchase orders, steered contracts to favored vendors, received and accepted deliveries, certified contract performance by signing receiving reports like the DD-250, and submitted invoices to the finance office for payment. 
In Mr. Krenik's organization--the 7th Communications Group--there was no separation of duties. In that environment, it was so easy for Mr. Krenik to fabricate phony invoices and receipts and get paid. 
He said it was a piece of cake. It was just too easy. 
This is what Mr. Krenik said after being apprehended:  
I saw how others had manipulated the DD-250s [receipts], so I thought I could do that also. . . . It was so easy to generate fake billings and open the Post Office box. 
I fear that Mr. Krenik was led into temptation by lax internal controls. 
With separation of duties, it would have been very difficult--if not impossible--for him to do what he did. More scrutiny by others would have greatly increased the probability of detection. That fear alone is sometimes enough to deter fraud. 
With duties properly separated, the goods are delivered to a central warehouse. After a receipt is certified by an independent warehouse-person, the goods are then turned over to the customer or user--someone like Mr. Krenik. 
In the right circumstances, a certified receipt can be a powerful weapon, and I want the certified receipt to be a powerful weapon in the DOD Comptroller's arsenal. 
I want receipt verification to be at the top of the checklist of things to do before making a payment. 
Above all, I do not want to see this body gut DOD's internal financial controls--or what remains of them--in the name of `defense reform.' 
Section 401, as written, would gut DOD's remaining internal controls. 
Knowing that DOD's internal controls are already weak or non-existent, the GAO and the IG oppose Section 401, as written. 
Section 401 would eliminate what's leftover, and it `ain't' much. 
And the crooks are hard at work. We know that for a fact because there is a new case at Dayton AFB, Ohio. 
Though we don't yet have all the details on the case, it looks like a carbon copy of the Krenik case--fraudulent invoices and receiving reports valued at nearly $1 million. 
Dayton happened, despite Air Force assurances to the contrary. 
The Air Force assured me on July 18, 1997, in no uncertain terms, that a Krenik-style operation could never happen again. 
The Air Force said it had `more internal controls to prevent this type of action from happening again.' 
I hate to say it but Dayton was happening as those words were being placed on paper. 
Weak or non-existent controls combined with heightened embezzlement activity do not argue for Section 401. 
So why push pay and chase now? 
Pay and chase is a bad idea. It would make DOD's accounts more vulnerable to theft and abuse. 
They are already far too vulnerable. 
What we need to do now is strengthen internal controls not weaken them. 
We need to make the certified receipt the potent anti-fraud weapon that it should be. 
DOD should not be authorized to make payments without receipts. 
And those responsible must be held accountable for erroneous and fraudulent payments--as they are today. 
As I see it, there are two ways to handle Section 401:

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I spent much of the recent recess talking to constituents in my state about drug problems. It is clear to me after a field hearing, numerous town meetings, and many conversations that the public is deeply concerned about the drug issue. This impression is confirmed by recent pools. Again and again, the public have indicted an abiding concern about the presence of drugs in our society. Parents, community leaders, and young people have repeatedly indicated that the availability and use of illegal drugs is among the most important issues affecting them. They expect the government to help them in fighting back. They expect our policies and programs to support community efforts to keep drugs off the streets, out of our schools, and away from our kids. But what do they find? 
I am sorry to say that the Clinton Administration is simply not making a convincing case that it is serious about the war on drugs. If I had doubts about this before, events of the last several days have removed them. I learned during recess that the Administration was planning to endorse needle exchange programs. I found it hard to believe that this could be true, but I learned otherwise. Indeed, on 20 April, Donna Shalala, the HHS Secretary, issued a statement saying that needle exchange programs were a good thing. That they stopped the spread of AIDS and did not encourage drug use. She encouraged communities to embark on programs giving needles to drug addicts. She did not go so far as to say that the Administration would back up this determination with federal dollars--a small blessing. But she has now put the authority of the Administration behind this idea. Exactly what is this idea? It is startling simple: The Administration has announced that it will now facilitate and promote others to facilitate making drug paraphernalia available to drug addicts in our communities. 
It will now use the voice of the Federal Government to facilitate drug use. What next, handing out the drugs themselves to addicts? 
This is voodoo science backing up Cheech and Chong drug policy. It is making the federal government a Head Shop. 
How does the Administration justify such a decision? It hides its move behind junk science. Secretary Shalala's argument is `The science made me do it.' At best, this is a half-truth. While there is science, of a sort, that claims that needle exchange programs work, there is no consensus science that establishes this as remotely the case. Still, we are being asked to endorse this vast experiment on the public based on a trust-me argument. This is not acceptable. It is irresponsible and risky. 
In order to understand what is at issue here, let me start at the beginning. One of the most effective delivery systems for illegal drugs is intravenous injection using needles. This is one of the most common methods for taking heroin and it also can be used in taking cocaine and methamphetamine. The addict uses injection because it means getting high quicker. The whole purpose of using needles is to facilitate drug use. Major addiction, which is risky business all by itself, also often leads to other, destructive behaviors. One of these is sharing the needles used for injection. 
Basically, what this means is that a number of addicts pass around or get together and share the same needle for numerous injections. In the age of AIDS, this means that if any of the sharing addicts has HIV or AIDS, anyone who shares the needle is at great risk of infection. Now, addicts already know this. It is not a secret. There are also quick and easy ways to disinfect these needles. Addicts know these too. They are not secrets here either. 
Despite this, addicts often don't bother with these easy steps. They don't bother even though they can do them with commonly available disinfectants in the comfort of their own preferred environment for injecting. Addicts are not the most rational of people when it comes to life decisions. Their lives are built around and based upon upon risky behavior. Our decisions on policy, however, should not be so cavalier. 
Now we come to the logic of needle exchange. The argument is, that a significant, or overwhelming proportion of HIV-positive cases are the result of using infected needles shared among addicts. Arriving at this conclusion, the next step in the logic is that stopping the use of infected needles will stop the spread of HIV and AIDS. Having reached this point, the next step is to argue that we must, therefore, keep addicts for sharing dirty needles. And now, in this breathless chain of argument, we arrive at this conclusion: To ensure that drug-using addicts only use safe needles, we, that is the government using public money or some similar deep-pocket institution, must hand out clean needles to addicts on demand. 
This is what the Secretary of Health and Human Services has now endorsed. But there is more to this story. 
Let us start again at the beginning. Drug addicts, particularly heroin users, depend upon syringes as the best vehicle for administering their drug of choice. This means that, for addicts, needles are essential drug paraphernalia. Just like crack pipes or other devices used to administer the drug, needles are part of the necessary equipment. 
During our last drug epidemic, one of the things that we learned we needed to do was to close the many `Head Shops' that specialized in selling drug equipment. We realized that pushing drug paraphernalia, making the equipment for drug use readily available, fostered drug use. It encouraged a climate of use. It was an indirect way for advertising drug use. Most states passed laws to prohibit the sale of drug paraphernalia. 
Many States included needles as part of this. Doing so was one of the things that helped us stop the drug epidemic. It helped us establish with kids that consistent no-use message that is essential if we are to keep drugs off our streets and out of our schools. Now, enter needle exchange. 
The Congress and most of the public have long opposed needle exchange. This is not because anybody wants to promote the spread of AIDS. Let's get that canard out of the way right up front. The concern is for whether or not handing out drug paraphernalia promotes drug use. Our past experience says yes, so it is a reasonable assumption that doing so in the present will cause a similar problem. Hence the opposition in many quarters to handing out needles. Thus, also part two of Secretary Shalala's announcement: Her claim that not only do needle exchanges stop AIDS, handing out needles will not, in her view, encourage drug use. Really? 
Just how do we know this? Just how do we know that handing our needles will also stop AIDS? The short answer is, we do not know any such thing. 
The response from HHS, from an anonymous source I might add, and from AIDS activists is that the science tells us so. As proof they quote in the HHS press release from Dr. Harold Varmus, Director of the National Institutes of Health, to the effect that needle exchanges can help. Well, so can chicken soup, but this is not the issue and is not what the law calls for. 
Being concerned about issues of public policy and public health, the Congress has been concerned not to be stampeded into irresponsible policies. 
In this light, it included specific guidance in law on using public money or government support for needle exchange. The intent was fairly clear: No money, no support. Full stop. It did provide for an exception if the science conclusively showed that needle exchange programs stopped AIDS and did not encourage use. That is a fairly high standard. And it should be. Otherwise, what we are doing is experimenting on the public, betting on a hope that things will turn out right. This may be a good strategy at the race track or at the roulette table, but it has no place in major policy. 
Yet, this casino mentality is what the Secretary of HHS has now proclaimed. And she is gambling with the public health. Secretary Shalala has announced that, `a meticulous scientific review has now proven that needle exchange programs can reduce the transmission of HIV * * * without losing ground in the battle against illegal drugs.' 
In doing this, the chief health official of the country has endorsed a policy that is reckless and irresponsible. And she has done so on claims about scientific support for her position that is, at best, inconclusive. At the worst, science contradicts her arguments flatly. In either case, this is poor ground upon which to base such a significant change in public policy. 
As Dr. James Curtis notes in an oped piece in the New York Times of 23 April, the idea of handing out needles to stop AIDS is `simplistic nonsense that stands common sense on its head.' Dr. Curtis, a professor of psychiatry at Colombia University and the director of psychiatry at Harlem Hospital, goes further. `For the past 10 years,' he writes, `as a black psychiatrist specializing in addiction, I have warned about the dangers of needle-exchange policies, which hurt not only individual addicts but also poor and minority communities.' 
The lack or contradictory nature of the science referred to by Secretary Shalala is also laid bare by Dr. David Murray of the Statistical Assessment Service. In an oped in the Wall Street Journal of 22 April, he notes just how thin the science is and yet how activists try to skip over this fact. 
Even the drug czar opposed this decision. Thus, there is not even consensus within the administration on this policy. The reason for this lack of agreement is based on the fact that the science is not there to support the position. And the law is clear. It does not say the science must show that such programs `might reduce', or `can reduce'. What it says is the science must show that they in fact do reduce AIDS and do not increase the chances for promoting illegal drug use. Even Secretary Shalala's press release hedges this with a `can reduce' comment. 
The only bright spot in the Secretary's announcement, and that light is a pretty dim bulb, is that no federal money will be used to support this policy. But this is a dodge. Even the advocates for exchange programs recognize it as such. This statement puts the authority of the administration behind this program. It does so on the thinnest of evidence. 
In my view, this decision is outrageous. I call upon Mr. Clinton to retract it. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that this administration simply doesn't get it when it comes to drug policy.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on Friday, a new audit report was released by the Health Care Financing Administration. It is the Chief Financial Officer's report. It shows that a staggering $20 billion of tax dollars were improperly paid through Medicare last year. That is 20 billion reasons to defend the False Claims Act and oppose the bill percolating in the House that's being pushed by the American Hospital Association, and sponsored by Congressman Bill McCollum--H.R. 3523. 
The audit is only the latest reminder of why the False Claims Act is the law of the land. Whether it is the derivation of the law signed by Abraham Lincoln in 1863, or the amendments that I sponsored, which passed in 1986, the reason the law exists is to protect the public's vital interests. 
In the case of health care, those vital interests are clear. The False Claims Act helps maintain the integrity of Medicare so that senior citizens won't have to fear the possibility that the program won't be there for them in the future. It helps maintain the standards we want for our seniors with respect to the quality of health care. The False Claims Act is beginning to be used successfully by U.S. Attorneys to improve the quality of care in the health care industry, such as nursing home care. 
Finally, the False Claims Act is the final yet most effective line of defense to protect the taxpayers' hard-earned money. Since my amendments in 1986, the Act has been used to return more than $4 billion, fraudulantly taken, back to the taxpayers. Nearly $2 billion of that is from the health care industry. And somewhere between $150 and $300 billion-worth of potential fraud has been deterred. 
There is a critical and obvious need for the False Claims Act to safeguard the public interest. The Act is also highly successful. It has built up a track record for accomplishing exactly what it was designed to do--to promote integrity in taxpayer-funded programs. 
Suddenly, integrity in such programs is under a fierce attack. The attack is the McCollum bill, which would gut the False Claims Act. What's wrong with this picture? 
The McCollum bill is a misguided missile in the war against fraud. If it passes, perpetrators of fraud will be celebrating in the streets. It is ill-founded, and would send the wrong message both to the public and to those who would commit fraud. 
The bill is the product of the American Hospital Association. The AHA came to me earlier this year and reported what they claim are examples of the Justice Department going after hospitals with heavy-handed tactics, and using the False Claims Act to prosecute innocent mistakes. I also visited with the Iowa Hospital Association, from my home State. 
After listening to their concerns, it seemed to me that the examples the AHA provided spoke more to problems in the implementation of the law, rather than to problems with the law itself. I agreed to approach the Justice Department and help begin a dialogue between DOJ, the AHA, and myself and other members of Congress. The goal was to examine the evidence and see where the problems were occurring and why. And then to fix any real problems. 
After much examination and discussion, I and others determined that the AHA had some legitimate concerns involving the way some U.S. Attorneys were communicating with some hospitals around the country. 
To its credit, the Justice Department has reevaluated its process and made changes. It has changed its approach, and has taken steps to ensure higher standards prior to any investigation for fraud. It is not often that the Justice Department willingly reexamines its process, admits changes are needed, and then makes them. Because it did so in this case, I believe that the Justice Department should be commended for its responsiveness. 
As a case in point, let me refer to a letter I received this month from the president of a medical center in Iowa. Next year, he will be in the leadership of the Iowa Hospital Association. He is one of those who had expressed concerns to me months ago about how the Justice Department was implementing the False Claims Act. After the dialogue, and after DOJ changed its process, this official wrote to me and said he was satisfied that the law doesn't need to be changed. This official further says that after meeting with the local U.S. Attorney, he is confident in DOJ's intentions to not use the False Claims Act to go after honest mistakes. 
In this case, the dialogue seems to have worked. Reason prevailed. Where reason has not prevailed is with those supporters of the McCollum bill who believe that the False Claims Act should be gutted anyway. There is a logical disconnect between the problems identified by the hospital industry, and the solution they now advocate. 
Pure and simple, the False Claim Act is a tool against fraud. It is not to be used, and is not used, against innocent mistakes. There is clearly an agenda behind this bill. It is to remove the taxpayers' most effective weapon in its arsenal against fraud. And it is being pushed by some in an industry that has been clearly ravaged by those who have committed fraud. 
There is no question that the vast majority of hospitals and hospital employees in this country are honest, civic-minded, and true public servants. Many are absolute heroes. Those in industry who get caught committing fraud threaten to give the industry a tarnished reputation. 
If that is so, can't we also say that those who are pushing to gut the law also threaten to give the industry a tarnished reputation? After all, given the changes made by DOJ, there is no empirical basis for this bill. Just as changes were demanded of the Justice Department to refrain from taking action without a legal or factual predicate, shouldn't there be a legal and factual predicate for advancing this bill. There is none. 
The McCollum bill is not designed to stop the prosecution of innocent mistakes. Rather, it would make fraud easier to accomplish more often. And, it would establish new `look-the-other-way' loopholes, including for on-going cases such as Columbia/HCA. And remember, this bill would do all that at a time when there's $20 billion of potential fraud out there, fraud in the medical industry has been rampant, and the public has had it up to their keesters. 
Is this what the supporters of the McCollum bill really think the public wants and needs? Do you really thing the public wants a white flag of surrender in the war against fraud? 
Specifically, the McCollum bill would do the following: 
First, it would create a `fraud-free zone.' No false claims case could be brought unless the taxpayers' damages are a `material amount.' That `material amount' is unclear but it could be as much as ten percent. In other words, we will write off the first 10 percent of fraud. In effect, it legalizes or legitimizes up to ten percent of what is now illegal. For a company like Columbia/HCA, for example, which pulled in more than $6 billion from the taxpayers last year, the first $600 million would be okay. For the entire Medicare program, which was $210 billion last year, we could write off the first $21 billion. That is a $21 billion loophole. A real whopper. 
Second, let us say a false claims case involved a `material amount.' there are still three more ways a company could get off the book anyway. The McCollum bill would open up three more whoppers to raise that $21 billion--`free fraud zone' to substantially more. Companies would be able to better insulate themselves from liability simply by, among other things, showing a commitment to setting up better procedures in the future despite defrauding Medicare today. 
Finally, the bill would make it much harder to provide that claims were wrongfully submitted. The normal standard for civil statutes is `a preponderance of the evidence.' The McCollum bill would raise it to `clear and convincing evidence.' That is basically a criminal standard, not a civil one. Once again, reason has not prevailed in the formulation of this bill. 
The McCollum bill would establish a fortress around the medical industry. It would prevent legitimate efforts on behalf of the taxpayers to punish those bad apples that undermine the integrity of health care programs and raid the treasury. The solution is not to gut the law. The solution was and is to take the steps DOJ has already taken, and to ensure DOJ stays on that rack in the future. We have addressed the process dealing with innocent mistakes. 
At the same time, we need the toughest possible law to go after mistakes that aren't innocent. Those who continue down the road of supporting this bill pose a clear and present danger to the public's vital interests--to the highest quality of health care for our senior citizens, and to the integrity of how our tax dollars are spent.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to commend my friend from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, for offering this excellent amendment last evening. 
The purpose of our amendment is to curb wasteful military spending. I am a co-sponsor. 
This amendment contains a very important message. It sends this signal: Pay a fair market value for what you buy. We hope the Department of Defense (DOD) will be guided by this common sense principle in the coming year when it starts spending all the money provided for in this resolution. Unfortunately, that may not happen. 
Two recent reports issued by the Inspector General at the Defense Department undermine our confidence in DOD's ability to get a handle on the problem. These two reports provide details on the latest round of spare parts `horror stories' at the Pentagon. They were presented by the Inspector General (IG), Ms. Eleanor Hill, at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 18, 1998. 
The IG's testimony and reports are the motivating force behind our amendment. 
Mr. President, the story presented by the Inspector General on March 18th was not new. In fact, it's the same old story about spare parts overpricing that we have heard so many times before. It's a carbon copy of what we witnessed back in the 1980's. First came the revelations about the $450.00 hammer and the $640.09 toilet seat. Then came the assurances from all the Pentagon bureaucrats: `Don't worry,' they said. `We already have a fix in place.' 
History has repeatedly proven that those promises were worthless. They were empty promises. And history is about to repeat itself--again. There's no reform in sight. 
The IG has brought new spare parts horror stories to light, and the bureaucrats are already promising that `corrective actions' are in place. Problem solved, right? Wrong! Unless DOD's corrective action has some teeth--and there is some accountability for the mess, there will be more horror stories somewhere down the road. I guarantee it. 
Mr. President, the only way to stop these kinds of waste procurement practices is with accountability. Some heads should roll at the Pentagon. Those responsible for the policies governing spare parts purchases should be identified and disciplined. 
I wrote to Secretary of Defense Cohen on March 20th, asking him to consider the need for accountability in the latest round of spare parts horror stories. I am still waiting for a response. 
This amendment sends a message over to the Pentagon. It's only a message but a very important message: This kind of waste must be brought to a screeching halt. We must find a way to fix it for good. 
And it sets the stage for the debate over the Defense Reform Initiative that will take place later this year. That measure will be considered when we take up the defense authorization bill for FY 1999. I am hoping there will be some specific proposals offered--at that time--to bring some lasting reform to the way DOD buys spare parts. 
Again, Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague from Georgia for sending the right message to the Pentagon.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, when many think of Iowa, they think of people with spirit, discipline, and a good old-fashioned work ethic. When sports enthusiasts think of Iowa, they think of superior college wrestling. 
Two weekends ago in Cleveland, Ohio, for the fourth consecutive year, for the 7th time in the past 8 years, and for the 16th time in the last 21 years, the University of Iowa won the college wrestling national championship. Two weeks prior, for the 25th consecutive year, Iowa won the Big Ten Conference Championships. Individual titles were won by Mark Ironside, Jeff McGinness and Joe Williams and three other Iowans became All-Americans by placing second. 
Imagine the attention a school would get if it won two, three or four consecutive NCAA basketball tournaments. Yet the University of Iowa's dominance in NCAA wrestling has become almost routine. Nevertheless, this year's victory was anything but routine. Because this year, Iowa won without its legendary coach, Dan Gable, who took the season off and is contemplating retirement. 
As many know, Dan Gable is the world's most notable ambassador for the sport of wrestling. Gable grew up in Iowa and compiled a 64-0 high school record. He attended Iowa State, where he was 118-1, and went on to win the Gold Medal at the Olympics in Munich in 1972. He won the Olympic tournament without allowing an opponent to score a single point against him. 
Gable then went on to coach at the University of Iowa and win 15 national championships in his 21 years as coach. In doing so, he coached 9 consecutive national championships from 1978-1986 which is an NCAA record for all sports. Incidently, that streak was broken by Iowa State University who placed 6th this year in Cleveland. 
Though he is largely unheralded outside of amateur athletics, his formula for success is as simple as it is difficult--hard work. Gable once said, `Like anything in life, it's not hard to be the best. It is as simple as outworking the opponent.' His motto is `Hard work solves anything.' But Gable didn't just say the words, he lived them. And he demanded his wrestlers live them as well. 
Following Gable's 1971 Gold Medal victory in the World Championships in Bulgaria, he celebrated by taking a long run. For most, that was a time to relax, to enjoy your success. For Dan Gable it was an opportunity to get one practice ahead of any opponent he might face in the upcoming 1972 Olympic Games. 
The notion of work and preparation is almost second nature in an agricultural state such as Iowa, where folks understand that you cannot harvest what you do not sow. That's why the other secret to the success of Iowa wrestling is that most of its wrestlers are Iowans. Seven out of the ten wrestlers that Iowa qualified for nationals are from the state of Iowa. 
Furthermore the second-place team, Minnesota, a suburb of Iowa in wrestling terms, is coached by a former product of Iowa wrestling. And the coaches of Illinois, Wisconsin and Indiana are former Iowa wrestlers. Iowa's new coaches, Jim Zalesky, Lincoln McIlravy, Tom Brands and twin-brother Terry Brands collectively won 10 NCAA individual titles while wrestling for Dan Gable. 
Gable once said the biggest benefit of sports is that `* * * it teaches an athlete to deal with adversity and adversity builds character.' Perhaps, the greatest testament to Iowa's character is that they won a National Championship without Dan Gable. No one would have wanted that more than Gable himself. 
Former NFL-great Frank Gifford commented, `Dan Gable is the most dedicated athlete I have ever known.' The impact of his dedication prevails even in his absence, as the tradition of Iowa's wrestling dominance marches forward. Old-fashioned hard work still lives in Iowas and it still works for Iowa. 
My congratulations to Iowa wrestling--the National Champions again!

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing `The Business Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998.' As Members of this body may remember, the National Bankruptcy Review Commission submitted a list of recommendations to Congress in October of last year. So far, the public has tended to focus on the consumer bankruptcy recommendations, which unfortunately would have made it easier to get into bankruptcy and would have given consumers even more of an upper hand. I think that these recommendations were fatally flawed, and that's why I introduced the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act with Senator Durbin last year to tighten up the bankruptcy system and provide new consumer protections when creditors use abusive tactics. 
The legislation I am introducing today will make many badly-needed reforms to the business provisions of the bankruptcy code. This legislation will provide--for the first time ever--new protections for patients of hospitals and HMOs and nursing homes that declare bankruptcy. Under current law, the bankruptcy process is oriented toward protecting the interests of creditors and helping the debtor corporation reorganize. And that is all we need most of the time. 
But hospitals and HMOs and nursing homes are different. Patients are uniquely vulnerable and Congress needs to take special care to ensure that patients are protected during the bankruptcy process. For that reason, this bill allows a bankruptcy judge to appoint a patient ombudsman to make sure that the bankruptcy process is fair to patients. If the ombudsman determines that the quality of patient care is declining, he must notify the bankruptcy court so that corrective action can be taken. 
This legislation also requires that the bankruptcy trustee ensure patients are transferred to other hospitals when a health care provider is winding down. Under current bankruptcy law, there's no such requirement. Under current law, patients could just be thrown out and have nowhere to go. Congress can't let that happen. 
Importantly, to the extent that there are some State laws which already require a State agency to place patients when health care providers go under, this legislation will allow those agencies to recoup their expenses from the estate of the bankrupt health care provider. Otherwise, the bankruptcy code forces State taxpayers to pay for something which should be paid for by the defunct health care provider. 
Following a recommendation of the National Bankruptcy Review Commission, this legislation provides an important new protection for employee health care and pensions. Under current law, if money is withheld from wages to pay for health care insurance or pension contributions, but a company declares bankruptcy before the withheld money is actually transferred, then the bankruptcy code prohibits the company from transferring this money. In practical terms, this means that workers lose their health insurance and forfeit pension contributions. I think this is wrong. So, my legislation will create a special carve out so that withheld money can go for its intended purpose. 
The Business Bankruptcy Reform Act also makes several changes to the way securities transactions are treated under the bankruptcy code. Many of these changes are supported by the administration. I would call my colleagues' attention to one provision in particular. As we all know, home mortgage rates are at an all time low, allowing many Americans to purchase homes for the first time or to move into a larger home to accommodate a growing family. One factor in keeping mortgage interest rates very low is the existence of a robust secondary market where mortgage lenders can spread the risk by issuing securities backed up by home mortgages. With the risk spread by a securities market, mortgage bankers can make loans at lower interest rates. 
Unfortunately, a provision of the bankruptcy code threatens to undermine the viability of this important secondary market. And if the secondary market dries up, then lenders will have to raise interest rates. Under current law, it isn't clear that the income stream going to the purchaser of the mortgage-backed securities will continue if the lender declares bankruptcy. In my bill, we expressly say that the income stream belongs to the securities purchaser and not the bankrupt lender. This change will help ensure that the secondary market stays strong by providing much-needed certainty to purchasers of mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities. 
On another topic, this legislation enacts the model law on international bankruptcies. When I held a hearing on international bankruptcies before my subcommittee last year, I learned that many times bankruptcy proceedings in this county are hampered because foreign countries won't cooperate with our bankruptcy courts. This model law would provide for standard procedures for recognizing and cooperating with foreign bankruptcy proceedings. If other countries--especially our trading partners--follow our lead in enacting this model law, then our bankruptcy proceedings will be treated fairly and American creditors will be able to get a fair shake for the first time when trying to collect from a foreign corporation which has declared bankruptcy. 
The development of bankruptcy systems is a critically important factor in ensuring that international trade will continue to expand and benefit the United States economy. Many international insolvency specialists tell me that the lack of a good bankruptcy system in the Asian countries is making the Asian financial crisis even worse. When we finally get to consider the IMF funding bill, I intend to offer an amendment which would require the IMF to push for meaningful bankruptcy reforms when they provide loans to countries in economic trouble. I hope that my colleagues will support me in this effort. 
Finally, the legislation I'm introducing today will provide for special fast-track procedures for businesses that declare bankruptcy which have less than $5 million in debt. Right now, these cases often languish for years in bankruptcy without a real hope of reorganizing. I believe that the bankruptcy code should identify cases which have no realistic chance of reorganizing and get them into chapter 7 as quickly as possible. In this way, creditors will get more of what they are owed. Most of these special fast-track proceedings were recommended by the Bankruptcy Review Commission, although I've added some changes to reduce the chances that clever bankruptcy lawyers will find a way to keep a company in chapter 11 which should be liquidated. The Business Bankruptcy Reform Act also contains special tax provisions so that taxing authorities will receive effective notice of a bankruptcy. 
Mr. President, I believe that this bill will do much good for patients, for creditors and for all Americans whose lives are increasingly affected by business bankruptcies. I hope that we can pass this bill in this Congress.

Mr. GRASSLEY. 
Mr. President, today I am proposing a private relief bill, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, that would classify Regine Beatie Edwards as a child, and therefore, allow her to become a citizen of the United States. 
This bill originates from a request of Mr. Stan Edwards, a United States citizen and Regine's adopted father, concerning his daughter's naturalization application. Regine Beatie Edwards was born on August 3, 1980 in Germany and arrived in the United States with her mother on October 16, 1994. In 1997, Mr. Edwards, on several occasions, contacted the Immigration and Naturalization Service to obtain the proper form to apply for his daughter's naturalization. In response, the INS sent Mr. Edwards the form N-643, Application for Certificate in Behalf of an Adopted Child, and notified him that the adoption must be completed and that the application must be submitted by his daughter's 18th birthday. On January 13, 1997, Regine was legally adopted by Mr. Edwards. At this time, Regine was 16 1/2 years old. After the completion of the adoption, Mr. Edwards delivered his daughter's application, in person, to the INS office in Omaha, Nebraska on March 27, 1997. 
Over the following months, Mr. Edwards became concerned about the amount of time that had passed since the submission of the application to the INS. In January of 1998, the INS reported that Regine Edwards' application was to be denied because the adoption had not been completed by the child's 16th birthday and that the form N-643 was the incorrect form for application. This new information contradicted what the INS had previously told Mr. Edwards that Regine had to be adopted by her 18th birthday. The INS indicated that Mr. Edwards' daughter had met three of the four qualifications to qualify for citizenship. As a result of this misinformation, Regine did not meet the qualification of an adoption by a citizen parent before the child had reached the age of sixteen. In response to the incorrect information given in this case, the INS refunded the money for the N-643 application to Mr. Edwards. 
I feel that Regine Edwards should not be denied citizenship due to the wrong information provided by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The Edwards family fulfilled the qualifications that they were originally told by the INS were necessary. Unfortunately, Mr. Edwards was misinformed which has cost his daughter the opportunity for citizenship at this time. Mr. President, I ask you and my fellow colleagues to support this young woman by allowing her to fulfill her wish to become a United States citizen and not deprive her of this opportunity.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have kept our word, and we have increased education spending by exactly what the President and the Congress decided to do last year in the Balanced Budget Act. 
We provide an additional $8 billion in additional discretionary education funding over the next 5 years. In total, we will provide close to $20 billion in K-12 education funding this year. That is a 98 percent increase over the last 10 years. 
We agree with the President on the funding. However, we disagree with the President on how to spend the money, because the President and his party want to make Washington, DC, education central. Republicans want to decentralize education decisionmaking and put power and resources into the hands of the States, the localities, and the families. We should oppose the amendment. I move to table the amendment.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want the record to show that while I am not supporting the Kennedy amendment, I am supportive of many of the principles behind this amendment. I took the lead in sponsoring legislation (S. 701) last year to provide Medicare beneficiaries with consumer protections such as: (1) detailed comparative information and access to a 1-800 number for Medicare beneficiaries to choose the best health plan; (2) an expedited appeals process for urgent cases; (3) a prohibition on gag clauses that restrict patient/physician communications; (4) access to specialty care when needed, with special attention to the chronically ill; and (5) limits on the use of financial incentives by managed care plans. Many of these provisions were enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Often, Medicare sets the example for the private sector, and this is my hope. 
I believe consumers should have good information about their health plans; that they should have protections in place for a fair and timely appeals process; that they should have access to specialty care when needed; and that physicians should be able to discuss all treatment options with their patients. 
Regulating the private sector is more difficult because regulations cost money. These costs are shifted onto employers and ultimately employees. I will want to evaluate proposed legislation based on the impact this will have on employees' health benefits. I do not want to do anything to increase the number of uninsured, which is as much as 41 million Americans who lack health coverage. I commend my colleague from Massachusetts for raising this important issue, but as we all know `the devil is in the details.' I would like this issue to be debated and for legislation to be proposed and analyzed thoroughly for any unintended consequences to ensure that we are not doing more harm than good. We cannot afford to increase the number of uninsured and must be careful not to hurt those that currently have coverage.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator Domenici to the amendment offered by Senator Rockefeller on disability compensation for veterans with smoking-related disabilities. 
It seems to me reasonable to ask for more deliberate review of this issue. After all, President Clinton has twice proposed not to allow post-service smoking related illnesses to be eligible for VA disability compensation. Once the question has been thoroughly reviewed, we can then reconsider the matter. 
This Domenici amendment would ask the General Accounting Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and the VA to review this matter over the next year. This will allow the main analytical resources of the Federal Government to come to bear on this question. And, when the assessment is finished, we will have greater confidence that we are doing the right thing. 
With respect to the main Rockefeller amendment, we have to keep several things in mind. This would be an expensive program. According to the Congressional Budget Office, we are talking about around $10 billion over five years. It is also not clear that it is fair to all the other veterans who have service-connected disabilities which are clearly service-connected or low income veterans who have problems clearly related to military service that have led, or would lead, to receipt of disability compensation. 
Furthermore, it is certainly possible that major inequities could result were the underlying amendment enacted. By this I mean that veterans who started smoking after military service could conceivably be eligible for disability compensation under terms of this amendment. Keep in mind also, that veterans who suffer from tobacco-related health problems can still qualify for health care services from the VA if they met the regular qualifying criteria.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to commend my colleague Senator Domenici, the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, for bringing a truly remarkable budget resolution to the Floor of the Senate. I truly never thought that I would be standing here during my lifetime preparing to vote on a resolution that will bring our federal budget into balance, even producing a surplus. This is going to be one of those rare occasions when the Congress will actually be following its own advice. We will advance beyond the rhetoric of talking about balancing the budget and actually balance the budget. And we are doing it 4 years ahead of time. This is a truly remarkable achievement. 
If we continue on this course, something even more remarkable may begin to happen. The public may start to lose some of the skepticism about the Congress which has built up over the years. 
Last year we were faced with many hard choices as we worked on the bi-partisan Balanced Budget Act of 1997. It was a difficult time. The decisions which we made then were as tough as any decisions which we as legislators have ever had to make. But we joined hands, and for the good of the country we made them. Those difficult, sometimes bitter decisions are now bearing the sweet fruit of a balanced budget along with a possible surplus. 
We should be hearing the blue bird of happiness here in the Senate Chamber, and continue to be careful with the taxpayers money. But that doesn't seem to be the case. Instead we are hearing the gremlin of spend, spend, spend. It seems that the lessons we have learned about tightening our belts and living within our means was fleeting at best. To make matters worse, we are talking about spending money that we do not have yet. 
Another way that we are talking about spending money that we don't have in the various votes about spending the tobacco settlement money. This is not the appropriate time for this debate. 
In addition, we are putting the cart before the horse. We are debating how to spend the money from a tobacco settlement before we have made the hard choices required to enact this settlement. What about liability limitations, advertising restrictions, billion dollar attorneys fees, tax deductibility questions, new federal regulations, and antitrust limits? These are just a few issues that must be carefully considered before Congress passes any tobacco legislation. 
When we pass tobacco legislation, our goal--our priority--must be to eliminate youth smoking. When I can, I discourage people, both old and young, from smoking. I recently took my grandson Patrick to a town meeting, where Al Gore was speaking, that was organized to alert young people to the dangers of smoking. Let's make that clear, there is no one in this room who favors youth smoking. Any efforts to characterize anyone otherwise are disingenuous and frankly, unhelpful to this debate. 
I believe that we must pass tobacco legislation this session. And we need to keep our priorities straight when we do this. Our priority must be to stop youth smoking, not to coddle the tobacco industry. This Budget Resolution protects the chances of passing solid tobacco settlement legislation this year. It takes the proceeds from this theoretical legislation and puts them in a reserve fund for Medicare--which pays the health-related costs that the state lawsuits were designed to address. It funds the issues won in the settlement--smoking cessation programs, health research, and such--from existing funds. We believe that these are important enough to fund them without waiting for new legislation. This allows us to stop arguing over how to spend the money long enough to consider the issues that must be solved for us to get this money. This gives us the strongest hand to enact legislation that creates a real, effective and lasting regime for reducing youth smoking. 
Now is also not the time to talk about new entitlement programs. Now is the time to keep entitlements and spending in line with last year's bipartisan budget agreement. It is time to make sure the entitlements we have already can meet their commitments to the millions of Americans who depend on them. 
Again, this is a good budget. This budget paves the way for real increases in spending for health research, child care, and other important programs. And we do it within the agreed upon budget caps. 
I greatly admire the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and the skill and expertise which he has shown in crafting this budget resolution. This is a good resolution. This resolution keeps the faith with the American people as we continue to work to get a balanced budget and to keep it.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to express my support for Senator Kyl's amendment establishing a sense of the Congress regarding Medicare beneficiaries freedom to privately contract with physicians. I understand there has been a lot of misinformation about private contracting and the Balanced Budget Act provision. But the fundamental issue behind this debate has always been clear. What this really boils down to is what is the appropriate role of the government. And I just don't believe that the federal government should tell seniors how they can or cannot spend their own hard earned money. While the Balanced Budget Act allows private contracting on a limited basis, most beneficiaries will not have this freedom because physicians who privately contract will have to opt out of the Medicare program for 2 years. Most physicians won't be able to do that, and most beneficiaries would not want their doctor to do this. Therefore, I support the Kyl amendment to give seniors the freedom of choice to privately contract.

Mr. GRASSLEY. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that lifts the unfair limits on how much people can save in their employer's pension plan. Last year, Congress took an important first step in helping people prepare for retirement through educating the public about private savings and pensions. But education can only go so far. We also must remove the barriers that prevent working Americans from achieving a secure retirement. 
Removing the barriers means taking a fresh look at some of the provisions in the Internal Revenue Code which discourage workers and employers from putting money into pension plans. One of the most burdensome provisions in the Internal Revenue Code is the 25 percent limitation contained within section 415(c). Under 415(c), total contributions by employer and employee into a defined contribution (DC) plan are limited to 25 percent of compensation or $30,000 for each participant, whichever is less. That limitation applies to all employees. If the total additions into a DC plan exceed the lesser of 25 percent or $30,000, the excess money will be subject to income taxes and a penalty in some cases. 
To illustrate the need for elimination of the 25 percent limit let me use an example. Bill works for a medium size company in my home state of Iowa. His employer sponsors a 401(k) plan and a profit sharing plan to help employees save for retirement. Bill makes $25,000 a year and elects to put in 10 percent of his compensation into the 401(k) plan, which amounts to $2,500 per year. His employer will match the first 5 percent of his compensation, which comes out to be $1,250, into the 401(k) plan. Therefore, the total 401(k) contribution into Bill's account in this year is $3,750. In this same year Bill's employer determines to set aside a sufficient amount of his profits to the profit sharing plan which results in an allocation to Bill's account in the profit sharing plan the sum of $3,205. This brings the total contribution into Bill's retirement plan this year up to $6,955. 
Unfortunately, because of the 25 percent of compensation limitation only $6,250 can be put into Bill's account for the year. The amount intended for Bill's account exceeds that limitation by $705. Hence, the profit sharing plan administrator must reduce the amount intended for allocation to Bill's account by $705 in order to avoid a penalty. Bill is unlikely to be able to save $705, a significant amount that would otherwise be yielding a tax deferred income which would increase the benefit Bill will receive at retirement. Bill's retirement saving is shortchanged by $705 plus the tax-deferred earnings it would have generated. 
Now let us look at Irene. Irene works for the same company, but she makes $45,000 a year. She also puts in 10 percent of her compensation into the 401(k) plan, and her employer matches five percent of her salary into the account. That brings the combined contribution of Irene and her employer up to $6,750. She would also receive a contribution of $3,205 from the profit sharing plan. This brings the total contribution into Irene's pension plan for that year to $9,955. She is also subject to the 25 percent limit, but for Irene, her limit would not be reached until $11,200. She is able to put in her 10 percent, receive the five percent match and receive the full amount from the profit share because her amount doesn't exceed the limit. 
Despite the fact that Bill and Irene have the same discipline to add to their pension plans and save for their retirements, Bill is penalized by the 25 percent limitation. By lifting the 25 percent limit, we can provide a higher threshold of savings for those who need it most. 
Permitting additional contributions to DC plans will help women `catch up' on their retirement savings goals. Women are more likely to live out the last years of their retirement in poverty for a number of reasons. Women have longer lifespans, they are more likely to leave the workforce to raise children or care for elderly parents, are more likely to have to use assets to pay for long-term care for an ill spouse, and traditionally make less money than their male counterparts. Anyone who has delayed saving for retirement will get a much needed boost to their retirement savings strategy if the 25 percent limit is eliminated for employees. 
Not only does this proposal help individual employees save for retirement but it also helps the many businesses, both small and large which are affected by 415(c). First, the 25 percent limitation causes equity concerns within businesses. Low and mid-salary workers do not feel as if the Code treats them equitably, when their higher-paid supervisor is permitted to save more in dollar terms in a tax-qualified pension plan. 
Second, one of the primary reasons businesses offer pension plans is to reduce turnover and retain employees. Employers often supplement their 401(k) plans with generous matches or a profit-sharing plan to keep people on the job. The 415(c) limitation inhibits their ability to do that, particularly for the lower-paid workers who are unfairly affected. 
Third, this legislation will ease the administrative burdens connected with the 25 percent limitation. Dollar limits are easier to track than percentage limits. 
Finally, I want to placate any concerns that repealing the 25 percent limit will serve as a windfall for high-paid employees. The Code contains other limitations which provide protection against abuse. First, the Code limits the amount an employee can defer to a 401(k) plan. Under section 402(g) of the Code, workers can only defer up to $10,000 of compensation into a 401(k) plan in 1998. In addition, plans still must meet strict non-discrimination rules that ensure that benefits provided to highly-compensated employees are not overly generous. 
The value to society of this proposal, if enacted, is undeniable. Increased savings in qualified retirement plans can prevent leakage, meaning the money is less likely to be spent, or cashed out as might happen in a savings account or even an IRA. 
There will be those out there who recognize that this bill does not address the impact of the 415 limit for all of the plans that are subject to it. I have included language that would provide relief to 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans, for example. Plans authorized by section 457 of the Code--used by state and local governments and non-profit organizations have not been specifically addressed. I want to assure organizations who sponsor 457 plans that I support ultimate conformity for all plans affected by the 415(c) percentage limitation. Over the next couple of weeks, I hope to work with these organizations to identify the changes that are necessary to achieve equity and simplicity for their employees. In the mean time, this is a positive step toward enhancing the retirement savings opportunities of working Americans. 
We have begun to educate all Americans about the importance of saving for retirement, but if we educate and then do not give them the tools to allow people to practically apply that knowledge, we have failed in our ultimate goal to increase national savings. Let's help Americans succeed in saving for retirement. In helping them achieve their retirement goals, they help us to achieve our goal as policymakers of improving the quality of life for Americans.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today Tunisia celebrates the 42nd Anniversary of its Independence from France. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate them for their many successful endeavors of the past 42 years. 
Last year, Tunisia and the U.S. celebrated the bicentennial of the `Treaty of Peace and Friendship.' This celebration marked the longest unbroken friendship treaty in the history of the two countries. Throughout our long relationship the United States and Tunisia have experienced cooperation based on respect and our mutual commitment to freedom, democracy, and the peaceful resolution of conflict. 
Despite its location in a very volatile area of the world, Tunisia has been a leader in promoting stability and peace in Africa and the Middle East. It has been a voice of moderation in the Arab-Israeli peace process promoting dialogue and improved relations. It was the first Arab State to host an Israeli delegation and to hold a multilateral meeting of the peace process. In 1996, Tunisia and Israel opened interest sections in each country and established full diplomatic relations. 
Tunisia also has made impressive economic strides. It has successfully graduated from development assistance to become a self-sufficient nation. The people of Tunisia enjoy the highest standard of living in the region. These improvements have come about through the devotion of vital resources to the promotion of its people, education, and economic reform. 
In the past 12 years, the government has focused its economic development on privatizing many of the state-owned companies and reforming the financial and banking systems. As a result, Tunisians have developed a diverse and market oriented economy where they have experienced not only domestic success but increased international standing. Tunisia is a member of the World Trade Organization and enjoys duty-free access to the European Union and most Arab countries. 
Tunisia has been a friend and ally to the United States for many years. I look forward to continued cooperation and friendship in the years to come. As Tunisia celebrates its 42nd anniversary of independence, I offer my sincere congratulations on their many successful accomplishments.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to comment on the prayer of the Chaplain of the Senate this morning. It is a prayer that is needed, because there is more than just one member of the family involved in the Senate. It is needed because family is very much involved. More importantly, our Chaplain practices what he preaches in the sense that he is truly a person who is a pastor not only for 100 Senators and their families but for a bigger family, the staff of the Senate. So I know that his prayer is from the heart as well as from the Scripture.

Mr. GRASSLEY. On behalf of the leader, Mr. President, I wish to make this announcement. The Senate will be in a period of morning business until 11:30 a.m. At 11:30, the Senate will begin consideration of H.R. 2646, the Coverdell A+ education bill. At that time, Senator Roth will be recognized to offer an amendment. It is hoped that good progress can be made on the Coverdell bill, and therefore Senators can expect rollcall votes throughout Wednesday's session. 
In addition, the Senate may resume consideration of the NATO enlargement treaty. The Senate may also be asked to consider any of the following items: the ocean shipping reform bill, the Texas low-level waste compact, and any other executive or legislative items cleared for action. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, Haley's Comet appears and disappears every so many decades. So do balanced budgets in Washington, DC. After 30 years, it looks like our Budget Committee, of which I am a member, will have another balanced budget for the first time, as I said, in 30 years. And it looks like after that we could have surpluses for quite a few years. Of course, that is a very unusual situation from a fiscal standpoint--for this Congress to be faced with balancing the budget 2 or 3 years earlier than we predicted and having surpluses for quite a few years into the future. 
That gives us a windfall opportunity to do good. But it also is giving some who are willing to squander this an opportunity and to do it in the form of more spending or in the form of more tax cuts. 
Last year's budget deal was, of course, to the benefit of both political parties. We actually did something good. We did it together. And the good benefited our country. 
This was very different. It was a bipartisan plan. We wrapped our arms around each other. Both sides should, and do, take credit for doing this good. 
But for those who are politically motivated, when the two sides are locked in a policy embrace, there is no discernible difference. And some people just cannot stand that sort of an environment. So they do not like it. So there is a mad rush to declare new ideas to give away the money--money, incidentally, that we do not have yet, legitimately planning to get it as you forecast a good future, but it is not really in our pockets. Yet, it is just like it is burning holes in our pockets. We don't know what to do with it. We need to spend it. We need to get rid of it in some way. Thus, what was done for the good of all taxpayers would be sacrificed for a new round of political operations of picking winners and losers. 
For once, we need to take the politics out of what we do and do right for the country. We did that last year. All we have to do is just be patient, and it can evolve this year because this country is on the right track. This Congress' fiscal policy is on the right track. 
So, let us do a lot of good by simply doing nothing--being cool-headed and being levelheaded in our policy, the same sort of policy that got us together a year ago with the signing of a bipartisan budget agreement to put this country on a path toward a balanced budget. 
For the first time, as our Budget Committee meets to mark up the budget resolution--that is this very day and yesterday as well, and we should have this resolved before the evening is over in our Budget Committee--but for the first time, as we meet to mark up the budget resolution, we are faced not with a growing Federal budget deficit but the possibility, and the very real possibility, of surplus of funds in the Treasury. For the first time we sit to deliberate not on how to corral an out-of-control beast but on how to responsibly maintain the ground which we have gained. 
The bipartisan Balanced Budget Act has performed its function well. Last year we established and agreed to live within budget caps. These caps have provided the discipline necessary to begin to get the Federal spending under control. Along with an economic boom that shows little signs of slowing down, the budget caps have helped to bring the Federal Government into a surplus situation. 
I urge my colleagues to continue to live within these caps and to continue to practice the spending restraints instituted 8 months ago. To think that the surplus is there to be spent willy-nilly is to break a newly developing trust with the American taxpayers. This trust is not easy to come by. In fact, as I speak, any poll in America asking the question, `Do you feel that Congress is really serious about balancing the budget?'--they might even say, `Is the President and the Congress serious about balancing the budget?'--three out of four people would respond negatively to that. 
So any thought of breaking this trust that is not easy to come by and is still building will send the wrong signals to our bosses, the taxpayers. Any thought of breaking this trust will send the wrong signal to the financial markets, with dire consequences, in my view. 
This budget resolution must help to address the cynicism of the public by continuing to show fiscal responsibility and gradually winning over those three out of four people who do not think, as a result of the bipartisan budget resolution last year, that we are really serious about a sound fiscal policy and continuing to balance the budget and to pay on the national debt. 
We have a historic opportunity then just by living by that agreement to do the most good for the American people, and we can continue that process by simply doing nothing because nothing should be done to break the budget caps. That is the fiscal discipline. Nothing should be done then to upset the financial markets. And we would do that if we were to not live by that agreement. Everything should be done to have the Federal Government live within its means, just as every American must do. Every family must balance their checkbook. Every small business or big business must show a profit, or it is soon out of business. And shaped with this is an old adage that at least my party has always lived by: `The government that governs best governs least.' That should be our bellwether as we continue the markup of this budget resolution in our committee. Never has this statement been more true than it is right now. Let us not squander the windfall opportunity that has been handed to us by the budget resolution of last year--the bipartisan budget resolution of last year. Let us not, by talking about giving tax decreases on the one hand or on the other hand by setting up eight new entitlement programs, as the President proposed, cause those three out of four people who do not believe we are going to be balancing the budget to be right by being skeptical about how Congress acts on these matters. 
We also have the opportunity to do what the President has asked us to do, and that is to strengthen the Social Security System. Until we have come to an agreement on how to make the Social Security System viable for future generations, we should not be spending this surplus. For now, then, doing nothing--in other words nothing new--not setting up eight new entitlement programs or not cutting taxes until we have the 
money in the pocket and we can plan for what we are really going to do--doing nothing the way things are done by paying off on the national debt, we will have the result then of that downpayment on the Federal debt for the first time since 1969. 
This country generally--but specifically the financial markets--has a great deal of confidence in a person called Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Fed. He strongly urged our Budget Committee when he appeared before it, and the Congress generally, to take this rare opportunity to pay down on the Federal debt. I think we should follow his very good advice. Paying down the debt will open up markets for private investors. That will help to reduce interest rates, which helps all of us, and particularly capital-intensive industries like the small industries. Until the public and policymakers reach a much needed consensus on the future of the Social Security System, paying down the debt is the best way to protect Social Security and to maintain it for the baby-boom generation, and to put that system in a sound position as our population grows older--the longevity of our population, as well as the biggest demographic shift in the population of our country that is going to take place when the baby-boom generation retires in the year 2010. 
It has been somewhat amazing to me to have seen in the last several weeks the number of people with proposals to spend money that we don't have in our pockets yet. I am not only talking about the budget surplus but what to do with revenue--and we don't even know how much will come in--by the proposed tobacco settlement. Everyone wants a piece of the pie before it has even been baked. We don't even know how big the pie will ultimately be or if there will even be a pie to covet. 
It is irresponsible to spend money that is not in the bank. We ought to cool it and just wait and see if it is there. And, if it is there, then we can. Even if there is something to be done with it and you know exactly what it is and you can make wiser decisions of creating a new program or a wiser decision of how to reform taxes and to cut taxes, whether it is a surplus or the tobacco money--but particularly in the case of the tobacco money--using the proposed tobacco money to pay for specific programs before the money is in hand is the old smoke-and-mirrors game. We must be responsible and wait to spend any tobacco money and not spend it until it is in the bank. 
In general, I think that Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget Committee, has put together a very good mark in regard to the possibility of doing something with taxes. He is not spending the surplus on any tax provisions of this budget. The Finance Committee, if it wants to change some taxes, has to find new money to pay for that. That is a responsible way to approach taxes. So the chairman's mark is a very good mark. If we have an opportunity on taxes, then we need to push for tax fairness. 
However, I strongly disagree with those who advocate large tax cuts that dig into the surplus that we don't even have in our pocket yet, and to do it at this point in time. The time for a large tax cut is after we have retired some of our national debt, giving the three out of four people in this country who do not believe that we are serious about balancing the budget an opportunity to know that we are. And the surest way to do that would be to pay down the national debt. This is how we can best serve all taxpayers. 
So let us not squander this chance to ease the debt burden. Let us use this windfall opportunity to provide a better future for our children. Like us, our children must also have the opportunity to realize their dreams and goals. And this budget should help to restore the American dream. 
The fiscal discipline which I talk about, which I think the Budget Committee will exercise this very day as we vote out the budget document, will have a lasting positive influence on our children's and grandchildren's future. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I urge my Senate colleagues to vote against the anti-ethanol tax hike amendment offered by Senator McCain. 
The good Senator from Arizona took us down this road last year, only to be turned back by a vote of 69-30. 
I want to thank the 35 Republicans and 34 Democrats who joined in defending the Grassley/Moseley-Braun ethanol program extension, and urge that you join us again in defending one of our Nations's bright spots in our long battle to reduce our dependence upon foreign energy. 
I want to thank Chairman Roth for honoring the request from Senator Lott, Senator Moseley-Braun, and me to include in the highway bill the same ethanol language that we defended in that 69-30 vote last year. 
Mr. President, with increased frequency, we hear loosely tossed around the phrase `corporate welfare.' 
Unfortunately, by failing to establish and apply a consistent, workable definition, `corporate welfare' becomes as worn and arbitrary as the term `pork barrel.' 
Is it `corporate welfare' for an Arizona road construction company to take a government check to build roads? 
Clearly, without the government money, it would not be building roads, so does that make it `corporate welfare?' 
Is it `corporate welfare' for a defense contractor to take a government check to build aircraft? Clearly, without the government money, it would not be building military aircraft. 
If the key factor in identifying corporate welfare is the receipt of a government check, then America has a lot of companies depending upon corporate welfare. 
But what if the company receives no government check--not one thin dime from Uncle Sam? 
What if America decides that because it has become increasingly and dangerously dependent upon foreign energy, that we must establish programs and incentives to develop domestic sources of energy and to conserve energy? 
What if, instead of doling out government checks to specific corporations, we establish a program to lower the taxes of motorists who use gasoline blended with home-grown ethanol? 
That's exactly how the ethanol program works! Not one thin dime from the government goes to ethanol producers such as ADM. We do not pick the winners and losers. 
We do not influence, let alone decide or dictate who makes ethanol or who doesn't. 
Ethanol is produced by 35 companies with plants in 22 states. Many of these are farmer owned and operated cooperatives that support small towns and small businesses. 
Anybody under the sun in America can produce ethanol, and the fact is, one of the biggest growth areas in ethanol production is coming from cooperatives. 
But no matter who makes ethanol, they will get absolutely no government funds from the ethanol program that my colleague from Arizona seeks to destroy through a tax hike. 
The ethanol program doesn't even fit the criteria outlined by the corporate subsidy reform bill introduced by Senator McCain. 
One key test under his bill is whether or not government spending benefits the public, as opposed to a narrow group of corporations. Numerous studies have demonstrated that ethanol incentives provide tremendous economic, energy, and environmental benefits to the public. 
Those who oppose the ethanol program are not trying to eliminate a subsidy; they are attempting to impose a tax increase upon America's motorists. 
And we all know that the power to tax is the power to destroy, and that is just exactly what will happen if the anti-ethanol forces win. 
Ask the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America what will happen. If you deny them the alternative of ethanol-blended gasoline as a supply option, many will no longer be able to compete with the major oil companies. Many independents will be forced out of business by big oil, and gasoline prices will rise. 
And rise indeed: According to recent economic analysis, the termination of the ethanol program would force motorists to pay an extra $3 billion for gasoline! 
The Midwest Governors Conference analysis of the ethanol program found that it provides a 20-1 return on investment. It adds $4.5 billion annually to farm income, it reduces our trade deficit by $2 billion, and it generates $4 billion in increased federal revenues. 
Does the ethanol program promote the public interest? Absolutely. 
Is the ethanol program `corporate welfare?' Absolutely not! 
There is not one shread of credibility to accusations that the ethanol program is corporate welfare. 
Unfortunately, many of us have been caught up with misinformation. Misinformation disseminated by big oil's massive brain washing-machine, with it's hyper spin cycle that fuels the engines of tabloid journalism. 
Again, it's a massive brain-washing-machine, with a hyper spin cycle. And you thought I was going to say it was a vast right wing conspiracy. 
Mr. President, a year or so ago, Senator McCain produced a white-paper which analyzed and critiqued our nation's current defense planning assumptions which require us to be prepared to go it alone simultaneously fighting wars in two regions of the world, and do so with a win-win objective. He concluded that our financial and military resources are stretched too thinly to meet the demands of such a defense plan. 
We may not always agree, but Senator McCain rightfully takes a backseat to no one in his understanding of military affairs. 
I hope, therefore, he will take to heart my following comments which touch directly upon stretched military resources as well as the question of corporate welfare. 
Over 40 years ago, American oil producers convinced the federal government to impose oil import quotas and tariffs with the argument that we faced a national security crisis because we were importing a mere 10 percent of our oil. 
Today, our national security crisis is far more severe--we depend upon foreign energy for over 50 percent of our needs. I believe it's about 54 percent today. 
In 1995, the administration reported, and I quote:  
Growing import dependence increases U.S. vulnerability to a supply disruption because non-OPEC sources lack surge production capacity . . . petroleum imports threaten to impair national security. 
Now, Mr. President, what I am about to share, will shed light, not only upon Senator McCain's concern about our military resources being spread too thin, but also upon the very reason our petroleum imports continue to grow and continue to jeopardize our national security. 
In 1987, Secretary of Navy, John Lehman, stated that our total cost of protecting the Persian Gulf oil supply lines--forces, training, operations, bases and support--amounted to 20 percent of our total military budget. 
That amounted to $40 billion per year that taxpayers were being forced to pay to defend foreign oil. 
By any definition, this $40 billion, gold-plated military escort service is a subsidy directly benefiting the major oil companies and the Persian Gulf oil producing nations. 
So I ask, isn't this $40 billion military subsidy simply corporate welfare for an exclusive club of oil companies? 
And doesn't the expenditure of 20 percent of our military budget to defend oil supply lines partly explain the reason for and suggest solutions to the problems detailed in Senator McCain's white paper? 
What would happen if the oil companies, or even the oil producing nations, were required to pay for this $40 billion per year military escort service? 
Well, I can hear the oil importers already saying, `You either pay me now, or pay me later. We'll just pass on the cost to the American consumer with high gasoline costs.' 
My answer to that is `maybe so, but let's take a look at all the trade-offs.' 
I ask my colleagues to think about this. One analysis concluded that this $40 billion taxpayer subsidy put the real cost of imported Persian Gulf oil at $140 per barrel, during a time that U.S. domestic producers were getting about $18 per barrel. 
Is it any wonder that thousands of American independent oil producers were forced out of business during the 1980's? 
Isn't it just a little ironic that these taxpaying oil producers were being forced to subsidize the very foreign competition that was running them out of business? 
And, if they were still producing today, would we be so reliant upon foreign oil? 
Which, in turn, leads to the question of whether or not we would feel so compelled to devote 20 percent of our military resources to the Persian Gulf in the first place. 
Would it not make more sense to let the market place take over by requiring someone other than the taxpayer to pay for this military escort service? 
Wouldn't this put Oklahoma and Texas producers back in business? 
And to cap it all off, think of this: Most of this subsidized Persian Gulf oil goes not to the United States, but to our economic competitors in Europe and Japan! So here we are, subsidizing the energy of our foreign manufacturing competitors so that they can better undercut American manufacturers. 
I'm not sure what we have here: Corporate welfare? Foreign aid? Or is it Foreign corporate welfare? 
Picking up on John Lehman's admission that we must devote 20 percent of our military budget to protect Persian Gulf oil supply lines, it goes without saying that we are also talking about the lives of our sons and daughters who bravely, and honorably serve in our military. 
And as inflammatory as this may sound to some, the truth is not one of our sons and daughters have ever been asked to sacrifice life or limb to defend the supply lines and production of America's home-grown domestic fuel--ethanol. 
Isn't that worth something? Isn't that worth a mere 5.4 cent exemption from highway taxes? 
Or is your thirst of tax increases too great to resist? 
Are we that blind? Just a few months ago, officials of a Persian Gulf nation admitted publicly that they wanted American oil companies to establish operations in their country. Why? Because they knew the U.S. military would then most definitely come to the rescue if that country faced aggressive military action from a neighboring country. 
A few months ago, four of our nation's top national security experts wrote to congressional leaders calling for increased support for ethanol. 
They warned, and I quote: 
The domestic ethanol industry provides fuels that reduce imports . . . We implore Congress of the United States to continue and indeed strengthen tax incentives for the ethanol industry. 
To do otherwise would threaten America's national and economic security, weaken its plans to improve the environment and relinquish U.S. world-wide leadership in the biofuels area. 
This letter was signed by: General Lee Butler USAF (Ret.) Former Commander, Strategic Air Command, Desert Storm; R. James Woolsey, Former Director of the CIA; Robert McFarland, Former National Security Advisor to the President; and Admiral Thomas Moorer USN (Ret.), Former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
Mr. President, by using ethanol, Americans reduce by 98,000 barrels a day, the amount of oil and MTBE that must be imported. 
But the ethanol program is just one of many government programs implemented to reduce our dependence upon foreign energy. Others include: Mass transit subsidies, energy efficiency and conservation programs, alternative fuel vehicle incentives, subsidies to help oil and gas producers to develop advanced technologies for exploration and extraction, programs to promote natural gas use, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
Let's face it, no single government program can eliminate dependence upon foreign oil entirely, but these various initiatives, taken together as a whole, can help reduce our vulnerability. 
I ask my friends from oil and gas states: 
Is your problem the farmer and ethanol producer from the middle west? 
Or is it OPEC and the oil sheiks from the Middle East? 
Isn't it time we started pulling together, instead of pulling apart? 
Or do you propose giving up and surrendering to the OPEC oil sheiks by eliminating all energy and conservation programs? 
If so, be prepared to face the termination of the 14 cent highway excise tax exemption for natural gas. 
Be prepared for the termination of the highway tax brake for propane, liquefied natural gas, and methanol which now only pay 13.6 cents, 11.9 cents and 9.15 cents respectively, instead of the full 18.3 cents per gallon. 
Be prepared for the termination of the percentage depletion allowance for domestic producers, which drains the treasury to the tune of $900 million per year. 
And while my colleagues from oil and gas states think about this, could they please tell us, are these tax breaks and subsidies programs to promote energy independence, or are they merely forms of corporate welfare? 
What about mass transit subsidies. I have seen figures that show some mass transit taxpayer subsidies, for capital and operations, can run as high as $15 per rider. If you assume a 20 mile ride, that comes out to a government subsidy of 75 cents per rider/mile. 
Compare the ethanol investment. Ethanol has transported people 200 billion miles at a cost to taxpayers of about 2.5 cents per mile. It's even less if you subtract the savings to our farm programs. 
So, which does a better job of reducing our dependence on foreign energy? 
Ethanol at 2.5 cents a mile, or mass transit that can cost as high as 75 cents a mile? 
We could terminate all these programs aimed at reducing our dependence upon foreign oil. 
Are we that short-sighted? Are we that parochial? I think not. 
I know we're not, because 35 Republican and 34 Democratic Senators voted to save the ethanol program extension. Senate Republican Leader Lott and Democratic Leader Daschle are both committed to extending this program. House Speaker Gingrich and Minority Leader Gephardt have both pledged to support the ethanol program. 
And I know first hand, that both President Clinton and Vice President Gore support the ethanol extension because they both called me at my farm last year to pledge their support. 
It would be true folly to destroy one of the few bright spots in our fight for energy independence. 
Ethanol production has become highly energy efficient. Today, it takes 100 Btu's to yield 135 Btu's of ethanol. In sharp contrast, it takes 100 Btu's to produce 85 Btu's of gasoline or 55 Btu's of methanol. 
And ethanol helps reduce every mobile source pollutant that EPA regulates. It reduces carbon monoxide, ozone, NOX and toxic emissions. 
Furthermore, the Department of Energy and the Argonne National Laboratory recently finished a study entitled, `Fuel-Cycle Fossil Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Fuel Ethanol Produced from Midwest Corn.' This study reported that ethanol use results in a 50-60 percent reduction in fossil energy use and a 35-46 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. 
Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me and voting against the McCain tax hike amendment. 
Ethanol is good for national security. It is good for the environment. It is good for America's motorists. It is good for our balance of trade. It is good for our farm economy. 
I have said it before, but it bears repeating. Ethanol is just plain good, good, good.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I am pleased to join with my friend and colleague Senator Jeffords, to help spotlight and preserve an important part of America's and Iowa's heritage--covered bridges. This amendment will help our states to do the rehabilitation and preservation work necessary to maintain these icons of the open road. I urge the adoption of this amendment. 
There is a romance concerning our Nation's covered bridges. They bring forth pictures of a different time in American history. It was a time when life moved more slowly, both on and off the road. It was time when travelers could take the time to enjoy the scenery as they unhurriedly passed by. Now it seems that most of us are in a hurry to get to our next destination, with little or no time to observe and enjoy the passing scene. 
Today, I am happy to say, these bridges are drawing tourists. In Iowa this is in no small part due to a very popular book which was made into a movie. `The Bridges of Madison County' has greatly helped to focus attention on covered bridges. For Iowa, the book and movie have helped to increase our tourism industry. For our Nation, the book and movie have helped to bring into full view of the public a unique part of our transportation and cultural heritage. This attention for the covered bridges is well deserved. 
Maintenace and protection of these bridges is expensive. It is well that we take steps at the federal level to help the states preserve and protect these structures of beauty and grace. They are truly a national enhancement, a vital part of our history, and deserving of our special attention.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to further protect taxpayer rights. 
Mr. President, I have long championed taxpayer rights. In 1989, I co-authored the first ever taxpayer bill of rights with Senator David Pryor of Arkansas. We joined forces again in 1996 to pass the sequel known as T2, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2. Yet, my work as a member of the National Commission on the Restructuring of the IRS and as a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee led me to believe that we need even more taxpayer protections. In addition, we need to make a concerted effort to educate taxpayers of their rights and the IRS tax procedures. 
The findings of the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service, of which I was a member, recommended increasing taxpayer rights. The Senate Finance Committee recently concluded months of hearings that demonstrated to us, and to the public, that American taxpayers are being treated unfairly by the IRS. I cannot sit idly by and let this happen to the American people. 
For a start, last year Senator Kerrey and I introduced legislation that would implement the Restructuring Commission's proposals, including the taxpayer rights recommendations. The House of Representatives, when considering identical legislation, weakened some of the provisions. To its credit, the House also added some strong, imaginative protections in return. I applaud everyone who works to increase taxpayer rights, and to give the unrepresented taxpayer a louder voice against the IRS. 
With introduction of this legislation, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 3, or T3, I am saying that I want to see the strongest taxpayer protections possible in any Senate-passed IRS restructuring legislation. The bill I am introducing today, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 3, contains the strongest provisions from both the Kerrey-Grassley bill and from the House-passed bill, and also some additional protections. 
This bill takes a two-pronged approach to assure taxpayer rights. First, it increases basic taxpayer rights. It helps place a check on IRS collection actions. It gets the IRS off the back of delinquent taxpayers who are making good faith efforts to resolve disputes, and it prohibits the IRS from harassing and abusing taxpayers. Specifically, it requires the IRS to obtain court approval before seizing taxpayer property or belongings. Further, it requires that the levy is reasonable. If the IRS is levying a principal residence or business, then the IRS must have exhausted all other payment options, including the use of installment agreements. It also increases taxpayer rights by allowing honest citizens to sue the IRS when its employees negligently disregard provisions of the code or regulations. 
It also requires the IRS to enter into installment agreements for tax liability that is less than $10,000, if the taxpayer has not failed to file or pay taxes in the last 5 years, and has no prior installment agreements. It also requires the Commissioner to catalog and review taxpayer complaints of misconduct by IRS employees, and develop procedures for review and discipline. It expands the grounds on which taxpayers can sue the IRS for civil damages to include negligent actions. These are only a few of this bill's provisions. 
Another inequity that is solved is the difference between interest on tax overpayments and underpayments. Currently, the IRS charges you more in interest on money you owe to it, than it gives you on money that it owes you. This is simply not fair. 
Another unfairness that occurs is that the IRS does not have to live by the same collection rules that creditors live by. My bill prohibits the IRS from communicating with a delinquent taxpayer at any unusual time or place, generally prohibiting telephone calls other than between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. It also prohibits the IRS from harassing or abusing delinquent taxpayers. 
The second prong of my bill increases taxpayer education, notice and resources. Taxpayers must be aware of their rights in order to take advantage of them. Recent hearings have exposed IRS strategies that target the little guy by using his lack of knowledge about the process and about his rights against him. I 
intend to bring this unjust practice to an end. My bill establishes a 24-hour a day, toll-free taxpayer help line. This help line must be staffed at all times by a person trained in helping individual taxpayers, and during regular business hours by a person trained to help small businesses. All paper communications received from the IRS must prominently display this phone number, as well as the number of the local taxpayer advocate, low-income taxpayer clinics and the toll-free number for taxpayers to register complaints of misconduct by IRS employees. 
In addition, the IRS must inform taxpayers of their rights and IRS processes. This includes notice at the time of an interview, in a first notice of appeal, and in other contacts with the IRS. Taxpayers also must be notified of their right to refuse to extend the statute of limitations when the IRS asks the taxpayer to extend this time.  
Mr. President, this bill sends a clear signal to the IRS: put the customer first. Blame only those who are guilty. To this end, my bill is missing one provision that is vital to taxpayer rights reform. Today, in addition to introducing my own freestanding legislation, I am adding myself as a cosponsor to Senator D'Amato's innocent spouse reform bill. Innocent spouses are caught in the trap of joint and several liability and are unfairly saddled with another's tax debt. If we are truly trying to bring fairness and equity to the American tax system, then strong, and retroactive innocent spouse reform must be a part of any IRS reform bill. 
Finally, I'll be working during Finance Committee and Senate consideration of IRS reform legislation to give taxpayers the rights they deserve. This bill, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 3, is the first step in this direction. Let the word ring clear: The era of IRS bullying is over.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in earlier remarks, I indicated a number of problems in our domestic drug control efforts. I intend now to highlight some of the problems in our international control efforts. Many past problems in this area have been documented in testimony before the House and Senate and in reports issued by the Congress. Let me give just a few highlights of recent issues that speak of deep problems. 
I am concerned that the Administration seems only too willing to give drug producing pariah states a pass. Recently Senator Helms and I wrote the Secretary of State on North Korea. We wanted to know why, with indications that the Government of North Korea is implicated in drug production, that there was not more effort to confront this pariah state. The response was that we don't know enough. Well, why don't we know enough? Basically because we are not asking the questions. We are not putting our collection assets on the problem. 
This is one way of avoiding confronting North Korea on drug trafficking. This is a country apparently whose only two cash crops are nuclear weapons and illegal drugs. Yet, we ignore their drug activities and provide them help with nuclear materials. This is not the only dictatorship and enemy of the United States that this Administration is declining to confront for drug production and trafficking. 
During the recent recess, the Administration pulled another rabbit out of its hat. In the process, it once again showed its disregard for both requirements in law and for consulting with Congress. Mr. President, most members are probably not aware that the Administration has dropped Syria from the countries that we certify on drugs. The rationale the Administration offers for this move, done without consulting with Congress or Israel, is that what drug production there is in Syria does not affect the United States. That is not, of course, what last year's International Narcotics Control Strategy report, the Administration's own report, said. It is not what presidential certification notices have said. It is not what the Israelis report. It does not accord with the realities of international drug trafficking and the nature of the activities of organized criminal gangs. But there's more to the story. The Administration says it made this decision strictly on interpreting the law. In its reading of the law, the Administration argues that Congress did not mean to include countries like Syria where production is not coming to the United States. That is a singular interpretation, however. 
I have here a copy of an interpretation by the Senate Legislative Council's office pointing out where the Administration's reading of the law is in error. I also note that the Administration undertook this significant change in policy based on the legal opinion of a single State Department lawyer. They did this without consulting with anyone in Congress. And, in my view, they did it by not complying with the law. 
What all this means is empty gestures that send useless signals to pariah states. The fact that it does this by using U.S. drug policy as the throw away issue tells us a lot about how seriously this Administration takes our international counter-drug efforts. 
The law requires the Administration to submit to Congress each November 1 the list of countries to be considered for certification. My staff reminded the State Department of this requirement in late October. It became clear, however, that Administration officials had no intention of meeting that requirement. Only under pressure did they finally get the paperwork up here, 10 days late. This tardiness was in spite of the fact that they promised not to be late, after having been weeks late in 1996. And they were weeks late then even after Congress gave them an extra month to get the list up here. This list, as I say, was late. I note also, that in being late, the Administration submitted it just days before the Congress recessed. That is, it submitted a document that contained a controversial decision without consultation or the opportunity for serious discussion. 
Not only did the Administration not seek to consult on this important issue before the decision, it delayed action to avoid accountability after the decision. What next? Having ignored North Korea and having given Syria a wink, can we expect the Administration to certify Iran? Don't laugh. That was under consideration. The Administration cannot confirm significant changes in Iran's drug control efforts, but it was prepared to take Iran's word on the matter. It was only when J.C. Watts and I and several other Members of Congress blew the whistle on this that the idea was dropped. What was going on here? Why all the sneaking around? Iran suggests more cultural exchanges and the Administration plans to certify them as doing the right stuff on drugs. Once again, we are going to use our drug control policy to make gestures to our sworn enemies. What is wrong with this picture? Do these steps, this lack of consultation, suggest a deficit of seriousness on drugs? 
There's more. The Administration has also been mounting an effort to deconstruct the annual certification process. With all the misinformation being floated around about that process, it may be hard for the public and members of Congress to get at the facts. Let me just make a couple of points. Certification is about accountability. It is about expecting the Administration and governments in the major drug producing and transiting countries to take drug control seriously. It is about establishing standards to measure that seriousness. It is about expecting the Administration to then report on compliance with those standards to the Congress and the public. Let me note also, that recent and past polls indicate that the public supports tough standards. The Administration, however, it trying to undo this. For an Administration that has a record of avoiding accountability standards, this should come as no surprise. This is yet another area where the Administration is mounting an effort to weaken or disregard performance measures. 
But let me continue. On the issues I deal with on the International Drug Caucus, I see an Administration that doesn't follow through. Let me give just one case in point. This concerns nominations. The important post of the Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics Control remains vacant. We have yet to see a nomination. It has been vacant for many months. The post of Commissioner of Customs remains vacant. On this latter point, however, I am happy to see some movement, at last. Still, that critical post has been vacant for over six months. 
I also note that the Office of National Drug Control Policy has recently asked Congress to give them new presidential appointment positions. But the important post of Demand Reduction Deputy has not seen a qualified nominee in several years. It is vacant. The critical post of Supply Reduction Deputy has been empty since the Administration took office in 1993. These are the two most important posts in that office. Vacant. Unqualified candidates. Inaction. This is the legacy. 
The Administration also continues to send mixed signals to our partners in Latin America on drug control. Leaving aside the retreat on certification, the Administration cannot seem to get clear on its priorities. There are a number of examples, but I'll stick to one. In 1994, the Administration almost destroyed one of our most important information-sharing programs with Peru. This program enabled the closing of the drug smuggling air bridge. Congress stepped in to prevent the cutoff of information to this highly effective program. 
Today, the major declines in coca cultivation in Peru--almost 45 percent in two years--are directly attributable to that information-sharing program that the Congress rescued. Now, the traffickers are seeking to circumvent that program by flying through Brazil. Brazil is prepared to cooperate, but the Administration cannot get its act together to make this program happen. What's more, I have learned that some in the Administration are once again in the process of considering pulling the plug on this not only in Brazil but in Peru and Colombia. If this happens, we will throw away all our recent gains. If this is not enough, the whole counter-drug program in the region is in disarray. It lacks a coherence or consistent oversight and strategic vision. But this is not the only place we see a lack of comprehensive thinking. 
There is a similar problem on our own borders. Over the past few years, I have supported efforts to increase our ability to police our borders. This has meant more funding on the Southwest Border and in Puerto Rico. The problem, however, is that there is no coherent vision coming from the Administration. What I have repeatedly asked for is a more comprehensive concept for the whole southern tier. We keep seeing plans for this place or that place. Now we hear plans about sealing the Southwest Border with technological wonders. We know, however, that the traffickers adjust to our control efforts. Thus, if we focus here, they shift over there. And they can shift faster. 
As a recent Christian Science Monitor piece notes, we're seeing Miami Vice two. The traffickers are moving back into the Caribbean and south Florida. We need, therefore, a plan that does not create trafficking opportunities in one area while trying to foreclose them some place else. 
But we don't see this. Instead, we see plans that rob Peter to pay Paul. 
Or we see another version of data slicing that I noted in my earlier remarks. The Administration is now double counting increases in the Border Patrol as contributions to the drug war. While INS and the Border Patrol have some responsibilities in the drug area, this is not their primary duty. Yet they are counted in drug spending. The primary responsibility at the border falls to U.S. Customs. And what is happening here? The Administration continues to under fund agents, inspectors, and intelligence support on our southern tier. Further, to strengthen the presence on the Southwest Border, the Administration robbed positions in U.S. Customs from Miami and New York and elsewhere. The result? We now see more trafficking in south Florida. It's time to stop this piecemeal approach and develop a comprehensive southern tier strategy. This will require not only more serious thinking but a look at the resources necessary to make our borders more secure. I, for one, will be looking for such an effort. 
Problems at our borders and incoherence in thinking in dealing with our international partners are not the limits to the inconsistency we see. 
I have been calling on the Administration to offer proposals for how to deal with the problem of international organized crime. A plan for bringing together comprehensive international efforts to disrupt the organizations most responsible for drug trafficking. To date we have seen nothing. The proposals are late. Sound familiar? 
From these various accounts, it should be clear that we have a drug policy in name only. What we have is a collection of things with a price tag attached. We do not see accountability. What we do see is increasing drug use among our kids. What we do not have is the coherence Congress has asked for and the public has right to expect. We need better not just more. 
With this in mind, I have proposed, separately, several initiatives to improve our drug efforts. I will be following up on those proposals. 
I have gone on at this length to make it clear to my colleagues and the public that we need a lot of work on our national drug control strategy. Above all, we need seriousness of purpose and consistent follow through. We need to know where we're going. Otherwise, we will continue to wander around, lost, on roads that take us nowhere.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is an old saying that reminds us that when you have no idea of where you're going, any road will get you there. Well, that wisdom explains a lot about our current national drug strategy. It's a poor little lamb that has lost its way. The administration has never made drug control a serious element in its policies. Oh, we have had all the right sound bites. But we have not had the sound efforts. Not now, not from the beginning. We are paying the price for this inattention. In this and a subsequent statement, I will explain in more detail why I believe our national drug efforts are in disarray. Why they need more attention, more oversight, and more consistency. 
I remind you, Mr. President, that this administration opened its doors for business with a move to gut the Office of National Drug Control Policy. It then began a process of cutting support to law enforcement, interdiction, and international control efforts. That process continued until the Congress reversed the trend in 1995. Even then, the administration did not change its tune on drug policy until the 1996 campaign. To those who might believe that none of this made any difference anyway, let me remind you of some disturbing facts. 
Let me begin with a reminder of why we have a drug policy. We have a drug control policy because this country has a big appetite for illegal drugs. We have a major problem with addiction because we have a lot of hardcore users and new initiates. We have the hardcore user problem because we ignored all the warning signs about drug use in the 1960's and 1970's and early 1980's. It was not until we woke up one morning to find many of our kids hooked and out streets war zones for traffickers that we understood our mistake. Although we began late, we did begin to address the problem of drug use, production, and trafficking. 
Despite what many believe, the war on drugs in the late 1980's and early 1990's was not a failure. Indeed, there is not a single other major social program into which we put money and effort that can demonstrate the significant progress we made in reducing teen drug use. We were less successful with hardcore addicts. But, as anyone who knows who has dealt with well-established addiction, there is no cure. Even success is measured in multiple treatment episodes. 
Treatment can stretch over a lifetime with limited results. A typical addict may go through treatment a dozen times, and success does not always mean ending addiction--only the moderation of use. Thus, our folly in the 1960's and after in ignoring the dangers of drug use, laid the foundations for an addict population that remains a problem today. But we had made great strides in convincing a new generation of kids to say no to drugs. The results were dramatic and, if sustained, promised to return us, gradually, to a largely drug-free community. 
But, as I have noted here before, we did not sustain the successes. We did not sustain the effort. The present administration shifted our priorities and our messages. We were told that we needed more focus on treatment. We were told we needed less talk about enforcement. We were told all these changes would be better. We were assured drug use would stay down. What happened? Well, the results are in. They have been accumulating for years. 
They tell a revealing tale: Teen drug use reversed the downward trend. It is now on the rise and getting worse. The age of onset of use dropped to younger kids. Negative attitudes about the dangers of drug use went south. The legalization movement found a bag man to fund its efforts and is active on many fronts all over the country. We now see Hollywood and our music moguls back to pushing drug themes in movies and music. We see our major companies and advertisers dropping support to drug-free advertising. We see our major networks give less attention to this advertising. And now we know what happens. The consequence has been a growing drug crisis among our kids. This is no accident. We saw decisions made on wrong assumptions that have got us to this state. It's embarrassing and it's frustrating. And the administration still is lagging behind. It is just not serious. Having said this, let me give you just a few examples to illustrate the point. 
I started by noting the cuts at the drug czar's office from the early days of the administration. That was not an isolated event. We saw the problem beginning with the White House's whole cavalier attitude toward drug use and drug testing among employees there. We saw it continued by the I-didn't-inhale atmosphere. As a result, we lost the `Just Say No' message from the start. But there was more than this. The administration also began to reduce support to interdiction and law enforcement. This has been well documented and I won't repeat that now. Suffice it to say that the administration substituted reducing supply reduction for reducing supply. The legacy of neglect and indifference continues. 
Let me illustrate my point with a number of concrete examples. What these various cases I am going to talk about illustrate, when added together, is the lack of seriousness by the administration on drug policy. They are illustrative of the fragmented, incoherent thinking that has contributed to our growing crisis of teenage use. 
In these remarks, I will focus on domestic issues. Later, I will discuss international problems. In either case, we have a peck of trouble. 
Let me begin with some of those troubles. In the past 5 years of this administration, drug use among kids has doubled over the levels before it took office. Those increases came on top of almost a decade of declines. Although the use numbers are from every major survey of drug use, many the government's own numbers, the administration continues to argue that drug use is down. The President did this most recently in releasing the National Strategy and his State of the Union Address. He takes credit for this. How does the administration explain the difference between the claims and the facts? Simple. It charts drug use trends from the 1980's, when the numbers were getting better, in order to disguise present trends, when the numbers are getting worse. It also plays fast and loose with the figures. 
They make the numbers work for them by doing what is called `data slicing.' What that means is that you focus on only one part of the data while ignoring the whole. Thus, in discussing the most recent teenage drug use survey, the administration makes much of the fact that use among eighth graders went down. What the administration did not say, however, is that use was up in every other category. And, it failed to note that the indicators of use being down among eighth graders was not statistically significant. 
This is what the Wall Street Journal had to say:  
Clearly, the recent data from the Monitoring the Future Study are far more discouraging than the president has implied. If the president and his administration insist on talking credit for negligible improvements in relatively small cohorts, then they must accept responsibility for the overall dismal record that they have complied over five years.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this playing with the numbers is of a piece with another fact. The administration has consistently avoided providing Congress and the public with accountable standards of performance on drug control as required by law. Although the law creating the national drug strategy requires annual quantifiable performance measures, this administration has not complied with the law from its first day. Although the present drug czar has repeatedly promised such standards, we have yet to see them. And what they propose to send us is not a report on performance but a methodology for reporting on performance. 
If that system is ever put into place, we won't seek any accountability based on them until after this administration leaves office. Does this oversight strike you as paying serious attention to drug policy? Not to mention the law? 
But this is not all. What the administration has also proposed is a formula for downgrading the whole effort to have a national strategy. The administration's proposal for reauthorizing the drug czar's office drops the idea of a national strategy for an annual report. It proposes a 10-year strategy document instead. The effect of this sleight-of-hand is to reduce the drug strategy to a proforma exercise, which, by the way, is another means to dodge accountability. This administration will leave office without ever having provided a serious accounting for its drug policy. If present trends continue, it will leave office having presided over a renewed drug epidemic. 
It is in keeping with a number of other things the administration has done to signal its real feelings about the war on drugs. 
In keeping with this pattern, this administration has one of the worst records I know of in responding to congressional requests. I am not talking about responding to all the requests for information in response to major investigations. I am talking about responses to the normal business of Government. I am still waiting for the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Justice Department to respond to questions from a hearing last May. Lest you think the questions were a burden, I only asked three. I am still waiting. 
We only recently received responses from the administration to a hearing from last October, and not even all those are in. I also have requests of or correspondence to the Department of Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, and others that are months old. It routinely takes this administration, 3, 4, 5, even 6 months to answer a letter, respond to a request, or provide answers to complete the record of hearings. And the answers are often pretty slim and uncommunicative. This is an administration that needs to do a lot of explaining. 
The administration is now proposing to undermine the laws on cocaine sentencing. Let me note at the outset, that contrary to the impression in some quarters, the United States does not, I repeat, does not fill its jails with nonviolent drug offenders. It does not fill its jails with simple users. The majority of felons in our jails for drug crimes are there for trafficking and violent crimes. In the face of the drug epidemic, Congress passed and the public supported tougher sentencing for dealers and traffickers who pushed crack to our kids. 
Now, however, the administration is planning to walk backwards on crack. The administration plans to deal with a disparity in crack and powder cocaine sentencing by reducing sentencing for crack. Instead of lowering the boom they're lowering the standards. This is hardly a message to be sending at a time when use of drugs is on the rise. But it is in character with what we have seen. 
From our borders to our streets, we see a similar image. We see disarray and a lack of seriousness. Let me share with you one last example to illustrate why I am a little frustrated. Recently, $3.5 million was set aside on ONDCP's budget to assist parent groups in prevention work with youth. Keep that number, $3.5 million in mind. Remember, it was intended to support parent groups. Also keep in mind that these groups have a long track record of working with parents on drug prevention. Now, here goes. Of that $3.5 million, ONDCP pocketed $500,000 that did not go to the parent groups. That leaves $3 million. So far so good. That money was transferred to the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) at HHS. Of that, it appears that CSAP kept $600,000, presumably for administrative costs. That leaves $2.4 million for parent groups. Of that, CSAP awarded a private contractor, with no experience in parent movements and drug prevention, some $900,000. The purpose was to develop a program for parent groups. Never mind that the parent groups were the experts. Never mind that the contractor then had to spend its money talking to these same parent groups on how to help parent groups. Never mind that the parent groups have disavowed the resulting study and the proposed prevention effort as unworkable. That left roughly $1.5 million for the parent groups. That is to be spread over 2 years. It is to be shared by several different groups. The result? Each group will receive less than $70,000 a year, hardly enough to cover their costs. Is it any wonder that so many prevention groups have a hearty dislike for CSAP. This is hardly a reassuring story. It is, unfortunately, not atypical. It is a small example that explains a lot. 
These are only some of the examples of problems in our drug control program. I will have more to say about failures and shortcomings in our international efforts later. The story there is just as grim.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President. I would like to draw attention to a problem in our drug control program. It concerns something that the Department of Defense (DoD) is not doing. And frankly it's embrassing. Today, the men and women of federal law enforcement constantly put their lives at risk in an effort to fight the increasing flow of illicit drugs into our country. Not only do we face the threat of an increase of drugs in our children's schools and on our streets, but our law enforcement officers continue to face a rising tide of violence at our borders and in our cities as a result of the drug trade. We continue to see the flow of narcotics across the Southern tier of the U.S. to include Puerto Rico. Law enforcement personnel, with their commitment to the mission to fight the war on drugs, work many long hours, sometimes late into the evening and are subject to changes in their schedules at a moment's notice. The families of these officers also feel the pressures of the job they perform. This brings me to the point I would like to make. 
The front lines of the U.S. Customs Service do not involve just a problem of gun-toting drug thugs. Agents face more than long hours and risky situations. While they deal with all these things, they must shoulder the additional burden of coping with bureautic bumbledom. This added load is a result of DoD officiousness and unwillingness to cooperate. The language of instruction in Puerto Rico public schools is Spanish and not English. Therefore, the only affordable English-language school option for U.S. Customs personnel is the DoD school. However, current legislation and DoD policy is creating a hardship for Customs employees and their families. This unnecessarily affects our counter-drug efforts by undermining morale. 
It is understanding that the children of these law enforcement personnel have been attending DoD schools in Puerto Rico for more than 20 years. Throughout the years, changes in legislation and DoD policy have placed numerous restrictions on Customs and other Federal civilian agencies. Customs has recently augmented its workforce in Puerto Rico under its Operation Gateway initiative in light of the continuing and heightened threat of narcotics smuggling and money laundering in the Caribbean Basin. I supported this initiative. 
This session I will also stress the need for better coordination of our interdiction strategy, particularly the need to develop a `Southern Tier' concept. This initiative will strive to focus resources in a more comprehensive way to protect our southern frontier. Puerto Rico is crucial to this strategy. Current legislation and DoD's policy requirements are, however, obstacles to the effective implementation of this aggressive enforcement initiative in terms of recruitment and retention of Customs employees because, as I stated earlier, there are no English speaking public schools in Puerto Rico. 
In my view, it is unfair that Customs agents and Inspectors in Puerto Rico--the men and women who deal daily with difficult and dangerous situations--should find their attention distracted by something like this.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on February 4, I joined Senator D'Amato in introducing legislation to repeal a provision of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which penalizes hospitals that provide appropriate and efficient care. This law punishes hospitals that make use of the full continuum of care and discourages them from moving patients to the most appropriate levels of post-acute care. 
The current hospital prospective payment system is based on an average length of stay for a given condition. In some cases, patients stay in the hospital longer than the average and in other cases their stay is shorter. Historically, a hospital has been reimbursed based upon an average length of stay regardless of whether the patient remained in the hospital a day less than the average or a day more than the average. When the Balanced Budget Act transfer provision takes effect, however, this will no longer be the case. 
This new policy penalizes facilities that transfer patients from the hospital to a more appropriate level of care earlier than the average length of stay. It encourages hospitals to ignore the clinical needs of patients and keep them in the most expensive care setting for a longer period of time. In short, it offers an incentive for hospitals to provide an unnecessary level of care, for an unnecessary length of time. 
The transfer policy is particularly hard on hospitals in low-cost states like Iowa, where the cost of implementation has been estimated at $25 million a year. Because Iowa's hospitals practice efficient medicine, they have average lengths of stay well below the national average. These hospitals will be hit especially hard. This kind of perverse incentive is part of the problem with Medicare, not part of the solution. 
I understand that there may be concerns about abuses by some hospitals moving patients to lower levels of care sooner than is clinically appropriate. If that is a problem, let's attack it. But let's not punish all hospitals--especially the most efficient for the sins of a few others. 
In addition to the irrational incentives this policy creates, there is the very real problem of administering it. This law holds hospitals accountable for the actions of patients that are no longer under their care. If a Medicare beneficiary were discharged from the hospital without the expectation of a need for further care and circumstances changed, the hospital would not be entitled to the full Medicare payment. But the reality is that, the hospital may or may not know of this change. The law sets hospitals up for accusations of fraud due to events that are completely beyond their control. 
This law is a serious roadblock to the provision of appropriate and efficient care. The repeal of this legislation will help ensure that logical coordinated care remains a primary goal of the Medicare program.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as I have noted on earlier occasions, this country continues to face a major drug problem. It is a problem that affects us all. No community escapes the consequences of drug use. Our streets and neighborhoods are made dangerous and unwelcoming by those who peddle illegal drugs. Our places of work are not drug free. Today, we live in a country where even our schools are not safe havens from the ravages of drugs. 
In just a few days, the Administration will release its newest drug strategy. It will be welcome, even though it is two weeks late. I look forward to it, even as the Administration undertakes efforts to do away with an annual drug strategy. The budget for drugs will be increased. That, too, is welcome. But we need to remind ourselves that despite steady increases in our counter-drug spending, we have seen increases in drug use by kids. 
This is a fact that the Administration has tried to sugar coat. It has tried to disguise the fact that drug use among kids has steadily increased throughout its tenure. Despite recent efforts by the Administration to paint over this fact with rhetoric, the facts remain. 
We cannot fight drug use among our kids by being less than honest. We should not even try. But there is another lesson in our current and growing problem. I believe that the Administration has not done as much as it ought to do. I believe it has left undone much that it should do. But, our drug problem is a national concern that must go beyond what government can do. We must remind ourselves that this is a problem that we must all confront. Parents, community and religious leaders, the business community, local politicians, the media, Hollywood, and our opinion leaders must come together. We need more than just money. We need commitment. We need more than rhetoric. 
Every day more of our kids start using illegal drugs. We need to roll up our sleeves and get to work. 
For these reasons, I am today presenting a ten-point program to fight back. This is my agenda to try to get our counter-drug efforts back on the front burner. We need to better define the problem, and we need to be doing more. As Chairman of the International Narcotics Control Caucus, I will work to push a more visible and effective national counter-drug effort. 
The first item on my agenda is to continue work to strengthen local community counter-drug problems. Last year, I sponsored legislation in the Senate, later signed into law, that provides funding to local community counter-drug coalitions. I will continue my efforts to ensure that this legislation is fully, speedily, and responsibly implemented. 
Second, I will continue to work on implementing a statewide coalition effort in Iowa that I began last year. The aim of this effort is to help create a framework to complement state and local efforts to combat illegal drugs in communities across Iowa. Working with such national organizations as Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, we are engaged in a project that can become a template for other states. The coalition will foster input and guidance from a non-political steering committee and six task forces. These include members from Iowa business and union leaders, the education community, religious leaders, and representatives from law enforcement. They also involve contributions from the media, doctors, and community anti-drug groups. 
Third, I will be calling upon our national business leaders and advertisers to renew their commitment to drug-free advertising. We have seen in recent years a decline in this commitment. That decline lead to the use of public money to pay for advertizing. 
But more to the point, I am concerned about what it says about the declining commitment of our business community to support a national effort to fight drug use. This is especially true given the problems that drug use creates in the workplace. 
Fourth, I will be seeking more resources for communities across the country to deal with an emerging drug problem. This is the double whammy of methamphetamine. Communities in the West and Middle West face not only growing meth use problems. They also face a new trend: Mexican criminal organizations are increasingly building meth labs in our communities and rural areas. Meth is being funneled into Iowa by these organizations. Labs are also increasingly being discovered. These create an environmental hazard that is often beyond the resources of local police or fire organizations to deal with. Last year, I co-sponsored an effort to increase funding to these communities for meth lab clean up. I will expand that effort to ensure sustainable funding to help local communities. 
Fifth, I will continue to press the Administration for a comprehensive drug strategy. One of the major deficits in our current effort is not a lack of funding but a lack of focus. I propose to deal with that through greater oversight of our national efforts. In particular, I will push for a more comprehensive southern tier approach. Too often, our efforts to control access to our southern border have been piecemeal and fragmented. The forthcoming national drug strategy will perpetuate that imbalance. 
While we build a dyke in one area, the traffickers open a hole someplace else. We need a more focused effort that brings resources to bear consistently. We also need to ensure that our major drug control agencies receive adequate resources that implement consistent, well-conceived and integrated plans. 
As part of this effort, I will pursue more vigorous oversight of our counter-drug programs. 
I will do this through insisting that we maintain a strong commitment to the annual certification process on international drug control. I will continue efforts to investigate specific programs and activities to ensure that our efforts are on track and producing results. I will also seek to ensure that our efforts to protect the integrity of our law enforcement activities is a priority. 
I will also pursue legislation that will provide greater authority to our law enforcement community to break the link between drug trafficking and alien smuggling. Many of our local communities find that drugs are introduced or produced by illegal aliens. I have supported increased resources to both U.S. Customs and the INS. I will continue my personal efforts to ensure adequate resources and focus at our borders and in our local communities. 
As the eighth point in my agenda, I will pursue tougher penalties for those who traffic and sell drugs. In particular, I will seek enhanced penalties for trafficking or selling near our schools and for peddling drugs to minors. 
As an integral part of this effort, I will also seek to toughen, not weaken, cocaine sentencing guidelines. I believe it sends an entirely wrong signal to lessen mandatory minimum sentences for those who traffick in crack cocaine. The Administration is proposing to weaken sentencing at a time when drug use is increasing. It is typical of the disconnect between the rhetoric we hear and the reality we see. Like the Administration, I will support efforts to bring powder cocaine sentencing into line with crack cocaine. But I will seek to do this by supporting Senator Abraham's efforts to enhance the sentences for trafficking powder cocaine, not by weakening our efforts. 
Finally, as part of my action plan, I will continue to work to strengthen our ability to deal with money laundering and organized criminal activities. The drugs that reach our streets and target our kids do not get there by accident. They are directed there by well-organized, international criminal gangs. Their purpose is to make money at the expense of our kids. I will work to pass legislation that I introduced last year to go after the profits of these drug thugs. I will also continue to press the Administration to develop comprehensive legislation to go after international criminals wherever they may hide. 
This agenda is my personal commitment to do what one Senator can do to deal with this nation's drug problem. I will pursue this agenda as Chairman of the Drug Caucus. In the coming days and weeks, I will be introducing specific legislation to deal with many of the things I have talked about today. I will be coming to my colleagues for support. I will be expecting the Administration to live up to its obligations. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. 
Mr. President, I want to make a few comments on the nomination of Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson to the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. 
Recent resistance to her nomination has moved beyond individual opponents to wide-spread, bipartisan opposition. We've heard about opposition from the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association. 
Additional opposition comes from a Philadelphia lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, as well as the Fraternal Order of Police, National Legislative Program. The F.O.P. has written letters to the Senate and the President voicing their concerns over the safety and welfare of the Philadelphia police force if Judge Massiah-Jackson is confirmed. They fear her established record of being extremely lenient on criminals and her insensitivity to victims of crime will `pose a direct threat' against police. Also, the National Association of Police Organizations, which represents more than 4,000 police unions and associations and over 220,000 sworn law enforcement officers, opposes the confirmation of Judge Massiah-Jackson. 
If this isn't a strong indication of the problems this nominee's confirmation would cause, I don't know what is. 
The Northampton County District Attorney has also written a letter to the Senate detailing twelve separate instances illustrating the improper conduct of Judge Massiah-Jackson. The facts on which the letter is based were compiled from internal memorandums, court transcripts and other documents from the office of the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office. The most egregious example disclosed by the letter was a 1988 acquittal of a man charged with possession of two and a half pounds of cocaine. The acquittal was the second by Judge Massiah-Jackson of alleged drug dealers arrested by the same police officers. In open court she told these arresting officers, who were working undercover, to turn around and told the drug dealers and other spectators to `take a good look at the undercover officers and watch yourselves.' The incident was reported in a Philadelphia newspaper and, as has been mentioned, the Judiciary Committee has also received the signed statements of Detective Sergeant Daniel Rodriguez and Detective Terrance Jones, the officers involved. This conduct not only significantly reduced the crime fighting effectiveness of the officers, but more importantly, they believed it put their lives in serious peril. This is not the type of conduct expected from a Judge, nor can it be tolerated. 
In addition to this letter, the members of the Judiciary Committee also received a letter from Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham, who stands in opposition to this nomination. The opinion of Mrs. Abraham, who by the way is a Democrat, is particularly relevant since she campaigned with and served on the bench at the same time as Judge Massiah-Jackson. Mrs. Abraham concludes that, `the nominee's record presents multiple instances of a deeply ingrained and pervasive bias against prosecutors and law enforcement officers and, by extension, an insensitivity to victims of crime. Moreover, the nominee's judicial demeanor and courtroom conduct, in my judgment, undermines respect for the rule of law and, instead, tends to bring the law into disrepute.' She further notes that, `this nominee's judicial service is replete with instances of demonstrated leniency towards criminals, an adversarial attitude towards police, and disrespect and a hostile attitude towards prosecutors unmatched by any other present or former jurist with whom I am familiar.' 
These are not the biased opinions of racist or sexist opponents, as some have irresponsibly charged. They are the informed opinions of respected district attorneys and law enforcement officers with personal knowledge of the nominee. In fact, District Attorney Abraham has publicly said she `firmly believes the next appointee to the U.S. District Court here should be an African-American woman. But that appointee should be one of the many eminently well-qualified African-American women lawyers in the area, and not Massiah-Jackson.' 
Despite these fact-based opinions, supporters of the nominee have repeatedly insisted that she should not be judged on a few cases, and that her overall record can be characterized as fair to law enforcement and crime victims. They also point out that sentencing statistics show she is right in line with other judges. I must say these arguments are misleading, as demonstrated by the statistics provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee. 
In reality, Judge Massiah-Jackson deviated from state sentencing guidelines, in favor of criminals, more than twice as often as other judges according to statistics compiled by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing. From 1985 till 1991, Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced below the Pennsylvania guidelines 27.5 percent of the time. Other Pennsylvania judges sentenced below the guidelines in only 12.2 percent of the cases. This record cannot be characterized as fair to victims or law enforcement, and is not in line with other judges. We've also heard the argument that district attorneys regularly disagree with judges. Well, Mr. President, in the seventeen years I've been voting on judicial nominees, I don't ever recall such local, public opposition as we've seen in this case. This is truly unprecedented. 
We in the Senate can no longer overlook and excuse a record that is clearly against the interests of law enforcement personnel and victims of crime, or professional conduct which is below the dignity of a judge. No person, of any race or any gender, should be able to serve on the federal bench if she or he demonstrates a bias against police and prosecutors, is soft on crime and shows a lack of proper judicial temperament. For these reasons, I will oppose the confirmation of this nominee and urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments regarding the nomination of Margaret Morrow. 
Some of my colleagues on the other side have attempted to argue that Ms. Morrow has been treated unfairly. This unsubstantiated argument is based partly on the questions she was asked in the Judiciary Committee. However, all that some of us were trying to achieve in asking those questions was to attempt to understand what Ms. Morrow's views were on a number of important issues to the American people. In particular, we've had a number of Federal judges overturn popular initiatives, in direct conflict with voters' decisions. The last thing we need is another Federal judge that will defy what the voters have decided. Ms. Morrow has spoken against citizen initiatives and has publicly opposed specific ballot initiatives. So, we believed it was important to understand better what kind of a judge she might be. 
Now, we've heard Margaret Morrow was reported out of the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress without a problem. So, why is there a problem now? Well, I think to our credit, we on this side tried to give the President a great deal of deference regarding his nominees. But, as Senator Hatch and others have pointed out, the President has appointed a number of judges who have taken it upon themselves to try to make the law, and have angered the public in doing so. This record now demands the kind of scrutiny Senator Leahy advocated, which has been absent until the last couple of years or so. I've received a great deal of letters from my State asking me to do a better job of scrutinizing nominees. 
Of course, after getting used to us rubber-stamping nominees, I'm sure it's been quite a shock to see Republicans borrowing from the Democrats' playbook and turning the tables. Over the last year, I've heard irresponsible and overheated rhetoric directed at Republicans regarding judicial nominees. 
To suggest, as some misguided Members have, that Ms. Morrow's gender is a factor in our decision to ask her questions, or even oppose her nomination, is both irresponsible and absurd. As others may have noted, we've processed around 50 women judicial nominees for President Clinton, including Justice Ginsberg, and I've supported almost all of them. As a matter of fact, the first nominee unanimously confirmed last year was a woman candidate, and we've already confirmed a couple this year. It's just absurd to think that any Senator makes his or her decision on a nominee based on gender or race. 
Mr. President, I sent Ms. Morrow five pages of questions in total. As a contrast, I sent Merrick Garland 25 pages of questions. So, 5 pages versus 24 pages. And, we're supposedly unfair to Ms. Morrow. Figure that one out. 
I must say though, it was easier getting Mr. Garland to respond to his 25 pages of 100 or so questions than it was to get Ms. Morrow to answer her 5 pages. 
Mr. President, when a judicial nominee, whether a man or a woman, writes an article which is critical of democratic institutions like the citizen initiative process, it is our duty as Senators to learn the reasons for this. How can a Senator reasonably give advice and consent without understanding a potential judge's position on such fundamental issues? With the recent propensity of Federal judges, especially in California, to overturn Democratic initiatives on shaky grounds. It's important that we not confirm another activist judge who is willing to substitute his or her will for that of the voters. 
I recall during the Democrat-run confirmation hearings of various Republican nominees the issue of `confirmation conversion' was a recurrent theme. 
But, now the shoe is on the other foot. When Ms. Morrow answered written and oral questions contradicting her former beliefs on certain issues, I became somewhat concerned. Several of my followup questions related to such `conversations.' Where there are discrepancies, we have a duty to uncover the reasons why. 
But a more disturbing problem I have seen with Ms. Morrow's writing is that, on number of issues, she doesn't say her views have changed. She says we are misreading her writing. In other words, she doesn't really mean what she appears to say. 
In the 1988 article on citizen initiatives, for example, Ms. Morrow writes in language that is highly critical of the voters. She has recently responded that she `had not meant to be critical of citizen initiatives.' Yet, in her article she goes so far as to state that  
The fact that initiatives are presented to a `legislature' of 20 million people renders ephemeral any real hope of intelligent voting by a majority. 
In her statement, Ms. Morrow was basically saying that initiatives are inherently flawed, although now she is translating it differently. So this raises serious questions about Ms. Morrow's ability to enunciate her views in a clear and concise manner, which we all hope judges will do. If such conflicting messages are reflected in her writing as a lawyer, her potential judicial opinions may be equally confusing. How can citizens rely on writings of someone who has a record of contradicting herself? 
But, on top of these shortcomings, Mr. President, there is a matter of more importance. Whether intentionally or not, Ms. Morrow has, unfortunately, provided false and misleading information to the Judiciary Committee. And, I believe the integrity of the committee and the nomination process is at stake. 
When asked her views on a number of initiatives, Ms. Morrow first responded by stating unequivocally, `I have not publicly supported or opposed any initiative measure in the past decade with one exception.' And, then she mentioned a specific initiative from 1988 sponsored by the extremist Democrat, Lyndon Larouche, that she opposed. 
But, despite Ms. Morrow's unequivocal denial, in 1988 it turns out she also publicly attacked three other initiatives that pitted the insurance industry against trial lawyers. Ms. Morrow wrote, `Propositions 101, 104 and 106 were, plain and simple, an attack on lawyers and the legal system.' In 1988, she went on to attack a 1986 proposition that would have reduced the salaries of public officials. She argued it would have `driven many qualified people out of public service.' Of course, we hear that worn out argument every time we debate our own pay raises. 
Now, Ms. Morrow had stated, without question, that she had not taken any public position on these initiatives whatsoever. And, after creating this foundation of sand, she used it to refuse to answer questions on her views. 
Well, the foundation crumbled after the chairman demanded responses, and perhaps the nominee realized her misinformation had been discovered. Only then did she finally provide more responsive answers to the questions. 
But, the fact remains that regardless of whether there was an intention or motive, false and misleading information was provided to the Judiciary Committee by the nominee, an experienced lawyer, who one would presume either knew, or should have known, what she was doing. If she indeed didn't realize what she was doing, then one has to question her ability to be careful with the details, which would reflect on her ability to function as a Federal judge. 
Now, I'm sure that many of you are unaware of this problem, so I'm bringing it to your attention. Unfortunately, some have tried to make the feeble argument that these were just mistakes that should be overlooked. Well, this isn't a mistake of failing to provide articles to the committee, which the nominee did. This isn't a mistake of quoting a controversial statement of Justice Brennan, and they saying she pulled the quote from some book, but hadn't read the context of the quote, and didn't know what it meant. 
This is a major misstatement of fact, that was used as the basis for not responding to the committee. This is not what we expect from lifetime tenured judges. Mr. President, this is below the standard we all demand. This is below the standard afforded most Americans in their dealings with the government. For these reasons Mr. President, I will vote against the nominee. 
Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRASSLEY. I will only remind the Senator from California that the point I was making is not when--the question I was proposing is not when Ms. Morrow responded. The question is that she said she did not take a position on public policy issues except for that one, and she did take, we found out that she did take positions on public policy issues. So she was misleading.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a concurrent resolution to open the European market to U.S. beef exports. Last month, the Appellate Body of the World Trade Organization affirmed the earlier findings of the WTO that Europe's ban on U.S. beef violates commitments made under the Uruguay Round Agreement. The decision should clear the way for U.S. beef producers to sell their product to Europe. 
This concurrent resolution requests the European Union to open its market immediately, in light of the WTO's decision, and directs the U.S. Trade Representative to take action if the EU fails to do so. 
This dispute goes back to 1989 when the EU banned all imports of meat from animals treated with growth hormones. About 90% of U.S. cattle is treated with hormones. They have been found to be safe by every country that has studied them. In fact, twice the EU commissioned its own scientists to study the hormones and found them to be safe. 
Mr. President, to put these growth hormones in perspective: A person would have to eat 169 pounds of beef from an animal treated with a growth hormone in order to consume the equal amount of that hormone present in one, single egg. They are completely safe for human consumption. 
Yet, nine years ago, the EU decided to ban this meat from coming into its market. At that time, there was little we could do to counter the ban. We negotiated with the EU and even imposed sanctions, but nothing has worked. 
Then came the Uruguay Round Agreement. For the first time, members of the GATT agreed to eliminate trade barriers not founded on a sound, scientific basis. In other words, trade decisions would be made on sound science, not political science. Clearly, the beef ban was not based on sound science. 
In 1996, the U.S. requested a WTO panel to determine whether the EU had breached the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement of the Uruguay Round. In August of last year, the panel found in favor of the U.S. position and the decision was affirmed in January. So the WTO has decided that the European's ban on U.S. beef violates the S/PS Agreement and must be removed immediately. 
Mr. President, you would think that would be the final word on this issue. But the trade press is reporting that the Europeans are looking for ways around the decision. They want to study the issue a little longer. Even though the ban has already been in place for nine years. 
It seems to me that they have had enough time. Our farmers have suffered the effects of this ban for too long. When the ban was put in place in 1989, we were sending $100 million of beef annually to Europe. If the ban was lifted, it is estimated that beef exports would total about $250 million per year. American beef producers literally have lost hundreds of millions of dollars due to this unjustified ban. 
This concurrent resolution says to the Europeans, open your markets. You would had your day in court, now it is time to abide by the judge's decision. 
If the WTO is to have long-standing legitimacy as an objective arbiter of international trade disputes, its decisions must be respected and complied with. We expect the Europeans to respect this decision, just as the United States has complied with the decision in the Kodak-Fuji case that went against us. We do not have to like the decision. But we have to respect the dispute resolution process. 
The concurrent resolution also states if the Europeans do not immediately comply with the decision and open its markets, the U.S. Trade Representative should take action. I leave it up to the able USTR to decide what action is appropriate. But we cannot stand by and allow this decision to be ignored. 
Mr. President, enough is enough. The private sector and several government agencies have spent significant time and money attempting to resolve this dispute. And they have been proven to be correct. The European beef ban is simply a trade barrier, disguised as a health concern. No scientific evidence exists to justify it. And the WTO has said so. Now is the time for the EU to end the ban and allow American farmers and ranchers a fair chance to compete in the European market.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, lately, there has been a lot of talk about Chief Justice Rehnquist's `Year End Report on the Federal Judiciary.' As chairman of the Sucommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I have an added interest in what the Chief Justice has to say. According to some, the Chief Justice's report indicates that the federal judiciary suffers from a partisan produced `vacancy crisis.' Indeed, some critics have gone so far as to feverishly conclude that the Senate's Constitutionally mandated confirmation process has become an `obstruction of justice.' Caught up in this frenzy, some Democrats have come to the Senate Floor blaming many, if not all, of the judiciary's problems on vacancies. Vacancies, however, are not the source of the problem. 
Despite assertions to the contrary, the Chief Justice could not have been more clear on this point: Vacancies are the consequence of what he perceives to be an overburdened judiciary. In fact, the Chief Justice pointed out that it is the judiciary's increased size and expanded jurisdiction that is the major threat to justice in the United States. In his Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist warned that the federal judiciary had become `so large' that it was losing `its traditional character as a distinctive judicial forum of limited jurisdiction.'

<TEXT>
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in order to reverse this trend, the report resoundly concluded that Congress needed to reduce the jurisdiction of the federal courts. 
In the last Congress, the Republican leadership wisely pushed for measures designed to reduce the federal workload. Both the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Prison Litigation Reform Act `streamlined' procedures so as to decrease the number of potential federal court filings. These measures were praised by the Chief Justice as `promising examples of how Congress can reduce the disparity between resources and workload in the federal judiciary without endangering its distinctive character.' 
Similarly, a bill I sponsored, The Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996, included a provision that raised the threshold for diversity jurisdiction cases. It's estimated this provision alone reduced the federal workload by as many as 10,000 filings per year. 
In addition to what had been a continually expanding jurisdiction, the judiciary's increasing case filings was also a result, in large measure, from the policies and practices of the current Administration. Over the last year, the Executive Branch alone increased its number of civil filings by 23%. This increase, in addition to the increase resulting from expanded federal jurisdiction, accounted for the total overall increase in the number of civil filings in 1997. 
The policies and practices of the President have also crippled the criminal justice system. President Clinton has yet to present even a single nominee to fill the six vacancies on the seven seat Sentencing Commission. As a result, the Commission is `seriously hindered' in pursuing its important statutory functions, making it more likely that criminals may `beat the system.' 
The Ninth Circuit probably suffers the most from President Clinton's indifference to the judiciary's plight. The President sent up only six nominees to fill 10 vacant seats on the Ninth Circuit. One nominee has already withdrawn from consideration, leaving only four nominees to fill over one-third of the Circuit's total seats. To our credit, the Senate also just confirmed one of these nominees to this court a few days ago who had only been pending for a few months. Having solid qualifications and bi-partisan support, the Senate confirmation of Barry Silverman illustrates what we Republicans have long maintained. Whenever nominees can demonstrate that they follow the law as stated by the Constitution or enacted by Congress, rather than making up laws as they see fit, the Senate is prepared to expedite their nominations. 
By the latest count, there are around 83 vacant seats on the federal judiciary. When Democratic Senators controlled the confirmation process in 1991 and 1992, there were 148 and 118 vacancies respectively. Why wasn't the other side talking about a judicial crisis then? No one blamed the shortcomings of the judiciary on vacancies then, but now that Republicans control the confirmation process, 83 vacancies have all of a sudden become a `judicial crisis.' Taking into consideration the fact that there are 42 more judges sitting on the bench today than five years ago, 83 vacancies is not such an ominous figure as some would have us believe. 
Today, the Senate is working hard to confirm qualified nominees, but remains hard-pressed to fill those 83 judgeships when President Clinton has so far made only 42 nominations, which is just slightly over half of the number needed. The difficulty is only exacerbated by the President's refusal to offer new candidates after his nominees have been properly rejected by the Senate. 
The case of a nominee from Texas provides an excellent example. Both Texas Senators steadfastly rejected his nomination. Traditionally, and under Senator Biden's former chairmanship, when even one Home State Senator disapproves of a nomination, the nomination is effectively rejected. President Clinton, however, continues to press for this flawed nominee, despite the fact that other more qualified nominees could immediately replace him. 
These examples illustrate how some are trying to manipulate the vacancy issue in order to steer the public away from the real problems facing the federal judiciary. Put simply, the Chief Justice believes the judiciary's expanded jurisdiction and consequent workload is too large and needs to be cut back. Why aren't the demagogues who keep repeating the Chief Justice's point about vacancies also talking about his points of reducing jurisdiction as well as the overall number of judges? It's simple. They are being selective, because they don't agree with the Chief Justice's major arguments. They want to continually expand federal jurisdiction, and continually expand the number of judges. 
I agree with the Chief Justice that we should attempt to process qualified nominees in a timely manner and then have a vote. Of course some of the nominees we have been getting are not qualified or are flawed in some way. 
But, at the same time, Congress should refrain from expanding the overall size of the federal judiciary. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I have been conducting a review of the nation's judgeship needs. I hope to have this review completed by this summer. Although it may be true that additional judges are needed in some areas, it is also the case that judgeships should be reduced or at least not filled in other jurisdictions. 
A number of these 83 judgeships are not even needed. For instance, in the Judiciary Committee we have already made the case that the 12th seat in the D.C. Circuit should not be filled. We have had chief judges in other courts testify that they don't need seats in their courts filled. This further undermines the argument that there is some kind of a vacancy crisis. As a matter of fact, three of these vacant seats were created in 1990 and have never been filled. If they were so necessary, why didn't a Democrat-controlled Senate fill them in the four years it had to do it? I think the answer is self-explanatory, Mr. President. Those who charge that Republicans are practicing partisan politics against Clinton nominees are the same crowd that brought partisan politics to an art form against Reagan and Bush nominees. 
Mr. President, I intend to speak on this matter more as we continue to consider nominees and debate the issue of judicial vacancies further. I urge my colleagues on this side of the isle to do the same. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as we start the second session of the 105th Congress I want to outline my priorities on international trade issues from my vantage point of chairman of the Finance Committee's International Trade Subcommittee. Some of these are legislative initiatives that began in the 1st session and others are things that we should be doing everyday. 
The first thing we need to do is restore the United States to its rightful position of leading the world in liberalizing global trade. We can do this by granting the President new trade negotiating authority. The failure to pass fast track last year was harmful to American workers, American farmers and American consumers. 
Why? Free trade not only creates new, high-paying jobs/it helps preserve existing jobs. When high trade barriers prohibit U.S. companies from exporting to a foreign market, the company will choose to relocate in that other country in order to sell its product. 
The United States has one of the most open economies in the world. Our average tariff is about 2.8 percent. The world average is 12 percent. Fifty years ago it was 48 percent. Many other countries have virtually closed markets. According to the World Bank, for instance, China's average tariff is 23 percent. Thailand's is 26 percent, the Philippines 19 percent, Peru almost 15 percent, and Chile has a flat 11 percent tariff. 
It can be difficult for American companies to export to a country like China, that places a 23 percent tariff on our goods. The tariff prices our goods out of the market. So these companies move their plant to China and avoid paying the tariff. 
The preferred alternative--for American workers--is negotiating with China to lower its tariffs. Bring their tariffs down to our level. Then the companies can stay here--employ American workers--and export their goods to China. It's a `no-brainer.' 
But we can not negotiate these tariffs down without fast track authority. That is why fast track is so important. It leads to lower tariffs in foreign countries and the preservation of American jobs. 
Fast track also leads to the creation of new jobs. Exports already support 11 million jobs in the U.S. Each additional $1 billion in exports creates between 15,000 and 20,000 new jobs. These jobs pay 15 to 20 percent higher than non-export related jobs. And, in Iowa, companies that export provide their employees 32 percent greater benefits than non-exporters. 
All of this is in jeopardy without fast track. And it is the American worker who will suffer. 
Mr. President, what I am most concerned about is the vacuum of leadership on international issues that is left by the United States relinquishing this traditional role. Ever since the first Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act of 1934, the United States has led the world in reducing barriers to trade. And we have benefitted greatly from this leadership. 
American workers are the most productive, highest-paid workers in the world. American companies produce the highest quality products. And American consumers have more choices of goods and pay less of their income on necessities, such as food, than consumers of any other country. These are the benefits that we have enjoyed because we've been willing to lead on trade. 
This leadership is now being questioned by our trading partners. They are moving on without us. They're forming regional and bilateral trading arrangements that don't include the United States. 
What are the consequences for the United States? The European Union, Japan and developing countries will have a greater influence in shaping world trade policies. Should we trust Japan and the European Union to advance our interests? How hard will they push for opening markets? 
I ask my colleagues who voted against fast track because of labor and environmental concerns, how hard do you think other nations will push for raising these standards? I ask my colleagues from rural states, do you trust the European Union and Japan to push for open markets at the 1999 WTO agriculture talks? 
Only our President can advance our interests. Only the United States can influence other countries to improve their environment and labor standards, to improve human rights, and to embrace democracy through international trade. That is why the President should renew his effort for fast track authority and Congress should pass it this year. 
Congress also included a reauthorization of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program in the Senate's fast track bill. This program assures that every American who loses their job due to a free trade agreement receives the job training and assistance they deserve. No American will be left behind by our participation in the global economy. My second initiative is to secure passage of the TAA this year. 
MY third priority is to keep markets open the troubled Southeast Asian countries. I support IMF assistance of the nations in crisis. But as part of the economic reforms that the IMF requires, we must insist that the Asian countries open their markets to our exports. 
Countries have a natural inclination to close their markets in time of crisis. But this only accelerates the downward spiral they find themselves in. For their own good, they should resist the temptation to raise trade barriers. 
Also, some of these countries will attempt to increase their exports to our market in order to help their economies. If that's the case, they have a moral obligation to open their markets to our exports. And I will work to make sure that happens. 
Last week I joined with 19 of my fellow senators on a letter led by Senators Roberts and Baucus requesting a meeting with Treasury Secretary Rubin to discuss the pervasive trade barriers that remain in the Asian countries. Hopefully, that meeting will lead to a cooperative effort between Congress and the administration to remove these barriers. 
The fourth area I will be focusing on in 1998 persuading our trading partners to live up to the commitments they have made in prior trade agreements. Getting a good agreement is one thing. But we must demand compliance with our agreements on a daily basis. Many markets we thought we had opened are still closed. 
I will monitor our existing agreements and strongly urge the administration to bring enforcement actions when necessary. Trade agreements aren't worth the paper they are written on unless we put some force behind them. 
The last two initiatives I will pursue in 1998 involve agriculture trade, which is so important to my state and many others. Exports now account for over 30% of farm income in this country. Take away foreign markets, and we'd have to idle one-third of America's productive cropland. 
In recognition of the importance of foreign trade to the agriculture economy, last year Senator Daschle and I introduced S. 219 a bill creating a `Special 301' process for agriculture. This new 301 procedure requires the U.S. Trade Representative to identify and remove the most onerous barriers to U.S. ag exports. It will put other countries on notice that we are serious about gaining access to their markets. 
This bill was made part of the fast track legislation that was on the floor of the Senate at the end of last year. It is my intent to move this bill again as a part of fast track legislation or independently, if necessary. 
Finally, agriculture is preparing for another round of market access negotiations at the World Trade Organization beginning in 1999. These talks will lay down the rules on agriculture trade for the next century. I pledge to work with the administration to ensure the United States sets the agenda for these talks. 
Our trading partners do not necessarily want to remove their barriers to our ag exports. Because our farmers produce the highest quality products at the lowest cost. So American farmers will gain access to new markets only if the United States leads these negotiations and persuades other countries to open their markets. 
Mr. President, free and fair trade creates good, high-paying jobs. It raised the income of our farmers and the standard of living for our workers and consumers. Trade has contributed significantly to our strong economic growth and record low unemployment. I will continue to pursue an agenda of free and fair trade through this Second Session of the 105th Congress.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am a member of the Budget Committee, and under Senator Domenici's very good leadership, we are starting a new budget process as we do every year. Today he called a hearing of our committee to hear from Chairman Greenspan. Chairman Greenspan is a person who is very well respected, not only on both sides of the aisle by Members of the Congress, but also by the President. He was reappointed to the chairmanship of the Fed by this President. Further, he is very well respected by the people of this country and, most importantly, by people who, as investors in America, have to have confidence in the economy. I think that Chairman Greenspan exudes a great deal of confidence himself. He establishes in most everybody confidence in the economy because of his caution. Economic growth over the last several years has had a great deal to do with the steady hand of Chairman Greenspan. 
As we start a new budget season, it is very appropriate that Chairman Greenspan be invited by Chairman Domenici to come to appear before the Senate Budget Committee. 
We had a chance to listen to an outstanding presentation by Chairman Greenspan. It was relatively short, but throughout the sermon on the economy, Chairman Greenspan called for this Congress and this President to be very cautious, as we go into the budget process in this year, especially about spending, about taxes, and having too rosy a scenario about our economic future. 
He expressed a great deal of confidence that the future is very bright for our economy, but incumbent in what he said was a caution that, by unwise budget decisions, we have the capability of lousing up a rosy opportunity. He put a great deal of emphasis upon the good that comes from paying down on the national debt. He also expressed, in response to some questions, that next to paying down the debt a great deal of economic good can come from cutting marginal tax rates and cutting capital gains. None of these is an end unto themselves, but help to make sure that there is a positive attitude in this country for people who will invest to create jobs in America in order to keep this economic miracle going. 
I was very happy to hear the caution expressed by Chairman Greenspan, because I sense, as he senses--and obviously, I am back here for the first week since last fall's recess so I have not visited with a lot of my colleagues--that over the last 3 months the anticipated surplus is generating too much talk about renewed spending. The White House proposes about eight new spending programs that the President wants to create, adding up to about $63 billion--and those are not discretionary spending; for the most part those are entitlements. Some Members of Congress, want to spend more money, while other Members of Congress want to give tax cuts. I love to give tax cuts. I probably have voted for most every tax cut that has been suggested since I have been in the Senate--but I think that at this point both this Senator from Iowa and my colleagues and the President of the United States ought to follow the advice of Chairman Greenspan and exercise some caution about spending increases and tax cuts. As I said, it appears to me that a golden opportunity might be lost because we think this windfall is in our pockets already. It is like it is burning a hole in our pockets. We can hardly wait to spend it. 
I almost sense that Chairman Greenspan would like to express a couple words he cannot ever use again. I think he senses an irrational exuberance on the part of Congress and the President of the United States, just to fritter away a wonderful opportunity we have here to reestablish the confidence of the people in the economy and, particularly, in the fiscal policy of the Congress, which was adopted in a bipartisan way last year. 
So I would follow on with Chairman Greenspan and ask my 
colleagues to cool it, to make sure that we learn from history. During the last decade, the decade of the 1980's, we found it is very easy for conservatives to ask for more money to spend on defense and then, pretty soon, that opens up the door for other increased spending. Well, if we are going to spend more money on defense, liberals are going to get their hands in the cookie jar and say we have to have more money spent on domestic programs. Then there is always the other side of the aisle, people wanting tax cuts, and, as I said, I even like tax cuts. But pretty soon you are on an irresponsible approach that brings trillions and trillions of dollars of debt. 
Now, finally, after last year, it looks as if we are on a path to getting to a balanced budget, to stopping the building of the legacy of debt that our generation has left to our kids and grandkids. So I think we have to just cool it. We do not yet have this money in our pocket. Let us at least wait until it is there, and that is not going to be during this budget season. We have a historic opportunity, a windfall opportunity to do good. I know we have a strong economy, and that is where most of the praise can go--for balancing the budget even before the year 2002 as we promised. 
Also, Congress has exercised some restraint, finally. I do not think the public realizes it, but we have. Three out of four people in this country do not believe we are going to have a balanced budget when we say we are going to have it. Three out of four people, even after a bipartisan effort to accomplish it, do not believe today it is going to happen. Even with all the talk about more money coming in than anticipated, even with the President saying we are going to balance it before we said we were, still three out of four people do not believe we are going to balance the budget. So we have an opportunity, if we are cautious, as Chairman Greenspan said, to reduce that cynicism, to reestablish confidence in the American people that maybe we have a sound fiscal policy here and that we will balance the budget. 
We still have those, however, who say we ought to spend it, including the President of the United States. There are people who say we ought to have tax cuts. 
Now, we have a rare opportunity which seldom comes to Congress. If we just do nothing, we can do a great deal of good. How often, if Congress just does nothing, can some good come from it? But it is this simple. If we stay with the spending caps that we adopted last year in a bipartisan compromise, if we can stay with those caps, we are going to balance the budget before the year 2002, and we are going to pay off on the national debt without taking any action, because the Secretary of the Treasury just rolls over less old debt from week to week because of a budget surplus. So you gradually pay down on the national debt just by Congress taking no action. A great deal of good comes from Congress just doing nothing. 
We would reduce the cynicism of three out of four people in this country as to whether or not we are really serious about balancing the budget. That reestablishes confidence in the economy. It is going to encourage people to invest, and with investment you create jobs. We are going to reduce the interest costs to the Federal Treasury. The biggest item in the Federal budget is now interest--not defense, not Social Security or Medicare--interest. We will reduce it. 
Most importantly, we are going to be able to restore the American dream of our children and grandchildren. Every generation has thought their kids would have it better than their generation, but today's generation does not believe that their children will have a better future and their grandchildren have yet a better future because of the legacy of debt our generation is leaving. 
We can restore the American dream to our children and grandchildren. 
We also have an opportunity to do something that I never thought I would be able to be a part of in my lifetime--helping pay off on the national debt, reducing the legacy of debt that we have left to our children and grandchildren. It seems to me, not only is that good economically, but if we have an opportunity to do that--we have been living high on the hog for the last 3 decades because of Government borrowing--we can pay down that legacy of debt and keep a moral obligation that we ought to have for our generation to live within its means. 
We can also do what the President suggested needs to be done. We could also strengthen the fiscal position of the Federal Government so when the IOUs come due on Social Security we will be in a strong position to pay those IOUs. So the President needs to exercise restraint. Three years ago in the State of the Union Message we heard that the era of big Government is over. But this year we heard that the era of saying the era of big Government is over, is over. 
We also have to have some restraints on these tax cuts. Not that taxes can't be cut in the future, but we ought to make sure what we have in surplus first. We need to do it right and we should not do it piecemeal, and we have a tendency to do it in a piecemeal fashion. 
But most important, if we just cool it, if we just keep the cork in the bottle, if we just do nothing, we will do a great deal of good, not only for today but for our children and grandchildren. That is why I say we should take the advice of Chairman Greenspan that he gave to the Senate Budget Committee today and just be very, very cautious.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I noted on Monday of this week that the administration had taken an important step on drug policy. I think, however, it was very much a misstep, and I do not think the administration played fair in doing it. Each year, the Congress requires the administration to submit a list of countries to be considered for certification on drug cooperation. This is called the Majors List. 
The list serves as a basis for considering whether the countries listed have fully cooperated with the United States to control drug production and trafficking. It is this list that the President then considers for certification on March 1 of each year. 
This year, and in keeping with what seems to be a tradition with this administration, the list came up to the Hill very, very late. Because of this and because of the history of tardiness, I decided to send a message to the administration, one that seemed necessary to get their attention. So I put a hold on several ambassadorial nominations to send the signal that Congress takes compliance with this certification law on the Majors List very seriously. After more than a week's delay, we finally received the list. As a result, I removed my holds, but the list as a document contains an omission that deserves careful notice. 
Left off the list were the countries of Syria and Lebanon. Not just left off, but what does that mean, `left off'? In this backhanded way, the administration decided in one big step to certify these two countries as somehow fully cooperating with the rest of the world, in this case the United States, on drug policy. 
Let's think about this for a moment. Syria has been decertified for over 10 years. Syria was not certified even during Desert Storm or Desert Shield when it was one of our allies in that war. Lebanon has just received a national-interest waiver--a decertification with somehow a get-out-of-jail-free card. Now, without debate or without substantive explanation, the administration has simply left these two countries off the list. This is a momentous change in policy. It reverses years of consideration, and it appears to ignore considerable evidence. 
In the letter forwarding the list to Congress, the President makes two arguments for doing this. Neither argument stands up well. 
The first argument seems to advance the idea that because Syrian and Lebanese cultivation of opium has dropped below 1,000 hectares, that this act alone justifies a reconsideration of their being on the list. 
It may justify a reconsideration, possibly, but it hardly justifies backdoor certification, and this is backdoor certification. Even the State Department's own annual drug report makes it clear that both Syria and Lebanon remain major transiting countries for drugs. This criterion alone is enough to qualify for inclusion on the Majors List, but the administration then advances the argument that this is somehow OK, because the drugs do not come into the United States. There seems to be some belief in the administration that this is a justification for not keeping these two countries on the Majors List. However, it is apparent the administration does not read the law or doesn't even read its own reports. 
But even if the facts supported removing Syria from the list, which they do not, the Congress deserves to be briefed on this momentous change beforehand. Israel and other European allies deserve notice of this dramatic change of our policy. The American public deserves a chance to understand the change. This did not happen. Instead, what we have is indirect certification. As a result, Syria will now escape serious consideration next March, despite evidence of significant trafficking and production of these illegal drugs. 
When my staff first learned of the prospect of the change in policy, I told them to indicate to the State Department that this would be a very, very big mistake. I hoped that the Department would not take the step that they took. 
I was of the opinion, however, mistake though it was, that if the administration wanted to proceed well, then it was their call. I did not extend my hold on the ambassadorial nominations to cover the issue of Syria, and I withdrew my hold on these nominations as soon as the list was delivered, late though it was. But this list raises yet another concern. 
What we are left with, days before Congress adjourns, is a roundabout certification of Syria. I believe, as I said before, that such a decision is a big blunder. The way it was done does not do justice to the issue or the process of certification. 
If it had not been done this way, imagine for a moment how the issue would have been handled. Next year, in February, the administration would have to make a decision to certify Syria or not based on the merits. It would have to make a case to Congress at that point and even to the public at that point for such a move. There may be some who believe that in that more straightforward environment, the same decision would have been made, but I doubt it. 
With time to reflect and to consider, to publicly debate the issues and the facts, I seriously doubt that this administration would have certified Syria as fully cooperating in drug control. So not wanting to face the music, the administration did this behind-the-scene two-step instead. I hope the administration will reconsider, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in signing a letter to the President asking him to relook the issue.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I spoke a week ago about the necessity of the inspector general of the Treasury Department to resign. I want to continue that discussion, because she has not done that yet. 
Next year is going to mark the 20th anniversary of the Inspector General Act of 1978. In my experience, inspectors general are an important function of our system of checks and balances. Whereas committees of Congress may not have the time or inclination to perform rigorous oversight, which happens to be our constitutional responsibility, the inspectors general offices are there full time with nothing else to do. 
I have worked very closely with many IG's. For the most part, they are good at what they do. The IG Act has been a tremendous success. Hundreds of billions of dollars have been saved by inspectors general. 
At the same time, rarely has the IG's integrity been called into question. That is, at least until now, Mr. President. The integrity of the inspector general of the Treasury Department, Valerie Lau, has been called into question. 
The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Susan Collins, held 2 days of hearings just last month. The subcommittee found that the IG broke the law twice and violated the standards of ethical conduct. These violations involved the letting of two sole-source contracts, one to a long-time associate of hers. 
In addition, her office improperly opened a criminal investigation on two Secret Service agents. In that matter, at least one key document was destroyed--just plain destroyed. And that indicated a coverup. 
Furthermore, the inspector general provided false information to Congress. And that is a no-no for anybody, but particularly for somebody charged with looking out to see that laws are faithfully enforced and that money is properly spent. Of all people in the bureaucracy, the inspector general should be most careful. 
The irony in all of this is, the IG is supposed to stop this kind of activity, not commit it. Yet that is what Valerie Lau did. 
Mr. President, the charge that IG Lau violated these legal and ethical standards is not conjecture. It is not someone's opinion or judgment. They are simple facts--concrete facts. They are findings. They are findings of a subcommittee of the Congress of the United States. They are found in conjunction with the independent and nonpartisan General Accounting Office. 
Bad enough that these violations occurred by a watchdog, a watchdog whose job it is to deter such actions, but this IG's reaction is even more troubling. She agreed that they were technical violations of law, but she thinks that her actions were justified. 
The Treasury IG is one of the most important of all inspector general positions. Perhaps it is the most important. The Treasury IG oversees 300 employees, many of whom are law enforcement officers. 
How in the world can we allow an IG who violated the law twice and who is in denial about committing the violations to continue to perform the important functions of inspector general? How can the public, how can the Congress, how can even her own employees have confidence that she knows the difference between what is and what is not the law? 
Her responsibility is to catch those who break the law. That is what an inspector general is supposed to be doing. How can she do that given her own actions and her responses to the findings of the General Accounting Office? 
Ten days ago, Mr. President, immediately after Senator Collins' hearings, I called, as I said previously today, for Inspector General Lau's resignation, citing all these aforementioned violations. I cited the need for the IGs to be beyond reproach, to have the highest standards of integrity and credibility and conduct. The public's trust and confidence in this inspector general has without a doubt been undermined. 
Today, I renew my call for her resignation. If the Treasury IG does not get it, does not get that she should step down, the Treasury Secretary should. The President should as well. The Treasury Secretary has a responsibility, under this law, to generally supervise the IG. However, only Presidents can fire inspectors general. In my view, that means that Secretary Rubin is obliged to review the record and to make a recommendation to the President. The President would be obliged to take action and notify Congress of his action and why he took it. It should be done swiftly. As long as this IG remains in office, her troops remain demoralized and the IG's important work will be neutered. 
There has been a lot of talk around Washington that recent IG hires have lacked experience and background. That is certainly the case with the Treasury inspector general. 
I went back and reviewed the record of her confirmation. Her hearing lasted nearly 5 minutes. She was asked just one question--whether her mother was present in the audience. To follow up, questions were then asked of her mother. That ended the confirmation process. 
For the record, I want to make it clear that I am a member of the committee, the Finance Committee, that conducted the confirmation hearing. I did not attend the hearing, but I submitted an extensive list of questions for the record. And I received responses. They are part of the permanent record. 
As a result, I feel some obligation that I did not do more to question Inspector General Lau's credentials and experience at the time. I guess that is because you like to give the President's nominee the benefit of the doubt. I guess I learned the hard way that for the position of inspector general, questioning one's experience and qualifications obviously is paramount. 
I intend to be more aggressive on that score in the future. The Inspector Generals Act requires that the IG have `demonstrated ability.' That is in the law, the words `demonstrated ability.' And it is in the law not once, not twice, but seven different areas of the law. 
Here is what the IG Act of 1978 says:  
There shall be at the head of each office an inspector general who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, financial analysis, law, management analysis, public administration, or investigations. 
Ms. Lau would attempt to claim a demonstrated ability in accounting and auditing. She is a CPA and has been a Government auditor and evaluator. But in this area of auditing, she had reached only a GS-13 level. She managed only three employees, according to her deposition. And there was a 5-year gap between this experience and when she was finally confirmed by the U.S. Senate. 
How does that translate into becoming the head of a 300-employee operation that conducts huge, complex audits and even criminal investigations? 
What is clear is that Ms. Lau began the process of getting placed within this administration through the Democratic National Committee. Were the political connections enough to get the job? I hope that is not the case. We should have higher standards than that for the job of inspector general, which is a very important job. 
Reflecting back on the statute, the inspector general was not qualified in the first place. Once in office, she undermines her own integrity and credibility. She no longer has the moral authority needed to lead that office. To me, it is an open and shut case. Verdict: Time for new leadership. 
That brings me to my final point. This body would do well in the future to watchdog the watchdogs. And the inspectors general are watchdogs within each department, both before confirmation and during their tenure, I might say. I, for one, intend to increase my own vigilance of the IG community, as well as the experience and background of nominees. 
For starters, there is the IG's peers--called the President's Commission on Integrity and Efficiency. 
The PCIE, as I will call it for short, was established to conduct peer review and investigate allegations of wrongdoing by the IG. It is comprised of other IG's and is overseen by the Office of Management and Budget. It is also known as a do-nothing organization. IG's have rarely, if ever, been disciplined for wrongdoing by this organization. 
Last April, I forwarded the allegations against Inspector General Lau to the PCIE. The issues involving the illegal contracts that she let were sent to the PCIE, by the PCIE to the Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department. The allegations involving her improper opening of a criminal case against two Secret Service agents was sent to the independent counsel. 
Because of the long process PCIE has, which takes up to 6 months, Senator Collins and her staff decided to act swiftly and dig out all the facts without the usual bureaucratic delay. Meanwhile, by July, the PCIE shut down its entire involvement in this matter of Inspector General Lau. 
Now that Senator Collins' investigation is over, and the findings are on the table, now is the time for decisive action. Instead, and in very typical fashion, here is what is going on. 
Even though only the President can fire the IG, the White House is saying it is up to the Treasury Department to act. The Treasury Department, which must, according to law, generally supervise the IG, says it is up to the PCIE to act. The problem is, the PCIE does not act. Besides, they washed their hands of this matter way back in July. The only possible PCIE involvement at this point would be to drag out any decision. That is because the PCIE process takes 6 bureaucratically long months. 
What is going on here, Mr. President? Where is the decisionmaking? Where is the leadership? Where is the sense of outrage from an administration that says it will tolerate nothing but the highest standards? This issue demands action, not finger pointing. The longer it takes, the more we undermine the public's trust and confidence in this administration and in our Government generally.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on another matter, I want to speak for a minute on the failure of fast-track trade negotiating authority for the President of the United States and the action of the House of Representatives this past weekend. 
Last week, the Senate voted by a margin of 68 to 31 to proceed to debate on the fast-track bill. I believe without a doubt it would have passed here and would have been passed by a very huge bipartisan margin. But the leadership in the House decided not to bring the bill to a vote and risk a defeat on such an important issue for our Nation. The leadership of the House decided that on the advice of the President of the United States because he could not deliver even 20 percent of the Democrat vote, the vote of his own party, in the other body. 
Unfortunately, the result is the same. The President of the United States still does not have the negotiating authority that every other President since Gerald Ford has had. How ironic that the Democratic-controlled Congresses in the past granted fast-track authority to a Republican President--such as Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George Bush--and yet Democrats in this Congress refuse to give the President, a President from their own party, the same authority. Who would have thought that the President could not convince one-fifth of his own party to vote with him on such an important issue? This was a big win for leaders of labor unions in Washington. They proved that they have more influence with Democrats in the House of Representatives than the President of the United States does. But it was not a win for the rank and file union members, the workers who manufacture the products or perform the services that would be exported throughout the world. 
It was not a win for the farmers of America either who increasingly depend on foreign markets for a big share of their income. It was a big loss for working men and women of this country. 
I know some may question my qualifications for drawing these conclusions. You might say, how can a Republican Senator substitute his judgment for that of labor leaders? So I would like to read a few quotes from a Washington Post editorial of November 11. 
As you know, Mr. President, the Washington Post has often taken the side of labor against Republican policies. So I believe they might have some credibility on this issue, as well. 
Labor opposed fast track because they believe that liberalized trade leads to American companies relocating to other countries and American workers losing their jobs to imports. They also argued that fast track was flawed because it didn't give the President authority to force other countries to adopt our labor and environmental standards. 
The Washington Post, for one, believes that the lack of fast-track authority actually makes it more likely that Americans will lose their jobs. The Washington Post says that the President, not having negotiating authority, makes it more likely that American workers will lose their jobs.  
. . . while fast track's defeat may be good news for a few unions . . . it certainly doesn't help the vast majority of American workers. With the President less able to knock down trade barriers overseas, U.S. manufacturing firms will have more, not less, incentive to relocate, to get footholds, inside closed markets. 
That bears repeating, Mr. President. Without fast track, companies have more incentive to relocate. That's because high trade barriers may prohibit U.S. companies from exporting to a foreign market. In order to sell in that area the company would actually relocate there. 
Why would we want a trade policy in this country that would make an American company go to some other country to make a product to sell in that country, when if you reduce the barriers in that other country through these negotiations, that company could stay in America and export to that country and become competitive? 
Just within the last 2 weeks, I had a CEO of a major corporation in Des Moines, IA, our capital city, who said if the President doesn't get this authority and the barrier to Chile reduced through trade or through trade negotiations, then he was going to have to move there to build to do the business in South America that he wants to do. 
The United States has one of the most open economies in the world. Our average tariff is just 2.8 percent. Many other countries have virtually closed markets. According to the World Bank, for instance, China's average tariff is 23 percent; Thailand, 26 percent; the Philippines, 19 percent; Peru, 15 percent; Chile, a flat 11 percent tariff. 
It can be difficult for American companies to export to a country like China that places a 23-percent tariff on our goods. The tariff prices our goods out of the market. One alternative for these companies is to actually move their plants to China and avoid paying that tariff. 
The preferred alternative, Mr. President, and the one that is going to benefit American workers and, hence, benefit the entire economy, because American workers are very productive, is obviously to negotiate with China to lower tariffs, bring their tariffs down to our level. Then the companies can stay here, employ American workers and export their goods to China. 
But we can't negotiate these tariffs down without the President fast-track authority. That is why fast track is so important. It leads to lower tariffs in foreign countries. Most importantly, it leads to the preservation of American jobs. 
Fast track also leads to the creation of new jobs. Exports already support 11 million jobs in this country. Each additional $1 billion of sales of services or manufactured products creates between 15,000 and 20,000 new jobs. These jobs pay 15 percent to 20 percent higher than non-export-related jobs. In Iowa, companies that export provide their employees 32 percent greater benefits than nonexporting companies. 
All of this is in jeopardy without our passing a bill giving the President the authority to negotiate. As the Washington Post puts it, `[w]ith exports growing more slowly, or not at all, fewer new jobs will be created.' So the failure of fast track hurts the workers of this country. 
Mr. President, the editorial has one final comment on labor's concerns with worker standards in other countries. `Less trade certainly won't improve the standards of overseas workers, for whose welfare many Democrats claimed concern. And with the United States Government hamstrung, Japan, the European Union and developing countries will have a greater influence in shaping world trade policies. How hard do you think they'll push for improved labor and environmental standards?' 
Mr. President, I don't often say that the Washington Post is right. Economic stability and prosperity are the only proven means of increasing labor and environmental standards. The United States, due to our affluence, has the luxury of imposing high labor and environmental standards. Other countries don't yet have this ability. But increased trade will bring this economic stability, and it will lead to higher labor and environmental standards in other countries as well. 
Cutting off trade, or failing to pass this legislation, reduces our influence in these other countries and it increases the influence of countries such as Japan and the European Union. Can we trust Japan and the European Union to advance America's interests in world trading negotiations? The Washington Post correctly assumed that we cannot. Only the President of the United States, and the Congress working in conjunction with him, because that is what this legislation can do, can advance our interests and protect our interests. Only we can influence other countries to improve their environment and labor standards, to improve human rights, and to embrace democracy through the process of international trade that brings people together rather than keeping people apart. 
That is what I am most concerned about. The failure of fast track leaves a vacuum of leadership in international issues. Up until now, this vacuum had been filled by the United States. Ever since World War II, to some extent going back to the Reciprocity Act of the 1930's, since 1934, the United States has led the world in reducing barriers to trade, and we have benefited greatly from this leadership. 
American workers are the most productive, highest paid workers in the world. American companies produce the highest quality products. And American consumers have more choices of goods and pay less of their income on necessities such as food than consumers in any other country. These are the benefits that we have enjoyed because we have been willing to lead on trade. 
I'm afraid that our leadership may now be questioned by our trading partners after last weekend's events. These countries are going to move on without us. They are going to continue to form regional and bilateral trading arrangements that won't include the United States. The United States won't be at the table to protect our interests. And the losers in all of this will be the American workers, the loss of jobs, and the consumers won't have the benefit that they now have. 
Mr. President, I hope we can return next year and we can have a rational debate about what trade means to this country--because somehow that has been lost in the process--and how important it is for the President of the United States to have fast track authority, to be the living representation of America's moral leadership, to lead in free and fair trade, which we have done for 40 or 50 years. 
We have already lost 3 full years without this legislation and the opportunity to lead; 20 agreements we have missed out on. We cannot afford to wait any longer.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, since the Senator from Indiana is in the chair, I want to compliment Senator Coats for his involvement in this legislation. He had a very important role in this adoption and foster care legislation. I know the bill contains key parts in which he was interested. Senator Coats was very much a part of this being a successful product. 
Confronting the issues for children in foster care, is uncomfortable, almost painful. But the foster care system is in crisis and children are suffering. We are compelled to confront these problems. 
Foster care is a complicated entitlement program. While the issues are complex, so are the solutions. Today we are getting what we are paying for. It is not such a good situation, because what we are getting is long-term foster care--not permanency for these kids. 
Foster care was set up to be a temporary emergency situation for kids. The foster care system now is a lifestyle for so many of them. The Federal Government continues to pour billions of dollars into a system that lacks genuine accountability. Instead of encouraging States to increase adoptions, the current system rewards long-term foster care arrangements. 
Jennifer Toth described in her book `Orphans of the Living,' that children are `consigned to the substitute child care system, a chaotic prison-like system intended to raise children whose parents and relatives cannot or will not care for them.' She also wrote, `The children in substitute child care today have all suffered trauma. They are all at greater risk than the general child population. Yet they are given less care, when they need more care.' 
In Iowa, we have an organization called the Iowa Citizens Foster Care Review Board. They had a project of asking children in foster care and kids who were waiting to be adopted what they would like to tell us and the rest of the world. I could give lots of quotes, but these are examples from two of the children. `Don't leave us in foster care so long.' `Check on us frequently while we're in foster care to ask us how we're doing and make sure we are safe.' `Tell us what's going on so we don't have to guess. Tell us how long it will be before we're adopted and why things seem to take so long.' 
Children need to know that they have permanency, which means successful, healthy reunification with their birth families or permanency in an adoptive home. 
A happy, permanent home life provides more than just a safe haven for kids; it gives kids confidence to grow into positive contributors to our society. 
In the United States, at least a half million children are not living in permanent homes. While waiting for adoption or a safe return to their natural families, too many kids live out their entire childhoods in the foster care system. 
Sadly, it often turns into an lonely, even futile transition. There is a short window of opportunity to do something about this with each and every kid, and each and every kid is a little different in this regard. If this window of opportunity is missed, a child can leave the foster care system a legal orphan--as an adult--having gone through their entire childhood never having permanency--never having a place that they can call home. 
More needs to be done to dispel the myth that some kids are unadoptable. I have had people right here in Washington, DC, tell me that some kids are not adoptable. No kid is unadoptable. The only problem is that we just haven't found a home for them yet. 
I support the Adoption and Safe Families Act because it takes the initial, necessary steps toward real reform. For the first time in 17 years, this body has strived to address the pain and suffering of these children. A cornerstone has been laid upon which future adjustments can be made and reforms can be built. 
The bill will ensure health care coverage for adopted special needs children, break down geographic restrictions facing adoptive families, and encourage creative adoptive efforts and outreach. 
One of the problems we as legislators have experienced has been that inadequate statistics are not kept; we don't have good enough statistics to understand how States are performing with their child care system. The data is too sparse and States can't tell us how many children they actually have in their care, or how long they have been there. When the situation is that way, Mr. President, some children can be lost in the system. So our bill is requiring States to report critical statistics. Children will be identified and their lives will be personalized to those responsible for them. The status quo will not be able to hide behind the lack of information excuse. We have run into that when dealing with this legislation. 
Currently, the Federal Government does not require that States actively seek adoptive homes for all `free-to-be-adopted' children, who often are assigned to long-term foster care. This bill, however, compels States to make reasonable efforts to place a child in a permanent adoptive home. Long-term foster care should never be a solution for any kid. 
In most States, children are being denied permanency because of the artificial barrier of geography. This bill will break down the geographic barriers to adoption--prohibiting discrimination against out-of-State adoptive families--allowing more children to find permanent families. 
There is a mismatch between the location of children free to be adopted and families willing to adopt. Above all, these children need loving homes, and no State line should get in the way of their well-being. 
The bill establishes for foster and pre-adoptive parents the right to be given notice of hearings and the right to testify on behalf of the children in their care. How could anyone ever want to leave these people out of the process? 
These parents have been in charge of the children 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They are the ones in the best position to know the problems that these children might have and can represent the children's concerns. It is an important change to make as we seek to better represent the children's best interests. 
The Federal Government plays a significant role in child welfare by providing funds to States and attaching conditions to those funds. The single largest category of Federal expenditure under the child welfare programs is for maintaining low-income foster care children. To receive Federal funds, States must comply 
with the requirements of this bill, and States will be penalized for noncompliance. We are sick and tired of kids being kept in the foster care system because there is money that comes from the Federal Government for those kids. There is an incentive--a monetary incentive--not to move these children toward permanency. 
I am pleased with the provisions in this bill which emphasizes adoption promotion and support services in the Family Preservation and Support Services Act. 
To help ensure that new adoptive families are healthy and stay together, the bill provides post-adoptive services and respite care. It is a proven approach. 
In States where post-adoption services are offered, the number of adoptive families that have trouble staying together is significantly lower. 
I congratulate the Members for their efforts on this issue and commend the authors of this monumental piece of legislation. One person that hasn't gotten much attention--and he played a very important role in this process--is Senator Roth, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. He was instrumental in forging an agreement with members so that this bill could pass, as it will tonight. His guidance and insight were critical to the bill's success. 
Today, we begin to dramatically change the culture surrounding adoption. We begin the education process. We begin by dismissing the dehumanizing myth surrounding special-needs children. These children deserve permanent homes, too. These children are precious, and all children in need of permanent homes are adoptable. 
I have been impressed by the compassion of those who adopt these special children. They are gifted and they ought to inspire all of us to be more concerned about kids in need. We know that more families are willing to adopt children, including those with the most challenging of circumstances. 
Let's build upon the cornerstone of this monumental bill. Even though we will have passed this legislation, some children will still remain hostages in an inefficient system. More reform is needed to help place more children in a safe, permanent home. 
I am looking toward future years to do more in the following areas. People should know that Chuck Grassley, the Senator from Iowa, is not done with changes in foster care and adoption at the Federal level. 
First, we need to dramatically limit the time a child can legally spend in foster care. The national average length of stay in foster care is 3 years. That is three birthdays, three Christmases, and that is going through the first, second, and third grades, without having a mom and dad. 
Second, we need to remove financial incentives to keep children in foster care, and provide incentives for success, not just for attempts to adopt. Currently, the system pays the same rate per child per month without limitation. The Federal Government must pay for performance. 
These children are the most vulnerable of all; their lives begin with abuse and neglect by their own parents and, for many, they experience systemic abuse by languishing in long-term foster care. 
The Congressional Research Service stated, `Children are vulnerable, and their well-being is affected by conditions beyond their control.' But their well-being is not beyond our control. These children depend on sound Federal policy that promotes permanency. Together with those on the front lines, we can make this policy work. 
Congress has said that long-term foster care should never be a solution for a child who needs a home. It takes the critical first steps toward complete reform of a broken-down system, and it lays the cornerstone for continued improvement on behalf of tens of thousand of children left in limbo each year in the foster care system. 
Foster care is a poor parent. A loving, committed family is the best gift that we can give to any child. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I also want to congratulate this body for the passage of the adoption bill. It is a good step forward. I hope when we work out the differences between the House and Senate, they can be worked out amicably. I hope there is not a watering down of the Senate provisions. 
I would also like to have legislation passed yet this year. If it can't be worked out that way, obviously it is going to have to be put off until next year until it can be conferenced, but I hope we can work out these differences yet this year. 
A pioneer in the adoption field wrote `when a child of the streets stands before you in rags, with tear-stained face, you cannot easily forget him, and yet you are perplexed what to do. The human soul is difficult to interfere with. You hesitate how far you should go.' 
Congress has been considering adoption and foster care reform this year that has caused all of us involved to ask, how far should we go?' But after extensive research into the failure of the foster care system, I ask how far can we go? 
Confronting the issues for children in foster care is uncomfortable--almost painful. But the foster care system is in crisis and children are suffering. We are compelled to confront these problems. 
Foster care is a complicated entitlement program. Meaningful reform can only happen when Congress recognizes the seriousness of the problem and begins taking the measured steps toward reform. 
While the issues are complex, so are the solutions. 
Today we are getting what we pay for, long-term foster care. Twenty-one States are under consent decrees because they failed to take proper care of their children who had been abused or neglected by their parents. 
Set up to serve as a temporary, emergency situation for children, the foster care system is now a lifestyle for many kids. 
The Federal Government continues to pour billions of dollars into a system that lacks genuine accountability. 
Instead of encouraging States to increase adoptions, the current system rewards long-term foster care arrangements. 
Jennifer Toth described in her book `Orphans of the Living,' children are `consigned to the substitute child care system, a chaotic, prison-like system intended to raise children whose parents and relatives cannot or will not care for them.' 
She also wrote, `the children in substitute child care today have all suffered trauma. They are all at greater risk than the general child population. Yet they are given less care, when they need more care. Many thousands of children are lost and millions of dollars are wasted each year because no one--not the caseworker, not the foster home--takes full responsibility for them. Instead, each is passed from one caseload and placement to another, with too many kids and too little attention to go around. 
When these children look to adults for help, no one is there. Only when their situation becomes desperate, when they also fail, are they awarded the attention they crave.' 
One organization said that `foster care has been a black hole for many of America's neediest and most neglected children.' 
`I have a poster in my office that inspires me to work for real reform. The Iowa Citizen Foster Care Review Board asked children who were waiting to be adopted what they would like to tell us and this is what the children said: `Don't leave us in foster care so long.' `It is scary to move from home to home, find us one good family where we can feel like a real member of the family.' `Check on us frequently while we're in foster care to ask us how we're doing and make sure we are safe.' `Tell us what's going on so we don't have to guess. Tell us how long it will be before we're adopted and why things seem to take so long.' 
Dave Thomas of Wendy's challenged me and others to make sure kids have a happy childhood. For those who have had a happy childhood it is hard to understand why. For those who did not have a happy childhood--you know why, he said. 
Children need to know that they have a permanency--which means successful, healthy reunification with their birth families or permanency in an adoptive home. 
My wife, Barbara, and I, have been blessed as the parents of five children. Today, we get to watch our sons and daughters enjoy their own families and the happiness found through parenthood. These experiences have made me appreciate the importance of a family unit. A happy, permanent home life provides more than a safe haven for kids. It gives children confidence to grow into positive contributors in our society. 
In the United States, at least a half million children are not living in permanent homes. While waiting for adoption or a safe return to their natural families, many kids may live out their childhoods in the foster care system. Sadly, it often turns into a lonely, even futile transition. If the `window of opportunity' is missed, a child can leave the system a legal orphan, as an adult. 
These children leave foster care and enter onto the welfare rolls or into prison. Only 17 percent of those who emancipate from the system become completely self-supporting. Barely half finish high school, a little less than half are gainfully employed as adults. And, almost 60 percent of the girls give birth within a few years of leaving the system. 
Since 1982, about 20,000 children a year are adopted from foster care. Obviously, that leaves tens of thousands of kids in limbo every year. 
Reform is needed to help place more children in a safe, permanent home. Improvements should limit the time a child legally can spend in foster care; remove financial incentives to keep kids in foster care; and, provide incentives for successful family reunifications or adoptions, not attempts. 
More needs to be done to dispel the myth that some kids are unadoptable. I say that no child is unadoptable, we just havent't found a home for them yet. And, most children want the permanency provided through adoption. 
I support the promotion of adoption, safety, and support for the Abused and Neglected Children Act, or Pass Act, because it takes the initial, necessary steps toward real reform. 
For the first time, in 17 years, this body has strived to address the pain and suffering of these children. A cornerstone is laid upon which future reforms can be built. 
The Pass Act will ensure health care coverage for adopted special needs children; break down geographic restrictions facing adoptive families; and, encourage creative adoptive efforts and outreach. 
Thanks to Senator DeWine's vision and efforts we have strengthened the reasonable efforts statute. Senator DeWine raised our awareness on this issue and has been a champion for these children. 
One of the problems we as legislators have experienced has been the inadequate statistics to understand the performance of the States. The data is sparse and many States can't tell us how many children they actually have in their care or how long they have been there. The Pass Act will require States to report critical statistics. No longer will children languish without being identified, their lives will be personalized to those responsible for them. We will know who they are, where they are, and how long they have been in the system. And, the status quo will not be able to hide behind the lack of information excuse. 
Currently, the Federal Government does not require that States actively seek adoptive homes for all free-to-be-adopted children, who often are assigned to long-term foster care. This bill, however, will compel States to make reasonable efforts to place a child in an adoptive home. Long-term foster care should never be a solution for a child. 
The Federal Government plays a significant role in child welfare, by providing funds to States and attaching conditions to these funds. The single largest category of Federal expenditure under the child welfare programs is for maintaining low-income children in foster care. 
To receive Federal funds, States must comply with requirements designed so that children can remain safely with their families or return home after they have been placed in foster care. States will be penalized for not complying with the Pass Act. 
In most States, children are being denied permanency because of the artificial barrier of geography. The Senate bill contains a provision that will break down the geographic barriers to adoption. 
An adoption organization in a northeastern State shared with me a real life example of why this provision is necessary. 
Allison, Beth, Jimmy, and Jarod are siblings, ages 6, 8, 10, and 11. They were freed for adoption in October 1996. 
Because the siblings had regular visits and a close relationship with each other, their caseworker hoped to find a family that could adopt all four children. Our agency was able to send the caseworker the home studies of four out-of-State families who were interested in, and had space to adopt, all four children. However, the State child welfare agency pressured the worker to select in-State families for the children. 
Over a period of 6 months, there were no appropriate in-State families who could adopt all four children, so it was decided to split the sibling group. Jimmy and Jarod were placed with one family, and a different family has been identified for Allison and Beth. 
It is the intent of this legislation to remove the geographic barriers that keep children from appropriate adoptive families. 
I recognize the Members for their efforts on this issue and congratulate the authors of this monumental piece of legislation. 
They understood the complexity of this issue and pushed for reform. It was a very unique coalition, and I was glad to be part of it. 
Under Senator Craig's leadership, a successful consensus was formed and bipartisan, incremental steps were taken. 
Senator Roth was also instrumental in forging an agreement with Members so that this bill could pass with an overwhelming majority. His guidance and insight were critical to the bill's success. 
Today we begin to change the culture surrounding adoption. Children deserve permanent homes. All children are valuable and adoptable. 
I have been impressed by the compassion of those who adopt these special children. They are gifted and should inspire us all. 
We know that more families are willing to adopt children, including those with the most challenging of circumstances. 
We have always had a class of children considered unadoptable. 
Several decades ago many said that minority children were unadoptable. We know now that is not true. 
Many once thought that children with AIDS were unadoptable. We know now that is not true. 
Adoption organizations are finding homes for children and have waiting lists of parents all over the country anxious to adopt children despite their special circumstances. One adoption agency has a waiting list of a hundred families, willing to adopt a child with Down's syndrome. 
A family in Texas adopted 8 drug-exposed siblings ranging in age from 2 to 10. 
Susan Badeau, a witness before the Senate Finance Committee, shared her story about adopting 19 children out of the foster care system--virtually rescuing them from a lifetime in foster care. 
The Pass Act will encourage permanency for the children who cannot return to their original homes. 
To ensure that these new adoptive families are healthy and stay together they will need postadoption services and respite care. 
Postadoptive services are crucial for the success of these families because many of these children will have long-term service needs. 
In States where postadoption services are offered, the number of adoptive families that disrupt is significantly lower. 
According to the Congressional Research Service the following Federal programs could be used to provide postadoption services to adoptive families. Although none of these programs is exclusively intended to provide such services, they are among a number of allowable activities. They include the following: The Adoption Opportunities Program; the Family Preservation Program; Child Welfare Services; Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act; Community-Based Family Resource and Support; Child Care and Development Block Grant; and the Social Services Block Grant. 
I was pleased with the provision in the Pass Act which emphasizes adoption promotion and support services in the Family Preservation and Support Service Act. 
I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an explanation of the services provided under these programs.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, let's build upon the cornerstone of this monumental bill. Congress has a chance to continue to press on for meaningful reform. In spite of this legislation, some children will still remain hostages in an inefficient system. 
Any future reforms must: First, strive to dramatically limit the time a child can legally spend in foster care. According to the available statistics, the national average length of stay in foster care is three years--three birthdays, three christmases, first, second and third grade. Second, remove financial incentives to keep children in foster care; and provide incentives for success not for attempts. Currently the system pays the same rate per child per month without limitation. The Federal Government is entitled to pay for performance. 
Senator Brownback plans to hold hearings next year as chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight of the District of Columbia to determine what the Federal Government can do to address the crumbling foster care system in the District. 
These children are the most vulnerable of all--their little lives begin with abuse and neglect by their own parents and, for many, they experience systemic abuse by languishing in long term foster care. 
CRS stated that `children are vulnerable and their well-being is affected by conditions beyond their control.' But is not beyond our control. 
Those on the front lines, on whom we rely to make this policy work include: the court appointed special advocates, volunteers who advocate in the courts on the children's behalf; juvenile judges--an Illinois judge told me she requires each of the children's pictures to be attached to the front of their files so that those who come in contact with the case know that these are children, not a caseload number; the foster and adoptive parent associations; the citizen foster care review boards; special needs adoption organizations, Governors, the human services departments and social workers. 
We are all responsible for these children who depend on us. Foster care is a poor parent. A loving, committed family is the best gift to give any child. Passage of this bill is one way to encourage this. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment at the fact that during conference negotiations on the District of Columbia appropriations bill, there have been efforts to drop a provision offered by Senator Wyden and myself, and which was accepted by the Senate. This provision was the antisecret holds provision which would have put an end to the practice of putting holds on legislation or nomination in secret. 
My colleagues are all aware of the practice of placing holds on a variety of measures. Any Member of the Senate who objects to a measure can place a hold to prevent further action from taking place until that Senator's objections can be resolved. 
I want to be clear about one thing. This provision would not have prevented Senators from placing holds. But it would have required them to be open and acknowledge when they have placed holds. Our provision would have simply required Senators to either announce on the floor or place notice in the Congressional Record within 2 working days that they have placed a hold. It is very disappointing that the D.C. approps conferees sought not to allow this provision to remain in the conference report. More, not less, openness is needed in this institution. It is regrettable that conferees seek to maintain the status quo. 
However, I want my colleagues to know that, should this provision not be included in the final conference report, Senator Wyden and I will not consider this matter closed. 
We have had to work long and persistently before to achieve legislative goals and we are prepared to do so again. We will continue to pursue this matter until we achieve the openness that is necessary to regain the public trust in Congress that it once had. I know that is a goal that we all want to reach. 
Senators should remember that simply because the provision is not in the conference report, does not mean that Senators cannot take the initiative on their own and declare their desire, to place a hold on legislative activity. I call on all Senators to declare their action when they place a hold on legislation. Senator Wyden and I have already pledged to be open about any such actions we take. 
I firmly believe that shedding more light on the work that we do here can only help make Congress more effective and accountable. It will inspire greater confidence by our constituents, without which we cannot effectively do our jobs. There has to be a fundamental trust among our constituents that we will strive to represent their interests and views. I know I've never had a constituent tell me that Congress needs to be less open, less straightforward or less honest about what we do. That's why I want my colleagues to know this is not the last they have heard of this issue. They can be in step with the American people's wishes by making their actions public and by making the holds process more open. I appeal to my colleagues to not allow this provision to be killed in the secrecy that we need to eliminate. 
I also want to thank my friend, Senator Wyden, for his hard work on this matter. It has been a pleasure to work with him on this matter and I look forward to our continued efforts together.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important tax legislation for myself, Senator Jeffords, Senator Murkowski, Senator Conrad, Senator Kerrey, Senator Harkin, Senator Feinstein, Senator Boxer, and Senator Johnson. 
Our legislation extends the production tax credit for energy produced from wind. This legislation is similar to that which passed the Senate as part of the Senate's tax bill attached to the balanced budget reconciliation bill this summer. Unfortunately, it was dropped in conference between the House and the Senate, and did not become part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
Since the Senate has acted favorably on this wind energy production tax credit legislation in the past, I would like to ask Senators to consider it again next year. I am introducing it this year because I want to make sure that it gets an opportunity for cosponsorship. 
As we all know, our Nation's energy supply is both limited and controversial. However, energy produced from wind is clean, renewable and homegrown. There is nothing limited or controversial about this source of energy, the wind. Americans need only to make the necessary investments in order to capture it for power. 
Our legislation extends the production tax credit and the focus on energy produced from wind through the month of June, 2004. Scientists blame excessive carbon dioxide for global warming. The chief sources of environmentally dangerous carbon dioxide are emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. Obviously, we need other safer sources. Wind energy is clean, abundant, and a U.S. resource that produces electricity with virtually no carbon dioxide emissions. 
Every 10,000 megawatts of wind energy can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 33 million metric tons. Today, our Nation produces only 1,700 megawatts of wind energy. However, the American Wind Energy Association estimates that U.S. wind capacity can reach 30,000 megawatts by the year 2010. This is enough electricity to meet the needs of 10 million homes, while reducing pollution in every State in the Nation. 
Americans naturally find abundant wind in every State in the Union. Wind is a homegrown energy. No foreign powers can control our source of wind energy. No American soldiers or sailors will ever need to fight in foreign wars to protect our supply of wind energy, as they must in the case of oil. For example, consider the Persian Gulf war. No supertankers will ever crack up in the sea and pollute our beaches because of energy produced from wind. 
In short, wind energy is a good investment in the present and the future. Our legislation extends the successful wind energy production tax credit. It is a very successful way of promoting this source of energy. It is a cheap investment with high returns for ourselves, our children, our grandchildren and their grandchildren. The Senate needs to again pass this important legislation to ensure the wind energy production tax credit into the next century. I encourage all of my colleagues to cosponsor.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, almost 7 months ago, my colleague and I, Senator John Breaux, introduced S. 757, legislation identical to H.R. 1377. This legislation--the Savings Are Vital to Everyone's Retirement Act or SAVER is now ready for passage in the Senate and ultimately signature of the President. While it took a little longer than I had hoped--it is still a timely and vital piece of legislation. 
When I introduced the bill back in May, I cited some statistics on the dismal level of savings by individuals in this country. I said that only about one-third of American workers had calculated how much they will need to save by retirement in order to maintain their standard of living. I said that workers in the 40's to the early 50's had seen their savings levels drop by 6 percent from 1988 to 1994. 
Well, these kinds of numbers are very consistent with new data recently released by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in its annual Retirement Confidence Survey. Slightly more than one-third of the people surveyed in 1997 have even tried to determine how much they need to save by retirement. Only 27 percent of Americans had an idea of what they would need to accumulate in order to retire and maintain their standard of living. 
And people are very afraid. A recent poll by USA Today indicated that 49 percent of people are afraid of not having enough money for retirement. 
Clearly, people need help in learning how to achieve a secure retirement. The SAVER bill which is now before the Senate, will do that. The SAVER Act will direct the Department of Labor to maintain an ongoing public education campaign about the need to save for retirement. This campaign will include a broad scope of initiatives including public service announcements, covering public meetings, and crating and disseminating educational materials. 
Education has proven to be a powerful motivator for people to pay attention to their retirement savings. According to the Retirement Confidence Survey, of those employees who were provided educational programs and materials about the company pension plan, 45 percent said that it led them to begin contributing to the plan. Furthermore, 49 percent said that the educational programs and materials led them to reallocate their money among investment options offered. 
The Department of Labor already has a good start on a public education initiative; this legislation will ensure that public education will continue beyond the current administration because this is a problem that will not go away. 
The second important piece of this legislation is the creation of a national event--a national summit on retirement savings at the White House. This summit will be a truly bipartisan event--hosted by both the executive and congressional branch. The summit will bring together more than 200 experts in the field of pensions and retirement savings, elected officials, and representatives from the private sector and the public--all with the goal of raising the profile of the importance of saving and identifying barriers to saving and pension formation. 
The first national summit will be held in the summer of 1998--just a short time from now. We will be able to get the summit organized due in large part to the groundwork already laid by a very effective group--the American Savings Education Council or ASEC. ASEC is unique in its origins and its mission. Its membership is made up of public and private sector employers financial, educational, and service organizations; and government agencies. 
The organization is committed to helping individuals understand what they need to do to prepare for retirement and to encourage savings for the future. ASEC has already made appearances in towns around the country to talk about retirement planning and has distributed a logical choice for a private partner to work with the public sector lead--the Department of Labor--to get the national summit on track for 1998. 
I would like to commend Congressmen Harris Fawell and Donald Payne for introducing this legislation in the House. The support they generated was an important part of the successful consideration of this bill. I also want to acknowledge the cosponsors in the Senate--Senator Kerry, Senator Kyl, Senator Hagel, Senator Tim Hutchinson, Senator Robb, Senator Collins, and Senator Cochran. 
Today's workers need to be prepared for retirement--private savings can help minimize the risk that they will spend down their employers's 401(k) or count on more pension benefits than they will actually receive from their employer. Or, help prepare for the costs of medical care through long-term care insurance--that is an expense that worries many of today's retirees and their children. As we prepare for debate over the future of public retirement programs we must not overlook the role that private savings and an employer-based pension will play. The Government should play role in encouraging individuals to acquire knowledge that will help them achieve a secure standard of living when they are no longer able to work--SAVER is a critical first step in helping people achieve their hopes for retirement.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to speak on a subject that I speak on often on the floor of the Senate, the Department of Defense's illegal progress payment policy. Since early this year, I have spoken on this subject many times. Most recently I spoke about the Department's commitment to bring the policy into compliance with law. 
This commitment was made by the man who is now the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr. John Hamre. This commitment was made on July 22. I spoke about this 2 weeks ago, that he had a meeting with the leadership of the Armed Services Committee. At that meeting there was an agreement among all of us that certain accounting procedures would be brought into accordance with the law. Mr. Hamre gave us his word. He promised to bring the policy into compliance with the law on October 1 of this year. October 1 has come and gone and the illegal policy is still in operation. The Department of Defense is not complying with the law of the land. 
Recent news reports suggest that Mr. Hamre is a man of deep spiritual beliefs. I know him to be that way. The roots of his faith go back to his Lutheran upbringing in the small South Dakota town of Willow Lake. His father was the town's church council president. His grandfather was the pastor. John himself went to Harvard Divinity School to prepare for the ministry. 
So, Mr. President, it seems to me his faith runs deep, and I respect that. I remind John about some Scripture. The Bible teaches us to: always `do as you promised.' I will read a passage from Joshua 23:14: `You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the Lord your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled; not one has failed.' 
The Bible teaches us that God kept His word, and He expects the same from each of us. I hope that Mr. Hamre will keep his word that was made on July 22. 
Now, I know it is not always possible to keep promises because sometimes things happen in the interim that bring about a change of events that might cause some change of the original stance. Sometimes there are unforeseen events that stand in the way. But there has to be an honest effort. 
Mr. President, I'm trying hard to understand why the October 1 deadline is being ignored. There are three letters that helped explain Mr. Hamre's behavior. 
First, there is a letter from the Armed Services Committee, signed by the chairman, Senator Thurmond, and the ranking minority member, Senator Levin. It is addressed to Secretary Cohen, and dated September 26, 1997. 
Second, we have a letter from the inspector general, Ms. Eleanor Hill, to Mr. Hamre, dated September 30, 1997. 
Third, there is Mr. Hamre's letter back to the Armed Services Committee, dated October 1, 1997.

Mr. GRASSLEY. The Armed Services Committee's letter was obviously written in response to complaints from the defense industry. Industry claims that the new policy would cost an extra $1.3 billion a year to implement. The committee is concerned about that estimate. So the committee asked Mr. Hamre to weigh these factors: `We ask that you review the proposed changes, consider all public comments, and weigh the costs and benefits to the taxpayers and the Department of Defense before these new procedures are implemented. * * *' 
The committee is telling Deputy Secretary Hamre to do more homework before executing the new policy. This letter gave Mr. Hamre the authority he needed to delay beyond the October 1 deadline that was agreed to after our July 22 meeting among Armed Services Committee members. Mr. Hamre parrots the committee's language in his response: `Consistent with your request, the Department will review the proposed changes, consider all public comments, and weigh the costs and benefits to the taxpayers and the Department of Defense before these new procedures are implemented.' 
Mr. President, if I may paraphrase the letter, it says the committee requests a delay, and Mr. Hamre is just complying. I am happy to report that some of the delay may, in fact, be necessary. 
Mr. Hamre provides an important piece of new information in the second paragraph of his letter. He says that the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement--and we call that DFARS for short--cannot be issued until January 1998 due to `statutory administrative actions.' The DFARS is a key element in the new policy. But the DFARS cannot meet the timetable prescribed under the July 22 agreement that I've referred to. 
There are some new procedures under current law. These are spelled out in Public Law 106-121, the Contract With America Advancement Act of 1996. 
Unfortunately, no one who put the July agreement together knew anything about the new rules. So if Mr. Hamre says that he needs more time to get the DFARS ready, I can buy that and admit that extra time is needed. 
But the final paragraph of his letter gives me heartburn. It makes me nervous. I quote from the final sentence: The new policy, `which were scheduled to be implemented on October 1, 1997,' is `being delayed until January 1998, pending further review and evaluation of the proposed changes.' 
Now, that wording bothers me for several reasons. It could be a big loophole to ask for more time so that effectively there is no implementation of the agreement because January 1998 is not as specific as January 1, 1998, and January 1998 `pending further review' opens the door for yet more delay. It suggests that January 1998 may not be, in fact, a deadline. It may be passed by, depending on the outcome of the new review. The wording to me is very ambiguous.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I support fair trade because trading creates jobs in America. A billion dollars worth of trade creates 18,000 jobs. Those jobs pay 15 percent above the national average of jobs in America. In my State of Iowa, corporations that export pay 32 percent higher benefits than corporations that don't export. If we are going to continue to grow as a Nation, we are going to have to be able to export more to create good paying jobs in America. 
Why do we, from time to time as a Congress, give the President authority to negotiate trade agreements? The power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce is very clearly a power given to the Congress by the Constitution. It is one of the 17 explicit powers mentioned in the Constitution. Congress guards its constitutional authority very carefully. 
But we have found that it is very difficult for Congress, made up of 535 men and women, to negotiate with 132 different countries who are part of the GATT process. Congress, for the large part, can't even negotiate agreements among its own Members a lot of times. So you can see the difficulty of Congress as a body reaching an agreement with foreign countries on how to reduce barriers. 
So from time to time under very strict guidelines we delegate some of our negotiating authority to the President. But we don't 
do it in a willy-nilly fashion. We do it with safeguards to make sure that Congress' constitutional power to regulate interstate and foreign commerce is protected. And we do it for a short period of time. We also keep the power to deny the President the ability to negotiate with a specific country, if we don't want the President to do that. We make sure that the President and his people consult with Congress on a very regular basis so that we know what is going on, but more important, so the negotiators know what Congress wants negotiated or doesn't want negotiated to ensure the negotiations reflect the will of Congress. Then, obviously, nothing can become the law of our Nation if it is not passed by the Congress of the United States and signed by the President of the United States. 
So we are very cautious in giving the power to negotiate. But we do it for two reasons: First, it is very impractical for Congress to negotiate with foreign countries, and quite frankly it is something that the President does on a regular basis on a lot of foreign policy issues. But more important we have seen opportunities for America's economic expansion happen because we have reduced barriers to trade since World War II. We have a track record of knowing our economy can expand when we export. We have a track record of knowing that jobs are created if we export. And we have a track record of knowing that those jobs that do export pay very good wages. 
So we start with the proposition that we want to have an expanding economy, that we want to create jobs and we want to create good jobs because that has been the track record of expanding foreign trade over the last 50 years. We move forward with confidence, giving this President, as we have given Republican and Democrat Presidents in the past, the authority to negotiate trade agreements. And we are confident that the workers and consumers of America will benefit as a result of giving the President this negotiating authority. 
We have seen barriers to trade around the world reduced from an average of 40 percent 50 years ago to an average of 5 percent today. Those are tariff figures. We have seen still, countries have higher barriers to trade--both tariff and nontariff trade barriers--than what we have in the United States. They are up here and we are down here. So it is a given. It is common sense, the extent to which the President can get these other countries to reduce their tariff and nontariff barriers to trade to a level equal to or closer to ours, it levels the playing field for our people, both large and small business, and that will create opportunities to export and enhance the economic well-being of our country. 
So I rise strongly in support of S. 1269, the Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1997, and I urge my colleagues to vote aye on further motions to proceed and to take up the bill. Mr. President, this debate is long overdue. The President has lacked the authority to negotiate trade agreements since the completion of the Uruguay round agreements in 1994. 
Since then, the United States has, as far as I am concerned, relinquished its leadership role that we have had over the last 50 or 60 years in international trade issues. And the rest of the world will not wait for a long period of time for the United States to act but will move on without us. 
This bill will restore the United States to its rightful position as the world's leader in international trade. If nothing else, it's going to reassert the moral authority of the United States to be a leader in fair trade negotiations around the world, as we have been for the last 60 years. 
Since the original reciprocal trade agreements of 1934, the United States has taken this leadership role in reducing barriers to trade. We learned from the Smoot-Hawley legislation, we learned from the Great Depression of the 1930's, and we learned from the results of World War II that protectionism is not only bad economically, it's bad from the standpoint of promoting peace throughout the world. As I said, in the period of time since the United States started this process of reducing barriers to trade--not only our own barriers, but other barriers in other countries--we have seen global tariffs drop from an average of over 40 percent to about 4 or 5 percent today. This dramatic opening of world markets has led to an explosion of economic growth since World War II, and the United States has been the primary beneficiary of this growth. 
American workers are the most productive, highest paid workers in the world. American companies produce the highest quality products, and American consumers have more choices of goods and pay less of their income on necessities, such as food, than consumers anywhere else in the world. These are the benefits of fair trade agreements. 
Americans have enjoyed these benefits only because, through U.S. leadership, we have convinced other countries that freeing up trade and leveling the playing field for everybody is critical to economic growth, not only in our country, but around the world. And we have led by example. We have lowered our own tariffs to show our willingness to trade with the rest of the world, and to show that trade is beneficial to workers as well as consumers and not something to be feared. This bill reestablishes the United States in this leadership role. 
This bill will allow the United States to continue on the path of economic growth and prosperity, and will show the way for other countries as well. Free and fair trade creates jobs--stable, high-paying jobs. Exports support more than 11 million jobs in our country. These jobs, as I have said before, pay 15 percent higher wages than other jobs. In my own State, exporting companies have 32 percent higher benefits than nonexporting corporations. 
Trade is a major component of the economic growth of even the most recent decade. It is estimated that exports, as a share of gross domestic product, grew by 39 percent and accounted for nearly 50 percent of the total U.S. economic growth between the years 1986 and 1992. This year, total U.S. trade will be 30 percent of our total GDP. These statistics show that trade is important to this country. It's important to the well-being of our economy. 
This bill will allow the United States to maintain its competitive advantage in the global economy. Trade negotiating authority is necessary to remove barriers to our exports and, hopefully, some day remove all remaining barriers to our exports. These barriers are taking money out of the pockets of American farmers and workers. But without this bill, the rest of the world will continue to raise barriers to our products. We will remain on the sidelines--where we have basically been since 1994. 
Since trade negotiating authority expired back then, over 20 major trade agreements have been consummated. The United States was not a party to any of them. Do the opponents of this bill believe that other countries are looking out for the interests of the United States when negotiating these agreements? We had an opportunity to be at the table. Of course, nobody is going to look out for the interests of the United States, except our U.S. 
negotiators. We in the Congress are going to see that they look out for those interests. We can deny the President's authority to negotiate with a specific country. We will consult with the President of the United States on a regular basis on how those negotiations are going, and advise the President on what should be negotiated. Finally, we have an opportunity to enact the final product of any negotiations. 
Now, I said that we have had 20 agreements negotiated, where the United States was not a party. But I can show in some of those negotiations where U.S. economic interests--and maybe humanitarian and nonpolitical interests, or political interests have also been hurt. 
Chile is a good example of what we have sacrificed by not having trade negotiating authority. In 1992, President Clinton promised Chile that it would be part of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Five years later, Chile has a free trade agreement with Canada and with Mexico--the other two partners of the North American Free Trade Agreement--but not with the United States. Chile is an associate member of the MERCOSUR countries, which is a trading block composed of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Yet, Chile is still not a member of NAFTA. You might say, so what; you don't like NAFTA and you are applauding. But in the process, American workers and farmers are beginning to feel the consequences of this inaction. 
An American company recently lost a $200 million telecommunication contract to a Canadian company that enjoys preferential treatment under its trade agreement with Chile. 
American farmers currently supply 90 percent of Chile's free grain imports. Those are exports from states like Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Illinois. But our biggest competitors for this market, Argentina and Brazil, enjoy an 11-percent tariff advantage over American farmers. And whether or not we are going to continually supply feed grains to Chile--it is only a matter of time before we lose this important agricultural market. What will the opponents of this legislation say to the farmers of their State and the workers of their State when these workers and these farmers lose their jobs and lose income because this market is lost because we have an 11-percent disadvantage? This bill allows us to compete for these markets once again. 
The economic benefits of trade negotiating authority are very clear. But let's remember that trade is also an important foreign policy initiative. Free and fair trade is humanitarian, as well as it is economic. Free and fair trade promotes liberty and freedom around the world. This bill is going to help increase the standard of living of our trading partners and, with it, enhance the stability of their political and economic systems. And when you enhance the political and economic systems, you open the door, through trade, for the United States to export its democratic principles of liberty and freedom. We are seeing enhancement of these institutions in countries where freedom and liberty was foreign to a lot of people. Economic intercourse opens the way, opens the door; it is a window of opportunity for other things that we in America believe in, which you can't put a dollar and cents value on. We know that when Americans travel overseas, when we enhance our business opportunities with other countries, this sort of rubbing shoulders with people of other countries has benefits that go way beyond just the dollars and cents of free and fair trade. 
The people we trade with experience American values through the goods they purchase and the relationships they form when trading with us. In time, it is likely that they will insist that their own government uphold these values as well. We have seen it happen in Latin America, Eastern Europe, and someday--I am optimistic--we will see it happen in China. 
Many scholars believe that a country must attain a certain standard of living and economic stability before democracy can even begin. Trade, and not foreign aid, is the mutually preferred method of achieving economic growth and economic stability, which is a forerunner of political stability. 
Since 1986, I have hosted, on six different occasions during the month of August in my State, week-long tours of Iowa by foreign embassy ambassadors. In other words, the embassies here in Washington, DC, send their ambassadors and/or trade representatives. I hear from these people coming to my State of Iowa, again and again, from these international guests, that a mutually beneficial and healthy trade relationship is much preferred over foreign aid from the U.S. Government. While foreign aid can be fleeting, trade builds and expands economies. This, in turn, fuels the democratization process. So this bill helps our trading partners help themselves. 
Mr. President, the opponents of this bill want to turn back the clock. They prefer a time when this country could afford to be isolationist, when we could consume all in America that we produce, and we didn't have to worry about exports, 
and when economic growth could be sustained then by domestic production alone. 
Reminiscing about those past days may make for good political rhetoric. But that sort of rhetoric is dangerous because it simply ignores the economic facts of today's world. They ignore the benefits beyond economics that come from trade. Because, like it or not, we are in a global economy. Our jobs and standards of living have become to some degree dependent on trade with other countries. We can't afford to build walls around this country, and we can't afford to turn inward. If the United States were to do that, other countries would do it as well. And that could be dangerous. I just saw a quote recently, that I believe to be accurate. `If merchandise is not going to cross borders, soldiers will.' It is a preventive of war. It is a promotion of peace when we trade. 
We must lead. We still have all the advantages: A highly skilled, educated work force; we have technology, capital, and, most important, a sense of entrepreneurship that not only benefits America, but when this is promoted around the world, it is going to benefit all of the economies of the world. We also have the most stable economic and political system the world has ever known. The United States has the most to gain by leading and the most to lose by sitting on the sidelines. 
This bill is the first step back into reasserting our moral authority to lead in leveling the playing field in international trade, an authority that we have exercised since the 1930's. 
Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues that the question is not whether future trade negotiations will occur. They are happening right now under our very noses between countries all over the world. I have cited 20 specific examples since 1992. Rather, the question is whether the United States will be at the negotiating table protecting the interests of our citizens for the good of this country and for the good of the world. 
This legislation must become law. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in the spirit of legislation I am sponsoring with Senator Wyden, I want to make something clear. I want to make it a matter of public record that I am putting a hold on the nominations for ambassador of individuals being considered for posts in Bolivia, Haiti, Jamaica, and Belize. I am also asking to be consulted on any unanimous-consent agreements involving the Foreign Service promotion list if it should come up for consideration. 
I am taking this step to make it clear to the State Department and the administration that the Congress takes the law seriously. Something the administration appears not to do. Under the law, the administration is required to submit to the Congress on November 1 of each year the names of countries that the administration will certify for cooperation on drugs. Last year, the administration was late in submitting that list. The administration had asked for more time and we gave it to them. Although I believe 6 weeks was pushing it. 
The Congress made it clear then, however, that being late was not a precedent. We gave the administration an extra month in law. And they missed that deadline. They asked for more time last year and we gave it to them. We made it clear, though, that giving more time last year was not to become an excuse for being tardy in the future. 
This point seems to have gotten lost. This year, again, the administration has not submitted the list as required by the law on the date specified. And there is no indication just when or if it may arrive. This is simply not acceptable. This leisurely approach and irresponsible attitude needs an appropriate response. 
It appears we need to get the administration's attention so that they will abide by the law. This needs to be done especially on a law involving drug control issues at a time of rising teenage use. In the spirit, then, of reminding the administration that we in Congress actually do mean the things we say in law, I am putting a hold on these nominations. 
The countries in question have been on past lists, and therefore there is a link to my hold now. That hold will remain in place until such time as we receive the list in question. If we do not receive a timely response, I may consider adding to my list of holds. 
Let me note, also, that by `timely response' I do not mean a request for more time. I mean having the list in hand. The November 1 deadline is not a closely held secret. The fact that the list is due is not an annual surprise. Or it shouldn't be. I hope that the administration will find it possible to comply with the law, late though this response now is. And that they will do the responsible thing in the future. I thank you. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Breaux and myself, I am introducing legislation today to require the use of universal product numbers [UPNs] for all durable medical equipment [DME] Medicare purchases. The purpose of this legislation is to improve the Health Care Financing Administration's [HCFA] ability to track and to appropriately assess the value of the durable medical equipment it pays for under the Medicare Program. Very simply, our bill will ensure Medicare gets what it pays for. 
According to an interim report by the General Accounting Office [GAO] and the Office of Inspector General's review of billing practices for specific medical supplies, the Medicare program is often paying greater than the market price for durable medical equipment and Medicare beneficiaries are not receiving the quality of care they should. HCFA currently does not require DME suppliers to identify specific products on their Medicare claims. Therefore it does not know for which products it is paying. HCFA's billing codes often cover a broad range of products of various types, qualities and market prices. For example, the GAO found that one Medicare billing code is used by the industry for more than 200 different urological catheters, with many of these products varying significantly in price, use, and quality. 
Medicare's inability to accurately track and price medical equipment and supplies it purchases could be remedied with the use of product specific codes known as bar codes or universal product numbers [UPN's]. These codes are similar to the codes you see on products you purchase at the grocery store. Use of such bar codes is already being required by the Department of Defense and several large private sector purchasing groups. The industry strongly supports such an initiative as well. I am submitting several letters of endorsement for the record on behalf of the National Association of Medical Equipment Services and the Health Industry Distributors Association. 
This bill represents a common-sense approach. It will improve the way Medicare monitors and reimburses suppliers for medical equipment and supplies. Patients will receive better care. And the Federal Government will save money. I ask that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support this legislation which I am introducing today with my friend and colleague, Senator Breaux.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to inform my colleagues about an instance of failed leadership in protecting the taxpayers' money, and in executing the law enforcement functions of our Government. It's a story full of irony, of abuse of power, of a breakdown in the people's trust. 
Last Friday, and again today, hearings were held by the Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. The chairman of that subcommittee is Senator Susan Collins of Maine. The subject was the performance and conduct of the Treasury Department's inspector general, Valerie Lau, and her staff. 
During Friday's hearing, we learned that Ms. Lau personally let two illegal contracts, including one to a long time associate, Mr. Frank Sato. IG Lau violated procurement laws and regulations in the sole-source procurement of the two consulting contracts. The judgment that these two contracts were illegal was not made by members of the subcommittee. It was made by the independent, nonpartisan General Accounting Office. 
The GAO also found that IG Lau violated the standards of ethical conduct. This is because she failed to disclose her personal and professional relationship with Mr. Sato. 
Today, at the subcommittee's second hearing, we heard more. We learned that IG Lau and her staff provided false and/or inaccurate testimony to Congress and congressional investigators. We learned of the destruction of a document. The document was destroyed, in my view, as part of a cover-up. It was to hide the fact that a potentially criminal investigation had been launched--without merit--of two agents of the U.S. Secret Service. It was in retaliation for their testimony before Congress in the FBI Filegate matter. Again, that is my own judgment. 
The IG and her staff, as well as other Treasury officials, had told my staff as well as officials of the Secret Service that a potentially criminal case had been opened. Then, the IG and her staff denied having told us that, and maintained that such a case was never opened. The record now shows that those statements were false: There was, in fact, such an investigation of the two agents. 
Also today, we learned that the IG presides over an agency that has become totally demoralized. It's clearly because of failed leadership at the top. Wrongful and questionable activity can be assigned to virtually the entire upper level of the IG's office. The troops below are suffering from bad morale. The office of the Treasury IG has been severely crippled. 
The irony in all this is that an inspector general's job is to detect these very violations in others. An IG is not supposed to commit them. 
One of the illegal contracts that the IG let, grew from $85,000 to $345,000. That's called contract nourishment. There's not much to show for it. Except 1,000 rulers, Mr. President. The rulers are 6 inches in length. They're made of flexible plastic. They have the inspector general's mission, vision, and values statement printed on them to remind employees of who they are and what they do. 
Mr. President, I take the amount of rulers purchased--1,000--and divide that into the cost of the contract--$345,000--and I come up with a value per ruler of $345. 
That's right, Mr. President. The $345 ruler. 
Mr. President, this is not the first time in my experience that the Government bought ordinary products at extraordinary prices. I recall coming to this floor in 1983. I had with me a small steel washer that was a spare part for an Air Force airplane. The price of that washer was $364. It was worth only about a quarter. 
The Pentagon, at the time, defended the cost of the washer. First of all, it wasn't just a washer, you see. Why, it was a `sheer pin spacer.' And the $364-price tag wasn't really outrageous. After all, it was precision-molded from space-age alloys; extremely light weight, less than half an ounce; no moving parts; easy-to-handle circular shape; plus, there was inflation; transportation costs; special packaging; obsolescence; breakage; deterioration; pilferage; and so forth. All of these are costly. So, $364 was an absolute bargain, according to the Pentagon, for a steel washer. Excuse me--a sheer pin spacer. 
Given my experience with military spare parts, I thought to myself: Now, what could possibly be the justification for the Treasury IG first, buying all these rulers, and second, buying them at $345 per copy? 
Well, let's look at the first question: Why does the IG need all these rulers? There are only 300 employees in the office. Yet, she bought 1,000. That's three rulers for each employee. Perhaps the extra 700 are spare parts. 
Also, Congress recently passed the Government Performance and Results Act. That act gives Congress the ability to measure the performance of Government agencies. It does so by requiring agencies to come up with performance goals, and then provide us with data so we can measure their performance against their goals. 
The contract in question provided no real benefit to the taxpayers. It was intended to boost morale. But testimony from witnesses at today's hearing said morale was worse after the study than before it. That means, the only real, tangible benefit to the taxpayers out of this contract were the 1,000 rulers. 
So I must assume, Mr. President, that the IG needed these rulers to help measure performance. Is it possible the IG took the measurement function a little too literally? 
If so, that gives new meaning to the term `performance measurement.' 
Now that might justify why we purchased the ruler. But it doesn't justify the price tag. 
Perhaps I could take a stab at that. I note that the ruler is lightweight--less than half an ounce. It looks like it could be made of precision-molded space-age teflon. No moving parts. Flat, streamlined sides for trouble-free underlining. Able to withstand thousands of whacks on the knuckles. Customized to fit in most standard pockets. It's a real triumph of 21st century technological configuration. Then, of course, there's the packaging costs, the cost of inspection, planning, transportation, and so forth. Just like the DOD steel washer. A real bargain, Mr. President. 
With that kind of price tag, this IG is perhaps better off working at the Pentagon as a contracting officer, rather than an IG guarding the public's Treasury. At least at the Pentagon, a $345 ruler would not be an anomaly. 
But seriously, Mr. President, clearly the aforementioned is a major embarrassment for the inspector general, who needs to always be beyond reproach, for the Secretary of the Treasury, and for the President, who nominated this IG. And also the Congress, which confirmed the IG. 
But nothing is more unconscionable than what this IG's office did in perpetrating a potentially criminal investigation of two dedicated agents of the U.S. Secret Service, in retaliation for their testimony before two committees of the U.S. Congress. And after opening such a case, it was denied and covered up. As part of the cover-up, an official document was destroyed. 
I have seen similar abuses of power in the past, since I arrived in Congress. That's not what's new. Bureaucracies do that all the time. That's why we have IG's. IG's are supposed to catch those who abuse their power. 
What's new in all this is that the abuse of authority is by someone in whom the citizens have vested the powers to combat such actions. I have never seen such an abuse of power by a Federal law enforcement official. 
The responsibility of employing such powers is of enormous proportions. The full powers of the IG's office were directed against the most precious right that exists in this country--the civil liberties of two American citizens. It cost these two agents over $26,000 so far. Worse, there has been a cloud over them and their families for more than a year. 
What happens the next time these agents are in a court of law, or being interviewed for a future job opportunity? Suppose they are asked, `Have you ever been the target of a criminal investigation?' How are they supposed to answer that question? Technically, they were targeted improperly. But if it's a yes-or-no question, they would have to answer yes. It's just not fair. 
The process of correcting the wrong that was done began today. The IG, after a year of denials, contradictions, and wordsmithing, finally apologized at this morning's hearing. It was a year overdue. Nonetheless, it was the appropriate thing to do. 
I mentioned earlier that this ruler, purchased as part of one of the illegal contracts, displays the IG's value statement. Ironically, the actions of upper management in the IG's office systematically violated almost every one of them.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I voted for Mr. Rossotti to be reported out of the Senate Finance Committee. So, obviously, I support his nomination on the floor of the Senate today. 
His resume differs from many of his predecessors. That is, he did not come to this position through appointment of the President as a tax practitioner. He comes to us from having succeeded in the business world, but not as a tax lawyer. 
In business, he provided a superior product and a superior service. The country desperately needs a superior product and superior service at the IRS and a manager who can deliver both. That is why the country needs someone like Charles Rossotti to be Commissioner of the IRS. 
Senator Kerrey and I found, through our work on the Commission to Restructure the IRS, that what the IRS really needed was not a tax lawyer to head it up. That had been tradition. What they need is an organizational leader. I think Charles Rossotti fills that responsibility. The duties of the IRS are very much like a big business organization. 
Last year, the IRS had revenue of $1.4 trillion and a congressional appropriation of over $7 billion to collect that money. On the other hand, the IRS cannot satisfy the General Accounting Office that its books are in order. The IRS has a work force of 106,000 people. This compares to the 50 largest business organizations in America. The IRS serves 115 million individual taxpayers. Last year, it received 76 million inquiries. It handles 200 million different tax returns and over 1 billion information returns annually. 
It has offices in every State in the Nation. The National Treasury Employees Union is one of the largest labor unions in the country. The IRS deals with over 12,000 financial institutions and 12 Federal Reserve banks in some 600 locations. 
All of these things taken together require a manager with very special skills. Those skills do not necessarily involve expertise in the Tax Code. Consequently, that is my argument. The tradition of having a tax lawyer as IRS Commissioner is overblown. Somebody with organizational skills coming from a business organization with a proven track record in that environment is the best person to run this massive organization we call the IRS. 
The IRS Commissioner's job has been thought of as the chief tax collector of our country. In a way, I hope that Mr. Rossotti does not become the Nation's chief tax collector. We all expect him to collect every dollar that is legally due. 
But I would rather think of the Commissioner's job as that of the `chief customer service representative' at the IRS. We need to instill, in other words, through Mr. Rossotti and his background, the attitude of customer service at the IRS. In other words, another way to say that would be to put the word `service' back into the Internal Revenue Service. Mr. Rossotti seems to recognize improved customer service as his personal task. In the private sector he knew his organization would not be successful without putting customer service No. 1 on his priority.

Mr. GRASSLEY. In subsequent discussions with Deputy Secretary Summers we agreed that now is the time to acquire a nontax practitioner to lead the IRS. 
With Mr. Rossotti, we hope to capture the benefit of a superior organizational leader. The risk is that a nonlawyer could not handle the legal side of the Commissioner job. At the Finance Committee hearing on Mr. Rossotti's nomination, I asked Mr. Rossotti how he intends to perform legal analysis as a Commissioner of the tax law agency when he does not have that background. He responded that he would do it exactly the same way he would do it as a private-sector business leader. He would hire good advisers, consult the experts, and make clear decisions based upon all the information supplied to him. 
The Nation has a great opportunity with a person like Charles Rossotti. When coupled with legislative reform at the IRS, a nontax practitioner as IRS Commissioner represents a sea change at the IRS. The IRS is moving away from being a law enforcement agency and toward becoming a customer service agency. Of course, it is about time. Most people pay their taxes voluntarily and pay them honestly. 
Therefore, I encourage all my colleagues to support Mr. Rossotti's nomination and then we can take up the matters of legislative reform of the IRS with him as an ally. 
I think I need to speak for a moment in support of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act, the Kerrey-Grassley legislation. Our bill, S. 1096, is the product of 1-year's work in the National Commission to Restructure the Internal Revenue Service. Senator Kerrey and I participated in the commission as four congressional Members of this 17-member commission. The other 13 members were non-Congress-oriented, and 10 of those were from the private sector. So I think we had a broad range of expertise on this commission to study how can we make the IRS more consumer friendly and more efficient in its operation. 
The House might pass this same legislation as early as tomorrow. Our legislation is maybe the only thing more important to the IRS and the taxpayers than who the next Commissioner might be. If that Commissioner is dedicated, as I think Mr. Rossotti is, to change at the IRS, then he needs our legislation in order to succeed. 
I introduced S. 1096 with Senator Kerrey last July. However, the Senate seems to be on track to address this legislation next year rather than this year. There are arguments to wait--and I think our distinguished chairman, Senator Roth, is very sincere in his expression of these reservations. But, speaking for myself, delaying IRS reform is a mistake. The Senate should pass our legislation yet this year. The House is prepared to pass the companion bill. We can make IRS reform the law of the land before the 1997 holidays. If we did, the Senate would create a new reason for Americans to be thankful this November. 
There are two reasons for the Senate to join the House in supporting the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. First, troubled taxpayers literally can't wait for the relief that we provide in our bill. Second, the Senate will hopefully confirm the next IRS Commissioner nomination. Mr. Rossotti needs the tools that are in our bill in order for him to fully succeed in his job. Let's not require him to spin his wheels for another half-year. When you are dealing with the Internal Revenue Service, every day counts. If you are a taxpaying family and you are being hunted by the IRS, you need relief right away. If the Senate does not pass relief until 5 or 6 months from now, individual taxpayers will continue to suffer. At best, they may lose their life's assets. At worse, they may lose that which holds the family together. If you are in trouble with the IRS, 6 months is an eternity. 
The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act would provide immediate relief to taxpayers in trouble. We would extend to taxpayers a greater ability to recover costs and fees incurred to defend the 
family against the aggressive tax man. In the Senate hearings where we had these sort of horror stories about how the IRS can treat the taxpayer, we found that many taxpayers simply pay an unlawful tax assessment. Often it is cheaper than a legal defense against the IRS. 
When there is a tax due, our legislation sets standards and sets allowances within which we would require the IRS to make offers in compromise of a disputed claim. In other words, taxpayers get to pay their bill and go on with their lives. When a disputed claim includes both an IRS debt to the taxpayers and a taxpayer debt, we once and for all eliminate the IRS interest rate preference over taxpayers. 
Currently, when you owe the IRS money you pay a higher percentage than when the IRS doesn't make your refund and the Government owes you money. So if we wait another 6 months, we continue to give the Government the monetary advantage over the taxpayer. The Government earns a higher rate of interest from taxpayers than what the taxpayer get in return. It is a matter of equity that we would not charge the taxpayer more than we are willing to pay the taxpayer for money not refunded. 
Indeed, fundamental fairness is what finding a new breed of IRS Commissioner is all about. We are about ready to confirm Mr. Rossotti to be this person. I think he will be a fundamentally new sort of IRS Commissioner. He is experienced in leading large multistate organizations. He is experienced in organizing state-of-the-art information systems. That is his business. He is experienced in providing customer service or he would not be the head of a very successful private-sector organization. 
However, when he takes office, he is going to need all of the tools that we can think to provide him in order to succeed. It seems to me that Congress needs to pass legislation to knock down the legal barriers to his success on behalf of the taxpayer. Charles Rossotti needs the tools of reform on his very first day, not 6 months from now, and the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act provides those tools. 
For example, our legislation provides that the incoming IRS Commissioners would sit for a single 5-year term. The revolving door between the Commissioner's office and the tax industry will be closed. We will require Commissioners to stick around long enough to reap what they sow. More important, we will provide the Commissioner with an independent board of nine persons who will be his strategic leaders. The board will provide guidance on long-term goals and investments. The Commissioner will implement the corresponding day-to-day leadership at the IRS. 
Our legislation provides that the new Commissioner need not operate as a team of one. Our legislation offers the opportunity for the new Commissioner to bring in his or her own team of senior managers, because currently at the IRS and over decades of time, high-level bureaucrats at the IRS know they can always outlive any new IRS Commissioner. Previous IRS Commissioners have gone into those positions with high-level management there in a place frustrating what the Commissioner wants to accomplish. 
So it seems to me that the taxpayers deserve the best. Our legislation allows the next Commissioner to recruit the best and then to retain the best. We make it clear as the intent of the law. Mr. Rossotti hopes that even under existing law he can bring people in from other agencies of Government, through the Senior Executive Service, to accomplish a team that he wants. However, it is not clear if he can bring in people from outside of Government. He will need such new faces in order to get the job done. We ought to give him the best team that he sees necessary to accomplish his goal. 
However, I would say, having the right personnel is not enough because much of the trouble at the IRS stems from the IRS information system debacle. Currently, the IRS gets poor information from its computers and then makes it worse. In this age of information and technology, most persons are still filing paper tax returns. Then employees of the IRS input that data by hand at the IRS processing centers. This is where mistakes happen most often. Each mistake translates into an expense of time, money and, most importantly, hardships for the taxpayers. In our legislation, the Senate offers some strategic direction. 
We will direct the IRS and the next Commissioner to reach a target electronic tax filing rate of 80 percent by the year 2007. That 10 years starts right now, and it ought to start right now; it ought to not start 6 months from now when the Senate gets around to acting on this legislation. The Commissioner nominee recently told the Finance Committee that, once he can begin his job, it will take him 10 years to design and implement a state of the art information system at the IRS. We need to get that 10-year clock ticking right now, not 6 months from now. And the 10-year clock will not tick until the taxpayers get this legislation, the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act. 
For example, our IRS Restructuring and Reform Act would provide and set standards for security and access to taxpayers' electronic accounts. If we are going to have electronic filing, we will need electronic payment. Otherwise, we would still have people out there licking stamps and going to the post office on April 15. Our legislation accomplishes these things and many more. 
In short, waiting until next year to pass IRS reform is bad for taxpayers, and it's going to be lengthening the period of time that Mr. Rossotti will be the most effective Commissioner we have had for a long time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This bill, which I am introducing with Senator Durbin, will restore the stenographic preference for depositions taken in Federal Court. Under our system of government, Congress has the duty and responsibility to scrutinize carefully all of the rules of Civil Procedure promulgated by the Judicial Conference and transmitted to us by the Supreme Court for review--and to make modifications or deletions when appropriate. Indeed, when many changes to the rules were proposed in 1993, some were to be modified in legislation which was passed by the House. Unfortunately, the crush of the end-of-session legislation that year made it impossible for the Senate to act on this bill to modify these changes and they took effect in December of that year. 
Many of us in this body wanted to bring the bill forward, but opponents of the proposed modifications were able to delay any Senate consideration until after the effective date required by the Rules Enabling Act. Because of our responsibility to review these rules, I want to bring one of the modifications back before the Senate. This modification concerns rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. 
From 1970 to December 1993, rule 30 permitted depositions to be recorded by non stenographic means, but only upon court order or with the written stipulation of the parties. The change in rule 30(b) altered that procedure by eliminating the requirement of a court order or stipulation and affording each party the right to arrange for recording of a deposition by non stenographic means. 
Testimony at hearings conducted by the Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts and Administrative Practice in the 103d Congress raised concerns about the reliability and durability of video or audio tape alternatives to stenographic depositions. There was also information submitted suggesting that technological improvements in stenographic recording will make the stenographic method more cost-effective for years to come. 
Depositions recorded stenographically have historically provided an accurate record of testimony which can conveniently be used by both trial and appellate courts. In addition, the certification of accuracy by an independent and unbiased third party is a significant component of trustworthy depositions. Studies undertaken by the Justice Research Institute confirm the fact that a stenographic court reporter is the qualitative standard for accuracy and clarity in depositions, and a court reporter using a computer--aided transportation is the least costly method of making a deposition record. 
Even now, 5 years after the rule change, court reporters associations contend that mechanical recording frequently produces unintelligible passages and is laden with other dangers such as the inability to identify speakers. Rather than becoming the way of the future, electronic recording has been faulted by judges and attorneys as an error-prone system where tapes are often untranscribable because of inaudible portions, machines frequently fail, and recorders pick up every background sound, including papers rustling, coughing, and attorney sidebar conferences which then must be edited out before use by jurors or for the appeal process. 
The case was never made for unilateral decisions on the use of nonstenographic recording of depositions. The legislation that I am introducing today with my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, would restore the rule that nonstenographic recording of depositions is authorized only when permitted by court order or stipulation of both parties. 
This version of the rule worked very effectively for over 23 years. In fact, I am not aware of any instance where an attorney or party was denied the ability to use an alternative method when it was requested. However, the most important factor was that the prior incarnation of the Rules recognized the potential for errors from methods other than stenographic means and thus established the safeguards of stipulation or court order. In fact, the notes to accompany the 1970 version of the Civil Rules said it best: 
In order to facilitate less expensive procedures, provision is made for the recording of testimony by other than stenographic means--e.g., by mechanical, electronic, or photographic means. Because these methods give rise to problems of accuracy and trustworthiness, the party taking the deposition is required to apply for a court order. The order is to specify how the testimony is to be recorded, preserved, and filed, and it may contain whatever additional safeguards the court deems necessary.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak about the Department of Defense's illegal progress payment policy. 
I have spoken on this policy a number of times since the beginning of the year. Well, I thought we had finally laid the issue to rest. But how wrong I was. On July 22, DOD made a commitment to bring that policy into compliance with the law. 
The commitment was made by the nominee to be Deputy Secretary of Defense, Mr. John Hamre. At the time, he was the department's chief financial officer or CFO. He is now the Deputy Secretary of Defense. 
Mr. Hamre made the commitment in front of the leaders of the Armed Services Committee: Senator Strom Thurmond, chairman of the Armed Services Committee; Senator Carl Levin, ranking minority member of the committee; and The committee's ranking Republican, my friend from Virginia, Senator Warner; and the Senator from Iowa was also present. 
Mr. Hamre promised to put the new policy into effect on October 1, 1997. But October 1 has come and gone. As of this moment, the illegal policy is still in operation. For over 6 years now, the inspector general; the IG, has been telling DOD to fix the policy. And DOD has repeatedly promised to fix it. Unfortunately, Mr. President, these were empty promises. They are broken promises. 
Mr. President, John Hamre gave me his word he would fix it this time. A man's word is like gold. You should be able to take it to the bank. He proposed to bring the policy into compliance with the law. And he did it in front of the leadership of the Armed Services Committee. I expect him to keep his word. And the IG is involved, as well. The IG made a commitment to verify compliance. And DOD is not in compliance. This is a bad situation. The basic agreement is outlined in the IG's letter of July 23. I placed a copy of that letter in the Record on July 24. It can be found on page S8110. 
The July agreement started to unravel barely 1 month after being put together. It unraveled because of complaints from industry--mainly a group called the Council of Defense and Space Industry Associations--that is CODSIA.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRASSLEY. Industry's complaint boils down to one key point: The new policy will cost $1.3 billion in the first year alone. This is pure, grade A Pentagon baloney. The IG says it is baloney. 
No one knows what the new policy would cost--if anything. 
Maybe it would save money. 
DOD is paying accounting firms like Coopers & Lybrand hundreds of millions of dollars to resolve accounting errors. 
These accounting errors are caused, in part, by the current policy. 
If payments were made according to law, all the money paid to Coopers & Lybrand could be saved. Surely these saving would offset any new costs. Let's face it, the thought of more cost makes industry lick its chops. More cost is not the issue. 
More money is the issue. What I am talking about here is the flow of funds. 
The new policy threatens to interrupt the money flow. 
That is what scares CODSIA. 
And I am not talking about not paying legitimate bills on time. Under law, DOD must pay its bills promptly. 
I am talking only about bills that cannot or should not be paid. I am talking about overobligations and overpayments. 
DOD cannot write checks and pay bills with no money in the bank. 
Mr. President, this simple rule applies to most citizens in this country but not to entrenched bureaucrats in the Pentagon. 
They can dip into a bottomless well that is the $250 billion defense budget. 
This bottomless well allows DOD bureaucrats to merge and comingle appropriations. 
They do this to cover shortages--beyond the purview of Congress. Say a bill is submitted for payment, but the bureaucrats discover that there is insufficient money in the account to pay it. 
Under the current policy--that is Mr. Hamre's policy--the bureaucrat is authorized to arbitrarily and deliberately post it to another account--the wrong account--but one fat with cash. 
Mr. President, that is illegal. Yet that is exactly what CODSIA is asking DOD to keep doing. CODSIA refers to ACRN for accounting classification reference number. ACRN's identify appropriation accounts. 
I quote from CODSIA's letter to DOD:  
Continue the current DFAS [Defense Finance and Accounting Service] procedure of reallocating payment by ACRN when there are not enough funds in an ACRN to make the payment. 
In other words, CODSIA says: Keep charging the wrong account if there isn't enough money in the right account. 
Mr. President, that is a blatant violation of law. 
When an ACRN contains insufficient funds to pay a bill, the account is overdrawn. It is in the red. It is time for heads to roll. 
That is a violation of the Antideficiency Act--section 1341 of title 31, and that carries criminal penalties. It's a felony. 
And when you arbitrarily reach into another account to get the money, as CODSIA suggests, you also violate sections 1301 and 1502 of title 31. 
These laws are the sacred constitutional cornerstones of Congress' control over the purse strings. 
CODSIA shows no respect for these sacred constitutional principles. 
At least CODSIA is up-front about what it wants. It wants industry to get paid--even if it means breaking the law. 
There is another problem--overpayments. These are bills that should not be paid. 
DOD has a nasty habit of overpaying contractors and does it with great regularity. 
The bad part about it is DOD doesn't know when it happens. DOD doesn't have the controls in place to detect them. 
The only way DOD knows about an overpayment is when the contractor voluntarily returns the money. 
Well, Mr. President, guess what is causing overpayments? 
Answer: Mr. Hamre's current progress payment policy--the one he promised to terminate on October 1. 
A recent GAO report--No. 97-37, page 12--says this policy is `the most frequent cause of DOD's overpayments.' 
The GAO report is entitled `Fixing DOD's Payment Problem Is Imperative.' 
The new policy promised--but not delivered--by Mr. Hamre should put a lid on overpayments. 
Now if overpayments were stopped, who would suffer: CODSIA or the taxpayers? 
Mr. President, I think CODSIA has plenty of self-serving reasons for wanting to keep the current policy. 
CODSIA lost its credibility when it insisted that DOD break the law to keep the money spigot wide open. 
Mr. Fuqua's letter to Acting Comptroller Alice Maroni was followed by a similar letter to Mr. Hamre. 
This one was from the defense heavyweights: Boeing, Hughes, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. 
The message was the same.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Hamre buckled under all the pressure from industry. 
He responded with what I fear may be an open ended deferral of the new policy. 
In doing that, I am afraid he is breaking his word to me and the leadership of the Armed Services Committee. 
At this point, the future of the new policy is very much in doubt. 
Mr. President, I will have much more to say about this issue in the near future.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, as chairman of the International Narcotics Control Caucus, sometimes called the drug caucus of the U.S. Senate, I periodically report to the Senate on trends in the use of drugs and the dangers thereof that go on in our society. 
This month of October in my State of Iowa is called Drug-Free Month. I want to bring my colleagues' attention to this fact and the reason for it. Iowa has only 2.8 million people. As you know, it is largely a rural State. Des Moines, our largest city, numbers fewer citizens than one of the suburbs of some of our Nation's big cities. There are more people in the Los Angeles area or Chicago than in all of my State of Iowa. We are a closely knit community, proud of our commitment to families and the virtues of self-reliance, hard work and personal responsibilities. 
These facts, however, do not mean that Iowa is isolated from the mainstream or provincial in its thinking. This also does not mean that Iowa is free of the problems that beset States with larger cities and more people. We, in Iowa, unfortunately, see our share of gang violence and teen drug use. Indeed, Iowa shares in the growing drug problems among the young, the same that troubles the rest of the Nation. The fact that this problem reaches beyond our larger States and beyond our big cities into our rural heartland should tell us something about the far-reaching nature of our national--and I emphasize national--drug problem. 
According to recent numbers from my State of Iowa, as many as 11 percent of our high school seniors are regular users of marijuana. This number is up dramatically from just a few years ago. This number is growing as more kids at even younger ages no longer see using heroin as risky or dangerous. In the last few years, the number of regular users has grown steadily, whether it is in Iowa or across the country. In addition, we know from experience and research that as marijuana use goes up, so does drug use of other varieties. 
We now have a major problem in my State of Iowa in methamphetamine. This problem has exploded in just the last few years, paralleling the trend in the West and the rest of the Midwest. Reports of treatment episodes for meth problems in my State of Iowa soared over 300 percent between 1994 and 1995. The trend continues. Just as troubling is the effort by the criminal gangs to site the labs that produce and sell this poison to our kids in Iowa. This is something that we are seeing through the West and Midwest, and the problem is moving eastward. 
The lab problem is a double whammy. The labs produce a dangerous drug that poisons the hearts and souls of our kids and then they create a very dangerous environmental hazard requiring cleanup wherever the labs are found. Cleanup is risky, dangerous, costly. Many of our local fire and police departments lack the resources or the training to deal with the problem of cleaning up meth labs. 
This problem and the trends that I have noted are not unique to Iowa. They are indicative of what is happening across the country. They are happening because we have lost our fear of drugs. We have let our guard down. Into that environment drug pushers and drug legalizers have stepped in to do their own song and dance. They are making gains; we are losing ground. And it is the kids who are paying the price. 
Two very important concerns are being missed. The first is the serious nature of the growing drug use among kids. The second is the growing tendency to regard this trend with complacency, or worse, to go along with the drift into a de facto legalization of dangerous drugs. The last time we as a country did this we landed ourselves into the midst of a major drug epidemic. We were just beginning to dig ourselves out from the 1970's and 1980's. Now it seems the earlier lessons are forgotten. 
There is no way to put a happy face on what is happening. It is not hard to describe. It is not difficult to understand. It is not beyond our power to do something about it. Yet what is happening is happening right under our very noses, and to date what we are doing about it is not working. This is what is happening: 
Between 1992 and 1995, marijuana use among kids aged 12 to 17 has more than doubled--from 1.4 million to 3.1 million. More than 50 percent of the high school seniors have used drugs before graduation; 22 percent of the class of 1996 were current users of marijuana. LSD use by teens has reached record levels. Evidence indicates that the current hard-core addict population is not declining. 
Hospital emergency room admissions for cocaine-related episodes in 1995, the last year for which there is complete information, were 19 percent above the 1992 levels. Heroin admissions increased almost 60 percent. Drugs of every sort remain available and of high quality at cheap prices while the social disapproval has declined, especially among policy leaders and opinion makers. 
Hollywood and the entertainment industry are back in the business of glorifying drug use in movies and on TV. There is a well-funded legalization effort that seeks to exploit public concerns about health care issues to push drug legalization, most often under the guise of medical marijuana. 
Opinion polls among kids indicate that drugs and drug-related violence are their main concerns. They also make it clear that drugs are readily available in schools, and the kids as young as 9 and 10 years are being approached by drug pushers in school or on the way to school. 
This is only part of what is happening. Taken together, what these things indicate is that we are experiencing a rapid increase in teenage drug use and abuse. This comes after years of progress and decline in use. These changes are undoing all of the progress that we had made during the 1980's. If the trend continues, our next drug epidemic will be worse than the last one. We will not only have the walking wounded from our last epidemic--there are over 3 million hard-core addicts--we will also have a new generation of substance-dependent kids moving into adulthood. As we learned, or as we should have learned during the last time that we went through this, this dependence is not a short-term problem. For many addicts, it is a lifetime sentence. 
For the communities, families, and the Nation that must deal with these people and with the problems associated with it, it is also often an open-ended commitment. 
Along with this comes all the associated violence that has made many of our inner cities and suburban neighborhoods dangerous places. Not to mention the medical and related costs in the tens of billions of dollars annually. And all of this for something that advocates reassure us is purely a personal choice without serious consequences. This is one of those remarks that should not survive the laugh test. 
The fact that it does, however, and people can somehow make light that personal choice of drug use is not something to worry about and doesn't have serious consequences is an indicator of our problem in coming to terms with the drug use. 
In the last 5 years, the record on drugs has gotten worse. Pure and simple. It's not because we are spending any less on the effort. Indeed, the drug budget has grown every year. One of the first acts of the Republican Congress was to increase the money devoted to combat drugs. Yet, the numbers on drug use grow worse. 
One of the leading causes of that is a lack of leadership at the top. The President and First Lady in previous administrations were visible on the drug issue. That is not now the case. The present occupant of the White House has put a great deal of emphasis on tobacco but he has been the Man Who Never Was on illegal drugs. More than this, the message about both the harmfulness and, just as important the wrongfulness of illegal drug use has been allowed to disappear. I leave to others to determine if the President's absence is because his advisors believe he has no credibility on the issue or simply do not care. Whatever the explanation, the result is an ambiguous message or no message. 
If we could have the same message coming out of the White House on illegal drugs as we do on tobacco, I think we would be much further along on the road to victory on the war against drugs. 
We need to be consistent in our no-use message on illegal drugs. To be ambiguous or complacent or indifferent sends the wrong message. The recipients of that muddled message are kids. The consequences of garbled messages can be seen in changes in attitudes about drugs, and in drug use numbers among kids at earlier and earlier ages. We cannot afford this type of unmindfulness. 
That is why we are having Drug-Free Iowa Month. We need to come together as a community to recognize the threat and deal with it. We need community leaders involved. We need our schools, politicians, business, entertainment, sports, and religious figures to be aware of the problem and engaged to deal with it. We can make a difference, but that begins with awareness. It requires an effort. It requires sustaining that effort. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1997. This bill, which I am introducing with Senator Durbin, will tighten bankruptcy laws and do much to stem the tide of casual bankruptcies. With bankruptcy filings at all time record highs, it's imperative that Congress enact serious and tough reforms of the consumer bankruptcy chapters. 
By far, the most pressing bankruptcy policy question facing America today relates to the explosion of consumer bankruptcies. Last April, I chaired a hearing on the crisis in consumer bankruptcies. While there's not much agreement about the root causes of the rise in consumer bankruptcies, it's obvious that Congress needs to do something now--before the economy takes a downturn--to reverse this trend. At the present time, the economy is doing well and unemployment is low. Inflation is under control. 
But we know there are always potholes on the road to economic prosperity. And we know that when the economy declines, bankruptcies increase. With so many bankruptcies now, when times are good, I shudder to think of the strains we will face if we hit a recession. Clearly, Congress needs to act while the economy is still in good shape. 
The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act will discourage casual bankruptcies by sending a clear signal that you can't file for bankruptcy and walk away from your debts if you have the ability to re-pay some portion of those debts. This is a simple and straightforward idea whose time has come. According to my research, Congress considered reserving bankruptcy relief for only those Americans who can't re-pay their debts as far back as 1932. So, what we're proposing is not based on some unprecedented concept, but instead has a long and distinguished history. 
The bill I'm introducing today amends section 707(b) of the bankruptcy code to permit bankruptcy judges to transfer debtors to chapter 13, or dismiss a case outright, if the debtor could re-pay 20 percent or more of their nonpriority unsecured debts. And the bill changes current law to let creditors bring motions to bankruptcy judges to have debtors moved to chapter 13 or have their cases dismissed. This means that creditors can be the masters of their own destiny. The bankruptcy code should not 
prevent creditors from even presenting evidence that debtors who could repay their debts are abusing the bankruptcy code and walking away scott-free. 
The bill also allows private chapter 7 trustees to bring motions under the new section 707(b). And if they win on their motion, and the debtor is either dismissed or transferred to chapter 13, the private trustee will be reimbursed for attorney's fees. As an added incentive for the private trustees, if they win on a section 707(b) motion, the court can order the debtor's attorney fined and make that fine payable to the trustee. Thus, there will be a army of trustees looking for debtors who shouldn't be in bankruptcy. This will cause people to think twice before rushing to declare bankruptcy. And that's a very positive reform. 
However, in order to forge a bipartisan compromise, the bill doesn't make ability to repay the only factor in determining whether to transfer or dismiss a case. Instead, each debtor's individual circumstances will be examined. In this way, our bill avoids the injustice which can accompany a crude formula with practically no exceptions. 
I'm also very aware that there have been abuses by creditors using harsh and abusive tactics to collect debts from people who have declared bankruptcy. So, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act contains an entire title--title II--dedicated to enhancing consumer protections by requiring judges to impose stiff penalties for abusive conduct and frivolous court filings. As a strong supporter of rule 11 reform, I believe that Congress should crack down on groundless court filings which some creditors have used to harass and intimidate debtors. 
I also believe that the Grassley-Durbin bill will encourage alternative dispute resolution and out-of-court settlements under the new section 707(b), if a creditor refuses to attempt ADR, then a debtor who could otherwise be transferred from chapter 7 to chapter 13 can raise this noncooperation as a defense. This will encourage creditors to negotiate out-of-court settlements. And that will save court time and resources--a goal which I am strongly committed to. I think that bringing Bureau of Labor statistics numbers into the bankruptcy code for the first time, as the House bill does, is unprecedented and will breed new and costly litigation. The Grassley-Durbin bill avoids this problem by relying on time-tested bankruptcy provisions to identify chapter 7 filers who really need to be in chapter 13 or out of the bankruptcy system altogether. 
This bill is fair and balanced and will implement needed changes efficiently and without the uncertainty and new litigation associated with statistical formulas which are completely foreign to the bankruptcy code. It will crack down on bankruptcy abuses on both sides of the equation. And it will tell those who don't want to take personal responsibility for their debts that the free-ride is over. 
Finally, the bill also strikes the cap on single asset real estate, a goal which I have long supported. I'm very grateful to Senator Durbin for working with me on this matter, since it really is so important to the health of the commercial banking industry.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, what we are proposing in the Wyden-Grassley amendment is not going to hurt anybody. Senator Wyden and I experimented with this so the other 98 Members of the Senate would not have to be hurt if it didn't work. Well over a year ago, we voluntarily, on our own, without any instigation from the rules or anything or anybody else, we publicly stated that we were going to follow the practice of our amendment, even though we didn't have to, and when we put a hold on a bill or a nomination, we would put it in the Congressional Record. We did that. I can speak for myself and say that there are no bruises, there is no harm, there is no retaliation. Nothing happened as a result of the whole world knowing why Senator Grassley or Senator Wyden were holding up a particular action. 
I think that ought to tell everybody else that they can likewise do whatever they need to do in the Senate to adequately represent the interests of their constituents through the use of a hold and freely tell everybody, and the end result can still be accomplished without anybody being hurt as a result of it. I hope that we will now institutionalize what I have found to be a very effective way of doing the job of U.S. Senator and, yet, at the same time, being open and aboveboard about it. 
This amendment requires simply disclosure by Senators of the holds that they place on legislation. As we all know, the current Senate practice allows Senators to block consideration of any measure without disclosing their actions just by notifying Senate leaders of their objection. Our amendment does not stop this practice. Rather, we seek to put an end to the secrecy surrounding the practice. If any Senator objects to legislation, that Senator should have the courage and conviction to express openly the reasons for opposition. It is critical to preserve the right of every Senator to represent the views of his constituents, but we cannot fully earn the trust of our constituents if we do not shed the brightest possible light on what we do here in the people's assembly. 
It is important for the Senators to remember that their right to place holds on initiatives about which they have objection, then, is very much preserved in the tradition of the Senate, but everything is out in the open. The only thing untraditional about it is, if you want to hold up legislation, you should state your reason in the Record and let people know. All we are requiring is that Senators make their objections known in one of two ways--either stating their objections on the floor, or publishing their objections in the Congressional Record within 48 hours of placing such a hold. 
It is a simple amendment that sends a very powerful message that the U.S. Senate is willing to operate in an open manner, according to the principles of representative democracy. I believe this amendment can only increase our constituents' belief that we are willing to be open and honest about the legislative process and what our legislative agenda is. It should help reduce some of the cynicism toward the processes of representative Government here at the Federal level. 
I thank Senator Wyden for his work on this amendment and the majority leader for accommodating this issue. It will go to conference. I would expect comity between the House and Senate because this is just a Senate issue, and that there will not be any objection on the part of the House because of comity. 
In the case of the Senate, since this is being adopted by the Senate, I would expect that our Senate conferees would uphold the amendment and it would become a part of the traditional process. 
I urge my colleagues to continue to work toward reform that makes Congress more open and straightforward in how we do the people's business. I thank you for your consideration.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today Mr. Ken Apfel will be sworn in for the position of Commissioner of the Social Security Administration. Mr. Apfel was confirmed earlier this month to direct the agency responsible for administering the largest domestic program in the United States. Social Security will have an impact on the life of every single American at one time or another. I support Mr. Apfel's confirmation to head this vital agency. 
Mr. Apfel will guide the Social Security program into the 21st century, bringing it right up to the edge of the largest demographic shift this country has ever seen. Starting in 2010, the baby boom generation--70 million strong--will begin entering retirement. Because of the tremendous medical strides we have made in extending life expectancy, this cohort will be living longer and collecting benefits longer. It is imperative that our Social Security program be ready to absorb such a huge influx of beneficiaries. The Commissioner must be a leader in preparing the agency and the program itself, to meet this challenge. 
Preparing for the retirement of the baby boom generation is only half of the challenge. There are on-going problems that must be addressed as well. The Social Security Administration has had difficulties protecting taxpayer dollars. The General Accounting Office recently elevated the Supplemental Security Income Program to its high-risk list of Federal programs because of their inability to pay out the proper amount of money. Huge overpayments go out to beneficiaries--most of which are never collected. Additional problems exist in the Disability Insurance Program. Prisoners and legal aliens have received benefits improperly. The agency has not fulfilled its legislative mandate to refer applicants and recipients of disability benefits to appropriate rehabilitation. Addressing these issues is very important because problems in any one of the programs that the Social Security Administration operates undermines confidence in all of the programs. 
I will say right now that I do not envy Mr. Apfel. He is endeavoring to take on a job with many difficult challenges. Having met with him personally, I can honestly say I believe he can do the job. It is my hope, however, that he will not fall into the practice of his predecessors of not taking a pro-active stance with regard to policy issues faced by the Social Security Administration. When he sees the need for legislative action, or he sees problems with policies that must be changed--that he communicate with Congress immediately. 
I hope he will see himself , in his capacity as Commissioner, as a liaison to the public, to the President, and to Congress to resolve some of the most important challenges that will face our country and the Government over the next 6 years. Most of all, SSA, like any other Government agency, is an overseer of taxpayer dollars--our money. That responsibility must be taken with the utmost seriousness and deliberation. If he can motivate his personnel to do that--protect taxpayer dollars--he will have a successful term as Commissioner.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today was a landmark day for the American people in hearings before two Senate committee on which I serve. 
As chairman of the Special Committee on Aging and the request of my colleague, Senator Shelby, I assembled several panels to raise the awareness of the second-leading cause of cancer death for men: prostate cancer. 
In the Finance Committee, we opened up 3 days of unprecedented oversight hearings into systemic abuses of power by the Internal Revenue Service. 
The telephones were ringing off the hook in my office as these hearings were underway. That's how much these issues struck a chord with the American people. 
And suddenly, the hearings were canceled. Why? Was it a national emergency? The death of a colleague? An international crisis? Hardly. 
Instead, the Democratic leadership used the Senate rules to shut down the public's business. 
They shut down important policy debates on prostate cancer and IRS abuses. And that's only in the two committees I was involved with. Other committees were affected. 
What's apparently more important to the Democratic leadership than these issues is a partisan political issue in Louisiana. It's an issue involving campaign irregularities in a campaign in Louisiana involving one of our colleagues. 
Certainly, this is an important issue, although political. But is it important enough to systematically close down the public's business? 
The hearing before the Committee on Aging this morning was called at the urging of Senator Shelby. He is a prostate cancer survivor. The hearing was designed literally to help save lives. 
This year alone 335,000 American men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. The ranking member of the Committee on Aging--Senator Breaux--and I worked to put together a healthy policy debate about treatment options. 
This productive debate, a debate that could help save lives, was cut short this morning because of politically motivated maneuvering through Senate rules. We were therefore unable to engage in a full debate about when to screen and how to treat prostate cancer. 
Among the 10 witnesses scheduled to testify this morning was the distinguished former Senate majority leader Bob Dole. I'm happy we were able to hear his statement before the shutdown. 
Senator Dole's testimony this morning was his first official event on Capitol Hill since he left the Senate in June 1996. 
No better way, in my view, to get the message out. 
Today, I think this legislative body would be well-served to remember the productive, bi-partisan leadership of Senator Dole. The people's business was always Bob Dole's first concern as he presided over the work of the Senate for many years. 
The second very important effort stopped by this maneuvering today was landmark hearings of the Finance Committee to expose the excesses and abuses of the American taxpayer at the hands of the Internal Revenue Service. 
The fair-minded and very capable chairman, Senator Roth, spent 8 months preparing these hearings to talk about the specific problems and to consider specific solutions on how the IRS can be restructured to work for taxpayers, not against them and at the expense of the civil liberties of individual Americans. 
All of this was disrupted by the Democratic leadership who put petty politics ahead of the public's health. I'm very disappointed. And I wouldn't be surprised to learn of the public's disappointment as well. 
The Democratic leadership needs to explain to the American people why partisan politics seems more important than No. 1: raising the awareness of the second-leading cause of cancer death for men, prostate cancer. No. 2: exposing abuse and mistreatment of hardworking taxpayers at the hands of the IRS. 
If you don't like the investigation into campaign irregularities in Louisiana, fine. But should the priorities of the American people be shoved aside for the partisan concerns of a political party? I don't think so. 
Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Pension Tools Act of 1997. Why pension tools? Because this legislation contains the components, or tools that will assist pension participants and retirees to understand the fundamentals of their pension plans, get them to think about their retirement for the long term, and when problems arise--help put in place a cost-effective conflicts resolution process. 
This legislation is very important to today's retirees and workers. In June, the Senate Aging Committee, which I chair, convened a hearing which highlighted the growing problem of pension mistakes. That's right, Mr. President. A pension mistake. The problem addressed at the hearing did not target intentional wrongdoing--but honest mistakes by employers which can lead to a cut in a monthly pension payment or a lump-sum payment a worker takes when leaving a job. 
It's impossible to determine how big the problem is, but it is a growing concern. To try to document how big the problem could be, I asked the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC] to provide me with data about a program they administer called the standard termination audit program. The program audits a sample of plans which have terminated--these are not plans which have gone bankrupt. The PBGC released a letter to my committee which showed that certain pension payouts have errors in the range of 8 percent. That number has increased since the program started back in 1986 when it was 2 percent. Many of these errors involve substantial sums of money. In fact, one in three people who were shortchanged, were shortchanged by at least $1,000. 
Other pension experts and advocates would put the number of mistakes at a higher rate--in the range of 15 to 20 percent. But we just can't say what the number is because none of the agencies who regulate pensions audit whether or not the pensions and lump-sum payments that are made to the majority of workers and retirees are usually accurate. Most employers are doing their best to pay the right amount but mistakes do happen. The problem is that people are not aware that they really need to verify that their pension payouts are the right amount. 
The hearing called attention to that very problem. Too many workers lack a full understanding of how their pension works and how much their benefit will be until just before retirement. 
It is my hope that this legislation will be a vital part of our effort to educate people about the need to prepare for retirement. One of the components of good retirement preparation is tracking your employer-provided pension and knowing your pension rights. 
Specifically, this legislation will give employees the opportunity to have benefit statements sent to them on a regular basis. In addition, the legislation clarifies that pension plan participants and beneficiaries should have access to plan documents which show how their pension benefit was calculated. That way, they can check the math and verify that their benefit is correct. 
My bill will also address two other problems raised at the hearing. First, one problem faced by pension participants and beneficiaries is that employers are slow to respond to their requests for information. To address that problem, we will authorize the Secretary of Labor to assess a fine if an employer fails or refuses to provide information in a timely manner. The other problem that this bill will address is to clarify that a person who has been cashed out of a plan can still get information from the plan administrator if a problem arises after the person separates from employment. 
Senator Breaux and I are also including a directive to the Secretary of Labor to draft model procedures for alternative dispute resolution. The enforcement option open to pension participants now--a lawsuit--is simply too costly for many people who are living on a fixed income. 
Part of the problem we see is that pensions are very complex. It is hard for employers to administer pensions even with the expert advice of paid pension consultants. I am continuing to seek ways to alleviate some of the pressure on employers. We have already taken the first step of asking the General Accounting Office to review the changes in the law since the passage of GATT--this had an impact on interest rates--one of the areas where we see the most problems in pension errors. We are also looking into the usefulness of mandating that employers provide a summary annual report of the pension plan to participants every year. These summary reports are not user-friendly and do not provide the participants with information in an accessible way. Benefit statements and the use of education and outreach may provide a substitute for the annual mailing of summary annual reports to pension participants. 
I am also submitting for the Record two letters of support for the legislation. The first letter is from the Pension Rights Center here in Washington, DC. The center has a long history as an effective advocate for participant rights. The second letter was submitted by the American Society of Pension Actuaries. This group strongly supports the idea of automatic benefit statements and we will certainly work with them to clarify language in the legislation. 
While great strides have been made since the act went into effect, participants and beneficiaries still lack access to basic but vital information and tools to enforce their rights. Having a pension can make all the difference to people once they retire. The Pension Tools Act strikes the right balance to get people useful information about their pensions and help them enforce basic rights to that information. I urge my colleagues to support the efforts of Senator Breaux and myself to ensure that retirees and workers get every penny they have earned when the time comes to retire.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to address an important topic which will be coming before the Senate in the near future. In 1994, Congress created the Bankruptcy Review Commission and charged this Commission with developing suggestions for changing the bankruptcy code. As the ranking member of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over bankruptcy at that time, I assisted in creating the Commission, When I became the chairman of the subcommittee after the 1994 elections, I fought to ensure that the Commission was funded. The Commission's report is due on October 20, 1997. I will have much to say at that time about the Bankruptcy Review Commission and the way in which it was conducted. As some of my colleagues may know, there have been some troubling instances that have come to my attention regarding the way the Commission has operated. 
For now, however, I simply want to outline my views on the substance of bankruptcy reform. 
I believe that the current bankruptcy system needs to be fixed in several ways. Under current law, it is just too easy to declare bankruptcy. And it is too easy for people who declare bankruptcy to avoid repaying their debts when they have the ability to do so. Of course, decades of irresponsible and runaway spending by Washington has set a bad example for the American people, so Congress bears some of the responsibility for this new attitude of deficit living that seems to push many Americans into bankruptcy. 
With record numbers of personal bankruptcies in this country, American businesses are losing millions of dollars a year to bankruptcy. And this results in higher prices for homes, cars and other consumer goods for those Americans who pay their bills on time, and as agreed. In other words, those of us who play by the rules are picking up the tab for those who don't. 
I think that Congress needs to tighten the bankruptcy system so that bankruptcy is reserved for only those Americans who really need the extraordinary protections of the bankruptcy code. At the same time, I'm very aware that creditors can sometimes use abusive tactics. In fact, Sears was recently forced to pay a multi-million dollar settlement for engaging 
In abusive activity. So, in my opinion, bankruptcy reform which will help creditors get more of what they are owed should also include reforms to enhance protections for debtors from harsh or abusive conduct. 
Section 707(b) is one example of a situation where the bankruptcy code sends the wrong signal to the American people and may encourage irresponsible conduct. Section 707(b) allows a bankruptcy judge to dismiss a chapter 7 case only to prevent substantial abuse. In other words, Section 707(b) says that it's OK to abuse the bankruptcy system somewhat, so long as you don't abuse it so much that the abuse becomes substantial. I think we in Congress ought to change this to say that debtors can't abuse the bankruptcy system at all. The consideration of Section 707(b) will be very important when Congress considers reforms in the context of consumer bankruptcy. 
I also believe that chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code needs fundamental reform. In hearings before my subcommittee on how bankruptcy disrupts funding for education, I learned that many businesses which attempt to re-organize flounder for too long, thereby deleting the assets of the company. That's less money for creditors and employees of the company. I think that this should change. The Bankruptcy Review Commission has adopted a proposal to speed things up for small businesses in chapter 11 cases. I look forward to supporting that proposal in the next session of Congress. 
I believe that Congress needs to look long and hard at the way attorneys are compensated in bankruptcy. It seems to me, from the reports I receive from around the country, that attorneys are using up the assets of the bankruptcy estate without really contributing very much. And attorney's fees are paid ahead of--and at the expense of--schools, workers and children entitled to child support. I think that's something we need to change. I'm a little disappointed that the Review Commission did not really get into this issue, but it is something that I will be pursuing in the bankruptcy reform bill. 
Another area which needs attention is the effect of the new global economy on bankruptcy. With the increase in international trade, many complex questions arise when a multinational company declares bankruptcy. Right now, 
international insolvency is an issue where there isn't very much international cooperation. The United Nations recently approved a model law on international insolvency and bankruptcy and I look forward to considering that model law in the coming year. In the United States, we put a great deal of emphasis on reorganizing companies under chapter 11. Chapter 11 protects jobs and creditors. But other nations don't put such an emphasis on reorganization. So these foreign nations sometimes aren't as respectful of our bankruptcy laws as they should be. Of course, the United States has exercised a leadership role in the area of international bankruptcies for many years through section 304 of the Bankruptcy Code which recognizes the validity of foreign bankruptcies. It is time to take the next step and make sure that all companies--wherever they are located--are treated fairly when they confront the bankruptcy laws of a foreign nation. If companies fear that they won't be treated fairly under a foreign nation's bankruptcy system, they may be less willing to invest. And that would hamper international trade, which America needs if it is to remain a strong and vibrant economy. 
Mr. President, unfortunately there is a very parochial perspective among many bankruptcy professionals. The idea has somehow flourished that bankruptcy should be as broad and all-encompassing as possible. I don't share this point of view. I think we have to remember that bankruptcy should be a last resort. And that means the bankruptcy laws should be narrow and provide only as much relief as is necessary. The so-called automatic stay provides a clear example of the parochial attitude of many in the bankruptcy community. The automatic stay is a court injunction which automatically arises whenever anyone declares bankruptcy. Earlier in this Congress, as part of the authorizing legislation for the Chemical Weapons Convention, I authored an amendment which gives the Government an exception to the automatic stay so that public health and safety regulations can be enforced. So, the philosophical question posed by my amendment is this: Which policy should win out, bankruptcy policy or public health and safety policy? For me, that choice is simple. I want to protect the American people from unsafe food and unsafe airlines. But many in the bankruptcy community believe that Congress should make the opposite choice. 
When we begin the process of bankruptcy reform, I will be looking to find other instances in which the Bankruptcy Code harms the public so that Congress can make changes to protect the public. 
The broad themes that I believe will dominate bankruptcy reform in the 105th Congress, include the following: Promoting personal responsibility; protecting consumers, debtors, and the public; promoting international commerce; and protecting States' rights where possible. 
I look forward to coming before the Senate next year with a good bankruptcy reform bill which promotes these themes. I hope to do that in a bipartisan manner. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Social Security Advisory Board Sunshine Act. This legislation will apply the public meeting and disclosure requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act to the Social Security advisory board. 
The Social Security Advisory Board was created in 1994 when the Social Security Administration became an independent agency. Its purpose is to serve as an advisor to the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, the President and the Congress. The 1994 law requires the Board to make recommendations on some of the most critical issues facing the Social Security Administration and the country, including: How to ensure economic security for Government retirement and disability programs; how to ensure the solvency of Social Security programs; how to improve the quality of service and the policies and regulations that influence that service; and how to increase the public's understanding of Social Security. 
With such a significant mandate, the question we should be asking is not why have open meetings, but why not have open meetings? This Board has been entrusted with the responsibility of making policy recommendations regarding the largest domestic Government program in this country. Virtually every American is affected by Social Security. Every American has a stake in Social Security. They have the right to know what recommendations are being made and why. The Federal Advisory Committee Act, which became public law in 1972 is intended to promote good Government values, such as openness, accountability, and balance of viewpoints. At the heart of the matter is a desire to keep the channels open between Government and the interested public. 
Yesterday, during the confirmation hearing for Ken Apfel for the position of Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, I asked him if bringing the Advisory Board under the Sunshine laws was a good idea. He said, `I think sunshine is almost always a good idea.' 
My legislation would require the Advisory Board to provide notice of all meetings, make available for public inspection all Advisory Board documents, provide opportunities for nonmembers to participate in Board meetings, keep minutes of those meetings, and make transcripts of Advisory Board meetings available. In addition, the Social Security Administration will be required to disclose the disbursement of money to, and the disposal of money by, the advisory Board. 
My legislation would also provide for compensation of the board members. Board members are paid per diem travel expenses, but they receive no compensation for the time they take off work to attend the meetings, which are held once a month. Because they have been given charge of such an important task, and because of the homework that must be done in order for them to be prepared and participate in meetings, compensation commensurate with that of similar boards and committees is only fair. 
I want to commend the Board on the work it has done so far, particularly to highlight the need to expand the Social Security Administration's policy analysis capabilities. Those capabilities will be very important as we jump start discussions about Social Security reform. 
The Advisory Board will be undergoing some changes in membership in the near future. I intend to work at getting this legislation enacted as soon as possible so the change in membership will occur with a change in the philosophy that Government is best done in the open and not behind closed doors.

Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to take this opportunity to commend the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Specter, for his leadership in crafting what is arguably one of the most difficult and perhaps the most complex appropriations bills Congress must deal with each year. 
I share his concerns that while there are so many worthwhile programs covered by this legislation, we are unfortunately constrained by limited resources. 
As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am especially concerned about one item in the bill--the recommended appropriation for the National Institute on Aging. 
As baby boomers shoulder their way into the 21st century, nearly 35 million Americans will be age 65 or older, compared to just 3.1 million at the start of this century. This tremendous growth is due in large part to better living standards as well as this Nation's commitment to medical research. As a result of past research investments we now have new and more effective treatments for arthritis, high blood pressure, stroke, and other diseases. 
But as you know, many critical challenges remain--not the least of which is the scourge of Alzheimer's disease. 
Alzheimer's disease and related disorders present one of the greatest threats to the health and economic security of the generation that will enter retirement in the 21st century. It has already stricken 4 million Americans. And if left unchecked, 14 million will fall victim to Alzheimer's by the middle of the next century. It will defeat all of our best efforts in Congress and as a nation to control health care costs and assure the quality of health care in general. 
I know that the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee shares my concern. As in my State of Iowa, his home State has a high proportion of elderly. 
I note that this legislation recommends $520.7 million for the National Institute on Aging. While that represents an increase over this year's funding and the House level, the rate of increase is below the average increase to NIH as a whole. 
I would like to ask the distinguished chairman that he keep in mind the importance of adequate funding of the National Institute on Aging. The challenges, and the opportunities, surrounding our aging population have never been greater.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Investment in Education Act of 1997. This bill will close gaping loopholes in the current bankruptcy code which allow companies that declare bankruptcy to cheat schools out of badly needed education funds. This bill has the support of Senator Durbin, the ranking member on my subcommittee. In an effort to work in a truly bipartisan way, I have reached out to the administration and have made several changes in the bill to accommodate the White House. As of now, I have received very positive signals from the administration and I'm optimistic that the administration will come out in favor of the bill. 
As we all know, our Nation's educators face difficult challenges every day, whether from crumbling facilities or classes that are too large because a school district can't afford additional teachers. Money won't solve every one of the problems facing our schools. But protecting funding for education from losses due to bankruptcies will do a great deal of good. That's why I believe that the Congress should enact the Investment in Education Act quickly to stem a federally created drain on already scarce education resources. 
As President Clinton has said, the era of big Government is over, and we have a responsibility in Congress to make certain that Federal laws--like the bankruptcy code--do not tie the hands of State and local governments. My bill will close bankruptcy law loopholes and provide millions of education dollars without raising taxes or spending any additional Federal money. 
Under current law, the bankruptcy code allows a Federal judge to retroactively lower the assessed value of a bankrupt debtor's property--often in direct conflict with State laws. And another part of the bankruptcy code artificially subordinates local property tax revenues. 
All of this lowers the amount of money available for education since education is overwhelmingly dependant on local property tax revenue. In fact, there have been instances in which school districts have had to refund money they have already received and spent. In this way, the bankruptcy code is taking money earmarked for education and spending it instead on administrative costs such as lawyers' fees. 
We need to close these loopholes to put kids, and not bankruptcy lawyers, at the top of our Nation's priorities. 
During a hearing which I chaired before the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I found out about a school district in Texas that lost enough money in one case to provide 375,000 meals for needy children. And I heard testimony about a school that could not rebuild its kindergarten which had been destroyed by a tornado as a result of money lost in a bankruptcy case earmarked for the school. In the State of Texas alone, between just a few school districts, about $70 million earmarked exclusively for education are currently at risk. Because the Administrative Office of the United States Courts does not keep comprehensive records on this, we don't know how big this problem is. But we know that it's a substantial problem. I say let's fix it now. 
The Investment in Education Act will close these bankruptcy loopholes so that there will be more money for meals for needy children, more money to pay for teachers' salaries, and more money to repair dilapidated schools. By passing my bill, we can ensure that our schoolchildren get the education dollars they need. 
Finally, section 3 of the Investment in Education Act will be of great help to children who are owned back child support. Section 3 of the bill will permit children and spouses to go into the exempt assets of the bankrupt debtor in order to make sure that unscrupulous deadbeats can't get out of paying child support by hiding their assets in bankruptcy. I don't think that Congress ought to let the bankruptcy code stick it to kids and so my bill corrects that.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am privileged to be in the Senate today to support passage of this historic legislation. In my career as a Senator, a Congressman, and a State legislator, I have participated in thousands of bills. Posterity will probably remember only a select few of them. Of all, I expect, and hope, those who keep apprised of Congress will remember this tax freedom reconciliation bill among those remembered most fondly and most often. 
This bill is not only about the Government living within the Nation's means, but about the Constitution itself. Two years ago, the Congress proved that it could pass a balanced budget. It also learned that the Constitution anticipates a third participant in the legislative process, the executive branch. So, we arrive here today not only having anticipated the needs of the President, we have included the executive branch as an active participant throughout the legislative process. 
The words of the Constitution do not proscribe that Congress and the President should enter into an agreement defining legislation before it is actually written. Furthermore, the Constitution does not proscribe that the Congress should advance legislation with the continued advice of the Office of the President, the Treasury Department, and the Office of Management and Budget. The words themselves simply allow the President the express authority to either enact or veto the bills that we in the Congress produce. 
However, the partnership forged between the President and Congress prove that the President can, and should, make his intentions known throughout the legislative process. Since the President can veto any bill that is sent to him, the process should allow that their contents of bills should not come as a surprise. But, it is not the President's reaction that should be avoided. It is the surprise of taxpayers. As the legislative process has evolved, too much progress occurs behind the closed doors of committees and caucuses. The people of the Nation have come to think of the legislative process as a black box. The good intentions go in one side, but something wholly unknown can come out the other. The President has always had the authority to veto and the Congress the power to reconsider. 
But, in modern times, our legislative processes have become so cumbersome that Congress leaves itself without the days necessary to reconsider huge reconciliation bills. Therefore, we have effectively revamped the legislative process by allowing the President to play an earlier role. 
Some might say that this is a significant change. Since the Constitution does not direct such a partnership, it must be implied therein. Our Constitution intends that we pass laws, not only bills. 
Therefore, I turn to the product of this new process: The tax freedom reconciliation bill of 1997. Earlier today, we passed the balanced budget reconciliation bill. The latter is the first spending bill that anticipates a balance in almost 30 years of gridlock. The former is the first tax bill in 16 years that actually cuts taxes. Together, they are the first omnibus reconciliation legislation in 4 years that will become law. 
Presently we are considering the tax freedom reconciliation bill. I am particularly proud of several provisions contained in this bill. Some of these sections have national perspectives like both the renewed income tax deduction for interest on student loans and estate tax relief. Others have a more regional effect such as the law turning back the unauthorized IRS expansion of the alternative minimum tax against farmers. All, however, provide relief to hard-working families in the areas of education and income security. 
For education, this tax-relief bill renews the deductibility of interest incurred on student loans. I have introduced that particular bill in every Congress since it was repealed in 1986. In the last two Congresses I was accompanied by my friend from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun. Today, I am happy to announce our success. 
When Americans think of investing money, we think of investing in things--machines, natural resources or businesses. This student loan provision is an investment in human capabilities and talents. I would like to do even more than what is offered in this provision. But restoring the deductibility on the interest paid on student loans sends a message to college students across the country. Their talents are worth the investment of dollars. 
Students need to know the Federal Government and the Nation value their contributions. Understanding this, I believe they will have a greater appreciation of the effort necessary to successfully complete a higher education. We are clearly sending the message that the Congress recognizes the financial responsibility students undertake, and we are willing to do what we can to ease that burden. 
For farmers, I am pleased to announce that another of these new laws will forever repeal the unauthorized IRS advancement of the alternative minimum tax against traditional farmer deferred commodity contracts. The President may offer his views on legislation, but the IRS does not have unilateral power to legislate on its own. This is good news for family farmers and rural America. It reaffirms the intent of Congress that family farmers should be able to continue receiving the use of the cash method of accounting not limited by the AMT. The IRS decision last fall to unilaterally change a 16-year-old tax policy for these deferred payments. The IRS was dead-wrong. Sixty-three of my colleagues joined my legislation with Senator Dorgan as solid proof. 
In addition to setting the record straight, turning back the AMT for farmers highlights the larger problem we face when the IRS disregards the intent and the will of Congress. Here, we had a tax policy in place for 16 years, and suddenly, the IRS decides to make a 180 degree turn, which caused a great deal of havoc and concern for thousands of taxpayers. But, in order to return the law to its original intent, we had to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars as an offset, because of the upside-down way we do revenue estimates around here. So, I hope the Joint Committee on Taxation will be addressing the revenue estimation problem in the near future. 
I am also proud of the future for estate tax relief for families. When thinking about estate taxes, you have to always keep your eye on the ball. Estates do not pay estate taxes, surviving families pay estate taxes. In this bill we do a number of things for death tax reform. All of these new laws are based on legislation that I introduced with my friend from Montana, Senator Baucus. Twenty cosponsors joined in our bill S. 479, the Estate Tax Relief for the American Family Act. It became the estate tax relief legislation embodied in this reconciliation bill providing over $675,000 of new relief. 
In current law, the general estate tax exemption is $600,000, but that number is more than $200,000 behind the rate of inflation. In nearly every area of my State and the Nation, we saw in the past decade estate tax ultimately confiscate many family farms. Estate tax reform is simply about fairness and equity for families. 
We've heard some make the faulty argument that the estate tax only affects a small percentage of taxpayers. Well, the point they leave out is that many other thousands of taxpayers have to waste a great deal of money in order to plan their estate so it will remain operational and in the family. 
In addition, without the relief under this bill, the number of those affected by the estate tax would increase substantially in the next 5 to 10 years. 
Let me also add that I strongly support estate tax relief because it directly helps preserve our natural land. Our estate tax relief is very pro-environment simply because it helps keep family farms operational and defers the danger of over-development by urban activities. 
In this bill, capital gains tax relief is the partner of estate tax reform. Capital gains tax relief is similarly vital to my State of Iowa. A disproportionate amount of farmland is held by older landowners. To illustrate, studies in my state of Iowa show that 42 percent of farmland is held by taxpayers over the age of 65. Last year, Iowa State University conducted its annual farm life survey. It found that in the next 5 years, 21 percent of Iowa farmers are planning to retire. This high rate of those leaving farming raises important questions about who will be the next generation of Iowa farmers. 
Some of those farmers who retire will want to hold onto the land and maybe rent it out. Many others want to sell the land, move to town, and be fully retired. Unfortunately, the capital gains tax has locked them on the farm. I support an even larger reduction in the capital gains rate. But, the reduction in the bill is certainly a very positive step in the right direction. 
Finally, I want to talk about the expanded availability of tax supported individual retirement accounts. With the constraints of the Tax Code reduced, we will have more people saving for their retirements. Homemakers will be able to save $2000 per year tax-free regardless of the tax free retirement program offered to the working spouse. These new pro-saving laws will reduce the strain on the Social Security system. 
This Congress produced all of this relief for families by using bipartisanship and cooperation with the executive branch. This cooperation was not expressed in so many words of the Constitution, but it must certainly have been implied. 
Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I have studied the recommendations of the Judicial Conference regarding the extension of a number of temporary article III judgeships. I am offering this bill along with Senators Durbin, Hatch, DeWine, Warner, and Hagel in response to the Judicial Conference's recommendations. 
Much anecdotal evidence and rhetorical commentary have been given, in both the press and from this body, regarding the burdened and overworked state of the Federal judiciary. My experiences do not bear this out. I have been a member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts for a number of years. In past years, this committee was likely to take the Judicial Conference's recommendations as given. Recently, in my role as chairman, I have taken a more hands on approach to the appointment and extension of judgeships in the Federal system. As part of this approach, I have held hearings on this subject and I have made suggestions to the Judicial Conference on ways to improve their surveys. In part, as a result of my input, the Judicial Conference added a question to its Biennial Judicial Survey that asks not only if the circuit or district has need of additional judgeships, but also whether the circuit or district might have too many judgeships for its current caseload. Because caseloads in some districts will inevitably decline, this question addresses a problem not previously considered. The purpose of the question is to help the Judicial Conference decide, when faced with a district that has a declining caseload, whether to reallocate resources to another district or eliminate an unnecessary judgeship. 
As I noted, I have studied various judiciary issues and have worked with the judiciary to address some of these issues. From my studies and from conversations I've had with those on the bench, it is obvious that there is no judicial crisis looming on the horizon. However, changing circumstances in some judicial districts do need to be addressed. That is why I am proposing this bill. It addresses the needs of some of these districts in a substantive, rational manner. 
Biennially, the Judicial Conference makes judgeship recommendations to Congress regarding the needs of the Federal courts. The Conference sends the chief judge of each district a Biennial Judicial Survey that they are to submit with the caseloads and weighted caseloads of the district and report on the status of the district. This survey includes information on how the district makes use of its senior and magistrate judges and any recommendations that the chief judge may have regarding additional judgeships or extension of judgeships in their district. The Judicial Conference reviews this information and passes its recommendations on to Congress for review. 
For the 1996 survey, the Judicial Conference recommended that 12 districts with current or expired temporary judgeships either make or add permanent positions or extend the temporary judgeships for an additional 5 years. The Judicial Conference only made recommendations for those districts which would have weighted caseloads in excess of the 430 maximum recommended caseload per article III judge, should the temporary position expire. 
Weighted caseloads are the actual caseloads per district, weighted or altered to reflect the difference in time and attention needed for certain types of cases. For example, criminal cases, in general, are more time consuming and thus are more heavily weighted. However, prisoner petitions are generally easier to resolve because the petition usually addresses issues previously addressed and resolved by the court. 
Based on this survey, the Judicial Conference recommended a permanent judgeship position be added to the northern district of Alabama to replace the temporary judgeship Congress allowed to expire last year. In addition, the Conference would like to make the temporary judgeships in the eastern district of California, northern district of New York, eastern district of Virginia, and the southern district of Illinois permanent. The survey indicated that the weighted caseload per article III judge exceeded the recommended 430 maximum caseload per judge. The Judicial Conference also recommended, based on this survey, that the temporary judgeships in the districts of Hawaii, Kansas, Nebraska, eastern Missouri, central Illinois, and southern Ohio be extended for another 5 years. The Biennial Judicial Survey indicated that these districts would be above the recommended 430 weighted cases per article III judge if the temporary judgeships were eliminated. 
Based on my studies, most of the districts that currently have temporary judgeships are able to show the need for the extension of these judgeships. I used additional factors, not used in the Biennial Judicial Survey, to arrive at my recommendations for the districts. My investigation takes into consideration the cases handled by magistrate and senior judges. These studies show that when these cases are factored out, some districts fall below the recommended maximum caseload of 430 cases per article III judge, even after expiration of the temporary judgeships. In deference to the Judicial Conference, I have given those districts the benefit of the doubt on their need for an extension and have recommended an extension of their temporary judgeships. My willingness to accommodate the Judicial Conference recommendations underlines my willingness to work with the judiciary to reach a reasonable compromise when possible. 
The Judicial Conference's recommendation for permanent status in the districts of eastern California, northern New York, eastern Virginia, and southern Illinois differs from my recommendation. After my review, I do not believe the Conference's recommendation can be justified. Among the factors I considered for extending permanent status for these districts is whether the district showed a consistent increase in its per judge caseload over the past several years. When plotted, 
caseloads from most of these districts, show a roller coaster ride regarding the number of cases filed per article III judge. Over the period tracked, caseload increases were inconsistent and filings frequently decreased compared to previous years. Additionally, the Judicial Conference does not take into consideration, in the caseload statistics of each article III judge, how many cases are performed or could be performed by magistrate judges or senior judges. Cases, such as prisoner petitions and Social Security cases could, in most instances, be performed by magistrate judges. When prisoner petitions and Social Security cases are weighted and removed from the weighted caseload total per article III judge, the districts have a lower and much more representative calculation of the actual caseload per article III judge. And these figures don't even adjust for the consent cases the magistrate's handle. 
The data I have indicates that prisoner petitions and Social Security cases are included in computing the judicial caseload figures used by the Judicial Conference to calculate each article III judge's caseload. For example, the eastern district of California commenced 1,747 cases dealing purely with prisoner petitions in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996. In that district, magistrate judges resolved 1828 prisoner petition cases during that period. The difference in the number of cases resolved during that period would be those cases commenced in the prior year, but resolved in the current year. 
Additionally, my study indicates that some of the district's surveyed are not utilizing magistrate judges as effectively or efficiently as other districts in the survey. This factor needs to be taken into account prior to granting any additional or permanent article III judgeships to these districts. It is, in part, such considerations that led me not to recommend an additional permanent judgeship in Alabama, contrary to the recommendation of the Judicial Conference. In addition, Congress chose not to extend the temporary judgeship in that district before it expired last year. 
In calculating if districts are overburdened, weight must also be given to the effective use of senior judges in those districts. My studies took into consideration the district's use of senior judges. Several districts surveyed make effective use of their senior judges and this was taken into account when drafting this bill. Based on all of the factors I have outlined, I believe this bill will keep the judges in these districts from being overburdened and makes effective use of the taxpayer's money. 
Therefore, I recommend that the temporary judgeships in the eastern district of California, the northern district of New York, the eastern district of Virginia, the southern and central districts of Illinois, the eastern district of Missouri, the northern district of Ohio, and the districts of Hawaii, Nebraska, and Kansas be extended for another 5-year period.

Mr. GRASSLEY. I have the privilege this morning, with our outstanding colleague, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, to announce my intention to introduce a piece of legislation, the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring Act, that is a product of the National Commission on Restructuring the IRS. That commission functioned for approximately 12 months. The success of the commission is a result of the leadership of Senator Kerrey and Congressman Rob Portman of Ohio. 
As a member of the Commission on Restructuring the IRS, also as a current senior member of the IRS Oversight Subcommittee on the Finance Committee, and as the chief Senate sponsor of previous legislation that has been called the Taxpayers Bill of Rights I and the Taxpayers Bill of Rights II--and of course I am a taxpayer myself--I have been involved in several ways for many years in an effort to finally reach this point that we will make substantial changes, hopefully passing legislation, that will make substantial changes in the IRS and how it functions. 
Congress is on the verge of a very major shift in power from the Federal Government to the people. The recommendations of this commission are a blueprint for the transfer of power. Understandably, there is much anxiety within the Federal Government at this moment. It is in anticipation of this loss of power. The anxiety is at the highest levels in the executive branch that I have seen it. 
The American taxpayers have waited a long time for this to happen. They have suffered through decades of encounters with an agency that has been unaccountable, unresponsive, misleading, arrogant, and even abusive. The IRS has been granted enormous powers that at times seems to disrespect, even to undermine, civil liberties. The responsibilities to our citizens that go along with such power was not exercised by that agency. 
Furthermore, IRS management seemed to have taken a vacation. Billions of dollars have been wasted. Performance failures were not met with discipline. Questionable activities were covered up by secrecy, mostly by abusing the authority of what we would all recognize as section 6103, the so-called privacy provisions. Congressional oversight of the IRS has been rendered all but impotent because of absurd 6103 restrictions. These restrictions make the Pentagon's highly secret and highly restrictive Joint Chiefs of Staff vault seem like a Freedom of Information office. 
I urge my colleagues to seize the moment. IRS reform is long overdue and is very vital. 
Mr. President, I want to highlight just a few important issues recommended by the commission. 
To restore accountability to the taxpayers, the commission has made several recommendations. 
The one attracting the greatest attention has been the commission's proposal for an independent board to oversee the IRS. The commission's belief is that an independent board will provide an infusion of talent from the private sector to set appropriate performance measurements and reward or discipline managers who either meet or fail to meet these performance measures. 
In private meetings, the administration appears to be divided on another proposal, the proposal for an independent board to run the IRS. But it appears unfortunate that some who oppose this proposal are doing so only because it signifies a monumental power struggle that they stand to lose. 
Treasury officials, who years ago could not find the IRS even if they were standing at the corner of 11th and Constitution, are suddenly in fits about losing some control over part of their budget and their bureaucracy. 
They must be reminded that the IRS is one of the few Government agencies that has a significant impact on almost every American. The American taxpayer deserves a modern IRS that provides taxpayer customer service on a level equal to that provided by private financial institutions throughout this country. 
We have seen a lot of promises of reform coming from the Treasury of late, wholly in response to the work of this commission. Treasury assures us that IRS reform is their top priority and their best people are on it. But if Congress turns its back now on reforming the IRS and listens to the siren song of the Treasury Department, I predict that a year from now Congress will face the justified wrath of the American taxpayer. 
Treasury officials who are locked in this power struggle trying to preserve their bureaucratic empire would do well to remember the quote of the first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, who said, `Here, sir, the people govern.' That is the essence of what this commission would do, return power from the Federal Government to the people of this country. 
I am also pleased that the commission did not call for the easy solution. The easy solution around Washington is just to give more money to some Federal bureaucracy. And the plea was made to us: More money is what is needed at the IRS. One Treasury official privately admitted recently that the IRS never 
would be serious about embracing reform as long as Congress kept throwing money at the bureaucracy. 
Until 2 years ago, the IRS had seen continued increases in its budget for 40 years. This commission uncovered that hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars were being wasted. Clearly, the problem at the IRS is management, not money. 
The commission made several findings and recommendations about protecting taxpayers and strengthening taxpayers' rights. I note that in the past, the Congress has focused its energies on giving rights to taxpayers who are in dispute with the IRS. The commission's recommendations build on this. We recommend a strengthening of taxpayers' rights in a number of areas, but I think of equal importance is the emphasis the commission has placed on protecting taxpayers, that is, preventing problems even before they ever happen by emphasizing quality of work and customer service by our IRS employees. 
We all know the story of the small business owner who gets a notice from the IRS that he owes maybe $2,000 in additional taxes. The business owner goes to his accountant, who says he does not owe the IRS $2,000, but it is going to cost $5,000 to fight the IRS. So what does the small businessperson do? He pays the $2,000. 
Why does this happen? Because the IRS puts such little emphasis upon quality control and upon taxpayers' rights. The IRS still measures its managers on dollars assessed, whether or not it is a proper tax owed. 
Is it any surprise then that when a taxpayer does appeal, the IRS loses 72 cents on the dollar? It is wrong that many taxpayers have to spend millions of dollars fighting the IRS because there is no quality control. 
I am pleased that the commission also emphasized the need for customer service. We recommend that taxpayers who are subject to examination or collection efforts or who simply try to contact the IRS to resolve a problem are provided a chance to comment on the service given. While revolutionary to the IRS, this is old hat for many State tax collection agencies as well as for business in the private sector. By measuring managers on customer service, we hope to begin to change the culture of the IRS and its employees. 
Emphasizing quality service and customer service are ways to protect the taxpayers in the first place. It is also a way to measure the performance in an appropriate manner that will hold managers and employees at the IRS accountable for their action. 
I suggest that the emphasis upon quality service and customer service is in keeping with what many saw as a mandate given to the Congress in 1994--moving power from Government to the people. The reforms suggested by the commission certainly emphasize that it is the taxpayer who comes first and it is serving the taxpayer as a customer that must be a top priority at the IRS. 
Mr. President, I want to just briefly touch on a third point, the need for greater openness at the IRS. The commission found that the IRS was a very closed and insular organization. The commission put forward a first step to make the IRS more open to the Congress, more importantly, to the press as a policing agency within our process of Government. If we are going to be at all successful in changing the culture of the IRS, a key ingredient must be greater openness at the organization. 
To encourage openness and also ensure accountability, there are three areas. 
One, the IRS must be timely in responding to Freedom of Information Act requests. 
Two, the IRS should not abuse its authority under section 6103 to cover up embarrassing information about management mistakes. For example, the commission highlighted that the IRS had abused its 6103 authority to hide from the press the fact that the IRS had provided Congress false information. 
Three, the IRS must maintain and preserve documents. The commission itself discovered first hand several times that the former IRS historian Shelly Davis is right--that the IRS doesn't preserve records. Many requests by the commission for documents and data were met with the response that the data no longer existed or the documents could not be found. 
Addressing these three areas of openness may not be headline grabbing, but my experience has shown me that they will go far in bringing accountability at the IRS and changing its culture. 
My final point is to emphasize the commission's findings on the need to simplify the Tax Code. We heard from countless witnesses, as well as hundreds of IRS employees and thousands of taxpayers that the complexity of the code is crippling to IRS management. 
While I've spent a lot of my time here criticizing IRS, let me make clear that the complex code is not the fault of the IRS, it is a burden placed on IRS management by Congress and the White House. It is clear that if we wish to see improvements at the IRS in customer service and relations with taxpayers, steps must be taken to simplify the code. 
This IRS Restructuring Act will lead to better management of the IRS and better customer service in the field. I encourage all of may colleagues to cosponsor it. 
Mr. President, before I yield the floor, my colleague is responsible for the tremendous product of this commission. It is not me. It is because he gave it the time it needed, the expert leadership it needed. I speak of Senator Kerrey of Nebraska.  
Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to address the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
This is an important moment. This bill represents the triumph of the idea that we must get our national accounts in order. This is an idea that Republicans, with the help of many Democrats, have labored for years to put at the top of the national agenda. 
Finally, it is close to being done. 
As a member of the Finance and Budget Committees, and as a Budget Committee delegate to the conference, I have been deeply involved in the consideration of this bill. And I have been in a position to witness the dedication Senator Roth, Senator Domenici, and Senator Lott hve brought to the difficult task of giving birth to this balanced budget legislation. I want to congratulate them on the success of their efforts. 
I would particularly like to thank Chairman Domenici, Chairman Roth, Senator Lott and the other Senate conferees for protecting a number of excellent Senate provisions in the conference committee. Believe me, Madam President, it wasn't easy. 
The Medicare portions of the bill will bring about very positive changes in the program. 
The bill calls for necessary savings in Medicare, and thereby will help put Medicare, and particularly the Medicare hospital trust fund, on a sounder financial footing. The bill also contains a number of innovations that I think will improve the Medicare Program. 
First and foremost is the new Medicare Plus Choice Program, reforming Medicare managed care. 
From my perspective, representing the State of Iowa, the inclusion in this bill of a 50-50 local/national blended rate for Medicare managed care reimbursement is extremely important. Also critical is the bill's inclusion of a minimum payment of $367 in 1998, with annual updates thereafter. 
The opportunity for additional types of health plans, other than HMO's, to participate in the Medicare Choice Program will open additional opportunities to Medicare beneficiaries. Based upon what I have been hearing from Iowa, I think the reformed payment system and the additional types of plans should truly broaden choice for Medicare beneficiaries in Iowa. 
These provisions together should go a long way toward giving Iowans the same kinds of choices Medicare beneficiaries in other parts of the country have. 
I also want to thank the chairman and my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee and the House and Senate conference committees for including many provisions contained in S. 701, legislation I introduced earlier this year regarding Medicare managed care standards. I am especially pleased to see that, beginning in 1998 and annually thereafter, beneficiaries will receive comparative user-friendly charts listing health plan options in their area. The only way to foster consumer choice and competition is by informing Medicare beneficiaries of their options and their rights under the Medicare Choice Program. The lack of information currently distributed to Medicare beneficiaries is astonishing. 
The Medicare conference agreement will ensure that beneficiaries have the information they require to make the right health plan choice for their individual health care needs. 
Another important protection for Medicare beneficiaries is a fair appeals process. I have been advocating for an objective review of health plans' decisions to deny care. 
I am pleased that the Medicare conference agreement adopted my provisions to provide Medicare beneficiaries increased protections during the appeals process. Now, all Medicare beneficiaries will have the assurance that the Medicare program will provide an independent review of all denials of care by health plans prior to beneficiaries appealing to the Department of Health and Human Services. 
This increased protection will hold health plans more accountable in their decision making process regarding medically necessary care and will give beneficiaries greater confidence in Medicare managed care, if they choose this option. 
Madam President, I am also very pleased that we have preserved in the conference agreement rural health provisions that I have been working on for several years. 
These provisions include: 
My Medicare dependent hospitals bill, which will help a large number of rural hospitals in Iowa suffering from negative Medicare margins; 
Senator Baucus' bill on critical access rural hospitals, on which Senator Rockefeller and I have been close collaborators; 
Reform of the Medicare disproportionate share hospital program, so that deserving hospitals will be treated fairly whether they are located in urban or rural areas----

Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his kind remarks. And he has spoken better than I can on that issue. But basically what his constituents do not realize and my constituents do not realize, is that we have a very cost-effective delivery of medicine in rural America, very high quality by the way, but because of the historical basis for the reimbursement of Medicare, based upon that cost-effective medicine, we are at a very low level, and the options that metropolitan areas have will not come to rural America; but the provisions of the legislation he just described will make that possible now. 
And so I can say this, that in 1995, it would not have been included in the legislation without the intervention of the Senator from New Mexico, even though it was my basic legislation. And he helped us this time at a very, very critical time in the negotiations between the House and the Senate. So I may have authored this legislation, but the fact that it is in the final package is a tribute to the leadership of Senator Domenici. 
I will continue on and say that we have also for rural areas the 
provisions for: 
Expanding the existing telemedicine demonstration project, in order to improve the delivery of health care to underserved areas; 
Reform of the eligibility requirements for rural health clinics, enabling this vital program to operate as originally intended; and 
My legislation assisting rural referral centers. 
I am also pleased to finally see my legislation to provide direct reimbursement at 85 percent of the physician fee schedule to nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, any physician assistants is finally going to become law. Similar measures were included in the President's Medicare proposal and in the House Ways and Means Medicare bill and were part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. 
Senator Conrad and I introduced these bills in the last three Congresses. We reintroduced them again in this Congress and were successful in getting them included in the Senate Finance Committee bill. This legislation will reform Medicare policies which, under certain circumstances, restrict reimbursement for services delivered by these providers. 
Direct reimbursement to these nonphysician providers will improve access to primary care services for Medicare beneficiaries, particularly in rural and under served areas. 
There has been much deliberation in this Congress over proposals to address the problem of uninsured children in our Nation. 
I am very pleased that the bill before us today includes a strong bipartisan package addressing this matter. This bill includes a total of $24 billion to be spent on children's health insurance initiatives for those who are not currently enrolled in Medicaid or who do not have access to adequate and affordable health care coverage. This is $10 billion more than the President's original proposal. 
We should view this achievement not only as an important piece of health care policy, but also as a giant step toward improving the quality of life for our Nation's children. I commend the Senate leadership, particularly Chairman Roth and Chairman Domenici, for their leadership and commitment to this important matter. 
These funds will be provided to States in the form of block grants. States are allowed considerable flexibility in designing health insurance programs, yet States must meet important Federal guidelines in their efforts to provide quality health care coverage. 
I am confident that this proposal will be successful in meeting our goals to cover our Nation's uninsured children. 
Yet, it is important that Congress remain committed to this goal and we must closely monitor the developments of the proposal set forth in this legislation. 
This budget bill includes a number of improvements to the Medicaid Program to ensure that high-quality of care is provided to our Nation's most vulnerable population. And, this bill reforms Medicaid to give States much more flexibility in managing their programs. 
In recent years, States have undertaken numerous initiatives to control spending in Medicaid. As a result, Medicaid spending has slowed significantly. This budget saves a total of $13.6 billion in the Medicaid Program over 5 years. Most savings are achieved through new policies for payments to disproportionate share hospitals. Funds have been retargeted to hospitals that serve large numbers of Medicaid and low-income patients. 
Other improvements made to the Medicaid Program include changes to last year's welfare reform law so that benefits are restored to legal immigrants needing long-term care services. Also, a number of important reforms were made to managed care policies for Medicaid programs serving children, people with disabilities, and other Americans. 
Of course, I do have a number of concerns, Madam President. Does this bill represent a long-term solution to the problems facing the entitlement programs? No, it most certainly does not. But I note that the proposal of Senators Roth and Moynihan to establish a Medicare Reform Commission is included in the conference agreement. We will look to the work of this commission to make proposals for reform and to help us produce the consensus we need to act to put the Medicare Program on a sound footing for the retirement of the baby-boom generation. Make no mistake: we will need to do more. But on balance, I believe that we have made a good start. 
I want to conclude by again thanking Senators Roth and Domenici and their hard-working staffs for the efforts they have made, for several years now, to bring us to this point.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Lott, the majority leader, I will make this announcement. 
We announce that this morning, following morning business, at 10:30 a.m., the Senate will begin consideration of S. 39. That is the tuna-dolphin bill. Under a previous agreement, there will be 30 minutes for debate. It will be on that measure. Then it will be followed by a vote on the passage of S. 39. 
Also under the order, a vote on the passage of S. 1048, the Transportation appropriations bill, will follow the tuna-dolphin vote. Therefore, Senators can anticipate two rollcall votes this morning. Hopefully that would be around 11 a.m. 
As Members are aware, the House did file H.R. 2015, the conference report to accompanying the Balanced Budget Act of 1997; therefore, the Senate will hopefully begin consideration of that measure today at noon. Under the statute, there are 10 hours for debate on that conference report. And as always, Members will be notified as to when that rollcall vote can be expected. 
Senator Lott thanks our colleagues for their attention.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am offering this resolution with my distinguished colleagues, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senators Lugar and Harkin. The resolution addresses an antidumping investigation being conducted by the Government of Mexico, on the import of high-fructose syrup [HFCS] from the United States. 
Mr. President, I have often come to the Senate floor to discuss the importance of international trade to our agricultural economy. American farmers have become more reliant on global markets for their income. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 31 percent of farmers' income will be derived from foreign markets by the end of the decade. 
Because American farmers are the most efficient in the world we should not be frightened by this trend. But we must be more vigilant than ever when it comes to eliminating foreign trade barriers. 
Both the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] and the Uruguay Round Agreement of GATT were successful for American farmers. They served to reduce or eliminate barriers to trade in agriculture products to a greater extent than any prior trade agreement. The implementation and enforcement of these agreements will be crucial to American farmers. 
That is why the recent actions of the Mexican Government are so disturbing. The Mexican Government has imposed unreasonably high, preliminary tariffs on imports of HFCS from the United States. These tariffs are far in excess of what was negotiated under NAFTA. The justification for these tariffs is the antidumping action filed by the Mexican sugar industry.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to announce my support for Mr. John J. Hamre's nomination to be the next Deputy Secretary of Defense. 
Mr. President, my support in favor of the Hamre nomination may come as a surprise to some of my colleagues. 
A yes vote on the Hamre nomination may appear to be totally inconsistent with all that I have said here on the floor about the nominee. 
I have made a series of critical speeches about Mr. Hamre since January. 
I have criticized Mr. Hamre for failing to control the money and make sure it is spent according to law. 
I have attempted to hold him accountable. 
In my book, accountability in government should be a top priority. 
My criticism of Mr. Hamre boils down to one main problem area. 
As Chief Financial Officer at the Department of Defense [DOD], Mr. Hamre pursued a policy on progress payments that the Inspector General [IG] had declared illegal. 
The General Accounting Office [GAO] has just completed another review of the Department's progress payment policy. 
As of July 21, 1997, the GAO report indicates that the policy declared illegal by the IG remains in operation. 
It remains in operation today--at this very moment. 
Mr. President, I am happy to report that Mr. Hamre has promised to change the policy. 
He has made a commitment to bring the Department's progress payment policy into compliance with the law. 
This happened at an important meeting on Tuesday evening, July 22d. 
The meeting took place in the office of Senator Strom Thurmond, chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
This meeting was attended by Senators Thurmond, Levin, Warner, and the Senator from Iowa. 
The nominee, Mr. Hamre, was also present. 
Mr. President, I don't quite know how this meeting came about, but I suspect that my good friend from Virginia, Senator Warner, was the motivating force behind it. 
I would like to extend a special word of thanks to my friend from Virginia for helping me out. 
He helped me find a reasonable solution to a very difficult dilemma. 
The Senator from Virginia was instrumental in resolving the dispute. 
At this important meeting, Mr. Hamre made a commitment to bring the department's progress payment policy into compliance with the law. 
To do that, the IG says DOD has taken two distinct steps. 
Step One: The Director of Defense Procurement, Ms. Eleanor Spector, is issuing a new contract regulation--known as a DFAR. 
The DFAR will authorize contracting officers--or ACO's--to require that each contract contains specific funding instructions. 
These would be fund citations. 
Step Two: The Comptroller, Mr. Hamre, has ordered the Defense Finance and Accounting Service or DFAS to shut down the current operation. 
DFAS must issue payment instructions that match up with the DFAR. 
This would allow DFAS to match the money with the work performed--as required by law. 
This would allow the disbursing officers to post payments to the correct accounts. 
Since DOD makes about $20 billion a year in progress payments, this should help to clean up the books. 
It should cut down on overpayments and erroneous payments. 
It should cut down on costly reconciliation work done by the big accounting firms like Coopers & Lybrand. 
The new policy should save money. 
But the fix won't happen overnight. 
It will take time to phase down the old system and get the new policy up and running. 
The IG is planning on a kick off date of October 1, 1997. 
At the meeting, Senator Levin raised questions about the cost of the new policy. 
Mr. Hamre responded by saying that he would have to add 50 people to the DFAS work force. 
The extra people would be needed to manually process the payments under the new policy. 
The software necessary to support automated computer processing will not be available until the year 2000 or beyond, according to Mr. Hamre. 
Now, Mr. President, that sounds like more Pentagon nonsense to me. 
Businesses, like NationsBank, routinely conduct 15.5 million comparable matching operations in a single day--using computers. 
The software is here--now! 
This is off-the-shelf stuff--not leading edge technology. 
DFAS needs to get on the stick. 
Senator Levin also insisted that the new policy should apply just to new contracts--and not be retroactive. 
That makes sense to me. 
Senator Levin raised one other very valid concern. 
He said: `Maybe we need to change the law? Maybe the law governing these payments doesn't make sense?' 
These are valid questions. They need to be explored. 
But I would like to offer a word of caution on this point. 
If Congress should decide to change the law--as Mr. Hamre proposed late last year, Congress must then change the way the money is appropriated. 
We must never allow DOD to merge the appropriations at the contract level, while Congress continues to appropriate and segregate money in special accounts. 
That would subvert the whole appropriations process. 
If DOD were authorized to merge the money at the contract level, then Congress would have to consolidate accounts upstream in appropriations. 
We might, for example, create an acquisition account by merging R&D and procurement money in one big account. 
Quite frankly, Mr. President, I don't think that idea would be a very popular around here. 
Segregating the money in the R&D and procurement accounts gives Congress some broad and general control over how the money is used--as intended by the Constitution. 
Mr. President, I left the meeting in Sentor Thurmond's office believing that something important had been accomplished. 
First, Mr. Hamre made a commitment to bring the Department's policy into compliance with the law. 
Second, it was agreed that the IG would send a letter to the committee. 
This letter would serve two purposes. 
The IG would certify that the Department had taken the two steps necessary to bring the policy into compliance with the law. 
And the IG would agree to provide Congress with periodic follow-up reports to ensure that the new policy is, in fact, executed. 
Mr. President, I have the IG's letter here in my hand. 
It provides the assurances I sought. 
With those assurances in hand, I can support the Hamre nomination with a clear conscience.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I only hope Mr. Hamre understands my position on this issue. 
From day one, I have merely tried to hold him accountable for the improper progress payment policy. 
I do my best to watchdog the Pentagon. 
And when the IG tells me something is wrong, then I'm going to speak out. I'm going to dig and bore in--until things are right. 
That's what I did in this case. 
I believe that together we have crafted a constructive solution to this problem. 
I thank the committee for its leadership and for helping me resolve this issue.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Missouri, the chairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, for his foresight in providing funding through the National Science Foundation for plant genome research. This is a critical program for American agriculture involving a meaningful amount of money--$40 million--to advance work on plant genome projects for farm crops that contribute significantly to our economy. It has been my pleasure to work with Senator Bond for some time on the plant genome mapping effort. 
Iowa is a national leader in the production of corn and soybeans. These two crops are mainstays of the Iowa economy. In order to remain competitive in the world market, we need to understand in increasing detail what the genetic mechanisms of these crops are and how they work. Researchers in many fields can use the results of the genome mapping effort to enhance these crops. The genome mapping research results will help us to understand new and better ways to increase crop yields, discover new uses and products, better the health of the plant by reducing risks to disease and pests, and to help protect the environment. This bodes well for the corn grower and soybean producer by increasing the value of the crop and, thus, increasing farm income. 
I will continue to work with Senator Bond to see that this effort receives proper funding both through the NSF and the Department of Agriculture. An interagency effort, along with a strong, effective, meaningful public/private partnership is key to the ultimate success of the plant genome mapping project. We must also be aware of international genome mapping efforts. Where possible it is necessary to cooperate with those efforts.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, too many times in our world today we settle for mediocrity, we settle for just enough to get by. But today, I rise to pay tribute to an Iowan who has never settled for anything less than excellence. I am referring to Dan Gable, head wrestling coach at the University of Iowa. Dan recently announced that he will be taking a year off and turning his coaching duties to others. I think this is the right time to look at the impressive record of Dan Gable. 
Many of you may recognize Dan's name because of his legendary accomplishments in the sport of wrestling. Dan reached the very pinnacle of this sport in the late 1960's and has stayed there ever since. As a competitor, Dan compiled a nearly flawless record of 182-1 in his prep and college career. Dan was a three time all-American and three time Big Eight Champion. 
After college, Dan went on to win titles at the Pan American Games and world championships. Dan also demonstrated his superiority in wrestling when he won a gold medal at the 1972 Olympics. 
His accomplishments as a coach are no less stellar. Teams coached by Dan have an amazing 355-21-5 record. He has coached 152 all-Americans, 45 national champions, 106 Big Ten champions, and 10 Olympians, including four gold medalists. To say Dan is a living legend in his chosen field is not an overstatement. 
But even more admirable is how Dan has handled being at the top of his field for nearly 30 years. We regularly hear about athletes involved in scandal after scandal--so much that we hardly raise an eyebrow when the newest controversy makes headlines. But Dan has always conducted himself with dignity and a refreshing lack of arrogance. Dan has imparted in the wrestlers he has coached an appreciation of hard work, perseverance, graciousness, and calm under pressure. If you believe there are no more role models, then you must not know about Dan Gable. I hope my statement might help correct that misbelief. Dan Gable exemplifies the notion that to be a true winner is not just about scoring the most points; it means carrying the title of winner with integrity and character. Dan Gable has certainly done that. 
I thank him for the credit he has brought to his family, his community, his sport, and the State of Iowa, and wish him the very best in all his future plans. I know he will continue to approach whatever he does with the same commitment and hard work he always has in the past.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to set the record straight. 
Defense Week reports that I made inaccurate statements during the recent debate on the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment on executive compensation. 
The article was written by Mr. Tony Capaccio and appears in the July 14 issue of his publication.

Mr. GRASSLEY. I think there is a misunderstanding, and I would like to clear it up. 
Mr. President, I pride myself on always doing my homework and sticking to the facts. 
So when someone accuses me of straying from the facts, I like to address the criticism head on. 
I would like to resolve the issue one way or the other. 
To do that, I went back to the place where I got the information in the first place. 
That's the General Accounting Office [GAO] in St. Louis, MO--near McDonnell Douglas headquarters. 
The man with the knowledge there is Mr. Robert D. Spence. 
I went back to Mr. Spence to check and recheck the facts to be certain my statements were consistent with the facts. 
The disputed information pertains to the amount of money the Department of Defense [DOD] pays out to senior executives at the McDonnell Douglas Corp. 
I presented those facts during the debate over executive compensation on July 10. 
The facts that Defense Week questions appear on page S7172 of the Congressional Record. 
This is what I said. 
The DOD paid the top five executives at McDonnell Douglas a total of $9,273,382.00. 
I said the top executive got $2,713,308. 
To back up that statement, I will place a table in the Record. 
This table was prepared by the GAO but the information came straight from the horse's mouth--the Defense Contract Audit Agency or DCAA. 
The table shows how much each of the five top executives at McDonnell Douglas was paid by the Pentagon. 
Now, Mr. Capaccio says that information is inaccurate. 
He says the top five executives were not paid $9,273,382.00 by DOD. 
He says that is the amount allocated to the overhead pools of the company's many components or subdivisions. 
He said that money would then have to be divided between commercial, general government, and defense contracts. 
Mr. President, I hate to say it, but Defense Week is flat wrong. 
As I said, Mr. President, I went back to the GAO and Mr. Spence to check and recheck my information. 
It checks out OK. 
My information comes directly from the DCAA. 
First, to get the DOD pay figures for the top five executives, DCAA had to query the field offices at each McDonnel Douglas subdivision. 
This was done to establish the split between DOD, non-DOD government, and commerical contracts. 
This was done to isolate the amounts charged to DOD contracts. 
That's what the GAO table does. 
It isolates the $9,273,382.00 as the amount allocated to components with DOD contracts. 
DOD contracts--that's the key. 
My numbers have absolutely nothing to do with general government or commercial contracts. 
So that's a bogus argument. 
Second, the dollar totals on the GAO table are not 100-percent accurate. 
I will be the first to admit that. 
They were not audited in every case. 
But they are considered reasonably accurate. They're in the ballpark. 
If the GAO and DCAA numbers aren't accurate enough, then Defense Week should produce a better set. 
And it admits it can't do that. 
Third, Mr. President, I need to clarify one point. 
The Pentagon, for example, did not send McDonnell Douglas' top executive a paycheck for $2,713,308.00. 
That's not how it really works. 
There are no individual DOD paychecks that go to executives; $2,713,308.00 is the amount McDonnell Douglas is allowed to bill the taxpayers on DOD contracts for that individual's salary. 
That is the amount set aside in DOD contracts for that individual's compensation package. 
Once the amount is approved by DCAA, it is then apportioned across hundreds of contract payments. 
It's doled out piecemeal in thousands of U.S Treasury checks. 
But it's there in those checks. 
McDonnell Douglas got the money. 
The money came from DOD. 
The money was for executive compensation. 
Just because it was a small part of a big payment doesn't make the money any less real. 
It doesn't make it play money. 
In the end, Mr. President, no matter how you slice it, DOD paid McDonnell Douglas' top five executives $9.3 million.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last year, many of my colleagues in the Senate had a great deal to say about the drug use problem in this country. This year, half way through the first term of the 105th Congress, not much has been said. I will not dwell on the reasons. But we need to recall that the reasons for being concerned about drug use in this country have not changed. In fact, all the indicators continue to point to a growing problem. 
Just recently, the administration released drug use data in the Pulse Check, a twice-yearly publication on drug use trends and markets. 
The information contained in the report is alarming. It confirms the continuing trend we noted last year of growing drug use particularly among young people. I want to share with my colleagues some of the information the Pulse Check shows. 
Heroin use in most markets is up or stable, and availability is high. 
There appears to be a trend of increased use among younger users, primarily in inner cities. 
Cocaine use is stable, but availability remains high. 
Marijuana use is growing rapidly and the onset of use is occurring at earlier ages. 
Polydrug use, the use of more than one drug in combination, is on the rise. 
Methamphetamine use is growing and the quality is improving. 
Anyone familiar with this country's last drug epidemic, a problem that we are still coping with, should be alarmed at what this information tells us. When you put these facts together with information from other surveys on use, hospital admissions, and trends, the picture is grim. Let me summarize briefly what we are seeing. 
More kids at younger ages are starting to use drugs. In our last drug epidemic, use began typically with 16-year-olds. Today's trend is for drug use onset to begin with 12- and 13-year olds. Along with this, more and more kids are seeing less danger in using drugs. This fact, of course, leads to more experimentation. 
Parents are not talking to their kids about drugs. Many believe that their kids do not listen to them. Many believe that TV and peers have more influence. Further, many of today's parents used drugs when they were young. They now feel ambivalent about talking to their kids about drugs. These parents don't want their kids using drugs, mind you, they just don't know how to talk to their kids. We know, however, that the most important source for kids on how to behave, to judge right and wrong, comes from parents. Not from TV, not from their peers, but from parents. But parents are not speaking up. 
Public messages and national leadership on drug use have declined in the past 5 years. As we noted last year, the bully pulpit is empty. In addition, discussion of legalization in one form or another is on the rise. What this means is that kids no longer hear a no-use message. Instead, they hear mixed messages from government leaders and others. They see efforts to legalize marijuana under a thinly disguised claim of medical need. They see increasing normalization of drug use in movies, music, and on TV. 
Is it little wonder, then, that we are seeing growing use of drugs among kids? This increase comes after almost a decade of decline. The decline of use among kids in the late 1980's and early 1990's was not an accident. 
It came as a result of commitment by this country--by parents, schools, community leaders, politicians, and others--to protect our young people and their future from drugs. In those years, we undertook efforts to discourage drug use. To make it harder to get drugs. To roll back the notion that drug use was simply a lifestyle choice that caused no harm, except maybe occasionally to a user. It worked. But we are now in the process of squandering those gains. 
We need to remember something about how we got into our last drug fix. The 1960's and 1970's was a period of collective forgetfulness about the harm that drug use does. It was not our first drug epidemic, it was our worst. It also did not happen by accident. 
Neglect of our public responsibility played a part. Glorification of drug use by the popular culture contributed. A collective public amnesia about our experiences of earlier epidemics added to the mix. It was a period of exploring the limits of personal freedom. Unfortunately, it was also a period that abandoned notions of personal responsibility. Combined with an active lobby that pushed for drug legalization, those years laid the foundations for an explosion of drug use. Most of the burden of that use fell upon young people. Most of our addicts today, who burden our welfare and health systems, are the casualties of that period. They are paying the personal price but the rest of us are footing the bill. It is also no coincidence that our major crime wave began during the same years and is linked directly to growing drug use. 
It was the double whammy of kids on drugs and crime on our streets that led to public demands for a speedy and effective response. It led to `Just Say No' and a concerted effort to reverse the trend and save a generation of young people. It worked. But now we are in danger of forgetting once again what we once knew: That drug use is not a victimless crime. That it is not harmless. That it is simply a matter of personal choice with no social consequences. 
In the last several years, we have seen teenage drug use increase at an alarming rate. We have seen drug use messages re-emerge in the popular culture. We have seen major public figures and leading members of government equivocate on drugs or openly advocate legalization. 
We have seen major financial figures pour money into pushing drugs-are-good-for-you themes. We have also seen the birth of MTV and the Internet. These media, aimed at kids, purvey in the most direct way drug use themes to kids of all ages. Today, access to kids by people who want to exploit them is unprecedented. Whether we are talking drugs or pornography, there is an open highway into almost every home in the country. Any household that is home to a tv or computer access to the worldwide web is accessible. You cannot lock your doors. 
Currently, drug information sources on the Internet are dominated by drug legalizers. Their websites are easily accessed. They specialize in trendy formats and cartoon helpers. We hear a lot about Joe Camel. 
Well, take a look at what those who specialize in drug legalization use. As a recent piece in the New York Times shows, drug messages aimed at kids are up to date, stylish, and accessible. High Times, which is one of the major drug legalization publications in the country, operates a site on the net. Their web page is available with only a few clicks from the main page. It is filled with lots of helpful tips. You can learn, for example, how to grow marijuana at home. It offers advice on how to evade or distort drug tests. You can find details on where to find the best drugs. Of course, to access these helpful hints, you have to certify that you are not a minor. But there is no way to check on this, so the certification is meaningless. There are many more, similar sites. 
When you link this access to reemerging drug themes in the music most listened to by young people, it is not hard to understand that more kids are using. It is not hard to see why more kids believe that drugs are not dangerous. 
These messages come at a time of another wave of ambivalence about drugs. They come at a time when leadership is lacking. They come at a time when many parents do not seem to know how to talk to their kids. 
Close to 25 percent of the population of this country is under the age of 18. Forty-five million are under the age of 12. It is this population that is most susceptible to drug use messages. It is this audience that is most targeted with those messages. 
We have all the ingredients for another drug epidemic. This one, however, will come when we are still coping with the walking wounded for our last fling with drugs. We are also seeing much younger kids starting to use. If we fail to respond, seriously and soberly, then our new drug epidemic will be worse than our last. It will also be the result of a colossal act of irresponsibility.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Law Enforcement Officers' Good Samaritan Act of 1997. This bill will help Federal officers do what they do best: protect lives. Under this bill, any Federal law enforcement officer who, while off duty, should unexpectedly arrive at or is present at a crime will be able to take appropriate action. 
Mr. President, perhaps a hypothetical example would best explain the intent of this legislation. Lets say a law enforcement officer stops at a convenience store on his way home from work one evening. While picking up a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread, a criminal attempts to rob this particular store. Now most law enforcement folks will tell you that, in this situation, they would feel compelled to take some kind of appropriate action. But in many jurisdictions, if they do take action and are hurt, or are forced to hurt the criminal, they may not be eligible for their health benefits, and may be open to be sued by the criminal for their actions. The law enforcement officer, acting on his training, and intervening in a situation that he had the training and ability to deal with, would have to cover these expenses from his own pocket. Mr. President, this does not sound fair to me. It can create a situation where the officer may feel unable to act in response to his sense of duty because of concerns that he will be penalized for acting. This legislation would eliminate these legitimate worries. 
Let me make it clear that this bill does not expand Federal law enforcement authority. A Federal officer could only make a citizen's arrest, if necessary, and local law enforcement officials would still have jurisdiction in the case. My office has spoken with the National Association of Attorneys General, and they are supportive of this legislation. 
I hope that my colleagues will take the time to look at this legislation, and join Senator Alfonse D'Amato and me in sponsoring this bill. Our Government has invested a lot of time, energy, and trust in the training and support of our Federal law enforcement officers. We need to be sure that they are able to perform their duties--and to act as we would hope and expect them to act.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to the sense-of-the-Senate offered by the Senator from Arkansas. I support the President's decision to extend most-favored-nation status, or normal trading relations, to China. 
The problems with China on trade, security, and human rights are well documented. And I won't take the time to repeat them here. But I'll just say that we are all concerned with China's poor record of promoting democracy, free enterprise and human rights. I'm especially concerned with the persecution of Christians in China. 
But I think the question comes down to what is the best way to influence policy within China. Is it more effective to have a policy of isolationism, where we have virtually no trading relationship with China? This is what would happen if normal trading relations is revoked. 
Or is it more effective to build a closer relationship with China through our trade policy? Trade serves to promote free enterprise and raise the standard of living of the Chinese people. It allows us to export our principles of liberty and democracy. I believe that the United States, and the Chinese people, are clearly better off by strengthening our relationship through trade. 
Integrating China into the world community has already paid dividends. Recognizing that China still has many problems, most people would agree that significant progress has been made just in the last 10 to 20 years. I believe our economic and diplomatic relations with China have helped push this progress along. 
This is not to say that we shouldn't be tough with China. Retaliatory measures can be very effective in encouraging further reforms in China. But retaliation should be targeted and specific. 
I recall that last year at this time, USTR announced $2 billion in sanctions against China for breaching its commitment on intellectual property rights. Now I'm told by the administration that China has taken significant strides in cracking down on the pirating of intellectual property. Firm sanctions targeted at specific behavior can force change in China. 
Revoking our normal trading relations is a blunt, ineffective tool. It would also hurt American workers, businesses, and consumers. Our $12 billion in annual exports to China would be put at risk, jeopardizing over 200,000 American jobs. And the increase in tariffs on China's exports into this county amounts to a stiff tax on American consumers. 
The costs of revoking normal trading relations with China--to American workers and consumers and in terms of our inability to effectuate change in China--clearly outweigh any perceived benefits. I find it hard to believe that Beijing will suddenly promote democracy and human rights because the United States ends its trading relationship with China. 
Engagement is the right policy for encouraging change in China. 
Some opponents of MFN are concerned, not with these other important issues, but with the trading relationship itself. They point to the United States' expanding trade deficit with China, which last year amounted to just under $40 billion. 
The current negotiations with China on its accession to the World Trade Organization is an opportunity to address the trade imbalance. We must get meaningful market access concessions from the Chinese before they are allowed into the WTO. American products deserve the same access to the Chinese market as their products enjoy in the United States. 
The stakes are very high. In the agriculture sector, these negotiations will determine whether China becomes our largest export market or our biggest competitor. We cannot afford to make the same mistakes made when Japan entered the GATT in 1945. The United States is still shut out of the market in many respects. We need a tough, fair agreement with China. 
It's time to move forward in our trading relationship with China. Let's get beyond this annual debate over trading status and focus on how we can best improve access to China's market for American workers and businesses, while improving the lives of the Chinese people by promoting human rights and serving as an example of democracy.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Working Family Farmer Protection Act of 1997. As the only family farmer in the Senate, I feel I have a unique responsibility to make sure that family farming remains a strong and vibrant part of American life. For generations, family farms have fed this country. But the global marketplace presents some new and unique challenges to the family farmer. That's why I'm introducing the Family Farmer Protection Act today, on behalf of myself and Senator Durbin. 
This bill makes chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code permanent. Currently, chapter 12 is due to expire in 1998, and I think it would be a terrible error if this Congress did not act now to reauthorize chapter 12 on a permanent basis. 
In order to understand why we need to make chapter 12 permanent, I think we have to go back a decade or so to the 1980's farm crisis. During the mid-1980's, the agricultural economy in the Midwest took a sharp downturn. And many family farmers were forced into bankruptcy. At that time, the only choice a family farmer had was to go into chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. Under chapter 11, the creditors form a committee and help to draw up a reorganization plan. Most family farms only had one major creditor--the bank with the mortgage on the farm. And 
that one creditor was able to keep farmers from reorganizing in an effective way. As a result, the family farmers who filed chapter 11 were frequently forced out of farming. In short, the family farm was on a fast track to extinction, and family farmers were fast becoming an endangered species. 
That's why in 1986 I drafted an entirely new chapter of the Bankruptcy Code to preserve the family farm. That chapter is chapter 12. Chapter 12 simply limits the power of the bank to exercise a veto over a farmer's reorganization plan. 
I think it's very important to realize that chapter 12 is not a handout or a get-out-of-debt-free card. Farmers are hard-working people who want the chance to earn their way. In fact, chapter 12 is modeled on chapter 13, where individuals set up plans to repay a portion of their debts. 
Chapter 12 has been wildly successful. So many times in Washington we develop programs and laws with the best of intentions. But when these programs get to the real world, they don't work well. Chapter 12, on the other hand, has worked exactly as intended. According to a recent University of Iowa study, 74 percent of family farmers who filed chapter 12 bankruptcy are still farming and 61 percent of farmers who went through chapter 12 believe that chapter 12 was helpful in getting farmers back on their feet. 
In conclusion, chapter 12 works and it works well. Let's make sure that we keep this safety net for family farmers in place. I urge my colleagues to think of this bill as a low-cost insurance policy for an important part of America's economy and America's heritage.

Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to make it clear I disagree with the Dodd-McCain amendment. We have been focusing in this debate on the necessity and the impact of the certification process on foreign countries as if the only purpose of this was to put pressure on foreign countries. That probably is the primary purpose and maybe the only one we talk about. But, as well, I would like to suggest that we have a situation where this process keeps our own Government decisionmakers responsible. In other words, through this certification process, we are causing them to make an annual judgment of whether or not our process of interdiction in other parts of the world on drugs is actually working and effective. I think that is a very important purpose of our process, to make our own elected and appointed government public officials take care to look at the process, look at whether the policies are working, to assess those policies, maybe to suggest changes in those policies--maybe even in basic law--but, also, to make a judgment of whether or not they are effectively carrying out the laws the way intended. 
I find the assumptions upon which the Dodd-McCain amendment is based to be wrong. I believe what it represents is a moving away from a serious standard of dealing with the drug problem. I believe it gives other countries a bye on taking drugs seriously. I believe it lets the U.S. administration off the hook. So I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against this amendment. If anything, we should be discussing measures to strengthen the process. It is a process that has served us well. 
We have had a letter by the present drug czar quoted on the floor of the Senate as supporting this amendment. I would like to suggest to you that I have had an opportunity to visit with another drug czar--former drug czar now--Bill Bennett. He was a very good drug czar. He was a drug czar when policies were working. He speaks very strongly in support of the present certification process and, consequently, would urge our vote against the suggestions of Senator Dodd and Senator McCain. 
It is argued by the proponents that the certification process does not work. No evidence is offered for this view. It is simply asserted. But what does `working' look like? I would like to ask a question in a different context to make this very point. Just recently we passed legislation putting more teeth into the sanctions for countries that support international terrorism. Do we believe that passing such laws will end international terrorism forever? Or do we believe that we need to have measures in place to ensure appropriate means are available to us, means that will help us uphold U.S. interests and international standards of conduct? I do not think anyone here believes that our laws will necessarily end terrorism as we know it. That is not the intent. The intent is to set a standard that terrorism is wrong and that we are going to fight terrorism wherever we can. 
We have passed legislation to hold countries responsible for violating intellectual property rights. Do we expect this legislation to end all pirating of books or CD's? Or do we expect to have the means available to us to respond to all counterfeiting, to send a message about what the standard is that we believe that we need to uphold? I think everyone knows the answer. 
Why are we seeking to establish some sort of different standard for drugs? It seems to me in the case of terrorism we say terrorism is wrong, we pass laws against it, we fully expect to enforce them in every way we can in an effort to end terrorism. We may not actually end terrorism, but it is a standard. So the certification process is not about the ultimate end to drug production or trafficking. Our law will not end that any more than any of these other laws that I have mentioned will end the problems that they address. The intent is to establish needed standards, to set the terms of reference for what doing something meaningful looks like, and to take appropriate action when this does not happen. 
Some, however, seem to want to hold drug certification to an impossible standard of judgment. The argument made is that certification does not work. In fact, certification is doing exactly what Congress intended. It forces the U.S. administration at least once a year to take international drug policy seriously. It also requires them to account for their actions to the Congress. I can appreciate that the administration may not like having to make all these very tough decisions. But we must hold this President and future Presidents, as we have held past Presidents, accountable for this process. 
Certification also forces other countries to do the same thing. Now, what about those other countries? These are countries that are major drug producers or transiting countries for illegal drugs. A goodly percentage of those drugs are then smuggled into our country. These activities are illegal under international law and even under the laws of the countries from which the drugs come. 
In any case, these same countries have bilateral agreements with the United States committing them to take steps to stop drug trafficking and production. In addition, many of these countries receive U.S. assistance, that is money and support, to combat illegal drug trafficking. 
What does certification do then? It asks that these countries take serious steps to meet their obligations under international law, under local law, and under these bilateral agreements. It asks the administration to report to Congress on whether countries are doing this. It sets measures for determining what cooperation looks like. If, in the judgment of the administration, the country does not meet these standards, then it proposes limited sanctions. It also provides a means for Congress to exercise its foreign policymaking authorities to override the President if it does not accept his determination. 
It is hardly outrageous, Mr. President, that we expect other countries to abide by laws and by commitments, international and otherwise, made by those countries. It is hardly unfair to expect an assessment of these efforts. It is not unrealistic to expect that we will take appropriate responses if minimal standards are not met, and we are perfectly within our right to decide not to continue our support. That support, after all, is not an entitlement, and it is not beyond the pale that we ask for an accounting. 
Certification has been around for about 10 years. As with other cases, the longer the requirement has been on the books and the more Congress has insisted that it be taken seriously, the more used and useful the process has become. The process has gathered momentum. Last year, in fact, I asked the Congressional Research Service to review the merits of the certification process. That review, which is still available, makes clear how the certification process has matured and proved effective. In that review, a former senior State Department official and ambassador makes the point that the certification process works. Other countries take it seriously. He recommended keeping it. 
Not only has the standard been applied with more rigor, it has also encouraged greater cooperation from certified countries. All in all, more countries now take as a given that drug control must be an important element in their thinking. This was not always the case. It is why Congress required certification in the first place. The need has not changed. If anything, the need is greater today. 
I want to make one final point. Some have argued that we must not continue the certification process in regard to Mexico because it might damage the evolution of democracy there. While I agree that we must support democracy in Mexico, we must not end up supporting a narcodemocracy there. A recent New York Times piece by Tim Golden makes it clear just what the problems we and the Mexicans face from their drug traffickers because of their influence within the country of Mexico. Their strength and influence is all the more reason why we must not back away from certification. 
Although it can be a painful process, it forces both countries and their governments to examine their situations. Sometimes the role of a friend is to deliver bad news. Nor do we become the friend of democracy in Mexico by shying away from our duty to the American people. As long as Mexico remains a major producing and transiting country, as long as Mexican authorities cannot or will not take adequate steps to control corruption, we cannot afford to ignore what happens in Mexico. 
With these thoughts in mind, I ask you to vote against the Dodd-McCain amendment. But in addition, we were told again, referring to a letter from General McCaffrey, the President's drug czar, about his support for this amendment. 
I refer, in closing, to the March 1997 report from the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report. This is an annual report, and on page 6, it speaks about the certification process. The last paragraph says: `The process works.' This is a document that has been approved by every Government agency that has something to do with the war on drugs. It says, after `The process works':  
The certification process has proved to be a remarkably effective diplomatic instrument for keeping all governments aware of the need to pull their weight in the international antidrug effort.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I understand the committee is prepared to accept my amendment on Department of Defense [DOD] disbursements. 
My amendment is simple and straightforward. 
It says that each disbursement made by the DOD over $1 million must be matched with the correct obligation before payment is made. 
It also says that this threshold must be met by June 30, 1998. 
This is the next, logical step in a process that began with section 8137 of the fiscal year 1995 DOD Appropriations Act. 
My amendment is fully consistent with the policy first adopted in 1994. 
This policy has been developed under the leadership of my friend from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and my friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye. 
This policy has been incorporated in the last three appropriations bills--fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997. 
The policy is embodied in section 8106 of the current law. 
The current law says that all disbursements over $3 million must be prematched. That's down from $5 million the previous year. 
What we are trying to do is gradually ratchet down the dollar thresholds. I think there is a general consensus for cranking down the thresholds. The DOD inspector general [IG], Ms. Eleanor Hill, has said we need to do it. 
This is what she said in a letter to the committee Chairman: 
We agree with the plan to continue lowering the dollar threshold for prevalidation of all contract payments made by DOD. 
Mr. Richard Keevey, Director of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service [DFAS] has said exactly the same thing but in stronger terms. 
This is what Mr. Keevey said in testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee on May 1: 
To prevent future problem disbursements, the department will require that every disbursement be prevalidated, that is, matched to an obligation before payment is made. . . . Our ultimate goal is to validate all disbursements to zero. 
DOD has a plan for meeting the dollar thresholds set in law. 
There is one small problem, however. The problem is at DOD's major contract payment center at Columbus, OH. DOD says the Columbus center cannot meet the $1 million threshold until June 1999. When we launched this policy back in 1994, DOD claimed it would be years before it could make the required matches. 
Well, despite all the bureaucratic roadblocks, DOD found a way to get the job done. DOD is making the matches today. 
Second, meeting the $1 million threshold should be no big deal. 
With all of DOD's cutting edge technology, it should be a piece of cake. DFAS Columbus processes no more than 11,000 payments annually that exceed the $1 million threshold. 
That's chicken feed, Madam President. 
Banks, for example, routinely handle 500,000 account matching operations in a single day. So why can't DOD do it? DOD seems to be working hard to meet the dollar thresholds mandated by Congress. I feel like the momentum is in the right direction. 
But recent GAO and IG audits clearly indicate we still have a long way to go. There's still much more work to be done. 
My amendment will help to keep the pressure on. It will help the Department reach the ultimate goal: to validate every disbursement prior to payment. 
Until we reach that goal, DOD's financial accounts will remain vulnerable to theft and abuse. 
Madam President, I thank the chairman and ranking minority member for their leadership and support on this issue.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we must be sure that we are taking the necessary steps to protect the citizens of our nation by preventing drug traffickers, organized crime and terrorist groups from obtaining the profits of their illegal activities. Much has been done and said about the movement of illegal drugs into the United States or terrorists acts against our country. But the opposite side of the business--getting the profits from drug sales and other illegal enterprises out of the country and back into the hands of the criminal organizations--does not get as much publicity and is just as important. 
In an effort to strike another blow to drug traffickers and criminals who prey on our citizens by their ill-gotten gains, today I, in conjunction with Senator D'Amato, am introducing companion legislation to H.R. 1756, the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act of 1997. This legislation will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and other relevant agencies, to coordinate and implement a national strategy to address the exploitation of our Nation's payment systems to facilitate money laundering and related financial crimes. The strategy will enhance and expand the Secretary's authority to ascertain criminal activity directed at our Nation's financial systems, determine the threat posed to the integrity of such systems, and develop regulatory and law enforcement initiatives to respond. The bill will hit the criminals where they feel it the most--in their pocketbooks. By implementing a strategy on a national level, hundreds of communities across our country will no longer be held hostage by these criminal enterprises. 
As we know, money laundering involves disguising financial assets so they can be used without detection of the illegal activity that produced them. Through money laundering, the criminal transforms the monetary proceeds derived from the criminal activity into funds with an apparently legal source. Money laundering provides the resources from drug dealers, terrorists, arms dealers, and other criminals to operate and expand their criminal enterprises. Today, experts estimate that money laundering has grown into a $500 billion problem worldwide. 
A significant component of this strategy will involve defining specific criminal activity affecting geographic areas, payment systems and financial institutions, that are considered to have a high potential to be abused by criminal organizations. These high risk money laundering zones will then be targeted for specific action, whether it is specific law enforcement operations, preventative efforts to insulate entire payment systems, or industry sectors from being exploited by criminal elements. This legislation will help provide assistance to localities for example, state and local prosecutors and law enforcement officials in the form of federal financial crimes grants to any area designated as a `High Risk Money Laundering Zone.' 
I would also like to thank my colleagues, Senators Dianne Feinstein, Ted Stevens, Tim Hutchinson, Bob Graham, Chuck Hagel, and Lauch Faircloth, for joining in cosponsoring this bi-partisan legislation. Working together, we need to tighten up our financial control capabilities to prevent criminal enterprises from abusing our financial and banking systems. I hope this legislation will be the beginning of a serious effort by Congress to impact the growing threat of money laundering not only to our Nation, but worldwide.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this amendment with my friend from California, Senator Boxer. Over the years, as she has already indicated, we have worked together as a watchdog of the Pentagon, and being a watchdog of that agency is not an easy job. Whether Republicans or Democrats are running this place, it is always tough when we tangle with the Pentagon. It is not a very popular thing to do. 
Senator Boxer has always been a reliable person to fight to get the most bang for the taxpayers' dollars in defense. 
And I compliment her on that. 
In today's political environment, reliable defense reform allies are hard to come by. They are somewhat of an endangered species today compared to 10 years ago. Organizations like the Center for Strategic and Budget Assessments used to support our cause. Not anymore. That organization is now bankrolled by the industry and by the Defense Department itself. So we are kind of teaming up with less outside support than we have had in the past. But we still have the same challenges to meet, and we are going to meet those. 
So I am happy to once again team up with Senator Boxer, this time on a specific provision, very targeted, very easy to understand, but one that is very important that we accomplish. That is the executive compensation issue. We worked together on this in years past. And I am glad to do it. We have also my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, as a cosponsor. I am glad to have him on board as well. So this is very much a team effort. 
Mr. President, there are four separate executive compensation caps in law today. 
I have a table that provides details on each of these caps.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRASSLEY. The Armed Services Committee is trying very hard in this legislation to blow the lid right off the caps with section 804 of the bill. The committee wants to reach deeper into the taxpayers' pockets by doing this. I do not understand why, and I want to know why. What is the basis for the decision? I know during this debate we are going to find that out. I know sincere people on the other side of the aisle are going to tell us the justification for it, but I want to tell my colleagues why I think the legislation is wrong. 
Because before we give executives a pay raise, we should know how much public money they get in the first place. That is where this debate should begin. That is taking us right back to square one. We cannot figure out where we need to go until we know where we are. And we do not know where we are on this subject of executive pay. 
The committee made the decision to lift the caps and, I think, without the facts. The committee needs to answer a key question. How much is the Department of Defense paying industry executives today? The committee does not have the answer to that question. 
Back in January, Senator Boxer and I tried to get that answer. We asked the General Accounting Office to answer three questions. How much is the Pentagon paying the top 50 industry executives today? How well are the caps working?

Mr. GRASSLEY. We need the answers to these questions, and the answers are not easy to get. We got some answers in June, but not the answers that we expected, Mr. President. The General Accounting Office reports the caps are having `no significant effect on limiting executive compensation.' 
The General Accounting Office did take a close look at one company, McDonnell Douglas. The top executives at McDonnell Douglas got $33 million over and above the $250,000 cap that is in law. That is, of course, all from the U.S. Treasury and all for 1 year. Only $313,000 of the McDonnell Douglas executive pay--that is less than 1 percent--was blocked or affected by the cap. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>105-grassley-ia-9-19970710</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GRASSLEY. One of the General Accounting Office tables shows how much the Department of Defense paid the top executives at McDonnell Douglas. The Department of Defense paid them a total of $9,273,382. The top executive got $2,713,308. And I have the chart here so that you can see that the cap is $250,000. We have the executive that I just referred to as executive No. 1, because obviously we are not here to embarrass anybody. It is proprietary information. The name does not matter, but the point is, executive No. 1 got paid $2.7 million; executive No. 2 got paid $2,646,773; the third executive got paid $2,046,481; and the fourth executive got paid $1,833,604--all when there is a cap of $250,000. 
So that cap was designed to limit the size of the Department of Defense paycheck that was sent to McDonnell Douglas for executive pay, and yet we find the cap did not work. 
Now, every citizen would like to get a paycheck like this from Uncle Sam. This chart shows so obviously I do not even need to say it that the existing caps are not working very well. 
In fact, you would have to say they are leaking like a sieve. They are riddled with loopholes the size you can drive a Mack truck through. Maybe they were not meant to be that way. Maybe this was just a big game that somebody is playing with the taxpayers. But we should not be playing these games. And if these caps are not going to work, they should not be in the law. That is what the committee would rather have. I say they ought to be in the law, and I say they ought to work. If the caps are being busted with regularity, we are here to fix them, and that is what the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment is all about. 
Is the problem unique with McDonnell Douglas or are the caps leaking everywhere? We do not know. The Department of Defense does not know. The committee does not know. And, of course, to the taxpayers of this country, that is just not acceptable. It happens to be the same old story. The Department of Defense is paying bills for services rendered, but it does not know what the services cost. 
How could the Department of Defense watchdog the caps if it does not know what each executive gets? There are a lot of questions, and there are no answers. 
Mr. President, the Department of Defense has a responsibility to the taxpayers to answer four questions that I am going to bring out. First, how much does it pay out each year for executive compensation? Secondly, how many executives receive those payments? What are their names? And how much does each one get? 
I asked the Department of Defense these questions on June 20, 1997. The Department of Defense response came back 4 days later, June 21 of this year. And guess what the answer is? The Department of Defense does not collect that kind of information. The Department of Defense does not have it.

<DOCNO>105-grassley-ia-10-19970710</DOCNO>

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, maybe the Department of Defense does not want to know the answer. The size of those paychecks might be embarrassing to the Department. Then again, maybe the Department of Defense does know. I suspect that they do know. I think there is a secret list hidden in someone's safe over at the Pentagon somewhere with this information. 
I have an audit report that tells me that the Department of Defense may know. This is a Defense Contracting Audit Agency report entitled `Audit of Corporate Offices, Overhead Expenses 1995.' Here it is. It is dated March 31 of this year. 
Now, Mr. President, I would like to place this report in the Record, but I have been warned that it may contain proprietary company information so I am not going to do that. It tells me exactly who is on the Department of Defense payroll at McDonnell Douglas and how much each person gets. 
There must be reports like this on other companies as well. Taken together, all these reports would give us the information that we need. These executives are on the public payroll. They take public money. The public should know who they are and how much they get. A company has no right to take public money earmarked for executive pay and stamp it `proprietary and confidential.' 
Strictly, that is Pentagon baloney. That is something that if somebody here on the Senate floor tries to justify, then it becomes Senate baloney as far as I am concerned. The Congress has the responsibility to obtain that information. 
There are two ways to get it. We could put a provision in the bill. It would call for a one-time report. 
I have an amendment, No. 603, that would get that information we need, or the committee, hopefully, is interested in this information, letting the Sun shine in. Where the Sun shines in on Government business, there is never going to be any mold, Mr. President. As an oversight responsibility for the taxpayers, I hope that the committee would be interested in requesting that information, not by my amendment, but simply a letter sent to the Department of Defense to get that information. I would hope that the committee would be willing to send such a letter. Then the committee would hopefully be willing to share this information to the taxpayers of this country. 
I do not think that we should lift that cap without this information. The bill lifts that cap. If the caps are not working, then we should plug the leaks. And, of course, the Grassley-Boxer-Harkin legislation plugs those leaks so that you do not have a situation like this, a cap at $250,000 meant to restrict pay, but you have one executive with $2.7 million, a second executive with $2.6 million, a third executive with $2.0 million, and a fourth executive with $1.8 million. 
So I think we have made a case, first of all, that what we have done has not worked. What we are going to do now should work. And the Boxer-Grassley amendment does that. 
I yield the floor and reserve the balance of the time for our side.

Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, my constituents would expect that if there is a cap in the law of the most that we will pay out of the Federal Treasury to an executive of a major defense corporation, they would expect that salary limit to be adhered to. Not as this chart demonstrates--$250,000 cap, you end up with $2.7 million, $2.6 million, $2 million and $1.8 million, and you gave figures for another corporation that are higher than this. They would expect that cap to work. 
It is obvious that it is not working. If it is obvious it is not working, the very committee that put the cap in place, they would expect that oversight committee to fulfill its constitutional responsibility and make sure that the law is abided by. 
Also, your question gives me an opportunity to point out to our friend from Pennsylvania, when he raised the question of this amount of money, that we could expect executives to make this amount of money. 
The point is this is just a portion of their salary that comes out of taxpayers' dollars. He raised that question, and I want to clarify that the $2.7 million, $2.6 million, $2 million, and $1.8 million is just that portion of that executive salary out of tax money, out of Defense Department money. As he indicated, they could get paid more, they get that out of other sources of income for the corporation. The point is this is just money from the taxpayers. 
Lastly, my constituents raised the same questions as your constituents might raise that it is a more moral and ethical issue here of the extent to which we are having executives get big salaries and people that are working and producing for that corporation on the assembly line or someplace else, that there is a gigantic spread that has developed within corporate America between what the blue-collar worker might be getting paid or other lower paid professional people versus what the executive is getting. I think there is a legitimate question raised whether or not that is a justified gap. I think this emphasizes that there is that gap over a long period of time. Executives getting big pay raises and people lower down are just hardly keeping up with inflation.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, this chart refers to the figure that has been given to us as the cap that might be effectively in place as a result of section 804, $340,000. 
In a practical world of paying executives, we have three estimates, and these are very recent estimates from various publications just this spring. The Wall Street Journal, for instance, had an average salary of corporate executives of $1.5 million. The Forbes publication had an average salary in their survey of $1.9 million. Business Week had an average salary of $2.3 million. This would be total compensation.

Mr. GRASSLEY. It would be unrelated to the issue we have before us of the defense industry, but it does tell me that the figure that the committee feels will somehow be a cap for this year--and we want to remember that it is suggested that this cap is going to go up from year to year--that it is not going to be a very effective way of controlling money leaving the Defense Department to the executives, as the committee has intended. I think they are going to find this just as ineffective as the cap that has been in the law, as I have demonstrated in a previous chart that I have.

Mr. GRASSLEY. For myself, I will answer that question very shortly this way. First of all, we are only talking about the portion that is going to come from the taxpayers. Second, we in no way in our amendment limit executive salaries for corporations. In fact, it is none of our business to do that. That is a market decision. We want that to be a market decision, and nothing in our amendment keeps that from happening. 
The point is, how much should be paid out of the Treasury and how much should be paid out of other income? That is a stockholders versus CEO business relationship that we will not infringe upon. Our amendment does not; we don't intend to. Both of us would say it would be wrong for us to do that.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think that is what is at stake here with the debate on our amendment as well as the debate on what has actually been taking place when there has been a cap in the law for the last year or so, and that is that the caps aren't working. But also the principle of a cap has been the policy of this Congress for a long period of time. We want to continue that policy. We want that to be an effective policy. We want a committee that is charged with the oversight responsibility for a law that this body passes to make sure that that policy is followed to a `t' by the Defense Department. We see all of that at issue here in our amendment. This isn't just an issue of $200,000 versus $250,000 or a new suggested limit of $340,000. It is the integrity of this body making public policy on defense, and is the Congress of the United States going to be followed by the agency executing our laws? 
We are finding out that Congress wants a cap. We are finding out even on a reconsideration of that law that the Armed Services Committee argues for a cap. We want it to be an effective cap. There might be an argument about $200,000 versus $340,000. I will buy either limit. But what I want is a limit that is enforced. I want the committee to know how much money we are paying out. 
We are told that they don't even know. They ought to know where the taxpayer dollars are going, the names of the people receiving them, and how much is going out. 
That is the issue with this amendment as much as whether it is $200,000, $250,000, or $340,000. Let's get this principle established firmly by voting for this amendment, and let's see that the cap is enforced.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the issue here is whether or not we are going to stand by and let the Pentagon thumb its nose at the U.S. Senate. We have had salary caps for the last 3 years. The Defense Department has found a way, by $33 million, just with McDonnell Douglas getting over that salary cap. We need an effective salary cap. We haven't had one. This will guarantee an effective salary cap so that the Pentagon will have to execute the laws the way Congress intended.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the accomplishments of the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program [RSVP] in Waterloo, IA. This program is celebrating 25 years in their community, this year of 1997. In the last 25 years, over two million volunteer hours have been donated to the communities it serves. Among the recipients of these hours have been children, teachers, elderly, handicapped and a variety of service and community agencies. Some of the many community needs RSVP is assisting with are mentoring, assisting teachers, clerical, carpentry, transportation for the frail and elderly, mediation, respite care, tax preparation assistance, bulk mailings, money management, etc. The needs are as diverse as the volunteers themselves. 
This RSVP program started out as a clearinghouse for volunteers and now includes sponsoring several programs of its own: a mediation program that assists with the small claims courts; a school volunteer program that provides mentors and other volunteers to assist with student needs; a money management program that helps individuals remain independent in their own homes; a respite program that provides relief to care givers; and a tax assistance program that provides tax preparation assistance to the low income and elderly. 
RSVP provides challenging volunteer opportunities to those 55 and older. At the same time meeting many community needs through the dedication of their unselfish volunteers, who have proven to be a valuable asset to the communities they serve.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise at this time to introduce two bills. Both bills are designed to encourage what is known in the legal world as arbitration, which is a type of alternative dispute resolution and a means of settling differences instead of litigating them in the costly environment and adversarial environment of the courts. 
Our great American leader, Abraham Lincoln, wrote over 140 years ago, in 1840: `Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can.' That is exactly what these two bills are designed to do. 
For over 20 years now, all three branches have looked for ways to alleviate the courts' crowded docket and to enable a civil litigant to have his complaint heard in a more expedient fashion. In 1976, in search of alternatives, Chief Justice Burger convened the Pound Conference on the Causes of Popular Dissatisfaction with the Administration of Justice and asked its members: `Isn't there a better way?' 
There is, and that way is called alternative dispute resolution. Most State and Federal bar associations now have alternative dispute resolution committees. Some have even elevated consideration of ADR approaches to a matter of professional ethics or its equivalent. Almost all law schools across the country now offer their students classes in ADR. Many graduate programs, especially business schools, have added ADR courses to their curriculum. And numerous legal and business publications are committed exclusively to the topic of alternative dispute resolution. 
Contracts, be they between nations, major corporations, or even private individuals, now more often than not include arbitration clauses. There are numerous professional and trade associations under the umbrella of alternative dispute resolution. ADR is not a legal vogue, nor is it second-class justice. ADR is an intelligent and efficient alternative to litigation, and it is a way to ensure that civil matters can be handled as quickly as possible with low cost to the parties and with an outstanding settlement and satisfaction rate among all entities involved. Arbitration in particular combines procedural protections with the informality necessary for parties to discuss their positions in a manner that promotes settlement and allows for a detailed exploration of the issues. 
In 1990, Congress enacted bills to authorize implementation of ADR programs throughout the administrative agency apparatus and to ask Federal courts to consider ADR as a means to reduce cost. For example, on November 15, 1990, President Bush signed into law a bill which I introduced called the Administrative Dispute Resolutions Act. This act authorized and promoted the use of alternative dispute resolution by Federal Government agencies. 
Almost immediately, the success of the bill became evident. In 1992, for example, agencies reported that over 70 percent of the disputes submitted to ADR reached settlement. Often mere discussion of what ADR techniques to apply led to agreement between the parties. Last year, in a unified showing of support for the idea of ADR, including arbitration, we permanently reauthorized that 1990 act. 1990 also saw the passage of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, which authorized the use of negotiated rulemaking as an alternative to adversarial rulemaking in Federal agencies, and the Civil Justice Reform Act, which required every Federal district court to develop a civil justice expense and delay reduction plan. 
To test the ADR waters in the article III courts, in 1988, Congress amended the Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Act and authorized pilot programs in 20 Federal district courts. The amendment made court-annexed, nonbinding arbitration mandatory in 10 districts and voluntary in the other 10. The results are in, and they are more than encouraging. Therefore, the first bill I am introducing today will permanently extend authorization of these pilot programs so that these courts can continue to provide litigants with efficient and successful alternatives to trial. Senator Specter, whose own home State of Pennsylvania has participated in this program, is joining me in this effort. 
Over half of the Nation's 94 districts currently offer some type of alternative dispute resolution. This number seems low, and the reason for that is because many districts are not sure whether courts other than those authorized by statute may offer ADR. Therefore, to eliminate this uncertainty, the second bill I am introducing not only authorizes district courts across the Nation to implement arbitration programs and procedures, it demands such implementation. It will then be left to the discretion of each judge, however, whether to make use of the implemented programs and procedures. 
The major goal of arbitration is to encourage litigants to settle their disputes without going through the lengthy and costly process of a full-blown trial. This will not only lessen the burden on the judicial branch, but also enable people who feel they have been wronged to get a decision without waiting months for the usual verdict and without spending tons of money on attorney's fees. 
Let me just give an example, and this is according to the 
National Law Journal. It was an article that was published last year. It has been determined that out of every dollar spent in asbestos litigation, only 39 cents goes to victims, with approximately 33 to 50 percent of the awards collected allocated as attorney's fees. 
My arbitration bills are designed to curb exactly this type of `plaintiff-milking.' In the pilot program districts, the majority of arbitration cases closed before even reaching the arbitration hearing level and over two-thirds did not return to the court's regular calendar, thus saving not only the litigants, but also the courts and, therefore, the public both time and money. In the New Jersey program, about 20 percent of the civil case filings qualified for mandatory arbitration over the 8-year period which the program operated. Less than 2 percent of those cases required trial; in other words, 98 percent of those cases could be settled via arbitration. 
A majority of the attorneys involved in arbitration cases agreed that referring the case to the program directly resulted in earlier settlement discussions and, most important, in avoiding litigation. For the parties involved, that means their issues were resolved from 2 to 18 months sooner than if the case had gone to trial. In the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as an example, the median time until a dispute is resolved through ADR is 5 months. Only 7 percent of the district's arbitration cases lasted beyond 9 months and the percentage of cases tried de novo is less than 10 percent. 
Litigants, attorneys, and judges all are more than laudatory of the program's results. As a matter of fact, positive reaction could be documented almost as soon as the program was implemented. A 1990 report by the Federal Judicial Center illustrates this point. Over 80 percent of the litigants surveyed praised the fairness of the ADR process; 84 percent of attorneys surveyed said that they approved of arbitration both as a concept and, more important, as implemented in their specific districts. 
Also, an overwhelming 97 percent of the judges involved in the program agreed that their civil caseload was reduced since less than a third of the arbitration caseload returns to the regular trial calendar. The resounding consensus was that other districts should also adopt this outstanding program as a result of this experiment. 
Let me give you another example of the success of ADR. A November 1996 study of the Judicial Council of California, on California's Civil Action Mediation Act, showed that litigant satisfaction for arbitration in the Los Angeles County Superior Court was 84 percent and that 94 percent of the overall respondents would use arbitration again. 
Incidentally, that same study showed that the program's mediation process within 2 years produced savings five times higher than what the California Legislature had targeted for 5 years. In other words, California had targeted $250,000 after 5 years to consider the mediation program a success. ADR saved the courts a total of $1.3 million in just 2 years. Whether it is mediation, arbitration, or any other of the ADR techniques, alternative dispute resolution undoubtedly is successful in creating huge savings for both the public and the litigants. 
The benefits of arbitration, not only to the judicial branch, but, more important, to the litigants, are impossible to ignore. Skeptics argue that the litigant will feel he is being subjected to second-class justice, but, quite frankly, the opposite is the case. Litigants feel that they are much more closely involved in the process than would be the case if there was formal adjudication. Litigants can participate much more actively and have much more control over what is decided and how it is decided. Negotiation, rather than adjudication, is the goal. And when all is said and done, unlike after a trial, the parties on opposite sides of the table often still have some type of positive relationship. 
On top of that, the process is private, unlike the public trial. In such a private, somewhat informal setting, the parties involved have much more flexibility, not only regarding procedure but also remedies. Generally, as we know, an article III court in a civil matter will limit remedies to a dollar figure. Arbitration can go beyond that. Often all a plaintiff wants might be an apology, or the injured worker who can't perform his job any more just wants another job. Arbitration can give a party those results. 
Arbitration is a legal concept that makes sense, saves time, and saves money. As a matter of fact, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, one of the pilot programs, estimates that arbitration has produced a 5-to-1 savings in private and public costs. 
So the two bills that I am introducing today will, therefore, help give the public efficient and expedient access to the Federal courts and will help alleviate the caseload burden on the judicial branch.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I know that all of us agree there is no greater national treasure this Nation has than our children. Nurturing and encouraging them to live up to their potential is one of the most important things we can do. That is why our educational system must be the best it can be and our Nation's educators must be the best they can be. But there is something that I believe all the members of congress need to be aware of because it may have a profound and lasting effect on educators throughout the country. I am referring to the ongoing merger talks between the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers. 
This matter is of prime importance to NEA members across the United States and I know it is of tremendous importance to the Iowa State Education Association. It is disturbing that many members of the NEA are not aware of this because this is not just joining of two teachers' organizations. Given the AFT's affiliation with the AFL-CIO and the apparent willingness of the NEA to accede to the demands of the AFT. Should the merger go through, this new organization would be a member of the AFL-CIO, which could have tremendous policy implications for the largest organization representing educators. For that reason, I urge other members of congress to read the article I am submitting for consideration.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, look at how wrong the argument of the Senator from Arizona is, that when a consumer doesn't pay a gasoline tax, it turns out to be a subsidy to an industry. How wrong that argument can be. This is not a subsidy to any industry. If this amendment passes, after the year 2000 the consumers of America are going to pay more gas tax on that portion of their gasoline that is ethanol. This is good for the environment and good for agriculture. It is good for jobs in the cities--195,000 jobs. It is good for energy independence and everything. It is good, good, good.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have spoken before this body several times about the serious problems in the FBI crime lab. The Justice Department's Inspector General has done the country a great service by uncovering the sloppiness and wrongdoing of certain lab examiners. 
A dozen such examiners are criticized in the IG's April 15 report for testifying beyond their expertise, and for changing lab reports. The IG found no criminal violations. Yet the wrongful testimony and the altering of reports by these examiners almost all redounded to the benefit of the prosecution, rather than to the defendant. 
This is a curious phenomenon, in my mind. Why weren't the changes more randomly distributed? How come they all benefitted the prosecution? Those are rather obvious questions. 
And so I thought a lot about what was done by the IG to determine motive or intent on the part of the examiners whose actions he criticized. And I have come to the conclusion that the IG's methodology was insufficient for determining motive or intent. And so, further investigation is warranted. 
The reasons for why further investigation is warranted were laid out in a letter I sent to the Attorney General on June 11. For starters, there was the April 16 Wall Street Journal front-page story on lab examiner Michael Malone. In that article, Agent Malone is cited for improper testimony in several cases, by judges and others. 
The Wall Street Journal broke new ground in uncovering problems in the FBI lab. First, it showed that wrongdoing by lab examiners has not been relegated to the three units investigated by the IG. Malone was assigned to a fourth unit--hairs and fibers. And second, it underscored the fundamental flaw in the IG's investigative methodology; namely, that it failed to review, for patterns of wrongdoing, all the cases of each examiner who was severely criticized in his report. 
To illustrate the point, it is interesting to note that in the IG's report, Agent Malone is criticized for wrongdoing in only one case--that of Alcee L. Hastings. Yet, the Journal reporter researched open-source case data and found numerous instances of apparent wrongdoing by Malone in other cases. If an enterprising reporter could do such a review, why couldn't the IG? 
And so I asked the Attorney General to conduct further investigation of those examiners, including Malone, who were severely criticized in the IG report. All cases worked on by each one of these examiners should be reviewed independently to determine if there is a pattern similar to what the Journal found in the case of Malone. Only then would we see the full scope of each agent's actions. If any patterns exist, those cases should be reviewed for administrative action, for undisclosed Brady material, for civil liability, or for misconduct involving obstruction of justice or perjury. 
There's some importance and urgency attached to my request. I understand that the IG has referred the findings of his report to the Pubic Integrity Section for possible criminal prosecution. In my view, they have been referred without sufficient follow-up investigation, thereby increasing the likelihood of declinations. I do not intend to stand by and watch declinations being handed out when some very obvious stones have been left unturned. 
My request was that the following agents' cases be reviewed by DOJ prior to any decision by Pubic Integrity: 
For possible involvement in altering reports: J. Thomas Thurman; J. Christopher Ronay; Wallace Higgins; David Williams; Alan Jordan. 
For possible false testimony: David Williams, Roger Martz; Charles Calfee; Terry Rudolph; Michael Malone; John Hicks; Richard Hahn. 
For possible undisclosed Brady material: Robert Webb. 
On April 16, I met with the IG, Michael Bromwich, and raised with him the subject of the Wall Street Journal article on Malone. I discussed my belief that his methodology was flawed, and that I would request in writing, after studying his report, that all cases involving lab examiners whose work he severely criticized in his report be investigated further. Thus, the IG has been aware for some time that my request would be forthcoming. 
In my discussions with the IG on April 16, one notable issue came up. I asked the IG if he had found possible criminal wrongdoing on the part of any of the lab personnel. He said `no.' I then asked him if he had detected a patter of wrongdoing by any agent, as the Journal seemed to find with Malone. He said `no.' I asked him if he even reviewed all the cases of any of the criticized agents. He said `no.' 
These responses are troubling to me because the IG has gone out of his way to say he found no possible criminal activity by lab personnel. It sounds to me like he didn't even look for it. In fact, he told me in my office way back in February--well after his investigation was finished--that it wasn't in his charter to look for possible criminal activity. Therefore, due diligence requires further investigation such as I have requested. Otherwise, the public's full confidence cannot be restored. 
In a specific instance, for example, the IG had critized Agent Williams for `backwards science'; i.e., tailoring evidence at the crime scene to evidence found elsewhere, such as at a suspect's home. I asked the IG if his finding of backwards science conducted by Williams didn't warrant further investigation for possible criminal intent. 
The IG responded that Williams gave a plausible explanation in his defense; namely, that Williams actually believed that was the proper way to conduct an investigation--in other words, `backwards.' The IG said the five blue ribbon scientists who investigated the lab believed Williams' explanation. 
Mr. President, I could not believe my ears. First of all, the scientists are not prosecutors. Second, whether Williams' explanation was believed or not, the IG should have reviewed the rest of Williams' cases. 
Such a review would have shown one of two things: Either he did do all of his investigations backwards, in which case his explanation would hold up but all of his cases should be considered suspect; or, he did some investigations correctly and some backwards, in which case his explanation would be undermined, and intent would be an issue. At the moment, because of the IG's flawed methodology, we don't know which is correct. 
The IG did not even review the second World Trade Center case to see if Williams gave similarly false testimony in court, as he had in the first World Trade Center case. I understand Williams' testimony in the second case was the same as in the first case. If so, this might have established a pattern in the IG's investigation. 
Meanwhile, at a May 13 hearing before the House Subcommittee on Crime, the IG admitted, under questioning from Congressman Robert Wexler, that alterations to lab reports appeared to be biased in favor of the prosecution's position. This is a serious matter because it could go to the issue of motive. 
It is also not clear to me whether the IG was aware of an FBI internal review in 1994 and 1995 of alterations and changes of lab reports after allegations were made by two lab scientists. James Corby, chief of the Materials Analysis Unit, conducted the review. Dr. Corby verified numerous instances of alterations, many of which were material changes. He concluded that they were clearly intentional. In a memo to his section chief, J.J. Kearney, dated January 13, 1995, Dr. Corby stated the following, with respect to the intentional changes: 
A[n] FBI Laboratory report is evidence. Often times the report itself is entered into evidence during the trial proceedings. The fact that SSA [redacted name] did make unauthorized changes in these reports could have resulted in serious consequences during legal proceedings and embarrassment to the Laboratory as well as the entire FBI. 
The FBI's Office of the General Counsel [OGC] apparently concurred. A memorandum from General Counsel Howard Shapiro to the Lab's director, M.E. Ahlerich, dated June 12, 1995, reiterated the lab's policy of not altering reports, and warned that, `* * * failure to follow this policy could subject the FBI and/or individual employees to civil or criminal liability.' 
Mr. President, I previously placed these documents in the Record on March 20, 1997. 
The documents and arguments I have advanced on this issue present a compelling case for further investigation. We have yet to hear an equally compelling counter-argument from either the Attorney General, or the IG. The issue of my request came up at the Attorney General's weekly press conference of June 12. A wire story later that evening by the Associated Press, quoted Ms. Reno as simply saying the following:  
We have not seen any basis for criminal inquiry. 
Mr. President, I don't know whether or not the Attorney General had read my letter before giving that quote. But I assure you, that if the AG had read it, she would see there is plenty of basis for criminal inquiry. 
I also asked Ms. Reno for a response by last week. I have yet to hear a peep out of her office. In my view, the Attorney General needs to act quickly and provide a compelling rebuttal to the facts I laid out in my June 11 letter to her. To simply say `We have not seen any basis for criminal inquiry' is simply not credible. I, for one, have seen sufficient basis. 
In the same June 12 AP story, the IG took issue with my statement that he did not do a criminal investigation. The IG said he did a hybrid, criminal/administrative inquiry. The IG may not recall the conversation we had in my office in February. He was asked to respond to a comment in a letter I had received dated February 21, 1997 from then-Deputy FBI Director Weldon Kennedy. The comment was the following: 
* * * [T]he Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General found no instances of perjury, evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory evidence. 
In my office, the IG was asked if he even looked for that. He responded no, because that wasn't in his charter. 
Regardless of what is or isn't in his charter, the fact is the IG did nothing to establish intent. If he wants to cite the questioning of David Williams and the backwards science as a probing of intent, well I'll simply rest my case. 
It is not my intention to criticize the IG's work. To the contrary, I consider it a landmark effort and an important service for the American people. I have nothing but praise for Mr. Bromwich, his team of investigators, and the five blue ribbon scientists. 
But it cannot stop there. There are too many stones left unturned. There is a culture that needs reforming. There's still a cowboy element running loose in that lab. 
It seems to me that the IG investigation is merely a point of departure. It identified individuals whose work should be more thoroughly scrutinized. Failure to conduct follow-up investigation can only further erode the public's dwindling confidence in Federal law enforcement. 
Meanwhile, Mr. President, I await the Attorney General's overdue response to my letter.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I would like to talk about two letters from the Department of Defense, DOD. 
The first letter is dated June 11, 1997. 
The second one is dated June 13, 1997--just 2 days later. 
Both letters are addressed to the editor of The Hill newspaper, Mr. Albert Eisele. 
Both are signed by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, Mr. Kenneth H. Bacon. 
Both were written in response to an article I wrote about Mr. John Hamre in the June 4 issue of the Hill. 
Mr. Hamre is the Chief Financial Officer at the Pentagon. 
He has been selected by Secretary Cohen to become the next Deputy Secretary of Defense. 
I oppose this nomination for the reason I gave in the Hill article. 
Mr. Hamre is aggressively pursuing a progess payment policy that the inspector general has declared illegal. 
Mr. Bacon charges that my article ignores the facts and twists the truth. 
Ironically, Mr. Bacon's letters prove he is the one who ignores the facts and twists the truth. 
He sent the second letter to correct misinformation in the first one.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think it would be very helpful to make a side-by-side comparison of these two letters. 
It would help bring my main point about Mr. Hamre into sharper focus. 
Mr. Bacon's two letters are identical in every respect but one. 
A major discrepancy exists between the last paragraph on the first page of the first letter and the same paragraph in the second letter. 
I would like to quote from that portion of the first letter. 
This is Mr. Bacon talking: 
Senator Grassley claimed Hamre presided over a scheme to make illegal progress payments. Again, the facts are quite different. Mr. Hamre, working with the DOD IG, has carried out the IG's recommendations on progress payments. Senator Grassley claimed Hamre tried to legalize the crime by proposing legislative changes concerning progress payments. 
That legislation was first proposed by the IG. 
Mr. Bacon's statements do not square with the facts. They are inaccurate. 
Mr. President, I pride myself on always doing my homework and always sticking to the facts. 
My article on Mr. Hamre's illegal progress payment policy is no exception. 
I have documents to back up every point I have made. 
From day one, I have never strayed from the facts and conclusions presented by the DOD IG. 
From day one, the IG and legal counsel have maintained that the department's progress payment policy `results in the rendering of false accounts and violation of the law.' 
Nothing has changed since the IG issued its report in March 1992. 
The illegal progress payment policy remains in effect at this very moment. 
The IG has consistently maintained that the `status quo is unacceptable' and that the policy must be brought into compliance with the law. 
After 5 years of unproductive meetings, the IG recommended that the department seek `legislative relief.' 
The IG proposed a temporary exemption from the law, while the progress payment operation was being overhauled. 
But when the draft language hit the street late 1996, it was not at all what the IG had in mind. 
This language was drafted by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service but was Mr. Hamre's brain child. 
It was far reaching, comprehensive and permanent. 
The IG and legal counsel came unglued when they saw it and killed it in the end. 
Mr. President, those are the facts--according to the IG--not according to the Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. Bacon's first letter is out of sync with the facts. 
When the IG, Ms. Eleanor Hill, saw Mr. Bacon's first letter, I am told, she blew her top. 
She picked up the phone and called Mr. Bacon. He was on travel, but his principal deputy, Mr. Bernath, was in his office over at the Pentagon. 
She confronted him with the truth. 
He agreed right then and there to retract the false and misleading statements in Mr. Bacon's first letter. 
Mr. President, that's how we ended up with Mr. Bacon's second letter. 
I would now like to quote from the revised portion of his second letter:  
Mr. Hamre, working with the DOD IG, is working to carry out the IG's recommendations on progress payments. Senator Grassley claimed Hamre tried to legalize the crime by proposing legislative changes concerning progress payments. Prior to proposing legislation, Mr. Hamre had discussed with the DOD IG the possibility of seeking legislative relief if it was too difficult for the department to comply with the current statute. 
These revisions give Mr. Bacon's letter an entirely new meaning. 
`Is working to carry out' is a far cry from `has carried out.' 
`Discussed with the DOD IG' is a far cry from `first proposed by the DOD IG.' 
The revisions--demanded by the IG--strengthen my main point, Mr. President. They showcase Mr. Hamre's shortcomings. 
I need to thank Mr. Bacon. 
His letters make my case: 
Mr. Hamre has failed to carry out the IG's recommendations and bring his policy into compliance with the law. 
Mr. Hamre's policy continues to operate outside the law at this very moment, and that's exactly why he felt like he needed legislation. 
He needed to cover his back side. 
He needed legal cover for his illegal policy. 
Now, I would like to commend Mr. Bacon for being more truthful and accurate. 
But there's one little problem. 
His first letter still stands as a matter of record. 
Where did the misinformation come from in the first place? 
Did Mr. Bacon dream it up by himself? Or did someone set him up? If so, who? Did Mr. Hamre have any knowledge of this letter? 
Mr. President, I have written Mr. Bacon. He needs to answer my questions.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to achieve one of my primary objectives as chairman of the Special Committee on Aging: to help workers and retirees achieve a secure retirement. 
As with any discussion about retirement planning, it is the norm to point to the `three-legged stool' of retirement--Social Security, personal savings, and a pension. Unfortunately, the legs of the stool may be getting warped. 
Just this week, the Aging Committee confronted an issue that is affecting hundreds of thousands of workers and retirees--miscalculation of their hard-earned pensions. This hearing was intended to raise consumer awareness about the need to be proactive about policing your pension. As one of our witnesses said, `never assume your pension is error-free.' 
While it is impossible to know how many pension payments and lump sum distributions may be miscalculated, we know the number is on the rise. An audit conducted by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation--focused on plans that were voluntarily terminated--showed that the number of people underpaid has increased from 2.8 to 8.2 percent. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of people receiving lump sum distributions who end up getting shortchanged could be 15 to 20 percent. Those numbers are very disturbing. The practical impact is that retirees, and young and old workers alike, are losing dollars that they have earned. 
Workers and retirees need to be aware that they are at risk. They can help themselves by knowing how their benefits are calculated, that they should keep all the documents their employer gives them, and to start asking questions at a young age--don't wait until the eve of retirement. 
Unfortunately, policing your pension is not easy. Employers are trying to do a good job but they are confronted with one of the most complex regulatory schemes in the Federal Government. Pensions operate in a complex universe of laws, rules, and regulations. Over the last 20 years, 16 laws have been enacted that require employers to amend their pension plans and then notify their workers of changes. It is 
not a simple task. If employers have problems trying to comply with Federal requirements, it is understandable that workers and retirees are having trouble getting a grasp on how their pension works. 
Trying to educate yourself about pensions implies that someone is out there providing information to those who need it. That is where the legislation that I am introducing today comes in. People who are concerned about their pensions--whether it's an unintentional mistake or outright fraud--often don't have anywhere to go for expert advice. 
Fortunately, there is an answer. Already authorized by the Older Americans Act, seven pension counseling projects have assisted thousands of people around this country with their pension problems. These projects provide information and counseling to retirees, and young and old workers in a very cost-effective manner. 
Each project received $75,000 of Federal assistance over a 17-month period. As is normal for other programs under the Older Americans Act, these dollars were supplemented by money raised from private sources. During their operation, the projects recovered nearly $2 million in pension benefits and payments. That is a return of $4 for every $1 spent. 
My legislation contains two key provisions: First, it updates the Older Americans Act to encourage the creation of more pension counseling projects. Seven projects are not enough to reach the 80 million people who are covered by pensions in this country. Hopefully, more counseling projects can be established to provide more regionally comprehensive assistance. 
Second, the legislation would create an 800 number that people could call for one-stop advice on where to get assistance. Jurisdiction over pension issues is spread across three government agencies--none of which are focused on helping individuals with individual problems--especially if the problem does not seem to be a clear fiduciary breach or indicate that there may be criminal wrongdoing. An 800 number linking people to assistance will help close that gap. 
I look forward to working with the Labor Subcommittee on Aging, the entity with jurisdiction over the Older Americans Act--to get these changes enacted as part of the reauthorization this year. 
It is also crucial to emphasize the need for pension counseling projects with congressional appropriators. The projects have not received earmarked funding since the end of fiscal year 1996 and we simply cannot afford to lose the expertise that has been developed over the last 3 1/2 years--especially in light of the growing concern over pension security. 
My committee has been focusing on preparing for the retirement of the baby boom generation--it can be anticipated that the need for assistance with pensions will increase as that generation begins to retire. Social Security, by itself, was never intended to be the primary source of income for a retiree. A pension from an employer can prove to be a determining factor in whether retirees are able to maintain a decent standard of living. If there is no one to go for assistance to get all of the pension they have earned, their chances at a secure retirement are gloomy indeed.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed H.R. 956, the Drug Free Communities Act of 1997, today. Earlier this month, this same bill was approved by a vote of 420 to 1 in the other body. As you know, I, along with 18 of my colleagues, introduced a companion version of this legislation in the Senate earlier this year. By the close of business today, this legislation has garnered a total of 29 cosponsors. 
Mr. President, this is an outstanding show of support for this important piece of legislation. When each of us return home over recess, we meet with the people that we represent. We listen to their problems, and we listen to their solutions. And when we talk about drugs, and talk about what can be done to keep our kids from using drugs, it always comes back to the community. What matters most is what parents, schools, churches, law enforcement, community groups, and businesses do, working together, to keep our kids drug free. 
This legislation will support these efforts. It will allow communities with established coalitions, coalitions that have a proven track record, to receive matching funds to support their efforts. It will provide additional resources in the hands of those who make a difference; people that our children respect and listen to: parents. Placing resources at the community level allows parents, teachers, community, and religious leaders to use these funds to make a difference in the lives of our children, our future. 
I want to thank my colleagues and co-sponsors on both sides of the aisle. I particularly want to thank Senator Daschle, Senator DeWine, Senator Biden, and Senator Hatch and many others for their support and efforts in moving this legislation.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to talk about the Department of Defense's [DOD] problem disbursements. 
I have spoken on the subject many times in the past. 
I would like to speak on it again today because the Pentagon's Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, Mr. John Hamre, claims he's whipping the problem. 
His claims do not seem to stand up to scrutiny. 
The GAO has issued a new report on DOD's problem disbursements. It is entitled `Improved Reporting Needed For DOD Problem Disbursements.' 
This report rips Mr. Hamre's claims to shreds. 
In May 1996, Mr. Hamre claimed he had an $18 billion problem. Now, it's $8 billion and falling. 
The GAO says Mr. Hamre is understating the problem by at least $25 billion. 
Mr. Hamre is blowing smoke to hide the problem. 
He is falling back on the oldest trick in the bureaucrat's book: Redefine the problem to make it appear smaller. 
He did it by administrative decree in December 1996. 
His decree arbitrarily excludes huge chunks of problem disbursements from official reports to Congress. 
He just waved his magic wand and shrunk the universe. 
It is not smaller because he cleaned up the books or reconciled delinquent accounts. 
He did not do any oldtime bookkeeping to get the job done. 
In fact, he did not get the job done. He just wants us to think the did. 
Mr. President, to understand what Mr. Hamre is up to, we need to understand problem disbursements. What are they, and why are they a problem? 
The GAO says there are three types of problem disbursements: in-transit disbursements, unmatched disbursement, negative unliquidated obligations or NULO's. 
An in-transit disbursement is one that is floating in limbo. 
The check was written and the bill was paid. But the payment has not been posted to an account. 
If Mr. Hamre were on the ball, there would be no in-transits. Transactions should be recorded as they occur. That's basic accounting 101 stuff. 
That's how businesses operate. 
The Pentagon's accounting guru--Mr. Keevey--says that's the right way to do it. I quote Mr. Keevey: 
Under a good finance and accounting network, you would never make a payment until you check it against the underlying obligation and the underlying records. 
If DOD practiced what Mr. Keevey preaches, there would be no problem disbursements. Period. 
Congress has been telling DOD to do exactly the same thing every year for the last 3 years. 
Section 8106 of last year's appropriations bill says: 
Match disbursements with obligations before making payments. 
But the bureaucrats complain: `No can do. It's just too hard.' 
They think it's normal for disbursements to float in limbo for up to 120 days or even longer. For them, a disbursement floating in outer space for 4 months is OK. 
It's not a problem disbursement under Mr. Hamre's exclusion policy. 
Here's a prime example of how well Mr. Hamre's policy works. 
The GAO discovered, for example, that DOD excludes certain `recurring and routine' transactions. 
Mr. President, you should see what the GAO found in the Pentagon's `recurring and routine' basket? 
The GAO discovered $4.5 billion of payroll disbursements from automated teller machines or ATM's that were once located on Navy ships. 
They just weren't very fresh. 
They were so old that their points of origin had disappeared off the face of the Earth. The ships that carried the ATM's have been decommissioned. 
Time passed them by. 
Most of these ATM transactions were at least 2 years old but some dated back to January 1988, or 9 years ago. 
To the average citizen, a check that is not recorded in a checkbook register for 9 years just might be a problem. 
But not to Mr. Hamre. 
He says it's `normal and routine' for a disbursement to float around in outer space for 9 years. `It's OK. It doesn't count. Not to worry.' 
Unmatched disbursements are more troublesome than in-transits. 
When in-transits finally reach the accountant's desk, the accountant tries to match the disbursement with its corresponding obligation. 
An obligation is like a contractual commitment of money. 
When a corresponding obligation cannot be identified, you have a problem--an unmatched disbursement. 
In some cases, the hookup is made. Sometimes it takes months or even years. And sometimes, the match is never made. 
That's an unmatchable disbursement. 
That happens when supporting documentation has disappeared. 
When you have a check and no supporting documentation, you have a hot potato. 
That's a problem, Mr. President. It's a big problem for anyone responsible for controlling public money.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to briefly address an issue I talked about already on June 5. I want to clarify the record regarding an inaccurate Washington Post front-page story on Chief U.S. District Judge George P. Kazen of the southern district of Texas. 
To refresh your memory, the Post reported on May 15 of this year that Judge Kazen had stated he was overworked, couldn't manage his caseload and needed more judges. The article then more than implied there was a backlog in his district and there was a crisis across the Nation which was created by the Judiciary Committee playing politics at the cost of justice. 
I had hoped we were done talking about that example of inaccurate and misleading reporting, but judging by a remark made Monday here on the floor, I must reiterate what I already said on June 5: there is no backlog in the southern district of Texas, the article III judges of that district, and of most districts of the country, for that matter, assure me that they can handle their caseloads just fine. 
I noticed my colleague Senator Leahy used this article Monday to once again complain about the pace of confirmations. Unfortunately, he has also become a victim of that misguided article. 
As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I felt compelled to come before my colleagues and set the record straight on the southern district of Texas. Therefore, on June 5, I gave you the applicable statistics for the district and I gave you the responses my 1996 survey produced for that district. As you might recall, in an effort to keep the lines of communication open between this Congress and the judicial branch, I sent a comprehensive survey to all article III judges last year. Some of the questions in the survey addressed precisely this issue of a backlog. I said on June 5 and I'll repeat it today, both my survey and my communications with our Federal judges clearly show that there is no backlog and that a vast majority of the judges in the southern district of Texas, one of the largest and busiest in the Nation, can more than aptly manage their caseload. By the way, the same 
holds true for the Nation in general. 
When I spoke to you on June 5, I wondered how come Judge Kazen would turn to the Washington Post and create such a different impression from what my research, my figures, and, most importantly, my communications with our Federal judges indicated. Well, it turns out that Judge Kazen was as surprised by the article as I was. You see, I just received a letter from Judge Kazen on June 6 and it has now become clear that Judge Kazen is as much a victim of inaccurate reporting as everyone who ended up reading that article is. According to Judge Kazen, he only talked to the reporter regarding his district's contemplation to move the home seat of a judicial vacancy from Houston to either Laredo or McAllen. 
Incidently, the vacancy Judge Kazen was talking about has been around since 1990. It therefore appears that my Democratic colleagues, who are so quick to cry `politics' when the Judiciary Committee dares to scrutinize a Clinton nominee, had ample opportunity to fill that seat and for one reason or another they chose not to do so. 
Judge Kazen insists in his letter that while the article ultimately quoted him as speaking about judicial vacancies, the conversation he had with the reporter was solely on the proposed move of the future judge's home seat. Judge Kazen further states that the article's focus on filling vacancies was never the focus of his conversation with the Post reporter. If mentioned at all, it was nothing more than a passing reference. Judge Kazen, in his letter to me, is adamant that he never described `any caseload as being unmanageable.'

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on May 27 I sent a letter to President Clinton. 
In it, I expressed opposition to the possible nomination of Mr. John J. Hamre to fill the No. 2 spot at the Pentagon. 
He would be the Deputy Secretary of defense, and it's a big job. 
I told the President why I would oppose this nomination--if it's ever made, and I'll give my reasons in just a moment. 
But 2 days after writing this letter, the Washington Post ran a story about my opposition to the nomination. 
Mr. Hamre was also interviewed. 
He attempted to respond to my criticism.

<DOCNO>105-grassley-ia-2-19970610</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to address some of Mr. Hamre's assertions. 
First, Mr. Hamre's remarks imply that my criticism is somehow personal. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. He is a very likeable person. 
But my personal feelings have absolutely nothing to do with my position on his nomination. 
What I have tried to do is examine all the facts and then reach a conclusion based on those facts. 
These are the facts as I know them. 
In 1992, the inspector general [IG] examined the Department of Defense's [DOD] progress payment procedures. 
The IG along with legal counsel declared that these policies `resulted in the rendering of false accounts and violations of the law.' 
The IG told the Department to get on the stick and fix the problem. 
The bureaucrats balked. 
Under pressure, they finally signed an agreement in March 1993. 
In signing this document, they agreed to comply with the law. 
One of the persons who signed this agreement was Mr. Alvin Tucker. 
Well, 7 months after Mr. Tucker signed the agreement, Mr. Hamre became Comptroller and Chief Financial Officer or CFO. 
Well, guess what? 
Mr. Tucker became Mr. Hamre's most senior deputy. He became the Deputy CFO. 
Mr. President, after becoming CFO, Mr. Hamre did nothing to meet the terms of the agreement and comply with the law. 
Instead, he sided with the bureaucrats who were thumbing their noses at the law. 
He gave them the green light to keep breaking the law. 
He personally reauthorized their illegal operation. 
Then, early this year he floated a legislative proposal. 
His draft language would have sanctioned the procedure that the IG had declared illegal and that he, Mr. Hamre, had personally authorized. 
Mr. President, those are the facts. 
In my opinion, Mr. Hamre was attempting to legalize a crime. 
Mr. Hamre knew full well his progess scheme was operating outside the law. 
Otherwise, why would he feel like he needed some legal cover? 
Second, he accuses me of making a mountain out of a molehill. 
He claims I am focusing on a `small policy' issue. 
I take issue with the notion that this is somehow an insignificant issue. 
The statute that Mr. Hamre's progress payment scheme violates is section 1301 of title 31 of the United Statess Code. 
This law embodies a sacred constitutional principle: Only Congress has the power to decide how public money many be spent. 
This is the device that Congress uses to control the purse strings. 
So, Mr. President, this isn't Mickey Mouse stuff. I'm talking about a constitutional principle. 
When a constitutional principle is involved, it's very difficult for me to see the smallness of an issue. 
Third, Mr. Hamre claims this is an acquisition issue--not a finance and accounting question. 
This is an obvious attempt to deflect responsibility--away from himself. 
It's an attempt to make it someone else's problem. 
His reasoning is flawed. 
If Mr. Hamre thinks this is an acquisition issue, maybe he has abdicated his responsibilities under the law--as CFO. 
The CFO's responsibilities are spelled out in the `Money and Finance' section of the United States Code. That's in title 31. 
His payment scheme violates section 1301 in the same book--title 31. 
It does it by deliberately charging payments to the wrong accounts and then juggling the books to cover it up. 
Anyone who thinks this is an acquisition issue needs to consult the law books. 
When you go to the law library and locate title 31 and open the book, the subtitle staring you in the face is: `Money and Finance.' 
Section 1301 lies in a chapter entitled `Appropriations.' 
Mr. President, misappropriation, mischarging and cooking the books takes Mr. Hamre deep into the realm of money and accounting. 
If this is just an acquisition issue, I'll eat my hat. 
Fourth, when Mr. Hamre became CFO in October 1993, he declared war on financial mismanagement. 
To claim success today, he cites `steep drops in contract overpayments.' 
Mr. Hamre's claims are not supported by the facts. 
The General Accounting Office [GAO] has issued a series of reports on DOD overpayments. 
These reports demolish Mr. Hamre's success stories. 
The most recent report says Mr. Hamre's progress payments scheme is the biggest, single driver behind overpayments. He's to blame. 
That's right, Mr. President, Mr. Hamre's own operations are causing overpayments to happen. 
That's exactly what it says on page 12 of the GAO report entitled: `Fixing DOD's Payment Problems is Imperative.' 
This report is dated April 1997 and has the designation NSIAD-97-37. 
GAO reports also say that DOD has no capability to detect overpayments. 
Virtually every overpayment ever examined by the GAO was detected by the person who got the check in the mail--the contractor--and not the Government. 
In almost every case, overpayments were voluntarily refunded by the contractor who got the checks. 
Now, Mr. President, if Mr. Hamre were really serious about eliminating overpayments, why didn't he just shut down the illegal progress payments operation--like the IG asked? 
That would have removed the primary source of overpayments. 
If Mr. Hamre has no capability to detect overpayments, how does he know whether they are going up or down? 
How does he know they are going down, if he doesn't know how many there are? 
Perhaps, if overpayments are really going down--like he says, it must mean the contractors have stopped making voluntary refunds. 
Maybe they have decided to keep the money. That would help to keep the numbers down. 
Mr. President, I will have much more to say about Mr. Hamre in the weeks ahead. 
Some of my colleagues have asked me why I oppose this nomination. 
I want to be sure they know where I am coming from.

Res. 84), establishing the congressional budget for the U.S. Government for fiscal year 1998 and setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002, and ask for its immediate consideration.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate a typographical error contained in the statement of managers to accompany the conference report on the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution. During the course of the conference some language was worked out to include in the statement of managers with respect to the section 8 housing allowance--which is set out in section 203 of the conference report. This language was mistakenly included in the description of section 203 of the Senate amendment rather than in the description of section 203 of the conference agreement. The language at issue reads as follows: 
The agreement creates an allowance of $9.2 billion in budget authority with an associated, but unspecified, amount of outlays to be released by the Budget committees when the Appropriations committees report bills that provide for renewal of Section 8 housing assistance contracts that expire in 1998. The conference agreement assumes that the amount of the allowance to be released (estimated to be $3.436 billion for outlays) will not be reduced to the extent that the appropriations and authorizing committees produce Section 8 savings that were proposed in the President's 1998 budget. 
Mr. President, the conference report on the concurrent budget resolution of the budget for fiscal year 1998 now before the Senate, represents the first major legislative step--in what will be a number of steps--to implement the bipartisan budget agreement announced by President Clinton and the bipartisan congressional leadership almost exactly 1 month ago today. 
As those in this Chamber will understand, but maybe not as obvious to those watching this debate, this conference agreement is the blueprint that will guide the building and enforce the adjustments to legislation throughout the summer. When the legislation is finished following this blueprint, and when it is sent to the President and signed, we will have built a house that is fiscally strong for the future. 
So today's vote on this conference agreement should be identical to the 78 to 22 vote taken in this Chamber just before the Memorial Day recess. And that is as it should be, because the conference agreement is based on the Senate-passed budget resolution and the House-passed budget resolution which both followed the agreed on budget levels of the announced bipartisan budget agreement. In other words the aggregate numbers in the two Chambers' resolutions were almost identical, resulting 
in hardly any need for a conference. 
In fact, it wad initially felt that since both resolutions followed the agreement, there was not even a need or a conference. It was held by our joint leadership that merging the two resolutions--because of the normal differences in House and Senate committees of jurisdiction under the reconciliation instructions--that this could have been done by simply adopting a House amendment to the Senate amendment, a procedure clearly authorized under the Budget Act. However, this procedure would have put us in the posture of possibly having amendments to that House amendment, the leadership concluded we should expedite the process by simply having a conference meeting and avoiding possible amendments. 
So on Tuesday afternoon when the House returned from the Memorial Day 
recess, they appointed conferees and Tuesday evening the conference met. As I indicated, since the two resolutions were almost identical in the numbers, the only issues to conference were related to some procedural reserve fund mechanisms, and nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate, sense-of-the-House, and sense of-the-Congress resolutions. 
Yesterday these minor issue were resolved and last evening the conference agreement and accompanying statement of managers was filed. The House of Representatives just acted on the budget resolution conference agreement by a vote of 327 to 97, almost identical to the vote when it first passed the House on May 20. The House-passed budget resolution passed on a vote of 333 to 99. Today, nearly 90 percent of the House Republicans voted for his conference agreement, and almost two thirds of the House Democrats voted for it. Clearly this is a bipartisan budget agreement as reaffirmed in this vote today in the House. 
And now the Senate is about to follow suit. If you voted for the Senate-passed budget resolution on May 23, then you have no reason not to vote for this conference agreement on June 5. 
For the record, through it is probably unnecessary, I might remind the Senators and those watching what this blueprint for a balanced budget means. It means that when our fiscal house is finished following this blueprint, the Federal deficit, which would have topped $150 billion in 2002 if nothing was done, will be balanced. And if the policies that get us to balance in 2002 are continued unchanged beyond 2002, we will reduce spending over the next 10 years almost $1.1 trillion. 
The blueprint for the balanced budget agreement before us this afternoon means that spending which would have grown at 4.4 percent annually over the next 5 years will now grow at slightly over 3 percent, about the rate of growth in the overall economy. 
The blueprint for the balanced budget agreement means that the size of the Federal Government will decline. Federal spending which today represents 20.8 percent of the economy today, will decline to 18.9 percent in 2002. 
The blueprint for the balanced budget agreement means that the Medicare part A program will remain solvent for nearly a decade and that the spending on all of Medicare that is now projected to grow at nearly 9 percent annually over the next five years, will be reduced to a more manageable growth rate of about 7.5 percent annually. 
The blueprint for the balanced budget agreement means that Federal taxes will be reduced on hard working American families with children and on small business and farms. Taxes will be reduced by $85 billion over the next 5 years, and if these tax cuts are extended over a 10-year period, total tax reductions not exceeding $250 billion will be given to the American public. 
We are going to let them keep their money. It is their money. 
Finally, the blueprint does assume that some additional resources are needed for high priority Federal programs in education, environment, justice, transportation, children's health, work welfare reform, and some safety net programs. But I would remind the blueprint critics that the some $33.6 billion in additional resources spent on these priority programs represent less than 0.37 percent of the total $9.0 trillion in total Federal spending we expect over the next 5 years. 
This is a good blueprint. Like all blueprints, as the building actually begins in the committees of jurisdiction these next few weeks, it will require some adjustments in the actual building phase and from time to time, as has already begun, there will be disputes as to how to read the blueprint. In those cases, I am long with my ranking member and the bipartisan leadership will work with the committee chairman to insure that we are making a good faith effort to stick to the agreement. But today the design is clear and the builders can go to work. 
In closing let me say that the passions of the Federal budget debate lie at the very essence of our free, democratic governmental system. The questions of the role of the Federal Government, how much of our national wealth should be spent on the public good and who should pay for it, are questions that date back to the beginning of this great republic. 
In recent years, however, the obstacles to the Federal budget have been primarily a question of finding a working consensus between the executive and the Congress. Today we have a consensus on this issue. Of course, each of us alone might have designed the plan differently, but then we might not have had a consensus. Yes, I personally think we should have done more in entitlement spending programs that still threaten the foundation of this house we build today, but for today we must do what we can. And I ask you to vote as you did on May 23 and adopt this conference agreement. 
Then we will be one step further on the road to the future of restoring the American dream for the young people of our country. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, In the past few months my Democratic colleagues have attempted to paint the picture of a national emergency regarding unfilled vacancies in the Federal courts. We hear talk of a judicial crisis, of justice suffering at the hands of overworked and over-burdened judges, and of the Senate Judiciary Committee creating this situation out of political motivation. A recent example is an article in the Washington Post which interviewed only one Texas district judge who described how he was plowed under with work ever since Congress decided to get tough on drug smuggling and illegal immigration. And because his district has three open seats, he can't keep up with the caseload. Unfortunately this one judge has been used in an attempt to reflect some kind of a national crisis. Maybe some clarifying remarks regarding the central issues of this article will shed some light on this matter. 
As the chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I sent a comprehensive questionnaire to article III judges last year. This extensive judicial survey addressed the very concerns raised by the May 15 article in the Washington Post. The judge in question was kind enough to respond to the questionnaire, as were most of his colleagues. As a matter of fact, 12 out of 17 active judges over 70 percent of the southern district of Texas furnished my subcommittee with detailed replies. Of those 12 judges, only 2 other judges complained of an unmanageable caseload and of a growing backlog. That means that 9 out of 12 judges found their caseloads to be manageable. As a matter of fact, one judge even stated that: `there is absolutely no backlog whatsoever.' 
Of the three judges who did complain of not being able to keep up with their workload, one had been on the bench less then 2 years, and the other two were the only two judges in the southern district involved in extensive outside work activities beyond occasional speaking engagements. You would think that before judges complain about needing more help, they would be devoting 100 percent of their working time and energy to their caseloads. Unfortunately, it appears that is not the case here. 
One must also keep in mind the organizational set-up of the district in question. The southern district has the highest number of judges in all of Texas, one of the highest in the Nation for that matter. Right now a total of over 30 active judges, senior judges, and magistrate judges are handling cases in that district. All but three of the active judges last year found their caseloads were manageable. Therefore, when one throws statistics and numbers around, we must be careful how to interpret those figures. For example, we must factor in the number of cases which are handled by staff attorneys. Prisoner petitions, for example, are rarely handled by a judge, but are routinely included in caseload statistics. As another Texas judge has told me, once prisoner petitions are factored out, the southern district's docket has actually decreased, not increased over the last 10 years. In addition, numerous judges have contacted me and praised the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act as having had a substantial and dramatic impact on the number of prisoner filings and as having caused that number to decrease enormously. I have asked the judge in question for more information on these issues. 
We must also keep in mind that many senior judges are hearing cases. In the southern district of Texas there are at least three senior judges. In order to be certified, a senior judge must carry, at a minimum, a 25 percent caseload. And many senior judges maintain a full caseload. Yet, senior judges are not factored into the weighted caseload statistics when ascertaining whether new judges are needed. In other words, senior judges are not even counted, even though they make considerable contributions. Again, beware of the numbers you read in the paper. 
As a matter of fact, nationally there are 48 seniors judges certified at 25 percent workload, with another 86 senior judges who are doing at a minimum at 25 percent workload. In addition, there are 206 senior judges certified at a 50 percent or more workload. Now lets add up the numbers: if you take 25 percent of the 48 senior judges, 25 percent of the additional 85 senior judges, and 50 percent of the 206 senior judges, you would have 136 full time judges, which more than makes up for the 100 or so vacancies nationwide. Now, while I would agree that there may be pockets of districts around the country that need some help, the overwhelming majority of the judges in the district named by the Washington Post, and across the Nation for that matter, are working diligently to serve justice and are doing so with a manageable caseload and without a backlog.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a very important amendment. This amendment applies the provisions of this bill, S. 4, to Congress. 
As most Senators know, I pushed for the adoption of the original Congressional Accountability Act for many years before it was enacted. Finally, in the last Congress, with my sponsorship, we enacted the Congressional Accountability Act into law. With this act we said that we in Congress are no better than the business men and women in our States. We are not different and we, too, must live under the laws that we pass. We no longer sit in Washington and look down upon the people and tell them how to run their businesses. This is a democracy, and therefore we make laws for the people, and we, too, are the people. 
This amendment is offered for the same purpose. It is a continuation of the spirit and intent of the Congressional Accountability Act. 
In the Federalist Papers, Federalist 57, James Madison wrote that: 
[Members of Congress] can make no law which will not have its full operation on themselves and their friends, as well as on the great mass of society . . . it creates between them that communion of interests and sympathy of sentiments of which few governments have furnished examples, but without which every government degenerates into tyranny. 
The bill before us gives important options to the private workplace that Government--with exceptions including Congress--has enjoyed for years. It is only fair that if these options--compensatory time, bi-weekly schedules and flextime--apply to the private sector, then they must also apply to Congress. A rationale of the Congressional Accountability Act was that by requiring us to live under the same laws as the private sector, we will understand the challenges created by the laws that we pass. If we apply compensatory time, bi-weekly schedules and flextime to the private sector, we must also apply it to Congress. Otherwise, we will not get an accurate understanding of what our labor laws do to our businesses and workers. 
The language in this amendment is carefully crafted to complement the Congressional Accountability Act. The drafting of this language was a long and careful process. I drafted it in consultation with the Office of Compliance and the Senate Employment Counsel. I thank both of these offices for their efforts to craft this language and make it the most effective and fair language possible. 
I ask my colleagues to support this amendment and to join me once again in saying that we are not above the laws that we make. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on May 23, I introduced legislation designed to maintain rural communities' access to hospital care. 
Today many rural Americans live in fear that they may lose access to local and regional hospital care. In these rural areas, where serious accidents, often related to farm equipment, are a constant threat. Access to an emergency care hospital within 35 miles can mean the difference between life and death. The ability to be referred to a major regional hospital for more specialized care can be of like importance. Congress must recognize the special needs of rural America and work to meet them. This bill is a step in the right direction. 
The Rural Health Care Protection Act of 1997 focuses on providing support of sole community hospitals and rural referral centers. Sole community hospitals [SCH's] are hospitals located at least 35 miles from other hospitals and are often the sole source of emergency care or impatient services in their areas. There are currently 728 SCH's in 46 States. There are 11 in my home State of Iowa. Rural referral centers [RRC's] are relatively large and specialized rural hospitals which receive referrals from community hospitals throughout a region. There are currently 142 RRC's in 39 States, including 5 in Iowa. 
This legislation contains four proposals designed to help keep these care centers operating. First, the act would give SCH's the option of choosing an updated fiscal year 1994-95 base year for Medicare funding instead of the outdated based years which they must currently use. Second, the act would permanently grandfather as an RRC any hospital that has previously qualified as an RRC. Third, the act would exempt the RRC's from the statewide rural wage index threshold for geographic reclassification. Finally, the bill would allow rural hospitals that meet the reclassification criteria to be reclassified as urban hospitals for purposes of disproportionate share hospital [DSH] payment adjustments. 
This bill would help ensure that rural Americans maintain access to these essential care centers. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support of this measures.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come before you today to submit a resolution which would designate the week beginning November 23, 1997, and the week beginning November 22, 1998, as `National Family Week.' This legislation has been passed in each Congress and signed into public law every year since 1976. I am pleased to be able to contribute to this longstanding tradition, of recognizing the importance of family, by again introducing this legislation. 
As we all know, the family is the most basic element of our society, and the tie that binds us to one another. It is the strength of any free and orderly society and it is appropriate to honor this unit as being essential to the well-being of the United States. 
Since Thanksgiving falls during both of these weeks, we will be paying homage to what we as a nation already know--the strength of the family provides the support through which we as individuals and a nation thrive. Therefore it is particularly suitable to pause during this special week in recognition of the celebrations and activities of the family which bring us closer together. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of two very important bills being offered by my colleague on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, Senator Harry Reid. The legislation we are introducing today will encourage more of our nation's physicians to specialize in geriatric medicine. As our population continues to age and with the impending retirement of the baby boomers, the need for trained geriatricians will be great. In my home State of Iowa, 15 percent of the population is over 65 with the third largest percentage of elderly in the Nation. 
The incentives for residents to choose geriatrics as a specialty are limited. The financial rewards are fewer than most other specialties. In addition, patients require more time and attention because they typically have a multitude of health problems. With the cost of education so high, many residents face enormous debt when they complete medical school. Institutions have trouble attracting students to specialize in geriatric medicine due to the lack of financial incentives. 
The Geriatricians Loan Forgiveness Act of 1997 will provide help to residents. This bill gives the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS] the authority to forgive up to $20,000 of loans under the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program on behalf of a resident who completes the required 1 year fellowship to become a geriatrician. The maximum amount of residents eligible is 400. 
The other bill I am cosponsoring today is the Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act of 1997. We spent nearly $7 billion last year on graduate medical education under the Medicare Program. Yet, only 200 of the over 100,000 residency and fellowship positions funded by Medicare are in geriatric medicine. This does not make sense. Medicare is a program for seniors. Therefore, we should be supporting physicians who specialize in geriatrics. 
The Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act has two provisions to encourage academic medical centers to train physicians in geriatrics under the Medicare graduate medical education [GME] program. The first provision provides for an adjustment in a hospital's count of primary care residents to allow each resident enrolled in an approved medical residency or fellowship program in geriatric medicine to be counted as two full-time equivalent primary care residents for the 1-year period necessary to be certified in geriatric medicine. A limit is placed on the number of residents enrolled each year to control the cost. No more than 400 fellows nationwide can be eligible in any given year. This provision will encourage institutions to train more geriatricians using Medicare funds. 
The second provision is budget neutral. It directs the Secretary of DHHS to establish five geriatric medicine training consortium demonstration projects nationwide. The demonstration will allow current Medicare GME funds to be distributed to a consortium consisting of a teaching hospital, one or more skilled nursing facilities, and one or more ambulatory care or community-based facilities to train residents in geriatrics. This provision could be beneficial to rural areas and other areas not served by an academic medical center. 
I applaud Senator Reid for his efforts to provide our Nation's elderly with qualified trained geriatricians. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join Senator Reid and me in support of these legislative initiatives.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator Breaux, to introduce the Medicare Beneficiary Information Act of 1997. Medicare is a Federal program paid for with taxpayer dollars. Therefore, Congress has the duty and obligation to ensure beneficiaries have access to necessary information to select an appropriate health plan for their individual health care needs. 
This legislation is based upon many of the recommendations made to members of the Senate Special Committee on Aging at a hearing we held on April 10, 1997. This bill will improve competition among Medicare health plans and provide Medicare beneficiaries with the useful information they need to make an informed choice when selecting a health plan. Good, reliable information that allows consumers to select among competing options is essential for any market to work. The health care market is no exception. Under Medicare, accurate, widely-available comparative information does not exist. The Medicare Beneficiary Information Act of 1997 addresses this problem by including the following provisions: 
While beneficiaries now have to call all the health plans in their area, wait for the marketing materials to come, and then try and compare all the different brochures with no standard terminology required, this bill instructs the Secretary to develop comparison charts for each Medicare HMO market and for Medicare Select plans. The Secretary has discretion to utilize existing mechanisms in place, such as regional Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] offices and Insurance Counseling Assistance [ICA's] programs, to develop and distribute these charts. 
Comparison charts would be distributed by Medicare health plans in their marketing materials and at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter. In addition, the charts would be available upon request through HCFA. The charts would help beneficiaries understand the difference between the HMO's in their market. The charts would also contain a description of standard fee-for-service Medicare, so beneficiaries have a reference point. 
The charts will tell beneficiaries about, for example, the health plans' additional benefits; additional premiums; out-of-pocket expenses; disenrollment rates, as recommended by the General Accounting Office at the Aging Committee hearing; appeal rates, reversed and denied; coverage for out-of-area services. 
The bill also requires plans to inform beneficiaries about their rights and responsibilities using understandable, standard terminology regarding benefits; appeals and grievance procedures; restrictions on payments for services not provided by the plan; out-of-area coverage; coverage of emergency services and urgently needed care; coverage of out-of-network services; and any other rights the Secretary determines to be helpful to beneficiaries. 
These provisions are also included in the bill I introduced on May 6, entitled the 
`Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act of 1997,' or S. 701. Senator Breaux and I believe that providing Medicare beneficiaries with proper information to select the health plan that best meets their individual health care needs is so important, we decided to introduce this free-standing bill. Increasing choices within the Medicare program has strong bipartisan support, but this approach is meaningless if beneficiaries cannot make an informed choice. Our bill can be enacted and implemented quickly. HCFA is already collecting this data and plans to start distributing comparative information this summer through the Internet. However, Internet access is not enough. We need to provide this information in written form and through Medicare counseling programs as well. Medicare beneficiaries, as research has shown, prefer reviewing written materials and having someone with which to talk. Our bill would enable beneficiaries to obtain a user-friendly chart utilizing existing Medicare counseling programs, local Medicare offices and through health plans participating in the Medicare program.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on the plan to pump up the Pentagon budget. This resolution jacks it up by $2.6 billion in budget authority. 
Last year, by comparison, we were staring at a $10 to $12 billion increase in the defense budget. 
I was very much opposed to such a large increase and did everything I could to block it all the way through the process. In the end, I failed. 
This year's proposed defense add-on of $2.6 billion is relatively modest. 
Mr. President, I do not intend to offer an amendment to kill the $2.6 billion add-on. 
I know defense is a top priority in the agreement and the defense number constitutes a carefully crafted consensus. Like last year, however, I still think we should stick with the President's request. 
The $265 billion requested by the President for defense is plenty to maintain a strong national defense--if the money is spent right. Unfortunately, that's not what happens. Some of it will be wasted. 
The Pentagon is like a ravenous monster that has an insatiable appetite for money. I am afraid the $2.6 billion add-on will be frittered away on cold war relics. 
Mr. President, I think we need to give the Pentagon some strict guidance about how the extra money may be spent. The Budget Committee could do it. The Armed Services Committee could do it. Or the Appropriations Committee could do it. Somebody needs to do it. 
The language should stipulate that the extra money be used exclusively to maintain the force structure and combat readiness. Otherwise, the Pentagon bureaucrats are going to rob the readiness accounts to pay for modernization. 
In recent years, DOD has consistently promised to pay for modernization with savings derived from lower infrastructure costs. But the promised savings have never materialized. So they rob the readiness accounts to get the money. We should not let that happen. 
Mr. President, the highly touted Quadrennial Defense Review or QDR will not solve this problem. The QDR is just a smoke screen for the status quo. It's another cover for robbing the readiness accounts to pay for modernization. The QDR is simply a repeat of the Bottom-Up Review. 
They douse the cold war programs with perfume to make them smell better, but it is still the same old stuff. We still have cold war programs hooked up to a post-cold war budget. This is a recipe for disaster. 
The QDR tells us to keep spending money on all the cold war relics--like the F-22 fighter. The F-22 is an excellent case in point. The F-22 was designed to defeat a Soviet military threat that is now ancient history. And it's cost is spinnning out of control. 
In 1991, we were told that we could buy 750 F-22's for $58 billion. Now we are told that far fewer F-22's will cost $6 billion more. The quantity drops by 40 percent and the price goes up by 10 percent. That's the Pentagon way. 
Four hundred thirty-eight F-22's are now estimated to cost $64 billion total, and production hasn't even started yet. If current trends continue, the Air Force will be lucky to get 200 F-22's for $100 billion. 
Mr. President, I think the F-22 is the threat. The F-22 has the potential for ruining the Air Force. It will eat away at Air Force fighter muscle and will totally demolish plans to modernize the fighter force. 
With the F-22, the Air Force will be lucky to have 2 or 3 wings--total, versus its force of 20 wings today. During the Reagan years, we actually had 40 wings and planned for more. 
Lockheed Martin CEO Norman Augustine put this problem in perspective in his book `The Defense Revolution.' 
I would like to quote from his book. He is an authority. He should know. This is what Mr. Augustine said: 
If the cost of tactical aircraft continues to increase as it has since the World War I Spad [airplane], a projection of the history of the defense budget over the past century leads to the calculation that in the year 2054 the entire U.S. defense budget will purchase exactly one aircraft. 
The F-22 is a prime candidate for fulfilling Mr. Augustine's prophecy. 
Mr. President, we need to reverse this trend. We should make sure the extra money is used to maintain combat readiness. The extra money should be used to buy more training, fuel, spare parts, and maintenance. And that's it. 
Mr. President, we need to take some drastic action. The centerpiece of Mr. Cohen's QDR is the plan to retain a capability to fight two major regional conflicts or MRC's simultaneously. If we fail to protect readiness and force structure, Mr. Cohen's two MRC's will be nothing but a pipe dream. 
Mr. President, I hope my colleagues on the defense committees will find a way to strike a better balance between readiness and modernization. 
We must put well-trained, combat-ready troops ahead of obsolete programs. 
That is the real choice. It is the only choice. 
Mr. President, when I look at this budget agreement, I find myself playing Hamlet. I go back and forth, between all the good things, and all the bad things. And then I agonize over which way to go. To agree or not to agree. That is the question. 
Usually when the leaders of the two parties get together on a budget agreement, it ends up being bad news. It means spending goes up for programs favored by each side. It is like a rising tide lifting all boats. And then the deficit is made to look OK. A little fairy dust produces a sudden windfall of revenues. This time it happens to be 225 billion dollars' worth. 
I think back to the Rose Garden Budget in 1984 under President Reagan. And, the Andrews Air Force Base agreement in 1990. They were similar. 
`Rising Tide' agreements do two things. First, all the sacred cows get more money than they should. Second, accountability for those programs goes out the widow. Desperately needed reforms do not take place. 
In 1984, we should have frozen the defense budget and demanded reforms. Instead we looked the other way. The freeze did not occur until the next year--with my amendment--and the reforms did not take place until 3 years later--with Nunn-Goldwater and the Packard Commission. By that time, we had already poured lots of money down a rathole. 
In addition, with rising tide agreements, the budget enforcements we put in place are then violated. We saw that in 1990, when we gave Gramm-Rudman a fix. The only thing we fixed in that budget was the ability to overtax and overspend. Now, we're seeing another enforcement violated to accommodate the rising tide--and that's Exon-Grassley. If we violated budget enforcement before, why should we believe it won't happen again? 
Meanwhile, in this budget, the absence of Medicare reform is deafening. A colossal structural nightmare is facing us just 15 years down the road. Especially in Medicare. Long-term reform is needed. Does this budget address that? No. 
And the sacred cows? Two examples. One supported by my side of the aisle, another by the other side. 
The cold war is over. But we need to spend an extra $2.6 billion this year for a defense budget that's still geared toward fighting the cold war. The same cold war that disappeared 10 years ago. 
What the Pentagon should not do--but will do with this money--is buy a bunch of cold war relics, like the F-22 fighter. That money should be going into the readiness and training accounts. But it won't be. Because politics is more powerful than commonsense. 
The Quadrennial Defense Review is simply a repeat of the Bottom-Up Review. It's a smokescreen to maintain the status quo, to plan for an obsolete war. Meanwhile, this is the same defense budget with 50 billion dollars' worth of unmatched disbursements, which cannot pass an audit, and whose financial records are in absolute chaos. We do not know what anything costs. It is hard to make rational decisions on bad information. It is a budget crying out for reform. 
But that is OK. Because the other side of the aisle also has a few sacred cows crying out for reform. But we'll pump those up, too. Take AmeriCorps. Cannot pass an audit. Cannot even be audited. No accountability. In bad need of reform. We were shelling out $27,000 per volunteer. That is crazy. 
So, last year we froze AmeriCorps and pushed for reforms. They have been promised, but not yet delivered. But this agreement would jeopardize reform and accountability at AmeriCorps. Instead of a freeze, plus reforms, this program will get an extra three-quarters of a billion dollars, plus no incentive to implement the promised reforms. And that hurts the efforts of many of us who have tried to save this program, but make sure the taxpayers are getting their money's worth. 
Finally, there is the matter of the deficits. Under this agreement, they go up, and then they fall off the table. In other words, the only progress on deficit reduction comes in the last 2 years. This reflects that phenomenon I call the narcotic of optimism. We're still addicted to it. It is simply not realistic. But it sure feels good. 
So that is a mountain of reasons why this agreement is bad. The reasons on the good side are not as impressive-sounding. But there are a couple of reasons. 
First, even though the tide is rising, it does not mean we cannot push even harder for reforms, to make sure they take hold. We desperately need long-term Medicare reform. We have a responsibility to provide it. We cannot duck it. If it takes a bipartisan commission instead of a budget agreement, so be it. 
But the most powerful reason, in my mind, in favor of this agreement, is that it is a bipartisan agreement of the leaders. When's the last time we saw that in this town? This is a first step, and only a first step. But it represents clearing a major, major hurdle--which was a lack of bipartisan cooperation. The importance of that accomplishment cannot be underestimated. And the desire of the American people to have us working together instead of fighting all the time also cannot be underestimated. 
And so that means, even though I have a mountain of reasons to oppose this agreement, and even though the reasons for supporting it are the size of a mouse by comparison, it is a mouse that roars for us to take the first step. 
And if we take that step, it means we are all the more obliged to pursue reforms in the meantime, and make sure we stick to the enforcement measures. 
And so, Mr. President, I think ultimately the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, and the other leaders on both sides of the aisle are to be commended for taking a positive, yet very difficult first step toward addressing our fiscal problems. Even though I might disagree with much of this agreement, I look forward to supporting it, and then appealing to my colleagues over the next 5 years to keep us on track for two things: a balanced budget, and much needed program reforms.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, recently I spoke about the annual certification process on drug cooperation. I wanted to follow up on those remarks. As I noted then, I believe it is important to address some of the myths that have grown up around certification. I also believe that it is important to put on record why we need to keep this process. 
One of the reasons often advanced for doing away with the certification process is that it just makes administrations lie. 
Now, in the first place, I don't believe that this is true. But even if it were, I do not see changing a valid oversight requirement by Congress on the premise that compliance makes liars out of the administration. It seems to me that if there is a law and the administration isn't being honest, then you take steps to hold it responsible. You don't shrug your shoulders and throw away the law. Where would we be if we did that routinely? We might as well forget about oversight. We might as well legalize lying. 
Like many of my colleagues, I have had problems with the executive branch. I am aware of misconduct, misfeasance, and downright lying by executive branch agencies and agents. 
But I do not believe that simple differences of opinion or interpretation necessarily constitute lying. It is even possible to disagree over policy without calling someone a liar for disagreeing. Misguided perhaps. 
It is possible, then, that the administration and Congress might disagree over a particular certification decision without jumping to conclusions about motive. It is also possible to have such differences without concluding that the only proper recourse is to scrap oversight efforts. Accountability is essential to our political process. This holds true even when there are serious disagreements about outcomes and procedures. 
The recent certification decisions on Mexico and Colombia are cases in point. This last March 1, the President decided to again decertify Colombia. At the same time, he decided to fully certify Mexico. Both decisions caused concern in Congress. It is important to understand that there were lots of different concerns. Additionally, many of these concerns arose from contradictory opinions. 
Some felt that if Colombia was decertified Mexico should have been. Others believed that if Mexico was certified then Colombia should have been. Still others believed that both should have gotten national interest waivers. Because none of these views were vindicated in the actual decision, many have drawn the conclusion that certification didn't work. Or they have concluded the administration lied. The answer in either case seems to be, `dump certification.' 
As I have already said, I don't think this is the right course. I believe the view is wrong on both substance and process. 
In the first place, when we in Congress created the certification process, we did not create a pass/fail system. Nor did we create a system of shared outcomes. That is, we created a process that evaluated each country on its own merits in fighting drugs. Just like we don't give everyone in school the same grade if they performed differently, we don't base certification decisions on group behavior. We designed the process to permit nuanced decisions. We recognized the need to draw conclusions based not on single issues or purely momentary situations. 
At the same time, we realized that without the push of law the administration, any administration, would likely not have made drugs a major foreign policy concern. In that sense, Congress had a healthy incredulity of administration motives. I remind my colleagues that it was a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-controlled Senate that first passed certification during the tenure of a Republican President. We had a bipartisan wariness of the executive branch. It is, after all, the business of Congress to give administrations heck from time to time. 
Initially, the administration resisted certification. It chose not to apply the standards in the law with any vigor. Indeed, the first countries to get decertified were all soft targets. Countries like Burma, Iran, and Syria. 
These were countries we already disliked and with whom we had only limited dealings. Initially, no serious countries got decertified. Because of this history, a certain cynicism grew up around certification. There is also today an evident impatience with what is and must be a complex decision-making process. 
That process has been around for 10 years. As with other cases, the longer the requirement has been on the books and the more Congress has insisted it be taken seriously, the more used and useful it has become. The process has gathered momentum. Last year, in fact, I asked the Congressional Research Service to review the merits of the certification process. That review, which is still available, makes clear how the certification process has matured and proved effective. 
In the past several years, in fact, the list of countries decertified or given a national interest waiver has grown to include some real countries. Such countries as Nigeria, Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Pakistan. Countries with which we have a wide variety of interests apart from drugs. Just a few years ago, no one in Congress believed that any administration would ever decertify Colombia. Certainly there was a lot of sentiment in Congress that believed the evidence justified decertification. But the conviction was that it wouldn't happen. It did. 
Not only has the standard been applied with more rigor, it has also encouraged greater cooperation from certified countries. All in all, more countries now take as a given that drug control must be an important element in their thinking. 
That list includes the United States. To voluntarily choose to abandon such a tool out of a passing frustration is not very sound policy. 
But, as the list of affected countries has grown to include more significant U.S. partners, the more controversial certification has become. This was to be expected. When Burma squawked, few in this country cared. Few people cared internationally. The military rulers of Burma had few friends. With Colombia affected and Mexico implicated, however, the noise level has gone up considerably. Both here and abroad. 
To me, this indicates that certification is working. As I noted in an earlier statement, the fact that countries such as Colombia are complaining about our process is no sufficient reason to change it, much less throw it overboard. 
Conversely, the fact that there was a difference of opinion on whether to certify Mexico or not, is also no sufficient reason to scuttle the boat.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to address a problem of critical importance to this country: The dismal level of individual retirement savings. This measure would encourage retirement savings by initiating an education project and creating a national summit on retirement savings. 
Before I go any further let me read you some statistics: 
Our national net savings fell from 7.1 to 1.8 percent from the 1970's to the 1990's. On an individual level, this means that individuals may not be able to retire when they desire with the lifestyle that they desire. 
In a 1994 survey by the Employee Benefits Research Institute [EBRI]: 14 percent of workers who were saving for their retirement did not know much they had saved, and 13 percent saved less than $1,000. 
In another survey by Merrill Lynch of workers in their forties and early fifties, savings levels had dropped by 6 percent from 1988 to 1994. 
According to the 1996 Retirement Confidence Survey released earlier this year by the EBRI: Only one-third of American workers have calculated how much money they will need to have saved by retirement in order to live comfortably; of the workers that have tried to determine how much money they should be saving, only one-third felt very confident that they had determined an accurate figure; when asked how much they calculated that they would need to save, 42 percent could not give an amount; and 
less than 20 percent had a specific number with which to work. 
So, the problem is twofold: There is a lack of adequate retirement savings, and Americans workers do not understand the importance of determining how much money they should be saving in order to retire comfortably. The Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, held its first hearing on meeting the challenges of the retiring baby boom generation. At that hearing, witness after witness stressed the need to start a national public education campaign. This downward trend in savings couldn't be happending at a worse time, given the retirement of the first wave of baby boomers is in just over 10 years. When baby boomers retire we will be unable to sustain, as presently structured, the programs on which the elderly rely for their health and income security. Educating the public about the necessity to save for their retirement is vital. That is why I am introducing the Savings Are Vital to Everyone's Retirement, or SAVER, Act of 1997. 
The SAVER Act would direct the Department of Labor to maintain an ongoing retirement savings education program. This program would include public service announcements, public meetings, the creation and dissemination of educational materials, and establish a site on the Internet. This project will give the American people the information they need, in terms they can understand, to develop retirement savings goals and a plan to achieve those goals. The information will include the tools necessary for individuals to cacluate how much an individual will need to save. Just a important, this educational effort will also focus on how employers can establish different retirement savings arrangements for their employees. 
My legislation will also convene a national summit on retirement savings. The summit will bring together in one forum experts in the field of employee benefits and retirement savings, leaders of Government, and interested parties from the private sector and the general public. By bringing these delegates together we hope to advance the public's knowledge and understanding of the need to put money away for retirement, urge American workers to set aside adequate funds, and identify the impediments for small employers in setting up retirement savings arrangements for their employees. 
I want to commend Congressmen Harris Fawell and Donald Payne, chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Employee-Employer Relations of the Education and Workforce Committee, for their leadership. The House legislation, H.R. 1377, has bipartisan support with over 30 cosponsors across the political spectrum. In addition the bill is endorsed by the several organizations including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the American Association of Retired Persons. 
Today's workers need to have confidence and feel good about their retirement and quality of life. One of the most important things Government can do is encourage individuals to acquire the knowledge that will help them achieve a secure retirement. The SAVER Act is by no means a solution to the problem of inadequate retirement savings, but it is a critical first step to facing the future demographic tidalwave.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have spoken many times in recent months on my concerns for the growing threat to our kids from drug use. All of our early warning systems are sounding the alarm. All our major national reviews of drug trends indicate the emerging pattern. What they show is that month by month, day by day, minute by minute, drug use among our young people is on the rise. They also make clear that attitudes among young people about the dangers of drugs are changing--for the worse. More and more kids, some as young as 10 and 11, are seeing drug use as OK, as no big deal. 
Let's stop for a minute and reflect on just what these facts mean. For those of us who remember how the last drug epidemic in this country got started, the present trend is truly disturbing. Think for a moment on what happened and how it happened. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, we saw the streets of our inner cities become battlegrounds. We saw many of our communities, our schools our public and private spaces overwhelmed with violence, addiction, and abuse. We saw families destroyed and individual lives shattered. The problem became so serious that the public demanded action. The Congress responded with comprehensive drug legislation in 1986 and 1988. We supported massive increases in public funding to fight back. We still do. To the tune of some $16 billion annually at the Federal level alone. 
That problem, the one we spend all this money on, began with our kids. It began because we as a country allowed people to sell us on the idea that drugs were OK. We bought the idea that individuals could use dangerous drugs responsibly. 
The consequence was the drug epidemic of the 1970's and 1980's. An epidemic whose long-term effects we are still coping with. Let's remind ourselves who the principal audience was that was listening to all the talk about responsible drug use. It was kids. It was the baby boom generation in their teens who heard the message and took it to heart. It was a generation of young people who bought the message. It did not take them long to translate the idea that they could use drugs responsibility into the notion that they had a responsibility to use drugs. 
As a result, today, a large percentage of baby boomers have tried drugs. Many of those are today's drug addicts and dealers. Many of them are today's parents who feel disarmed in talking to their own kids about drug use. 
Today, we are on the verge of making the same mistake again. After years of progress in reducing drug use among kids, it is this very population that is at risk. Once again, we are seeing the glorification of drug use. Increasingly the music our kids are listening to conveys a drugs-are-okay message. The normalization of drug use is creeping back into movies, advertising, and TV. And who do you think is listening? The answer is in the numbers. 
Teenage drug use is now in its fifth year of increases. And the age of onset of use is dropping. Our last epidemic started with 16 and 17 year olds. Today's `at-risk' population, the age of onset, is 12 and 13 year olds. 
One of the major reasons for this is that we have lost our message. We have in recent years been inconsistent. And, we are seeing a more sophisticated effort by some to once again promote the idea that drug use is okay. And they are targeting our young people. 
Nothing brings this home better than an item in the Washington Post on 27 April.

Mr. GRASSLEY. The article is based on a letter this young woman wrote to her teacher. She felt compelled to write following a lecture to her class by what was billed as a former drug addict. As she says, she expected to hear about the dangers of drug use. What she and the class got, however, was very different. 
In this case, a very clean-cut looking young man, identified as a former addict, spoke. While the teacher was present, the speaker evidently did talk about the problems of his personal drug use. Once the teacher left the room, though, the message changed. Instead of an anti-message, the lecture became a mini-course on drugs, drug use, and how to make a killing selling drugs. Among the things the speaker passed on was a recipe for a stronger form of cocaine. The speaker extolled the virtues of being stoned. He `raved' about the incredible amounts of money to be made peddling drugs. He left the class with the advice that since no one could drug test for alcohol, that it was okay to drink. 
The teacher in this particular class, based on negative feedback, has decided not to leave classes alone with future guest speakers. Unfortunately, as the young woman who wrote about this incident notes, the damage is done. 
Mr. President, if you, or any of my colleagues, have not yet read this letter, I encourage you to do so. The story that it tells is very poignant, and very disturbing. We know that there is a growing acceptance of drug use among our children. We can see the reports and the story they tell. But what we don't always appreciate is why. 
As this letter makes clear, the drugs-are-okay message is back. I would hope that this lecture by this individual was an accident and a one-time occurrence. But I am concerned that it is representative of a growing effort to influence the young. His talk apparently had everything but free samples. As the author of this letter tells us, `. . . the way in which he spoke of drugs made them seem appealing and beneficial.' This type of message is not isolated. 
From music to videos to movies and advertisement, we are seeing efforts once again to glamorize drugs. We have seen initiatives in several states to push drug legalization under various disguises. Just recently a micro-brewery in Maryland has begun to market a beer made with marijuana seeds under the title `Hempen.' 
Not too long ago some of our major fashion industry folks began to use models with the `Heroin Chic' look. We are seeing opinion leaders and members of our cultural elite portray drug use as simply a personal choice that is harmless and benign. Many of these individuals act as if the only issue is for responsible adults to decide for themselves. They speak as if it is only adults that we need to think about. This, however, is not in fact the case. 
If you do not believe this, talk to parents. Talk to teachers. Talk to the health and law enforcement professionals who daily see the consequences. Visit the emergency room of your local hospital and talk to the doctors and nurses who see every day the effects of drug use. 
Go to a treatment center and sit and talk to some of the patients, listen to their stories of how drug use has destroyed their lives, their families. 
But most important, listen to what kids are telling us about what is happening in their schools. To their friends. Ask them where they get their information, and who they listen to. If this letter tells us anything, it is that we must listen to our kids, if for no other reason so we know whom they are listening to. Above all, we need to do a better job at delivering a clear, consistent, no-use message to our kids. 
As we move into the appropriations cycle, we need to keep that need firmly in mind. We cannot repeat the mistake that we made in the 1960's and 1970's. Last time we had a drug epidemic we could claim ignorance. We don't have any excuses if we let it happen again.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the House is in the process of taking steps to alter fundamentally the annual certification process for drugs. In addition, there have been a number of statements in the press and elsewhere by Members of Congress and others on problems with certification. Individuals in the Administration, including the Drug Czar, have also broached the idea of change. I agree that some form of strengthening of the certification process is needed. Indeed, I offered my `Three Strikes and you're out' bill last year with the idea of making the certification process tougher. I also suggested some fixes this last February in the debate over Mexico. But I also think that it is important to take a hard look at what the certification process is before we tinker with it. 
The recent discussion of the certification process is born out of frustration over the decision on Mexico. I share some of these concerns and the frustration. But the present effort is little more than an attempt to water down congressional oversight of US narcotics policy. It does so in the name of flexibility. It does so/so that we won't be too hard on our international partners. I believe this approach is wrong. And I will vigorously oppose efforts to short change the public's interest in upholding tough standards for certification. 
Since much of the discussion in recent weeks on certification is based on a series of myths about it, I think it is useful to review some of these misconceptions. 
The principal myth is that the certification process unfairly brands other countries for drug supply problems. It also maintains that this is unfair while the United States does nothing to deal with its demand problem. 
There are several things wrong with this view. First, even if the United States did nothing about demand, we have a right and an obligation to do something about supply. This is especially true since most of the dangerous, illegal drugs used in this country are produced overseas. These drugs are then smuggled into the United States, often with the collusion of public officials in other countries. 
Our right to stop this flow stems from the fact that we and virtually every other country in the world are signatories of international agreements. These agreements bind us and them to action to stop drug production, trafficking, and money laundering. Moreover, most of these same countries--including the ones we certify--have made drug production, trafficking, and money laundering illegal under their own laws. And, many of these countries have bilateral agreements with the United States that commit them to take meaningful action against drugs. Thus, countries are bound to act in terms of international law. They are committed to binding agreements with the United States. And they have obligations in terms of their own domestic legal frameworks. 
It is neither unfair nor presumptuous for the United States to expect other countries to abide by laws and commitments that they have made. Nor are we being a busybody or arbitrary when we expect and require countries to uphold appropriate international standards of conduct. Indeed, it is only by insisting that such principles of conduct be observed that we have any hope of sustaining respect for and observance of international law. This is understood when it comes to judging other countries on their compliance with a host of other international canons. 
After all, we expect countries to observe principles governing human rights, sound environmental practices, fair trade, counterterrorism, and intellectual property rights, to name but a few. The United States has been a leader in promoting respect for these areas of concern. 
Congress has passed a host of certification requirements regarding them. In part, this is because we recognize that failure to uphold these principles in the face of willful or negligent disregard is to abandon the idea of standards altogether. And it makes at least as much sense to hold other countries responsible for trafficking in dangerous drugs as it does to scold them for trafficking in pirated CD's. 
As I said, we also have an obligation to uphold these standards. Our obligation is to the American people and to the policies we promote in their interest. Protection the citizens of this country from enemies, foreign and domestic, is one of our most important responsibilities. Stopping dangerous drugs coming to this country from abroad falls squarely into this category. 
If we are prepared to enforce sanctions for violations of intellectual property rights, it is hardly excessive to judge cooperation by other countries to stop the flow of illegal drugs. After all, not one American has died from Chinese counterfeit CDs. China White heroin, on the other hand, has killed countless of our fellow citizens and ruined the lives of tens of thousands more. This points up our obligation to uphold international standards of conduct. 
Somehow, though, when it comes to the drug issue, many seem to believe that expecting good conduct is wrong. They seem to hold to the notion that it is unfair. They act as if it is unkind to expect countries to comply with international law, solemn agreements, and their own legal requirements. 
Some seem to believe that it is outrageous that we also take steps to protect our national interest. Now, since many of the people who voice this latter concern are the leaders of drug producing and transit countries, we can take their complaints with a grain of salt. But the domestic critics are a different matter. To them, all I have to say is that it would be irresponsible for the United States to put the concerns and interests of other countries before those of the American people. Period. 
As I said, we would be justified in certifying other countries on drug cooperation even if we did nothing at home. But we in fact do a great deal. Out of a $16 billion counter-drug budget, less than 10 percent is spent on actions outside the United States. 
Over 90 percent is devoted to domestic programs, many of these efforts to control demand. And this is just at the Federal level. States, local communities, and private organizations spend this much and a great deal more on demand reduction. Thus, we spend annually more than $32 billion to deal with our demand problem. There is not another country in the world that devotes such resources to the problem at home. 
I remind my colleagues and the critics of the certification process that the standard for certification is not unconditional success. This is true whether we are talking about Mexico or California. To get a passing grade on drug cooperation does not mean that a country has to have totally eliminated drug production or trafficking, or, for that matter, use. 
It requires a good faith effort. The certification law takes into consideration the many problems with stopping drug production and transit. Thus, it is not unexpected that individuals can disagree on the results. It is not a sign of failure if the Congress and the President should disagree. Nor should such disagreements be the occasion for throwing overboard the very process we have for ensuring cooperation. And it does do this. Over the course of the certification process, we have seen more countries take the issue seriously. They do this because they are aware that we take it seriously. We have taught our own administration and other countries that cooperation on drugs is important. To now abandon the chief tool that we have is to run from our responsibilities at the first sign of unpleasantness. 
Certification is not perfect. No legislative tool is. We must, however, not expect more than is realistic. The present process clearly indicates Congress' expectation that countries, including our own, will demonstrate serious commitment. That commitment requires more than pious words. It expects action and demonstrable results. Failing that, it is wholly within our right to judge and to take appropriate steps. It is also an obligation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have all heard by now that Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, admitted that many pro-abortion groups agreed to a party line to say that partial birth abortions are very rare and performed only in extreme medical circumstances. Mr. Fitzsimmons has now admitted that this party line was a lie. 
Recent witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Renee Chelian, the president of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, was quoted in a news article as saying, `The spin out of Washington was that it was only done for medical necessity, even though we knew it wasn't so.' 
She openly admitted that she kept waiting for the National Abortion Federation to clarify it and they never did it. She said, `I got caught up: What do we do about this secret? Who do we tell and what happens when we tell? But frankly no one was asking me, so I didn't have to worry.' 
But the truth came out. Now we know that many, who so desperately were trying to tell us the truth, were right when they declared that this procedure is done thousands of times a year and the majority is done for elective purposes. 
I'm saddened to see that a new wave of behavior has begun to permeate our legislative process and for that matter political behavior. What appears to be commonplace is that now the end justifies the means. We've seen the administration use that excuse most recently when they openly admitted that it was necessary to do what it took to raise campaign funds in order to win the Presidency. And now, in this partial-birth abortion debate we have people who admitted they deliberately lied to Members of Congress and more important to the public about the partial-birth abortion procedure to justify a defeat of legislation banning it. 
The partial-birth abortion procedure is an assault on women and children. It is more than abortion on demand--it's abortion out-of-control. 
This is more than a debate about a woman's right to choose. This is about whether doctors, under the guise of health care, should be allowed to take the life of a child in such a barbarous way. 
I plan to support the measure before us, without amendment, which would end this procedure. This form of abortion is senseless, dangerous, and is clear-cut infanticide. 
My colleagues have discussed what happens to the mother and child during this type of abortion in graphic detail. Unfortunately, this procedure cannot be sugarcoated. It is a procedure which doctors use to kill unborn babies who in many cases have developed enough to live outside of the womb. 
I have been contacted by thousands of people in my State imploring me to support legislation to ban this procedure. Several hospitals from my State and their staffs have urged me to ban this procedure. 
Last year, President Clinton stated before he vetoed the original legislative ban on partial-birth abortion, `I have studied and prayed about this issue, and about the families who must face this awful choice, for many months. I believe that we have a duty to try to find common ground: a resolution to this issue that respects the views of those--including myself--who object to this particular procedure, but also upholds the Supreme Court's requirement that laws regulating abortion protect both the life and the health of American women.' 
Although it appears the President and many of my colleagues are concerned about the life and health of the mother, I must question their judgment. This bill would ban partial-birth abortions unless the life of the mother would be endangered. Medical experts have said that this 3-day procedure would not be necessary even then. 
Many say that this procedure must be allowed in cases where the health of the mother is at risk. Even that logic has been challenged. We know the Doe versus Bolton case interpreted health very broadly to mean almost anything, including if the mother is a minor or if the mother has depression and so forth. So, what that means in real terms is if the mother doesn't want the child--having the child will detrimentally affect her health and so on--abortion can take place in the third trimester. 
Many have testified that partial-birth abortion is almost never the safest procedure to save a woman's life or even her health. 
Former Surgeon General, Doctor C. Everett Koop has stated, `Contrary to what abortion activists would have us believe, partial-birth abortion is never medically indicated to protect a woman's health or her fertility. In fact, the opposite is true: The procedure can pose a significant and immediate threat to both the pregnant woman's health and fertility.' 
In the American Medical News, Dr. Warren Hern, who authored a widely used abortion manual, stated, `I would dispute any statement that this is the safest procedure to use.' 
Opponents talk about reproductive rights, but women have been deceived to think if an abortion procedure is legal then it is automatically safe. And I believe many women and men who support abortion in general do so on the basis of this reproductive safety jargon. 
Some have accused pro-life individuals of only being concerned about the baby and accused pro-choice individuals of only being concerned about the woman. I am seriously concerned about both the woman and the child. Babies are being victimized and women are being exploited. What kind of Federal or State regulations exist to make sure these abortions are safe? And I ask this question about abortions in general. A person doesn't even have to have a health care license of any kind to assist in the execution of an abortion. 
Do we have any uniform health and safety regulations that make sure abortion clinics are safe? I know there aren't Federal ones, because the pro-abortion forces have blocked any attempt to set safety standards and State regulations vary greatly. We saw the `60 Minutes' expose on the lack of safety regulations in Maryland that led to the abortion clinic death of at least one woman. 
I am concerned about women's health. And although some would say because I am pro-life, I do not care about the reproductive rights of women. That deduction is not accurate. And it exasperates me that women across our country have been led to believe that legality is synonymous with safety. 
Women should be outraged that this procedure has been designed and is being performed on them and healthy babies. This particular abortion technique is one of the most dangerous to their reproductive health and runs the great risk of jeopardizing their chances to ever carry a child to full term. As far as being out of touch, the other side is out of touch with protecting these children, many of whom could be the future women and men of America. 
And if those in opposition are really interested in protecting women's lives, why can't we enact Federal safety and health standards for abortion clinics? We can't because supporters of abortion don't want even minimum standards. How many women have been killed or maimed getting these so-called legal abortions? 
We always hear the mantra that the pro-life side is somehow out of touch and trying to turn the clock back on women. Well, the problem with the other side is they totally disregard the children and the women that are involved in these difficult cases. I'd like to move the clock forward for these children, not back, like the other side would like to do. 
Doctors that perform abortions are not required to inform the patient about any of the risks she faces with each specific abortion procedure. Doctors that perform abortions are not required to offer decision-based counseling to their patients. Doctors and those that assist the doctors, such as anesthesiologists, are not required to have an abortion-specific license. 
Abortionists can even ask their patients to sign statements saying that they will not sue if injured. 
Again, this is not a so-called anti-choice issue. Even pro-choice members have voted against this. Many have reiterated my colleague from New York's statement which said it accurately, `I think this is just too close to infanticide. A child has been born and it has exited the uterus and, what on Earth is this procedure?'

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 717. I support this bill because it has become clear to me that the status quo in special education is not acceptable. 
Even though Iowans have done a good job under existing law, it is time to make changes. These changes are necessary in order to keep pace with the challenges facing educators today. Students with a variety of special needs are now in the schools. They have needs we couldn't even imagine when the first special education law was passed. 
At this time I will address only two aspects of S. 717 that are sufficient reasons for supporting it. First of all, this bill would give schools and parents additional tools to improve education for all children. 
In response to school complaints, clearer guidance is given for actions to assure the safety of all students in the classroom. I believe all of us here today recognize the need to do this. 
For parents, the right to participate in decisions about their child's education is given more support. This is done through attendance at evaluation and assessment meetings and at any meeting at which the placement of their child might be decided. 
And for students, in this bill we send a clear message that we have high expectations for all students--including students in special education. More accountability for progress on IEP's would be required. Participation in statewide and districtwide measures of school performance would be required. Stronger linkages to the regular education curriculum would be required for these students. We expect success from special education programs under this bill, and we expect that success to be measurable. 
The second aspect of S. 717 I want to address is this. This bill clarifies that schools are not the only agencies that should pay for the services special education students need. This proposal does not 
retreat from the principle that all children have the right to an education, no matter what their needs are. What this bill does is require that Governors work to assure that all sources of funding for services are used to support these students. 
This will be of particular importance to schools and families in Iowa. 
Last week, I had a visit from a school superintendent in Iowa. His district has about 15,000 students; 2,000 of those students are in special education. Of those students there are about six or seven kids a year who require substantial medical support in order to attend school. 
The school district hires nurses and other professionals in order to assure that these students can get an education. But this superintendent has been unable to get other agencies and programs to contribute to the costs of providing health services to these students. And this school year approximately $2 million will be spent by this school system on health services for these few students, some of whom are eligible for Medicaid. 
Clearly these costs are beyond what we should be asking schools to pay. And that is one reason why S. 717 is important. It provides clear direction that these costs are not the primary responsibility of educators. They are instead the responsibility of other programs that have been created to support students and families. I am happy to provide such support to that school superintendent in his efforts to secure all the services his students need. 
That superintendent represents a strong tradition in Iowa. 
Education for students with disabilities in Iowa was mandated 6 years before the predecessor to IDEA was passed by Congress in the 1970's. At that time, when I chaired the Education Committee in the Iowa House, a State mandate for special education was passed. Following that, we developed a system of area education agencies that still serves Iowans today. It took us 2 years to get the area agency legislation passed; we were successful in 1974. That system is still the basis for delivering special education services to students all over Iowa, particularly in rural areas. 
Regarding this bill, S. 717, my colleagues have enumerated positive aspects of this compromise proposal other than those I have mentioned. I have followed the progress of the work group closely and now provide my support for this landmark legislation.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along with Senator Inouye, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, the PACE Provider Act of 1997. PACE, the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, is a unique system of integrated care for the frail elderly. This Act increases the number of PACE sites authorized to provide comprehensive, community-based services to frail, elderly persons. 
As our population ages, we must continue to place a high priority on long-term care services. Giving our seniors alternatives to nursing home care and expanding the choices available, is not only cost effective, but will also improve the quality of life for older Americans. 
PACE programs achieve this goal. PACE enables the frail elderly to remain as healthy as possible, at home in their communities. By doing so, elderly individuals maintain their independence, dignity and quality of life. 
Each PACE participant receives a comprehensive care package, including all Medicare and Medicaid services, as well as community-based long-term care services. Each individual is cared for by an interdisciplinary team consisting of a primary care physician, nurse, social worker, rehabilitation therapist, home health worker, and others. Because care providers on the PACE team work together, they are able to successfully accommodate the complex medical and social needs of the elderly person in fragile health. 
What's more, PACE provides high-quality care at a lower cost to Medicare and Medicaid, relative to their payments in the traditional system. Studies show a 5-15 percent reduction in Medicare and Medicaid spending for individuals in PACE. 
The potential savings to Medicare and Medicaid is significant. PACE programs provide services for one of our most vulnerable, and costly, population: frail, elderly adults who are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. In many cases, these `dually eligible' individuals have complex, chronic care needs and require ongoing, long-term care services. The current structure of Medicare and Medicaid does not encourage coordination of these services. The result is fragmented and costly care for our nation's most vulnerable population. 
The PACE Provider Act does not alter the criteria for eligibility for PACE participation in any way. Instead, it makes PACE programs more available to individuals already eligible for nursing home care, because of their poor health status. PACE is a preferable, and less costly, alternative. Specifically, this Act increases the number of PACE programs authorized from 15 to 40, with an additional 20 to be added each year, and affords regular `provider' status to existing sites. 
The PACE Provider Act allows the success of PACE programs to be replicated throughout the country. And, with an emphasis on preventative and supportive services, PACE services can substantially reduce the high-costs associated with emergency room visits and extended nursing home stays often needed by the frail elderly in the traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
My sponsorship of this bill grows out of my Aging Committee hearing on April 29, Torn Between Two Systems: Improving Chronic Care in Medicare and Medicaid. The plight of the dual eligibles is unacceptable. This bill is an immediate and positive step in the right direction.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer bipartisan legislation to provide Medicare beneficiaries with the necessary tools and protections they need to choose the right health plan under the Medicare program for their individual health care needs. The bill I am introducing today, with my Democratic colleague, Senator Conrad, whom I have had the pleasure to work with on many issues, is entitled the Medicare Patient Choice and Access Act of 1997. I am also joined by my Republican colleagues, Senator D'Amato and Senator Helms, and my Democratic colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House by Representatives Coburn and Brown. Representative Coburn's bill currently has 91 cosponsors and has strong bipartisan support. 
The bill I am sponsoring accomplishes a number of important objectives for Medicare beneficiaries and for the success of the Medicare program. We often talk about providing more choices of health plans for Medicare recipients, but we rarely discuss what they need to make the right choice. As Congress examines ways to encourage more options for Medicare beneficiaries through the growth of managed care, it is critical that there is a trusting relationship between Medicare enrollees and their health plans. Medicare is a Federal program. Therefore, it is our job to ensure that health plans participating in the Medicare program provide quality care to our Nation's elderly. Medicare recipients look to Congress to hold health plans accountable. The legislation I am introducing will encourage plans to compete based on the quality of care they provide and will give beneficiaries the necessary information they need make an informed choice. 
The bill includes the following provisions: Provides beneficiaries with standardized consumer-friendly charts to compare health plans in their area (information such as disenrollment rates and appeals denied and reversed by plans are included in these charts); ensures that beneficiaries will receive fair treatment when health plans deny care by establishing a uniform and timely appeals process for managed care plans participating in Medicare; creates an atmosphere of trust between beneficiaries and their providers by prohibiting the use of gag clauses which restrict communications between providers and their patients; provides beneficiaries with the assurance that their health care provider will refer to specialists, when medically necessary, by expanding Medicare's restriction on the use of financial incentives in managed care to include not just physicians but all providers; 
given patients, especially those individuals who require specialized care, the assurance they will be able to see a specialist, as medically necessary, when they are enrolled in a managed care plan; and offers beneficiaries more choices by guaranteeing they will have the option, at the time of enrollment, to select a plan with coverage for out-of-network services (point-of-service plans are the fastest growing health plans in the private sector). 
Many of the provisions in this bill are supported by research conducted by the General Accounting Office [GAO] and the Institute of Medicine [IOM]. In the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, we recently held a hearing on the importance of detailed health plan information in holding health plans accountable and improving the quality of care delivered. We heard from large health care purchasers such as the California Public Employees Retirement System [CalPERS] and Xerox Corp. on ways Congress could improve the Medicare program by providing comparative, standardized, information on participating health plans. We heard from the GAO and the IOM about ways the Health Care Financing Administration could be more cost-efficient by requiring that health plans standardize their information. These witnesses highlighted the costliness of high disenrollment rates among health plans and how rates are significantly reduced when beneficiaries are given accurate and detailed comparative information on available health plans. 
Most importantly, we heard from a recent Medicare beneficiary and a representative of a Medicare Insurance Counseling Assistance program on the lack of reliable, comparative information under the current Medicare program. The consistent theme from all these witnesses was the importance of trust between Medicare beneficiaries and their health plans. This trust in the program does not exist today, particularly in areas experiencing a rapid growth in managed care. However, by enacting the bill I am offering today which includes several incremental changes to the Medicare program, Congress can help to establish trust and rebuild confidence among our Nation's seniors in the Medicare program. 
Many of the provisions in this bill are strengthening current law or providing beneficiaries protection in statute in addition to regulation. I believe it is the responsibility of Congress and administration to ensure that our Nation's elderly are getting quality, cost-effective care under the Medicare program. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me and Senator Conrad in cosponsoring this very important bipartisan legislation.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to talk about our efforts to eliminate problem disbursements at the Department of Defense [DOD]. 
Problem disbursements are payments that were not matched with obligations before the bills were paid. 
As we have learned in recent years, the failure to follow this very elementary internal control procedure leaves the Pentagon's financial accounts vulnerable to theft and abuse. 
It leads to underpayments, overpayments, erroneous payments, and even fraudulent payments. 
It leads to overdisbursed accounts. 
That is when payments exceed available appropriations. 
When that happens, you have a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act. That is a felony. 
Right now, Mr. President, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service [DFAS] Center at Columbus, OH, has about 2,700 contracts that are overdisbursed. 
Those contracts have negative cash balances of $900 million-plus. 
In a nutshell, the Pentagon's financial books are in a shambles. 
Mr. President, that's not the Senator from Iowa talking. 
That's coming straight from the horse's mouth--the DOD inspector general [IG] and the General Accounting Office [GAO]. 
That's what their audit reports say. They say: DOD's books are in such a mess that they can't be audited--as required by law--the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. 
When the auditors can't conduct an audit, they issue a `disclamer of opinion.' 
Well, guess what? 
DOD gets one disclaimer after another--year after year. It's a disgrace. 
One way to clean up the books is to start matching disbursements with obligations before payments are made. 
This is the stuff that's taught in basic accounting course 101 in college. It's square one, I know, but it's the right place to start. 
And that's what the Senate has been telling DOD to do since 1994. 
For 3 years now, we have been telling DOD to get on the stick and fix the problem. 
This was done with the leadership and support of my friend from Alaska Senator Stevens, and my friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye. 
I thought we were really making progress--until I saw the new GAO report. 
That's a May 1997 report. It says DOD is underestimating the dollar value of problem-disbursements by at least $25 billion. 
DOD says it's an $18 billion problem. 
That means we're really staring at a $50 billion problem--or worse. 
Why would DOD grossly underestimate the problem like this, Mr. President? 
We're looking at a classic bureaucratic trick. Blowing smoke to conceal the problem: Redefining the problem to make it look smaller. 
This makes the Senate think the problem is getting fixed. 
They want the Senate to ease up on the pressure. That's the goal, Mr. President, reduce the pressure. 
Unfortunately, with problem disbursements at the $45 to $50 billion level, we right about where we started in 1994. 
So this is no time to ease up on the pressure. 
The unwanted pressure is being generated by our legislative initiatives.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, under the law, DOD was required to start making the matches on checks over $5 million, and then gradually ratchet the thresholds down to zero. 
At the $5-million level, DOD is really just scratching the surface. 
DFAS/Columbus is where it happens. 
DFAS/Columbus writes fewer than 1,800 checks per year that are $5 million or more. So what's the big deal? Matchups on 1,800 checks should be a piece of cake. 
But when it came time to start phase 2 and lower the threshold to the $1 million checks, DOD balked. 
DOD said `No'--even though it makes fewer than 11,250 payments over $1 million annually. DOD asked for more time. 
Making the matchups on 11,250 checks ought to be Mickey Mouse stuff. Banks routinely do 500,000 to 1 million each day. 
Mr. President, for 11,250 DOD checks versus up to 1 million checks for U.S. banks and DOD can't do it. 
Why can't the Pentagon do it--with all its technological know-how? 
Mr. President, I can't help but think that, maybe, the Pentagon bureaucrats don't want to clean up the books. 
They like the mess. That way no one knows what is really going on, including them, and no one gets in trouble. 
Well, thanks to the committee's determined leadership last year, our legislative reform effort is back on track. We regained some momentum. 
DOD must now make matchups on all checks over $3 million, starting next month--June 30. 
At the same time, DOD is supposed to be developing a detailed plan for moving first to the $1-million mark, and then on down to zero. 
The IG is reviewing that plan right now and should be submitting an assessment to the committee soon. 
After we study this report, we should be in a position to decide on how to proceed in the fiscal year 1998 bill. 
I would like to mention one disturbing new development. 
I was recently provided with evidence--DOD documents--that clearly indicates that DOD is not on board 100 percent with our effort. 
This material pertains to program payments made at the DFAS/Columbus Center. It shows that DOD is using several random-allocation procedures for matching payments with appropriated moneys. 
This procedure subverts the appropriations process and is guaranteed to create more unmatched disbursements--big time--along with a host of other legal problems. 
I will have more to say on this later, once I have all the facts. 
This new information tells me that we will need to apply more pressure to get the job done. I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation. There is--and the public knows this better than we do--a lot of legislation we debate on the floor of this body that might make sense in Washington, but does not make sense outside of Washington. We spend a lot of time debating legislation that does not make a difference in people's lives. This bill, S. 543, not only expresses American common sense--at least from my part of the country, Midwestern common sense--but it also says no to Washington nonsense. 
This bill gives me an opportunity, at the same time, to compliment the Senator from Georgia for the outstanding work that he is doing in this area. 
Debate of legislation that solidly promotes voluntarism is an example of Congress spending some of its time to get something done where there is a real reward. It is an example of the taxpayers' money well spent, to pay us to write legislation that will encourage Americans to do what we have a tradition of doing in this country--volunteering. 
I am sure Alexis de Tocqueville has been quoted on the floor of the Senate often during the debate of this bill. One observation that the French nobleman made when he came to this country in the 1830's to study our new system of government, was the American tradition of voluntarism that he saw in our churches and in our volunteer societies--or as he termed them `societies of cooperation.' He believed that one of the wonderful and unique aspects of our society was that neighbor helps neighbor. Yet, now our society has impediments to this tradition of voluntarism, to this neighbor helping neighbor. 
Our good friend from Georgia has a solution that restores the voluntarism that de Tocqueville observed. This very important legislation will remove one impediment to voluntarism in America. This bill will lessen the threat of a lawsuit for volunteers and their organizations. So here we are today discussing some legislation that is common sense. We are wisely spending our time and energy debating legislation that would provide to the taxpayer, in volunteer hours, more return on the taxpayers' dollars than anything we do. 
I come here to support the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997 and to compliment Senator Coverdell. This legislation has two important benefits. First, it promotes voluntarism. It promotes voluntarism at the time of the big volunteer crusade in Philadelphia. Praise the Lord for the people that were involved in that because that was a very worthwhile project and it was bipartisan. The Congress can do something through this legislation that will help that effort as well. So this legislation promotes voluntarism, and it also enacts much needed tort reform. 
Volunteers are vital to the health and welfare of our communities, States, and our Nation. We all rely on the kindness of friends and strangers. Volunteers are often these people, whether we see them or not, who bring meals to the homebound; who clean up trash along our highways; who respond to natural disasters. I will point out just a few recent examples. 
The United Way of Central Iowa rallied 2,500 volunteers--nearly twice as many as in 1995--to complete 97 projects. Among these volunteers was a troop of Brownies who baked brownies for the children and families at the local Ronald McDonald House. 
At the American Red Cross homeless shelter in Rockford, VT, 47 volunteers, including 15 shelter residents, painted and 
cleaned the shelter, dug a new pathway in its yard, and picked up litter in the neighborhood. 
The George Washington High School swim team in Danville, VA, gave an hour of free swimming lessons to 60 nonswimmers in grades 2 through 4. 
In Detroit, MI, kids from University CAMP and Detroit Country Day School painted, cleaned, and removed graffiti and boarded up vacant homes. 
The Men's Club of Oakland Methodist Church in Maryville, TN, installed carpeting and built a wheelchair ramp for a needy family whose 8-year-old daughter is in a wheelchair. 
These are only a few of the volunteers whose efforts have come to my attention. This is just a sampling of what volunteers give to our communities. We have an obligation to these volunteers and to their organizations beyond the casual `thank you.' If they are going to make these efforts, we must do everything in our power to enable and encourage them. We owe it to them to make their burden lighter and their jobs easier. We owe it to the organizations to make it as easy as possible for them to recruit volunteers. We must lower the risk incurred by volunteers and their organizations. 
This bill lowers the risk. It limits potential liability for volunteers and their organizations. It is only fitting that we pass this legislation for all of the volunteers and their organizations who put forth the sweat and the labor to accomplish so many good deeds. It is simply fair and equitable. That is what this legislation is all about. 
I am a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over this issue. I can tell you from my experience in this position that this is badly needed reform. The purpose of our civil court system is to establish liability and to compensate the injured. It does not always accomplish this now. I believe that our court system needs reform, including punitive damage reform. Punitive damages are an unpredictable risk for companies and volunteer organizations. They are sometimes a windfall to those less injured, while the truly injured do not receive the same financial amount. Our court system should not be a lottery but, instead, should award all who are similarly injured with similar compensation. Likewise, those punished should be punished equally for similar transgressions. 
This bill does not accomplish all of the needed reforms for the system. However, it is a solid first step. It will give the volunteer community some certainty of the risks that it faces. It does not relieve anyone of liability for conduct that is criminal, grossly negligent or reckless. It continues to hold those who intentionally commit wrongdoing liable for such acts. It is a good, fair bill that will boost the volunteer community and volunteers. 
So I strongly urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to think of the volunteers that they know, the people represented by the President and ex-Presidents and by Colin Powell in Philadelphia, the people they have met along the way, as well, and perhaps even volunteers who personally helped them. That is what this bill is all about. It is about volunteers and not about trial lawyers. 
As everyone on this floor knows, the highly paid trial lawyers have set out to stop this bill. Of course, too many in this body, particularly a large majority on the other side of the aisle, are doing the trial lawyers' bidding, as you can see from the opposition to this bill. The trial lawyers want to stop this bill because it will cost them money. It will reduce their legal fees in most cases when they are suing a volunteer or volunteer organization. But this bill is not and should not be about trial lawyers and not about trial lawyers' compensation. This is a bill about what America is about, about volunteering and about volunteers. It is about the people who do things that they do not even want to be thanked for; it is about selfless people who 
give of their time and give it freely to those in need. 
It is to these people that we owe something. That is what the Philadelphia conference was all about. We owe it to the volunteers to make their jobs easier. That is what this bill does. I ask my colleagues to put volunteers ahead of trial lawyers and to support this bill. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, to introduce legislation to standardize Medicare eligibility for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. It is estimated that osteoporosis results in 1.5 million fractures and $20 billion in medical costs each year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, through the use of 1992 incidence data of bone fractures related to osteoporosis, determined that such fractures represent three percent of all Medicare costs. A recent report issued by the Alliance for Aging Research examined the dramatic savings realized when the onset of age-related disability is delayed. The report indicates that delaying the onset of osteoporosis by 5 years could save the economy up to as much as $10 billion annually. 
In the state of Iowa, 15 percent of men and women over the age of 50, which is approximately 340,000 Iowans, have osteoporosis. Women are particularly prone to getting osteoporosis, which can lead to bone fractures that result in loss of independence and eventually to nursing home care. Early detection is critical, and there are effective treatments available to prevent bone mass deterioration. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 
Medicare currently covers bone mass measurement, which is the diagnostic tool used to detect osteoporosis. However, Medicare carriers have discretion regarding eligibility requirements. States cover bone mass measurement on a case-by-case basis; some States cover it when an individual is in the early stages of or already has the disease; and some States allow early detection of the disease based on whether or not the patient is at high risk of developing osteoporosis. 
Medicare carriers in states such as Iowa and Maine promote early detection of osteoporosis by covering bone mass measurement for individuals at-risk of the disease. However, carriers in more than half the States do not allow testing until the person already has the disease or is at very high-risk of getting it. 
The legislation I am co-sponsoring with Senator Snowe would help reduce the economic and social costs of osteoporosis through early detection of this crippling disease. The bill would establish uniform eligibility requirements for coverage of bone mass measurement, eliminating the variation in Medicare coverage that currently exists. It would not require that every individual be screened for the disease, only those that are considered at-risk. Medicare is a federal program where everyone pays 2.9 percent of their pay. Therefore, everyone deserves to have access to the same benefits. 
I congratulate my colleague, Senator Snowe, for taking the lead on this very important health issue. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Mrs. Feinstein, in introducing important legislation. This legislation, the Personal Information Privacy Act of 1997, is a solid first step toward keeping our personal information from being misused. 
In this amazing time of technology explosion, new challenges face our society. New technology makes information more readily available for many uses. This information helps the college student write a better term paper, it helps businesses function more effectively, and it helps professionals to stay better informed of developments in their fields. The technology that provides this ready access to infinite information also helps friends and families communicate across continents, increases the feasibility of working from a home office, and provides many other advantages. 
However, with these advantages come added risk. Dissemination of information is generally good, but dissemination of all information is not good. Technology can help people with bad intentions find their victims. It can also give people access to personal information that we would rather they not have. With minimal information and a few keystrokes, virtually anyone could have your lifetime credit history and personal wages downloaded to their computer. For this reason, it is important that we work to make sure some personal information stays out of the hands of people we have never met, whose intentions we don't know. 
One of the most important functions of lawmaking is to make sure that law keeps up with society, and in this case, technology. The bill that Senator Feinstein and I are introducing today is a solid first step. I will soon be introducing additional legislation affecting the Internet because I believe it is important that we talk about issues related to new technologies; that we exchange ideas. And at the end of the day, we must preserve the confidentiality of personal information and the safety of individuals.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to let my colleagues know that I have introduced legislation to make it easier for all Americans to bear the cost of a higher education. My legislation, which I offer with my colleague, Senator Moseley-Braun, would restore the deduction on the interest paid on student loans, which was eliminated in the 1986 Tax Reform Act. 
This bill is a simple, direct proposal. Under this legislation, those who are paying off student loans will be able to claim a deduction for that amount and they would be able to claim this deduction for the time it takes to repay the loan. 
When we think of investing money, we often think of investing in things--machines, natural resources, or businesses. This measure is an investment in human capabilities and talents. This bill will send the message to college students across America that their intellectual talents are valued and are worth the investment of tax dollars. Students need to know the Federal Government and the Nation value their contributions of the mind. 
Then, I believe they will have a greater appreciation of the effort necessary to successfully complete a higher education. 
And, increasingly, a higher education is the starting point on a successful career path. According to the Department of Labor, by the year 2000, more than half of all new jobs created will require an education beyond high school. 
However, at the same time as a higher education has become increasingly necessary, it has also become increasingly expensive. In the last 10 years, total costs at public college has increased by 23 percent and at private colleges by 36 percent. 
According to the General Accounting Office, this means that over the last 15 years, tuition at a public 4-year college or university has nearly doubled as a percentage of median household income. Accordingly to the Congressional Research Service, the best data available indicates that students graduating from a 4-year program leave that institution with an average loan debt of about $10,000. This, of course, represents a significant burden in itself. However, at the current capped rate of 8.25 percent for the basic Federal student loan program, students also bear nearly $1,000 in interest debt. For individuals just starting out, this extra burden adds insult to injury. We, in the Congress, can send the signal that we value higher education and recognize the financial responsibility students have by restoring the deduction on the interest on student loans. 
Furthermore, this proposal is more affordable than what the President has proposed. His tuition deduction which received cost estimates ranging from $36 to $42 billion. What I and my college from Illinois are proposing addresses interest cost, which, of course, is a percentage of tuition cost. I believe our proposal provides college students with the help they really need, while at the same time being fiscally manageable. That is why I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join Senator Moseley-Braun and I in supporting the Loan Interest Forgiveness for Education Act.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Biden in offering the Royal Hong Kong Police Anticrime Strategy Act of 1997. As the recent State Department report on international narcotics control makes clear, the criminal activities of major Asian organized crime groups directly affects the United States. Whether we are talking about alien smuggling, heroin trafficking, or spreading corruption, major Asian-based gangs, many operating from Hong Kong, daily affect the quality of life of many of our citizens. Their activities to launder their illegal incomes threatens the integrity of our banking and financial systems. 
With the transfer of Hong Kong to China, much of the current expertise on these criminal organizations now based in the Royal Hong Kong Police will be lost. What this legislation will do, and it is only a first step, is to give us the opportunity to examine ways of retaining that expertise, of putting it to use in our efforts to stop a despicable trade in human beings and to improve our capability to stop the flow of dangerous drugs that do so much to make our neighborhoods and streets unsafe. The proposal is innovative and timely. While only authorizing a study, the present proposal will give us the opportunity to explore ways to ensure the effectiveness of our international narcotics control efforts.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill on the Internal Revenue Code. From time to time we need to change the Internal Revenue Code, particularly when it deals with agriculture. However, there may be some people listening who do not understand agriculture. They may see these efforts as doing something special for farmers. I want to clarify today that I am a person who comes from the school of thought that every penny of legal tax that is owed the Federal Government should be paid. But I think, also, we have a responsibility, as Representatives of the people, to make sure that we balance taxpayers' compliance with taxpayers' rights. 
The legislation I am introducing today is centered on a proposition that has been the law for approximately 40 years. It proscribes that most farm landlords, just like small business people and other commercial landlords, should not have to pay self-employment tax on cash rent income. For 40 years it has been that way for farm people and city people alike. But in 1995, there was an Arkansas Federal tax court case that said the IRS could take other expansive factors into consideration. As a result of that tax case, the IRS decided to issue a related technical advice memorandum. These are widely deemed to be IRS policy statements on the law. As a result, many farm landlords are now treated differently from commercial and other city landlords. Consequently, farmers and retired farmers now find themselves paying 15.3 percent self-employment tax on cash rent. 
So, I say to the IRS, as I give an explanation for my legislation this morning: Don't try to game the system. The law remains what people have counted on for 40 years. Unless there is an act of Congress, you ought to respect history before you change the rules. Obviously, the test of time ought to prove the taxpayer was right and the IRS was wrong, particularly since there now is a difference between the farm sector and the city sector. 
The correct rationale is simple, the self employment tax applies to income from labor or employment. Income from cash rents represents the value of ownership or equity in land, not labor or employment. Therefore, the self employment tax should not ordinarily apply to income from cash rents. 
So, along with Senator Grams of Minnesota, I am introducing this bill so farmers and retired farmers are not going to be encroached upon by the IRS and the Tax Code as a result of this Arkansas Federal tax court case and the IRS technical advice memorandum. The IRS has thus, through this court case and broadened by its own pronouncement, introduced a new barrier to the family farmer. Our legislation would remove this new IRS barrier so that farm families and retired farmers can continue to operate. 
Specifically, our legislation would clarify that when the IRS is applying the self-employment tax to the cash rent farm leases, it should limit its inquisition to the lease agreement. This is not an expansion of the law for the taxpayers. Rather, it is a narrowing of an antitaxpayer expansion initiated by the Internal Revenue Service. The tax law does not ordinarily require cash rent landlords in cities to pay the self-employment tax. Indeed, cash rent farm landlords are the only ones occasionally required to pay the tax. This is due to a 40-year-old exception that allowed the retired farmers of the late 1950's to become vested in the Social Security system. 
However, the law originally imposed the tax on farm landlords only when their lease agreements with their renters required the landlord to participate in the operation of the farm and in the farming of the land. 
Forty years later and we are here today, the IRS has expanded the application of the self-employment tax for farmland owners. Now the Tax Court has told the IRS that in one particular instance, the IRS could look beyond the lease agreement. On this very limited authority, the IRS has unilaterally expanded the one court case even further so it now approximates a national tax policy. 
Our legislation clarifies that the IRS should examine only the lease agreement. Thus, it would preserve the pre-1996 status quo. We want to preserve the historical self-employment tax treatment of farm rental agreements, equating them with landlords in small businesses and commercial properties within the cities. The 1957 tax law was designed to benefit retired farmers of that generation so that they would qualify for Social Security. 
So, obviously, those persons of the 1950's have all since passed from the scene. Their children and grandchildren are now the victims of this IRS expansion of their old rule. Congress does not intend that farm owners be treated differently from other real estate owners, other than as they have been historically. We need the clarity provided in our legislation in order to turn back an improper, unilateral, and targeted IRS expansion of old tax law. In other words, I see this legislation as removing this new IRS barrier to the family farm and the American dream.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as you know the issue of drug use by our children is very important to me. I believe that we must do whatever we can to protect our children from the harmful effects of illegal drugs. The survey by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America recently released showed that children continue to cite their parents as a reliable source of information about the dangers of drugs. This confirms a 1996 study by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse which showed that the extent parents shouldered responsibility for their kids resisting drugs was a key indicator of whether or not their child experimented with drugs. Not Presidents, not Federal officials, not television, but parents and others who play an integral role in a child's life make the difference. 
Today, in conjunction with 13 of my fellow Senators, we are introducing the Drug Free Communities Act of 1997. This act will take funds currently being spent for less productive areas of the Federal drug control budget and route them to community coalitions with proven track records. Seeking to make the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars, Federal grants will match funding efforts from the private sector and the local community. 
It will put resources in the hands of those who make a difference; of the people that our children say their opinions they respect. It puts the resources at the community level, where parents, teachers, coaches, and community leaders can use these resources to educate our children about the evils of drug use. 
There are four key features to this legislation, features that make it different from existing funding opportunities. First, communities must take the initiative. In order to receive support, a community coalition must demonstrate that there is a long-term commitment to address teen-drug use by having a sustainable coalition that includes the involvement of representatives from a wide variety of community activists. 
In addition, every coalition must show that it will be around for a while. Community coalitions must be in existence for at least 6 months prior to applying for funds provided for in this bill, and they are only eligible to receive support if they can match these donations dollar for dollar with non-Federal funding, up to $100,000 per coalition. 
The third key feature of this legislation is an assurance that the funds for this bill will come from existing legislation. We plan on working closely with the members of the Appropriations Committee to find appropriate off-sets within the current $16 billion Federal drug control budget. 
An advisory commission, consisting of local community leaders, and State and National experts in the field of substance abuse, will oversee the implementation of the program at the Office of National Drug Control Policy. They will insure the funds are directed to communities and programs that make a difference in the lives of our children. 
At other times I've talked about the statistics--how drug use is up again this year among teens, and how emergency room admissions are rising after years of decline, and other depressing statistics. But the bill we introduce today is in support of organizations that are on the front lines, making a difference in the lives of our children. I urge my fellow members to join my colleagues and me in supporting this legislation for our children.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, this is the fifth time I have taken the floor to make observations about the FBI's upside-down management of its crime lab. 
In my view, the FBI's Director, Louis Freeh, continues to mislead the public about the lab. He would have us think that the FBI lab has met the highest standards. He has maintained that the allegations of the lab's whistleblower, Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, are all wrong. He has said that no other scientist in the lab has come forward with similar accusations. His testimony before Congress recently was totally consistent with that image. 
But documents belie the Director's rosy portrayal of the lab., and of his dark portrayal of Dr. Whitehurst. 
Thus far, I have released documents showing there is credibility to some of Dr. Whitehurst's allegations. I have pointed to press accounts in which the public has learned the IG's still-secret report uncovers problems in three specific cases. thus backing up Dr. Whitehurst with specifics. I released documents showing that Director Freeh was aware of the exact same allegations, investigated them, yet covered them up. I revealed that there was a second scientist who came forward with serious allegations that paralleled those of Dr. Whitehurst. 
I do not know what it will take for Mr. Freeh to admit these things, Mr. President. Perhaps the public needs to see more of the FBI`s documents that underscore my points. That's fine by me. Because documents don't mislead. They do not have a motive to. But, people do. And when leaders of the people mislead, there's a breakdown in confidence and trust. 
And so, I am here today, Mr. President, to test the boundaries of Mr. Freeh's denials. Today, I am releasing yet more FBI documents, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act. These documents contradict Mr. Freeh's own assertions. The American people have a right to know this. 
Today, I will reveal a third scientist in the FBI lab, who substantiated some of Dr. Whitehurst's more serious allegations. He substantiated them just months after the FBI Director and his team of lawyers whitewashed them. This third scientist, in fact, was Whitehurst's unit chief in the lab. 
Here are the facts. In December 1992, Dr. Whitehurst made the serious allegations that his lab reports were being altered by other agents who lacked authority to do so. Altered reports could constitute tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice, and could therefore be criminal. 
The universe of cases being looked at was 48 cases. Not all of them were altered. But all had to be checked. Some appeared to contain substantial changes. The Whitehurst memo of allegations went to the Assistant Director of the FBI for the Laboratory Division. 
In May 1994, a review of the Whitehurst allegations--much more extensive than just the altered reports issue, but including them--was done by Mr. Freeh's lawyers, rather than by an independent body with some scientific background. Ironically, it was the IG's investigation that supplied the needed independence and a scientific approach, and only then did these problems get aired. 
But, the FBI's review was headed by Mr. Freeh's general counsel, Howard Shapiro. He's the Director's top lawyer, himself a controversial figure with Congress. Mr. Shapiro felt there was no need to have an independent review because, as he said, the FBI has a long, proud history of doing its own reviews. Upon completion, the review was eventually read and signed-off-on by Director Freeh. 
So, here is what the FBI's own review found. First, there were no major problems in the lab. Everything was hunky dory. On the specific issue of altered lab reports, here is what Mr. Shapiro found. 
[Laboratory Division] management made it clear that this will not be tolerated and has instructed the Unit Chief's (sic) to reiterate this policy. 
How about that for a finding for this crack review team, Mr. President. They're investigating serious, possibly criminal activities. Instead of finding out whether it happened, Mr. Shapiro merely said it's not supposed to happen. His recommendation? If there were alterations, just correct the written report. 
You see, Mr. President, under the long-standing Brady decision, the government is required to provide the accused with any information that might point to their innocence. Material alterations of lab analysis might fit into that category. If changes had been discovered in some reports, the proper thing to do was to judge the impact of any alterations on each court case. Instead, Mr. Shapiro thought justice would be served by simply correcting the paperwork. Cases closed. 
By October 1994--about 5 months after Mr. Shapiro's review was issued--the IG got hold of the same allegations. The IG began its own review of the 48 cases. 
Meanwhile, in September 1994, the FBI lab managers discovered another agent making the same allegations of altered reports as Dr. Whitehurst was making. The allegations by then were being investigated thoroughly by lab personnel. 
By January 1995, the lab's investigation was completed. An FBI unit chief, whose name I will not divulge, wrote a memo of investigation to his section chief. In it, he stated that 13 of Whitehurst's 48 cases had significant alterations. He recommended the following: 
That [Supervisory Special Agent] (blank) be held accountable for the unauthorized changes he made in the [Auxilliary Examiner] dictation of SSA Whitehurst by administrative action to include both oral reprimand and a letter of censure. 
The unit chief concluded his memo this way: `(Blank) committed errors which were clearly intentional. He acted irresponsibly; he should be held accountable; he should be disciplined accordingly.' 
The scientist-unit chief writing the memo, and who backed up Dr. Whitehurst's allegations, identified the culprit. I won't reveal who either one is. But the memo is significant. It reveals yet another scientist--a unit chief, no less--who substantiated Whitehurst's allegations. It is another apparent example of an FBI lab agent shaving the evidence to get a conviction. 
What was covered over by Mr. Shapiro's team of crack lawyers less than 1 year before, was now popping up. The lab's management was finding the opposite of what Shapiro and his lawyers found. That meant there were conflicting findings. And that is serious. The lab unit chief's report was at odds with Director Freeh's. What was senior management--those above the lab managers--to do? 
The answer was not long in coming. During this time frame, FBI management indeed found a suitable discipline for this rogue agent. Mr. President, they promoted him. They made him a unit chief. The agent found to have intentionally altered evidence was promoted. That tells us how senior management resolved the dilemma. They promoted the rogue, and shot the messenger. 
That set the stage for the coverup. Because just 10 months later, when the Whitehurst allegations became public, Mr. Freeh issued the following statement in response. This was on November 8, 1995. He said:  
The FBI has vigorously investigated his (Whitehurst's) concerns and is continuing to do so. The FBI alone has reviewed more than 250 cases involving work previously done by the Laboratory. To date, the FBI has found no evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory evidence. Any finding of such misconduct will result in tough and swift action by the FBI. 
Is that what happened to the rogue agent, Mr. President? Yes. The FBI took swift action to get him promoted. 
The fact is, the statement by Mr. Freeh on November 8, 1995, was utterly false. Lab reports are evidence. If altered substantially--and 13 reports were--that is evidence of possible evidence tampering, and more. 
Ultimately, the IG caught up with the rogue agent. The FBI did not. But the IG did. When the IG report finally reached the Bureau, this rogue agent became one of the three who were transferred from the lab. Yet no other action has been taken against him by the FBI. I aim to find out why not. 
Mr. President, what is clear about all this is, the FBI is buried under a mountain of evidence showing it cannot police itself. It took the inspector general's investigation to finally root out what the FBI had covered up. Some good people in the FBI tried to do the right thing. But senior management got in the way. Senior management apparently places a higher value on maintaining image, rather than rooting out wrong. 
Therefore, the time may have come for independent review of the FBI. Someone needs to police the police. They cannot police themselves. That is for sure. Perhaps the way to go is to beef up the independent IG, instead of the FBI's Office of Professional Responsibility, as the Director has proposed. 
Growing up on the family farm in Iowa, my father taught us to revere and respect the FBI. They were the champions of right versus wrong in our society. We looked up to them, whether justified or not. 
I still have that same respect for the FBI. There are literally thousands of good, decent men and women serving their country as FBI employees. 
But those honest, hardworking agents need and deserve leadership that has integrity and credibility. They need leaders who will go after bad guys, and protect good guys. Not the other way around. They need leaders who reward honesty and punish wrongdoing--not the other way around, as we see in this case. 
The issue of bad management in the crime lab is serious. Bad scientific analysis used in court means good guys can go to prison, and bad guys can walk. That's not what we want. That is un-American. That's what they have in dictatorships. There is no room for that in a democracy. 
Mr. President, I have talked to my colleagues about the culture at the FBI under the present management. It seems to reward those who rush to a conviction. It seems to punish those who, in the FBI's eyes, `commit truth.' 
There is no better image to show this than how they treated the rogue agent--they promoted him--and how they treated Dr. Whitehurst--they went after him. 
Mr. President, I do not have to say anything else. That says it all.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am very sad to report that Air Force Col. John Boyd died in West Palm Beach, FL, on March 9, 1997. 
He was 70 years old. 
He passed away after a long and difficult fight with cancer. 
His remains were laid to rest today in Arlington Memorial Cemetery. 
John was a native of Erie, PA. But John came to Iowa to go to college. 
Iowa is where his Air Force career began. 
He won an athletic scholarship to the University of Iowa and enrolled in the Air Force ROTC program. 
After graduating in 1951, he went to flight school. He earned his wings and began flying the F-86 Saber jet. 
Then he went to Korea with one goal: shoot down a MiG. 
Fortunately, for everyone concerned, that conflict came to an end before his wish came true. 
But to John that was one of the biggest disappointments of his life. 
Mr. President, I am proud that John Boyd was educated in Iowa. 
He was a great American who dedicated his life to public service. 
I would like to honor him by speaking briefly about some of his most important accomplishments. 
First and foremost, John Boyd was a legendary Air Force fighter pilot. 
But John was no ordinary jet jockey. He applied his vast intellect to understand the dynamics of air combat maneuvering at which he excelled. 
To do that, though, he had to teach himself calculus so he could work the formulas to quantify the problem. 
This was the problem he saw. 
Why did the heavier and slower American F-86 achieve near total domination of the superior MiG-15 encountered in Korea? 
John wanted an answer to the question. 
After doing some truly original and pioneering work, he began advancing a theory. 
His tactical `Aerial Attack Study' became the bible for air-to-air combat training. 
It was instrumental in the creation of the Fighter Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base, NV. 
That's the Air Force equivalent of the Navy's `Top Gun' program. 
John being John, he never slacked off. He kept right on working and developing his theory of aerial combat. 
He wanted to take it to a higher plane. 
And he did. 
It culminated in the Energy Maneuverability Theory. 
This was a very important piece of work. 
John Boyd's Energy Maneuverability Theory was seminal in the development of two of our premier fighters: first the F-15 and then the F-16. 
That theory helped to shape the design of those two very important airplanes. 
So, Mr. President, John Boyd was truly a giant in the field of air warfare. 
When I first met John in early 1983, he was applying his genius in an entirely different field. 
He had retired from the Air Force and had set up shop over in the Pentagon. 
He was given a small consulting contract and a cubbyhole-size office to go with it. 
His Pentagon cubbyhole was the birthplace of some very important ideas. 
That's when I met John Boyd. He was just beginning his reform crusade. 
He was the leader of the Military Reform Movement. 
At that point in time, I was wrestling with the Reagan administration's plan to pump up the defense budget. 
I was searching for an effective strategy to freeze the defense budget. 
Cap Weinberger was the Secretary of Defense, and he kept asking for more and more money. 
The DOD budget was at the $210 billion level that year. 
But Cap Weinberger had plans to push it first to $300, then $400, and finally to $500 billion. 
The money sacks were piled high on the steps of the Pentagon. 
It seemed like there was no way to put a lid on defense spending--that is until John Boyd walked in my office. 
To this day, I don't know how he got there. Ernie Fitzgerald may have introduced us. I don't quite remember. 
But John had a secret weapon. 
His secret weapon was Chuck Spinney. 
Chuck was an analyst in the Pentagon's office of Program Analysis and Evaluation, or PA&E. 
He had a briefing entitled `Plans/Reality Mismatch.' 
John's plan was to use Spinney's material to expose the flaws in Weinberger's plan to ramp up the defense budget. 
So I asked DOD for Mr. Spinney's briefing but ran smack into a stone wall. 
At first, the bureaucrats tried to pretend it didn't exist. 
For example, Dr. Chu, Spinney's boss, characterized Spinney's briefing as nothing more than: `Scribblings and writings gathered up and stapled together.' 
Well, that didn't wash. It just added fat to the fire. 
DOD could no longer suppress the truth. 
The Wall Street Journal and Boston Globe had already published major reports on Spinney's briefing. A number of other newspapers had it and were ready to roll. 
The press knew this was a substantial and credible piece of work. 
John's behind-the-scenes maneuvering finally led to a dramatic hearing that was held in the Senate Caucus Room in February 1983. 
It was an unprecedented event. 
It was the only joint Armed Services/Budget Committee hearing ever held. 
In a room filled with TV cameras and bright lights, Spinney treated the committee to a huge stack of his famous spaghetti charts. 
This was Spinney's bottom line: The final bill of Weinberger's 1983-87 defense plan would be $500 billion more than promised. It was devastating. 
Mr. Spinney's outstanding performance won him a place on the cover of Time Magazine on March 7, 1983. 
And it effectively put an end to Weinberger's plan to pump up the defense budget. 
Two years later, my amendment to freeze the defense budget was adopted by the Senate. 
If John Boyd hadn't come to my office and told me about Chuck Spinney, the hearing in the Senate Caucus Room might not have taken place. 
And if that hearing hadn't happened like it did, I doubt we would have succeeded in putting the brakes on Weinberger's spending plans. 
The Plans/Reality Mismatch hearing was just one episode in the history of the military reform movement, but it is the one that brought me and John together. 
There were many others. John was always the driving force behind the scenes, giving advice, planning the next move, and always talking with the press. 
John Boyd always set an example of excellence--both morally and professionally. 
Mr. President, since John died, there have been several articles published about some of his exploits. 
There was a truly beautiful obituary--if such a thing exists--in the March 13 issue of the New York Times. 
It describes John's vast contributions to air warfare. 
Second, there is a more colorful piece, which will appear in the March 24 issue of U.S. News and World Report. 
That one is written by Jim Fallows and is entitled `A Priceless Original.' 
Mr. Fallows describes some of John's important contributions against the backdrop of his unusual character traits. 
Then, there is the letter from the Marine Corps Commandant, General Krulak. 
General Krulak describes John as `an architect' of our military victory over Iraq in 1991. 
That's an oblique reference to John's `Patterns of Conflict' briefing. This piece of work had a profound impact on U.S. military thought. 
It helped our top military leadership understand the advantages of maneuver warfare. Those ideas were used to defeat Iraq. 
And finally, Col. David Hackworth has devoted his weekly column to John Boyd. It is entitled: `A Great Airman's Final Flight.'

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might consume. 
In the last few weeks, the Congress has spent considerable time considering Mexico. A great deal has been said and a number of proposals are on the table about how to respond to the President's decision to certify Mexico as fully cooperating. 
These proposals include a resolution to simply decertify Mexico. And a resolution that would put on record the Congress' concern about the lack of visible progress on drugs. We also have a House proposal that is critical of the administration. This proposal would create another minicertification process. That means we get to have this discussion on Mexico all over again in September based on a report to follow the President's summit in Mexico next month. 
In my view, these various proposals reflect a generalized concern about Mexican cooperation and a lack of consensus on how best to respond. 
We need to ask ourselves where we began on this issue. The whole reason for this debate grows out of a simple fact. Congress did not accept the President's decision on Mexico. Many in Congress doubt the willingness or ability of Mexico to fight drugs. In response, Congress sought to exercise its legal obligations under the Foreign Assistance Act to find a means to overturn his decision. The means available were not satisfactory. Thinking in the Senate does not seem to favor a straight up-or-down decertification of Mexico. In addition, any such effort, even if it should pass both Houses, will face a veto. Congress does not have the votes to override. Thus, our options on how to proceed have narrowed. 
Many people have compared the decision to decertify Colombia with the decision to certify Mexico. They have pronounced the process unfair since both countries have corruption problems but they were judged differently. While that is true, the basic reason is that the situations are not the same. The reason for decertifying Colombia was based on reasonably convincing evidence of corruption at the highest levels of Government. We do not have parallel information on Mexico. On the other hand, when you look at the same categories of achievement or cooperation, Mexico scores at least as well as Colombia on most of them. This is not to say that we should be content with what Mexico has done. I do not believe that Mexican officials are content. Nor do I think they take any pride in recent revelations about high-level corruption. My point is that we should not be hasty in making decisions about a country with whom we are so closely linked. We should not rush to decisions involving our third largest trading partner. 
Instead, I offered an approach that I believe was both reasonable and responsible. It would have maintained our concern for accountability but it did not create yet more certification procedures for us to have to get through. And I doubt that circumstances will be any less ambiguous 90 or 120 days from now. My proposal did establish clear guidelines whereby we all--Mexico, Congress, and the public--could judge the state of cooperation using the same terms of reference. This proposal would have kept the process that Congress created. We created that process with clear intent and deliberation. I do not think it is time to change that. It is not time for the proposed experiment in Government currently on the table. Given where we started, it does not achieve what we said we expected at the outset. Nevertheless, it is the only proposal on the table. Thus we come to this vote. 
I will vote for this joint resolution with reservations. I will look forward, however, to working with my collegaues in the future for a formula that ensures accountability within a framework that permits informed decisionmaking.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which, when enacted, will modify the treatment of certain veterans benefits received by veterans who reside in State veterans homes and whose care and treatment is paid for by the Medicaid program. I am joined in introducing this bill by Senator Graham. 
Veterans residing in State veterans homes, who are eligible for aid and attendance [AA] and unusual medical expense [UME] benefits, veterans benefits provided under title 38 of the United States Code, who are also eligible for Medicaid, are the only veterans in nursing homes who receive, and who are able to keep, the entire AA and UME benefit amounts. This can be as much as $1,000 per month. 
Other veterans, who reside in other types of nursing homes are receiving Medicaid, and who are also eligible for AA/UME can receive only 90 per month from the VA. 
Yet, other veterans who reside in State veterans homes but who are not eligible for the AA/UME benefits must contribute all but $90 of their income to the cost of their care. 
So, even though veterans residing in State veterans homes who are eligible for AA and UME benefits and who qualify for Medicaid have all of their treatment and living expense paid by the State Medicaid program, they nevertheless may keep as much as $1,000 per month of the AA and UME benefits. 
It might be useful for me to review how this state of affairs came to be. 
In 1990, legislation was enacted, Public Law 101-508, November 5, 1990, which modified title 38, the veterans benefits title of the United States Code, to stipulate that veterans with no dependents, on title XIX, residing in nursing homes, and eligible for AA and UME, could receive only a $90 per month personal expense allowance from the VA, rather than the full UME and AA amounts. 
State veterans homes were subsequently exempted from the definition of nursing homes which had been contained in those earlier provisions of Public Law 101-508 by legislation enacted in 1991, Public Law 102-40, May 7, 1991. 
The result was that veterans on title XIX and residing in State nursing homes continued to receive UME and AA. Until recently, the State veterans homes followed a policy of requiring that all but $90 per month of these allowances be used to defray the cost of care in the Home. 
Then, a series of Federal court decisions held that neither UME nor AA could be considered income. The court decisions appeared to focus on the definition of income used in pre- and post-eligibility income determinations for Medicaid. The court decisions essentially held that UME and AA payments to veterans did not constitute income for the purpose of post-eligibility income determination. The reasoning was that, since these monies typically were used by veterans to defray the cost of certain series they were receiving, the payments constituted a `wash' for purposes of income gain by the veterans. 
However, the frame of reference for the courts' decisions was not a nursing home environment in which a veteran receiving Medicaid benefits might find himself or herself. In other words, the UME and AA payment received by a veteran on Medicaid are provided to a veteran for services for which the State is already paying through the Medicaid program. The veteran is not paying for these services with their own income. So, as a consequence of the court decisions, these payments to the veteran in State veterans homes represent a net gain in income to the veteran; they are not paid out by the veteran to defray the cost of services the veteran is receiving. 
VA does not pay AA or UME to veterans who are also on title XIX and residing in non-State veterans home nursing homes. Those veterans get only a $90 per month personal allowance. 
And non-Medicaid eligible veterans who reside in State veterans homes must pay for services with their own funds. If they get UME and AA payments, the State veterans homes will take all but $90 of those sums to help defray the cost of the nursing home care. 
Although the written record does not document this, I believe that the purpose of exempting the State veterans homes was to allow the Homes to continue to collect all but $90 of the UME and AA paid to the eligible veteran so as to enable State veterans homes to provide service to more veterans than they otherwise would be able to provide. 
In any case, it seems highly unlikely that the purpose of exempting State veterans homes would have been to allow these veterans, and only these among similarly situated veterans, to retain the entire UME and A&A amounts. 
The legislation I am introducing today modifies section 1902(r)(1) of the Social Security Act to stipulate that, for purposes of the post-eligibility treatment of income of individuals who are institutionalized, and on title 19, the payments received under a Department of Veterans Affairs pension or compensation program, including aid and attendance and unusual medical expense payments, may be taken into account.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise today to express my views of the pending nomination. As chairman of the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I have closely studied the D.C. circuit for over a year now. And I can confidently conclude that the D.C. circuit does not need 12 judges or even 11 judges. Filling either of these two seats would just be a waste of taxpayer money--to the tune of about $1 million per year for each seat. The total price tag for funding an article III judge over the life of that judges is an average of $18 million. 
Madam President, $18 million is a whole lot of money that we would be wasting if we fill the vacancies on the D.C. circuit. 
In 1995, I chaired a hearing before the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts on the D.C. circuit. At the hearing, Judge Lawrence Silberman--who sits on that court--testified that 12 judges were just too many. According to Judge Silberman, when the D.C. circuit has too many judges there just isn't enough work to go around. 
In fact, as for the 12th seat, the main courtroom in the D.C. courthouse does not even fit 12 judges. When there are 12 judges, special arrangements have to be made when the court sits in an en banc capacity. 
I would ask my colleagues to consider the steady decrease in new cases filed in the D.C. circuit. Since 1985, the number of new case filings in the D.C. circuit has declined precipitously. And it continues to decline, even those who support filling the vacancies have to admit this. At most, the D.C. circuit is only entitled to a maximum of 10 judges under the judicial conference's formula for determining how many judges should be allotted to each court. 
Judge Silberman recently wrote to the entire Judiciary Committee to say that filling the 12th seat would be--in his words--`frivolous.' According to the latest statistics, complex cases in the D.C. circuit declined by another 23 percent, continuing the steady decline in cases in the D.C. circuit. With fewer and fewer cases per year, it doesn't make sense to put more and more judges on the D.C. circuit. That would be throwing taxpayer dollars down a rat hole. 
So the case against filling the current vacancies is compelling. I believe that Congress has a unique opportunity here. I believe that we should abolish the 12th seat and at least the 11th seat should not be filled at this time. I believe that a majority of the Juidicary Committee agrees the case has been made against filling the 12th seat and Chairman Hatch has agreed not to fill it. So, no matter what happens today, at least we know that the totally unnecessary 12th seat will not be filled. At least the taxpayers can rest a little easier on that score. 
Abolishing judicial seats is completely nonpartisan. If a judicial seat is abolished, no President-- 
Democrat or Republican--could fill it. As long as any judgeship exists, the temptation to nominate someone to fill the seat will be overwhelming--even with the outrageous cost to the American taxpayer. 
Again, according to the Federal judges themselves, the total cost to the American taxpayer for a single article III judge is about $18 million. That's not chump change. That's something to look at. That's real money we can save. 
Here in Congress, we have downsized committees and eliminated important support agencies like the Office of Technology Assessment. The same is true of the executive branch. Congress has considered the elimination of whole Cabinet posts. It is against this backdrop that we need to consider abolishing judgeships where appropriate--like in the D.C. circuit or elsewhere. 
While some may incorrectly question Congress' authority to look into these matters, we are in fact on firm constitutional ground. Article III of the Constitution gives Congress broad authority over the lower Federal courts. Also, the Constitution gives Congress the `power of the purse.' Throughout my career, I have taken this responsibility very seriously. I, too, am a taxpayer, and I want to make sure that taxpayer funds aren't wasted. 
Some may say that Congress should simply let judges decide how many judgeships should exist and how they should be allocated. I agree that we should defer to the judicial conference to some degree. However, there have been numerous occasions in the past where Congress has added judgeships without the approval of the Judicial Conference in 1990, the last time we created judgeships, the Congress created judgeships in Delaware, the District of Columbia and Washington State without the approval of the Judicial Conference. In 1984, when the 12th judgeship at issue in this hearing was created--Congress created 10 judgeships without the prior approval of the Judicial Conference. It is clear that if Congress can create judgeships without judicial approval, then Congress can leave existing judgeships vacant or abolish judgeships without judicial approval. It would be illogical for the Constitution to give Congress broad authority over the lower Federal courts and yet constrain Congress from acting unless the lower Federal courts first gave prior approval. 
Madam President, I ask my colleagues to vote `no' on the current nomination and strike a blow for fiscal responsibility. Spending $18 million on an unnecessary judge is wrong. I have nothing against the nominee. Mr. Garland seems to be well qualified and would probably make a good judge--in some other court. Now, I've been around here long enough to know where the votes are. I assume Mr. Garland will be confirmed. But, I hope that by having this vote--and we've only had four judicial votes in the last 4 years--a clear message will be sent that these nominations will no longer be taken for granted. 
Let's be honest--filling the current vacancies in the D.C. circuit is about political patronage and not about improving the quality of judicial decision making. And who gets stuck with the tab for this? The American taxpayer. I think it's time that we stand up for hardworking Americans and say no to this nomination. 
I would like to make a few comments about the Judicial nomination process in general. Just about every day or so we hear the political hue and cry about how slow the process has been. This is even though we confirmed a record number of 202 judges in President Clinton's first term--more than we did in either President Reagan's or President Bush's first term. 
I have heard the other side try to make the argument that not filling vacancies is the same as delaying justice. Well, when you have Clinton nominees or judges who are lenient on murderers because their female victim did not suffer enough, or you have a judge that tries to exclude bags of drug evidence against drug dealers, or a judge that says a bomb is not really a bomb because it did not go off and kill somebody--then I think that's when justice is denied. 
The American people have caught on to this. And, I think the American people would just as soon leave some of these seats unfilled rather than filling them with judges who are soft on criminals or who want to create their own laws. 
We have heard repeatedly from the other side that a number of judicial emergency vacancies exist. We are told that not filling these vacancies is causing terrible strife across the country. Now, to hear the term `judicial emergency' sounds like we are in dire straits. But, in fact, a judicial emergency not only means that the seat has been open for 18 months. It does not mean anything more than that, despite the rhetoric we hear. 
In fact, it is more than interesting to note that out of the 24 so-called judicial emergencies, the administration has not even bothered to make a nomination to half them. That is right, Mr. President. After all we have heard about Republicans not filling these so-called judicial emergencies which are not really emergencies, we find that the administration has not even sent up nominees for half of them after having over a year and a half to do so. 
But, we continue to hear about this so-called caseload crisis. My office even got a timely fax from the judicial conference yesterday bemoaning the increase in caseload. Well, Mr. President, I sent out the first time ever national survey to article III judges last year. I learned many things from the responses. Among them, I learned that while caseloads are rising in many jurisdictions, the majority of judges believed the caseloads were manageable with the current number of judges. A number of judges would even like to see a reduction in their ranks. 
We know that much of the increased caseload is due to prisoner petitions, which are dealt with very quickly and easily, despite the hue and cry we hear. As a matter of fact the judicial conference even admits some of the increase is due to prisoners filing in order to beat the deadline for the new filing fees we imposed. So, there may be isolated problems, but there is no national crisis--period. 
On February 5, I had the opportunity to chair a judiciary subcommittee hearing on judicial resources, concentrating on the fourth circuit. My efforts in regard to judgeship allocations are based upon need and whether the taxpayers should be paying for judgeships that just are not needed. We heard from the chief judge that filling the current two vacancies would actually make the court's work more 
difficult for a number of reasons. He argued that justice can actually be delayed with more judges because of the added uncertainty in the law with the increased number of differing panel decisions. I am sorry that only three Senators were there to hear this very enlightening testimony. 
We in the majority have been criticized for not moving fast enough on nominations. However, we know there was a higher vacancy rate in the judiciary at the end of the 103d Democrat Congress than there was at the end of the 104th Republican Congress. Even though there were 65 vacancies at the end of last year, there were only 28 nominees that were not confirmed. All of them had some kind of problem or concern attached to them. The big story here is how the administration sat on its rights and responsibilities and did not make nominations for more than half of the vacancies. And some of the 28 nominations that were not confirmed were only sent to us near the end of the Congress. Yet, the administration has the gall to blame others for their failings. 
I think it is also important to remember the great deal of deference we on this side gave to the President in his first term. As I said, we have confirmed over 200 nominees. All but four, including two Supreme Court nominees, were approved by voice vote. That is a great deal of cooperation. Some would say too much cooperation. 
But now, after 4 years of a checkered track record, it is clear to me that we need to start paying a lot more attention to whom we're confirming. Because like it or not, we are being held responsible for them. 
I cannot help but remember last year when some of us criticized a ridiculous decision by a Federal judge in New York who tried to exclude overwhelming evidence in a drug case. What was one of the first things we heard from the administration? After they also attacked the decision, they turned around and attacked the Republican Members who criticized the decision. They said, you Republicans voted for the nominee, so you share any of the blame. 
Well, the vote on Judge Baer was a voice vote. But, I think many of us woke up to the fact that the American people are going to hold us accountable for some of these judges and their bad decisions. So, there is no question the scrutiny is going to increase, thanks to this administration, and more time and effort is going to be put into these nominees. And, yes, we will continue to criticize bad decisions. If a judge that has life tenure cannot withstand criticism, then maybe he or she should not be on the bench. 
Now, having said all of this, we have before us a nominee who we're ready to vote on. I had been one of those holding up the nominee for the D.C. circuit, the nomination before us. I believe I have made the case that the 12th seat should not be filled because there is not enough work for 12 judges, or even 11 judges for that matter. My argument has always been with filling the seat--not the nominee. Now that we have two open seats--even though the caseload continues to decline--I'm willing to make a good faith effort in allowing the Garland nomination to move forward. 
But, given the continued caseload decline, and the judicial conference's own formula giving the circuit only 9.5 judges, I cannot support filling even the 11th seat. So, I will vote `no.' I assume I will be in the minority here and the nominee will be confirmed, but I think the point has to be made. I very much appreciate Chairman Hatch's efforts in regard to my concerns, and his decision to not fill the unnecessary 12th seat. 
So, there have been a lot of personal attacks lately. Motives are questioned and misrepresented. This is really beneath the Senate. And I hope it will not continue. 
Despite the attacks that have been launched against those of us who want to be responsible, all we are saying is send us qualified nominees who will interpret the law and not try to create it. Send us nominees who will not favor defendants over victims, and who will be tough on crime. Send us nominees who will uphold the Constitution and not try to change it. As long as the judgeships are actually needed, if the administration sends us these kinds of nominees, they will be confirmed. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my good friend from Illinois, the distinguished Senator, has just spoken. I would just observe that more government isn't necessarily better government, and, also, in the sense of justice more judges do not automatically guarantee better justice. 
I can remember from my service, being appointed by the Chief Justice in 1989, I believe it was, to a 2-year study, the only study we have ever had, of the Federal judiciary that we were looking and projecting what number of cases were going to have to be filed over the next couple of decades. The only conclusion you could come to, if those figures were accurate--and, so far, they have been proven to be accurate--is that you could never appoint enough judges to take care of the problems that we are having with the explosion of cases; that you have to look at a lot of other ways. How do you dispense justice in the less-adversarial environment of a courtroom and in the less-costly environment of the courtroom? For instance, what can you do for alternate dispute resolutions? There are a lot of other ways that I as a nonlawyer am not qualified to speak to. But I can tell you that more judges is never going to solve the problem of more cases. 
Another area we have to do something about is tort reform, as an example of something that we have to do about the number of cases piling up. 
So I just ask my good friend from Illinois to think about those things as well. 
I want to respond to some of the comments raised by those who feel that the caseload statistics indicate that filling the 11th seat is necessary. In my view, this is not a fair reading of the caseload numbers. 
I point my colleagues' attention to a Washington Times editorial which appeared on October 30, 1995. That editorial considered the question of whether or not the administrative type of cases in the D.C. circuit are really as complicated and so complicated that caseload statistics can be misleading. I would like to quote from that editorial. 
Per panel the District of Columbia circuit averages at best half the dispositions of other circuits. To make a perfectly reasonable comparison that takes account of the greater complexity of the cases in the D.C. circuit, then we should be asking, Is each case in the D.C. circuit on average twice as complicated as the average case in the other circuits? That seems unlikely in the extreme. 
It seems to me that this point is exactly correct. Granted, the caseload of the circuit is a little different. I grant that. 
I agree with the point made in a hearing I held on the District of Columbia circuit in my subcommittee. The point is that other circuits--the second circuit in particular--have a large percentage of complicated cases. In the second circuit, those cases are complex, commercial litigations coming out of New York City. But you do not hear people complaining that the total staffing level of the second circuit should not be determined according to those statistics. 
So I believe that complexity of cases in the D.C. circuit is overstated. It really is a nonargument when the number of agency cases has declined by 23 percent in the last year. Moreover, now the District of Columbia circuit has a senior judge. That happens 
to be a former member of this body, Judge Buckley. Since senior judges must carry at least a one-third caseload, and they typically carry a one-half caseload, it is fair to consider the District of Columbia circuit as having 10 1/2 judges right now when the ratio says 9 1/2 judges. 
So let's see if what we have works because what we have right now won't cost the taxpayers any more money. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan effort to relieve the estate tax burden on the American family. I want to thank the other original cosponsors and particularly the Majority Leader. Estate tax relief is on the respective top ten legislative objective lists of both parties. It is my honor to lead the effort for my party. I think that estate tax reform will happen in this Congress. Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to associate themselves with our bipartisan legislation. It doubtlessly will become the focus of the estate tax reform efforts in the Senate efforts. The list of original cosponsors already includes Senators Baucus, Lott, Breaux, Nickles, Murkowski, Kerrey, Hagel, Torricelli, Landreiu, and Mr. Hutchinson. 
I will go about this introductory statement in two steps. First, I am going to discuss the importance of this legislation to my state of Iowa. Then, I will make some remarks about the specific provisions of the bill. 
In nearly every area of my state and the nation, we saw in the past decade estate tax ultimately confiscate many family farms. For example, in 1981, the children of two family farmers in Hancock County, Iowa, inherited tracks of land that were debt free. In both of these cases a father was passing the farm to one of his children. The estate was forced to borrow the amount to pay for both the state inheritance tax and the federal estate tax. At the time, the profitability of farming was low, and the value of farm land plummeted. In both cases the estate tax unfortunately brought about the foreclosure of these farms which had been in each family for four generations. 
That was sixteen years ago, and the estate tax has hardly improved since then. The general estate tax exemption has risen to $600,000, but that number is over $200,000 behind the rate of inflation. The important thing to keep in mind about estate tax reform is that estates do not pay taxes, surviving families pay taxes. This bill is simply about fairness and equity for families. Furthermore, it is about correcting latent defects in the estate tax rules that make tax lawyers rich, but also make families crazy. 
Reform in this legislation comes in three major parts. First, we increase the broad based estate tax exemption from $600,000 to $1,000,000 over a period of six years. Second, we grant family owned businesses relief similar to what was introduced by former Senators Dole and Pryor. For businesses 
passed down among the family, this bill provides a complete exemption for the first $1,500,000 of family business assets. It also provides an additional 50 percent exemption on the next $8,500,000. Thus, there is a $10,000,000 cap on our family-owned business relief. This provision is therefore a smaller provision than the original Dole/Pryor legislation. 
Finally there is a section that I call repair and maintenance. Here we improve some popular existing provisions. For example, housekeeping and improvement is done to special use valuation. The Government financed estate tax deferral provision is improved. A generation skipping tax equity problem is fixed that has already been passed twice but vetoed for unrelated reasons. Finally, an IRS gift tax audit statute of limitations problem for families is fixed. 
Because it is especially complicated, I want to discuss the generation skipping transfer tax problem that is addressed in the repair and maintenance section of this bill. For reference purposes, this legislation was known as bill number S. 1170 in the 104th Congress. It too was passed on the Balanced Budget Act of 1995 which was subsequently vetoed. 
The GST tax is an extra tax that families pay when a grandparent makes a gift to a grandchild. The provision in our bill has the support of over 200 charities in the Nation including the public universities in my State of Iowa. It has passed twice in the last 10 years, but was not enacted because the greater legislation was vetoed for unrelated reasons. 
Our provision expands the current law predeceased parent exception. This is an exception to the GST tax where a grandparent gifts to a grandchild but the grandchild's parent has already died. The grandchild steps up into the place of the parent. In our bill, this exception is broadened to include gifts not only to grandchildren with predeceased parents but also grandnieces and grandnephews. The expansion to include these gifts that are affected by trusts is necessary to promote charitable giving and also protect families. The White House supported this provision during the debate of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, given the prospective effective date as in our bill. 
Humility requires me to admit that each of these provisions passed as part of the vetoed Balanced Budget Act of 1995. In some places we have made technical improvements suggested by the tax experts, but by and large there is little original thought here. If you have good legislation you don't need to improve upon it. 
Some will ask about how this estate tax bill fits into the debate over a balanced budget. The answer is that the balanced budget is still a No. 1 priority and this bill will need to fit in a balanced budget. Since the White House has supported provisions in the President's budget similar to these provisions, we should expect the White House to offer assistance to us in resolving the estate tax problem. If the era of big government is over, then the White House should step up to the plate and aid us in eliminating estate tax theft upon surviving families.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I join Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota in introducing legislation aimed at reversing the lack of qualified nurse aides in rural America by encouraging local training programs to continue their work. Our goal is to improve the level of care in nursing homes. Increasing the availability of qualified staff in rural nursing homes will help older Americans live better lives. 
Many rural nursing homes rely on their own training programs to certify nurse aides. Current Federal law allows these training programs to be terminated due to problems unrelated to the quality of the training program. In rural areas, terminating a nurse aide training program can result in a lack of qualified staff at a rural facility. Therefore, terminating a nurse training program can actually make conditions worse, not better. 
This bill ensures that nurse aide training programs will be judged on their own merits, not on outside factors. This is commonsense legislation. Judging people on their actions and programs on their results is the American way. Judging training programs on outside factors doesn't penalize the substandard nursing homes, it penalizes older Americans.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to continue my observations about major problems in the FBI's crime lab, and about the Bureau's failed leadership. This is my fourth such statement. 
My colleagues are no doubt curious about the harshness of my criticisms of the Bureau's leadership. But my critique directly matches the level of the Bureau's misleading of the public. 
I have not been unfair or unmeasured in my comments. I dare say, I have been softer on the FBI than others in Congress. Yet the ranks of those of us who are perturbed are growing swiftly. 
I have raised these issues for two reasons: First, to use the Justice Department's and FBI's own documents to show where the Bureau is misleading the public; and second, to contribute an understanding of why it is happening. 
I will briefly remind my colleagues of what I already revealed before this body. Many of the allegations of the lab's whistleblower--Dr. Frederic Whitehurst--are being substantiated. FBI documents are showing that. In previous statements, I have referenced three problem cases, examined by the Justice Department's Inspector General, that were uncovered by the press. The three cases are those of Alcee L. Hastings, George Trepal, and Walter Leroy Moody. The conduct of specific FBI agents in each of these cases is in question. 
Second, the FBI tried to explain Dr. Whitehurst away by questioning his credibility, and saying no one else backs up his allegations. But now we know that is false. At least two other scientists have backed him up. One has been made public. The other is fixing to. 
Third, we now know that the FBI investigated these same allegations, knew about the problems, and covered them up. They did not fix them. They covered them up. The IG, then, took an independent look and flushed out the problems. The Bureau is now doing a mad scramble to control the damage. At the heart of its damage control operation is an effort to mislead. And that effort comes right from the top of the FBI. Right from the Director himself--Louis Freeh. 
But their scheme is unraveling, Mr. President. I rise today, to assist in the unraveling process. The public has a right to know what the FBI is covering up. And I am here to help them know. 
The latest case of misleading by the FBI involves the public testimony of Mr. Freeh approximately 2 weeks ago. On March 5, Mr. Freeh testified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State. The chairman is Representative Harold Rogers of Kentucky. 
During the hearing, Mr. Freeh was asked why the FBI placed Dr. Whitehurst on administrative leave. In response, Mr. Freeh stated: 
[T]he action that was taken against Mr. Whitehurst was taken solely and directly on the basis of the recommendation by the Inspector General and their findings with respect to Mr. Whitehurst.... 
Mr. Freeh also said the IG, Mr. Michael Bromwich, was notified about the action and had not objected. Mr. Freeh concludes by saying: 
The only reason that action was taken was because of what the Inspector General wrote and recommended to the FBI. 
When the IG found out what Director Freeh had stated, he fired off a letter the very next day. He demanded that Mr. Freeh correct the record in three specific areas. 
First, the FBI has consistently maintained that it was not just the IG report that factored into action against Dr. Whitehurst. I know this, Mr. President, because the Deputy Director, Weldon Kennedy, told me the same thing. The other reason involves the FBI's belief that Dr. Whitehurst would not answer questions in an administrative inquiry. It seems the FBI Director is using the IG report to hide behind. In my view, he wants the public to think he was forced by the IG to take action against a whistleblower. 
Second, the IG says it is inaccurate for Mr. Freeh to say the IG did not object to action against Dr. Whitehurst. In fact, the IG spent over a year objecting to such treatment of Dr. Whitehurst. I had not known this before, Mr. President. According to the IG, representatives of the FBI had an active campaign--for more than a year--to take action against the whistleblower. The IG spells this out in detail in his letter. 
That sounds suspiciously like retaliation against a whistleblower. And as you know, Congress has passed statutes prohibiting retaliation against whitleblowers. But it would certainly explain why the FBI is over-reacting to the IG's report, with respect to Dr. Whitehurst. I suspect that the IG would have had nothing but praise for Dr. Whitehurst, and the Bureau's response would still be, `See? The IG recommends that we fire Whitehurst!' 
I met on January 28 with then-Deputy Director Kennedy. I asked him what it was in the IG report that he thought gave the FBI grounds to take action against Dr. Whitehurst. I am bound to maintain the confidence of what is contained in the report that Mr. Kennedy cited. But let me assure you, Mr. President. When you see the report, you will be scratching your head in bewilderment. I was. 
Third, the IG says no such recommendation pertaining to Dr. Whitehurst is in his report. 
These were the three specific points about which the IG took issue with Mr. Freeh. If I could offer a translation, I will bet Mr. Bromwich thought Mr. Freeh misled the subcommittee. If Mr. Bromwich indeed reached that conclusion, the facts would be on his side. 
The IG's request that Mr. Freeh correct the record was responded to on March 11. In letters to both Mr. Bromwich and Mr. Rogers, Mr. Freeh appears to do what some of his agents have been accused of doing in a court room--cutting corners to get a conviction.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, to begin with, Mr. Freeh, in his letter to the IG--just as Mr. Kennedy did with me--believes that he can interpret the IG's report better than the IG can. He is saying to the IG, in effect, `I don't care what you meant to say about Dr. Whitehurst. I care about what you said.' He then plays a game of semantics and interprets the IG report as he wishes, not as the IG intended. 
Then, elsewhere in the letters, Mr. Freeh takes a few pot shots at Dr. Whitehurst and at the IG. I understand why he would take pot shots at the IG. After all, the IG did an independent investigation of the crime lab. He apparently, according to news accounts, found credibility in many of Dr. Whitehurst's allegations. And that contradicts the FBI's own findings, which were nothing more than a whitewash of the exact same allegations. And the whitewash was done under this current director, Director Freeh. And Director Freeh personally signed off on the review. So, yes, I understand what would motivate the FBI Director to go after the IG. 
But it is less clear why Mr. Freeh, before a subcommittee of Congress and later under his own signature, would go after Dr. Whitehurst. Why would the FBI Director involve himself, by misleading the public and the subcommittee, in an attack on Dr. Whitehurst? After all, Mr. Freeh recused himself from matters dealing with Dr. Whitehurst. Last week, I released the document showing the recusal. 
What kind of recusal is this? Is this part of a Kafka novel? Now, everyone in the entire Justice Department, including the FBI, knows how the FBI Director feels about Dr. Whitehurst. When decision-time comes to fire or retain Dr. Whitehurst, everyone has the message, directly from the FBI Director, regarding what he thinks about Dr. Whitehurst. 
Finally, Mr. President, since I am on the subject of misleading. On March 5, the same day Mr. Freeh misled the Nation and the subcommittee on the IG report, he misled the public in another way. He announced in a press release the enhancement of a more independent Office of Professional Responsibility, or OPR. The new head of OPR would report directly to Mr. Freeh and his deputy. 
But how can it be independent? It reports directly to Mr. Freeh and his deputy. Am I again reading one of Kafka's novels? Think of how reassuring the new, independent OPR is for Dr. Whitehurst, given what the Director said about him this past week. 
The one truism that I have uncovered in all this, Mr. President, is this: The FBI has shown, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it cannot police itself. This institution--the U.S. Congress--has bent over backward over the years to give the FBI what it says it needs. We have done it in good faith. We have done it without performing the necessary oversight. We put too much trust in the FBI. The FBI has squandered our trust. 
In the coming weeks and months, I will attempt to show that, at the expense of fighting crime effectively, the FBI has engaged in a colossal campaign to build its empire. They have done it right under the noses of our oversight committees, the Judiciary Committees--of which I have been a member since I came to the Senate. 
What the FBI needs is a good dose of oversight. They need to be reined in. There needs to be more independent oversight of their management. There needs to be more accountability of their budget, which has grown too large too quickly. 
The FBI's leadership has come under fire because of its response to problems that have surfaced. It has chosen to mislead rather than acknowledge. That tells me, the Bureau is more worried about its image than its product. 
Until the FBI acknowledges it cannot police itself, and works with Congress to establish more and better oversight, the FBI's leaders will keep taking heavy criticism from Capitol Hill.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to prohibit the payment of Social Security benefits to convicted criminals who are incarcerated at the expense of hard-working taxpayers. 
The fate of the Social Security program has become a major topic of debate in Washington and in the homes of the American people. In the news, on Capitol Hill, and in the conversations of people all across this country the question of how to address the pending financial problems of Social Security has caused considerable anxiety. Congress must face one of its stiffest challenges in the next couple of years to enact legislation that will rescue the Social Security program for the long term. 
However, there are other flaws in the Social Security program that we must not overlook. Because Social Security provides a lifelong entitlement to cash and health care, it is often a target of fraud and abuse. In the last couple of years, we have taken action to suspend benefits paid to drug addicts and alcoholics and have increased funding so the Social Security Administration can perform continuing disability reviews which ensure that beneficiaries who may have recovered are no longer receiving benefits. 
Just last year, Congress enacted legislation to help SSA identify prisoners who received benefits from the Supplemental Security Income Program. Unfortunately, Congress was unable to provide similar help to the Social Security Disability Insurance Program. 
No one incarcerated for a crime should continue to collect Social Security Disability Insurance. Criminals should not be allowed to double dip and receive Federal money earmarked for the purchase of food and clothing while they are part of a prison system which provides these necessities already. The average SSDI payment in January of 1996 was $682. When an individual's shelter, food, and clothing needs are already being paid for at government expense--at least $13,000 a year in some States--paying out additional Federal funds is inexcusable. 
Under current law, criminals are prohibited from collecting disability insurance benefits if they are incarcerated and if that incarceration arises from a conviction punishable by imprisonment of more than one year. However, this narrow standard applies to a limited number of criminals. 
In order to fully confront this problem we must enact legislation that accomplishes two goals. First, the law needs to be expanded to close the existing loophole that allows criminals who are serving time for misdemeanors or who receive a sentence of less than one year to continue to collect benefits. Second, we must amend the law to facilitate the flow of information between Federal, State, county and local officials. 
Right now, SSA is able to identify only a few of the individuals who have been imprisoned to stop their benefits. The Social Security Act already requires that any Federal, State, county or local agency send the SSA the names and social security numbers of anyone who is confined to a penal institution or correctional facility in writing. 
What's needed is an incentive for State and local law enforcement authorities to report to the SSA any inmate illegally collecting DI benefits. In testimony to the House Ways and Means Oversight Committee on March 4, 1996, the General Accounting Office testified that SSA lacks timely and accurate information to stop benefit payments to prisoners. 
My bill provides State and local law enforcement agencies with a financial incentive to report convicted criminals who are receiving benefits while serving time in jail. The bill awards $400 for each criminal reported to SSA within the first 30 days of confinement, and $200 if the required information is reported to SSA after the 30 day period ends. If the local authorities do not notify SSA within 90 days after confinement begins, no award will be made. 
Last year, as part of welfare reform we took steps to stop the flagrant abuse of the Social Security system with respect to SSI payments. Now we must finish the job by extending the law to include the illegal collection of DI benefits. 
By passing this legislation we will protect the financial soundness of Social Security disability insurance and preserve the program for the people it is meant to assist. The only way to protect the hard-earned money of the American taxpayer is to insure that every penny is being spent properly. This legislation is projected to save $35 million over the next 7 years. In this day of hundreds of billions of dollars in deficit this may not seem overwhelming, but it will ease the administrative burden on SSA and most importantly, help restore confidence in this vital program.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there is no dispute that a lot of drugs reach this country through Mexico. Not we, not the administration, not Mexico challenge this fact. Just as clearly, we must be concerned about this traffic in illegal drugs. We must be concerned for what this poisonous trade is doing to our country and to our kids. We must be concerned for what the drug money that results from this trade is doing to build criminal empires able to challenge and corrupt whole countries. For these reasons, the United States and Mexico have a shared interest in stopping an illegal trade that is so damaging to both our peoples and our institutions. 
Mexico acknowledges its responsibility to help in combating the production and transit of illegal drugs. The production and transit of these drugs are illegal under Mexican law. Mexico is a party to a variety of international agreements to stop these practices. It also has bilateral agreements with the United States to the same effect. Thus, by solemn agreement, Mexico, along with most others countries, is committed in principle and practice to taking effective action to stop illegal drug production and transit. 
The United States has a long and deeply intertwined relationship with Mexico, a relationship that is very important to both countries. Whether for good or ill, we are linked to Mexico and Mexico to us. Thus, we must be particularly thoughtful in how we treat that relationship. 
The resolution I am offering today does not amend the certification process. It does not change the President's decision to certify Mexico--today. What it does do is send a clear, strong message from Congress that, while we have heard many promises, we have seen little action. And actions--appropriate actions--are paramount. While a change in the certification process may be necessary, doing so without taking the time to hold hearings or look at the possible solutions is hasty. We need to consider our next steps carefully. 
There has been a lot of discussion in the last few days on what to do about Mexico. The discussion has tended to go from conditions that proposed to go too far, in my judgment, to approaches that do not go far enough. Clearly, striking the right balance on this important issue is not easy. In my view, however, we must lay down benchmarks with a clear time frame for deciding what Congress regards as the minimum we expect. After all that has been said and done in the last several days, to do less falls shy of doing anything. 
My resolution affords the Congress the time to make a reasoned determination about what to do. It requires the Administration to base its decision next March 1 on a specific set of measurable benchmarks. In brief, my proposal requires progress on nine specific issues. These include progress on establishing an interdiction network of radars, progress on extradition, progress on dealing with corruption, steps to resolve carry weapons, steps to reach a maritime agreement, and steps to resolve refueling rights. 
I believe that this approach and these measures give us the reasonable terms of reference for how to proceed. This approach gives us the opportunity and time to develop the cooperation on the drug issue that I believe we all want. 
This resolution outlines both the concerns that have been expressed by Congress and what we expect Mexico to accomplish before March 1, 1998. Not rhetoric, but actions. We ought to proceed with care before we take steps to fundamentally alter the United States-Mexican relationship. But we must keep faith with our responsibilities to the public.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the recent decision of the Justice Department regarding a qui tam lawsuit filed under the false claims act against Energy Secretary-designate Federico PenAE6a. Now, as a Senator I will not comment on the merits of an on-going court case. However, I do believe that it is appropriate to comment on what may be considered an unusual circumstance. 
As many of my colleagues may know, when someone files a qui tam lawsuit, the Department of Justice has to make a decision as to whether to intervene in the case or to decline to intervene in the case. Now, this time period is generally from 6 months to 1 year because qui tam lawsuits can be so complex. 
With regard to the PenAE6a case, the Justice Department has had the lawsuit for about 1 month and they have already made a decision--to ask the court to dismiss Secretary PenAE6a from the lawsuit. Now, I realize that Secretary PenAE6a is a cabinet nominee and a former Cabinet Member and this case might warrant expedited consideration. But this seems like a rush to judgment. It seems unwise and it raises questions in my mind as to whether the Justice Department's decision in this case is due more to political pressure than to a genuine desire to protect taxpayer dollars. 
There are several troubling questions which remain regarding the role of the Department of Transportation, Secretary PenAE6a and other top Transportation Department officials in seeking the reinstatement of a Government contract with the D.M.E. Corp. which the Coast Guard had terminated in March 1994. According to documents supplied to me by the Coast Guard, the D.M.E. Corp. was simply unable to satisfy the contract. Also, according to a memo prepared by the legal adviser to the Coast Guard, a financial audit revealed such serious irregularities that the FBI recommended that D.M.E. be prosecuted for fraud. Did Department of Transportation officials know of the FBI's recommendation when they pressured the Coast Guard to sign a memorandum of understanding committing the Coast Guard to reinstate the D.M.E. contract? 
As it happens, Ms. Lus Hopewell, who was Mr. PenAE6a's top aid for the affirmative action programs for the Transportation Department had been the executive director of the Latin American Management Association immediately prior to working for the Transportation Department. Mr. Luis Mola who was the president of D.M.E: the company whose contract was terminated--sat on the board of directors for the Latin American Management Association. Should Ms. Hopewell have recused herself? Did she disclose to her superiors that she had in effect worked for Mola only months before at her previous job as she was working to get D.M.E. reinstated?

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would also like to point out that D.M.E. has received approximately $30 million in contracts with the Transportation Department. Roughly one-half of those contracts were entered into after the Coast Guard audit detected financial irregularities. Did the questionable practices of D.M.E. at least cause concern within the Transportation Department? 
Now these concerns shouldn't necessarily prevent Secretary PenAE6a's nomination from going forward at this time, but there are serious questions about public integrity which require serious answers--not politically expedient ones.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I introduce important tax legislation to improve our Nation's soil conservation and water quality. This measure will extend the conservation expense income tax deduction to farmers who improve soil and water conservation and need to rent that farmland to family members on a cash basis. This legislation builds upon an existing and successful income tax provision that applies to similar improvements on sharecrop rentals. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and thereby endorse an environmental tax policy that uniformly encourages conservation improvements on our Nation's farms. 
Across all of our Nation's farmland, 4 out of 5 acres rely on private landowners and tenants to care for the natural resources. Even though all farmers should be encouraged to become good stewards of the land, current tax policy does not provide incentives to encourage all private landowners and tenants to make conservation improvements that are consistent with good environmental policy. On the one hand, farm landlords operating on a sharecrop basis are rewarded with an income tax deduction for soil and water conservation improvements. However, cash rent landlords who make the same conservation improvements are denied a similar income tax deduction. My legislation will 
eliminate this inequality. 
Mr. President, 43 percent of our Nation's farmland is rented. Of that farmland, 35 percent is rented on a sharecrop basis, and 65 percent is rented on a cash basis. Sharecrop rentals are arrangements where landlords typically contribute the real estate and improvements, and tenants contribute the labor. Cash rentals are also arrangements where landlords usually contribute the real estate and improvements. However, the landlords also contribute labor since these agreements exist many times within a family farm environment. 
To further compare, sharecrop landlords may deduct certain costs paid or incurred for the treatment or moving of earth for soil and water conservation, including the leveling, conditioning, grading, and terracing of farmland. Likewise, sharecrop landlords may also deduct costs incurred to build and maintain drainage ditches and earthen dams. Cash rentals, however, are not provided a tax deduction even though they practice similar conservation methods. In other words, though the substance of these rentals is similar, the tax treatment of conservation expenses is vastly different. 
Mr. President, it may surprise you to know that many family farmers are cash rent landlords. The life cycle of a family farm is one where aging parents gradually pass the family farm to their sons or daughters. In many cases, because the children cannot initially afford to purchase the family farms from their parents, a parent-child business relationship often starts out as a rental. Sometimes it is a sharecrop rental, other times they agree to a cash rent relationship. 
Unfortunately, our tax and environmental policy toward these two relationships remains irrational. If a landlord sharecrops with a stranger, then that landlord can deduct conservation expenditures. However, if a widowed farm wife cash rents farmland to her daughter and watches over the grandchildren while the daughter works the crops in the field, the grandmother cannot deduct conservation expenditures. Similarly, a retired father who cash rents to his son and provides labor assistance during harvest is likewise denied a conservation tax deduction. 
I believe that our tax policy should encourage and reward sound soil conservation practices regardless of the situation of the farmers. At a minimum, our tax policy should reward family farmers who make long term soil conservation improvements to any of their farmland. In fact, these sound conservation practices have already aided many farmers in reducing our level of soil erosion. The USDA reported in its 1992 Natural Resources Inventory that soil erosion has decreased by 1 billion tons annually. The USDA attributes one half of that decrease to improved conservation efforts by farmers. Nonetheless, our Nation's tax policy requires that family farmers on a cash rent basis bear much of the expense of this successful environmental policy. My legislation fixes this problem. Surely, it will yield even further soil and water conservation of our nation's most valuable nonrenewable resource: farmland. 
I encourage all of my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Rural Health Improvement Act of 1997, which I joined in introducing today with Senators Baucus, Rockefeller, and Thomas. 
We've heard a lot lately, Mr. President, about how hospitals are doing better financially than they have in years. ProPAC's recent report to the Congress indicated that the average prospective payment margins for hospitals are becoming healthy again. In 1995, the average PPS margin was 7.9 percent; only 3 years before, the average PPS margins were negative. 
This has truly been a remarkable turnaround, and I applaud hospitals for their success at improving their efficiency. We must remember, however, that anytime we use average statistics, there are those which are below the average, as well as those are above it. 
In my State of Iowa, as in many areas of the United States, small rural hospitals are essential links in the chain of health care access. For these small hospitals, however, economic survival is a constant struggle. 
There are limits to what we here in Congress can do to help these hospitals survive. But I believe that we have an obligation to do our best to give rural Americans a fighting chance at access to health care. And at the very least, we must not hinder small rural hospitals as they try to serve their essential role. 
Unfortunately, our Medicare policies have often been an obstacle, rather than a help. Our inflexible rules and reimbursement policies have made it even harder for small, rural hospitals to survive. I am pleased to report that the legislation we have introduced today is an important step toward making the Medicare Program a true partner with these hospitals. 
This bill expands two successful demonstration projects: the Montana Medical Assistance Facility project, and the Essential Access Community Hospital, and Rural Primary Care Hospital projects. These projects have been limited to eight States, with Iowa not among them. Mr. President, I believe that the purpose of demonstration projects is to see what works. Well, the results from the eight States have been very good. It is high time to make the same help available to hospitals in all 50 States. That is what this bill will do. 
This legislation allows the designation of certain hospitals as critical access hospitals. To qualify, hospitals must have average lengths of stay of not more than 96 hours, referral relationships with larger hospitals, and 15 or fewer beds, which may be used either for inpatient care or as swing beds. The bill also imposes a general distance requirement of 35 miles from another hospital, but this requirement need not be met if the State certifies that the hospital is a necessary provider of services to residents in the area. The ability of States to waive the 35-mile rule is crucial to hospitals in Iowa, where the distances between communities are not as vast as in some Western states. 
Critical access hospitals will be given greater flexibility in meeting Medicare regulations that were designed for larger hospitals. Most important, the legislation will help these hospitals to make their transition from acute care to less expensive primary care. This is why the General Accounting Office has found that the demonstration project has not only assisted the hospitals, and the rural Americans they serve, but that it has actually saved money for the Medicare Program. 
Mr. President, as you might expect, this bill will make a big difference in Iowa. In 1995, 43 Iowa hospitals had six or fewer inpatients per day. Of these 43, 15 had negative operating margins. Many of these are not county hospitals, and thus are not subsidized by county tax revenues. These hospitals are in a real bind, and many will benefit from this legislation. Some of the small towns which are likely to be helped are Hawarden, Primghar, Eldora, Rock Valley, Corning, and Rock Rapids. For these Iowa communities, and for many others across America, the Rural Health Improvement Act of 1997 could be a lifesaver. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. ROCKEFELLER Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues from Montana, Iowa, and Wyoming, Senators Baucus, Grassley, and Thomas, in re-introducing a very important bill for rural communities. My colleague from Montana, Senator Baucus, has long been a strong advocate of rural health care issues and I am very pleased to be working with him on such an important issue to rural America. Since Medicare's enactment in 1965, the Medicare Program has played a vital role in making sure senior citizens living in rural areas have adequate access to health care services. A disproportionate number of the elderly live in rural areas. As a result, rural hospitals are heavily reliant on the Medicare Program. 
Our legislation will provide some basic assistance to help rural hospitals keep their doors open. The changes we are recommending are based on carefully studied pilot projects in West Virginia, Montana, and other States, and we think it is time to apply some very good ideas to the rest of the Nation. I am pleased that President Clinton's budget would also expand Essential Access Community Hospital [EACH] and the Rural Primary Care Hospital [RPCH] program. We are very interested in seeing the specific details of his proposal. 
Mr. President, most rural hospitals have only one choice when faced with shrinking occupancy rates, declining Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and intense market pressures to lower their costs: close their doors. That is where our bill steps in. When being a full-service hospital is no longer viable, our bill gives them a way to become what we call a critical access hospital--a way to preserve essential primary care and emergency health care services for rural America. 
West Virginia is one of only seven States that is currently allowed to operate a EACH/RPCH Program. Since we introduced our bill in the 104th Congress, the EACH/RCPH Program, once again, proved to be the salvation for a rural West Virginia county that was on the brink of losing its access to primary care and emergency care services. Because of the availability of the EACH/RCPH Program in West Virginia, the local residents of Calhoun County, WV were able to merge and reorganize two existing, but financially strapped, health care providers, the Minnie Hamilton Primary Care Center and Calhoun General Hospital. A neighboring hospital, Stonewall Jackson, stepped in and offered financial and administrative assistance during this very difficult period of time. As a result, Calhoun County now has a thriving and financially stable health care provider that is meeting the health care needs of its local residents. This is 
huge relief to the residents of Calhoun County. 
Mr. President, our bill is modeled on two separate, ongoing rural hospital demonstration projects, the EACH-RPCH Program, the other is the Montana Medical Assistance Facility [MAF] Program. The basic concept is to place limits on the number of licensed beds and patient length of stays in the participating rural hospitals, and in exchange, hospitals receive Medicare payment rates that will cover their patient care costs, along with badly needed relief from regulations that are intended for full-scale, acute care hospitals. 
We believe, based on work by the General Accounting Office, that our legislation will wind up saving the Medicare Program money. We are encouraging the development of rural health networks, to help small, rural hospitals save money and improve quality by working more closely with larger, full-service hospitals. 
I am very proud to note that West Virginia has been a leader in helping small, rural hospitals figure out how to adapt and cope with rapid changes in the economics of health care. Six hospitals in West Virginia are federally designated RPCH hospitals and six hospitals are federally designated EACH hospitals. I know that many other rural States and rural hospitals are anxious to enjoy the benefits of this program. 
Our legislation draws on the lessons learned from the pilot programs, improves on them, and expands them so that rural hospitals and patients all across America will have the same benefits. Our legislation will give other States the same opportunities already available in California, Colorado, Kansas, New York, North Carolina, South Dakota, and West Virginia through the EACH/RPCH Program and in Montana through the MAF Program. 
Our legislation is targeted at the 1,186 rural hospitals nationwide with fewer than 50 beds. While these hospitals are essential to assuring access to health care services in their local communities, these hospitals account for only 2 percent of total Medicare payments to hospitals. In return for certain limits, rural hospitals can count on Medicare payments and regulatory relief to fit their circumstances. They can form new relationships with health care providers in their community, and larger hospitals farther away, so patients have the kind of access to care where it is best to get it. 
Mr. President, as we move to adopt Medicare reforms in the Finance Committee later this year, I will be working to make sure that commonsense reforms to help rural hospitals are also adopted.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, troubling facts continue to surface in the FBI crime lab issue. These facts are putting flesh on the bones of allegations that much of the lab's analysis is sloppy, not credible, fabricated, or all of the above. 
The FBI has charged that these allegations are unfounded, and that they are the musings of one Dr. Frederic Whitehurst. Dr. Whitehurst has come forward as a whistleblower with serious charges against the lab and its management. The FBI chose to shoot the messenger instead of taking Dr. Whitehurst seriously. 
After a year of studying Dr. Whitehurst's claims and his information, I was not so sure the FBI took the wise course. Then, after a private briefing by the Justice Department's inspector general on his investigation into these matters, I was even more convinced that the FBI has taken the wrong course. And now that the FBI has taken personnel action against Dr. Whitehurst in retaliation for his telling the truth, I am convinced that the Bureau is dead wrong. 
The FBI's defense--some would say coverup--is slowly unraveling. Last week, we discovered that it wasn't just Dr. Whitehurst that has raised serious concerns. Another respected scientist, Dr. William Tobin, had raised equally serious allegations in 1989. He alleged that an FBI agent tampered with evidence and made a series of false statements while testifying in court proceedings against then-Judge Alcee L. Hastings. I discussed this before this body on February 26, Mr. President. 
The FBI covered up this matter. There may be a missing document. Last week, at my request, the Attorney General ordered that the FBI not be involved in the investigation. The investigation has been given instead to the IG. This is because there are major questions about the FBI's ability to police itself. The Attorney General gets much credit for recognizing the potential conflict involved when the FBI investigates these issues. 
In the past 2 weeks, two additional cases--in addition to the Alcee Hastings case--appear to reveal similar improper behavior by FBI agents testifying in Federal cases. If it sounds to you like a pattern is developing, Mr. President, you have been paying close attention. Up to now, the FBI's denials had been set in concrete. What you are hearing now is the sound of concrete cracking. 
Thus far, the IG has had remarkable success keeping the draft report under wraps. But a few press stories about its contents have been popping out. Last week, the Miami Herald ran a story about a Florida case reviewed by the IG. In that 1988 case, George Trepal was convicted of murdering his neighbor by poisoning her soft drink. Mr. Trepal was sentenced to death, and is still on death row. 
But as the Herald reports, the testimony of evidence linking Mr. Trepal to this murder may have been tainted by an FBI lab supervisor. The supervisor may not have had adequate scientific support to identify the poison as he did. If the Herald is correct, this is another example of the problems found in the Hastings case. 
And now there's a third case, Mr. President. The Associated Press reported yesterday that the IG found similar problems in the VANPAC case. That is the case involving the 1991 conviction of Walter Leroy Moody for the murder of U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance and Georgia civil rights attorney Robert Robinson. It was Justice Department attorney Louis J. Freeh who prosecuted the case. 
Before I get into the specifics of the FBI's wrongdoing apparently uncovered by the IG in this case, let me provide some context. 
More than a year before the bombing tragedy in Oklahoma City, Director Freeh and his general counsel, Howard Shapiro, had been fully briefed about Dr. Whitehurst's allegations of misconduct within the lab. They were aware of Whitehurst's charges of a systemic quality control breakdown in the lab. 
On February 7, 1994, Whitehurst's attorney wrote to Mr. Shapiro informing him of the sensitive nature of the allegations, and how a thousand cases could be affected. Whitehurst asked that a special, independent, or outside counsel review the matters. 
But the FBI chose another course. It did not empanel an independent review. Instead, the matter was assigned to two attorneys within the Office of the general counsel. They reported directly to Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Freeh. 
No scientist was placed in the decisionmaking chain of command. Mr. Freeh, in conjunction with his attorneys, decided they could perform a diligent and thorough internal investigation. Mr. Shapiro's exact words in his February 14 reply--and remember these words, Mr. President, because I intend to refer to them liberally in the future--his exact words were, `The FBI has a long and proud history of performing diligent and thorough internal investigations.' 
What is amazing to me is that neither Mr. Freeh nor Mr. Shapiro recused himself from the decisionmaking role with respect to the review. After all, they had prosecuted one of the cases--the VANPAC case--in which Dr. Whitehurst alleged misconduct had occurred. 
In other words, nonscientists with a conflict of interest assumed the authority to review significant allegations of scientific and evidentiary misconduct that could affect hundreds, if not thousands of cases. 
I have now obtained a redacted copy of the results of that review, headed by Mr. Freeh and Mr. Shapiro. The findings and recommendations were approved by both. 
The first thing they did was fire at the messenger. On the very first page, the FBI notes that Dr. Whitehurst could be disciplined for providing information about the lab's misconduct to Congress. 
You see, Mr. President, providing information to Congress--and I'm quoting the FBI--`violates FBI and DOJ regulations.' Were you aware, Mr. President, that FBI and DOJ regulations override the first amendment guarantee of the people's right to petition Congress? If I could anticipate your response, Mr. President, neither was I. 
The second issue: During this 1994 review, Mr. Freeh and Mr. Shapiro learned that the lab `would not meet minimal accreditation standards.' The report notes that it was `incredulous that the premiere forensic laboratory in the world' was `not accredited.' 
Instead of asking how the failure to reach minimal accreditation standards had impacted on past cases, or might impact on future cases, the FBI took a different course. The FBI concluded, `no further investigation or action' was needed. 
In other words, rather than evaluating the potentially serious ramifications of the FBI's failure to meet minimal accreditation standards, the Bureau circled the wagons and whitewashed the problem. They set up a committee to come up with a timetable for accreditation. That was 3 years ago. Now, the Bureau tells us they'll be accredited in 18 months from now. And if you believe that, Mr. President-- 
This brings me back to the VANPAC matter. As I mentioned, Mr. Freeh had been the lead prosecutor on that case. He got national recognition. Mr. Shapiro was his cocounsel. Larry Potts--of Ruby Ridge infamy--was the FBI's case agent. 
Dr. Whitehurst had alleged that there were problems with the evidence in the VANPAC case. Despite the clear conflict, Mr. Freeh and Mr. Shapiro did not recuse themselves. They recused themselves about a year and a half later--in September 1995. But at this point in time--February 1994--they kept themselves at the top of the investigation into misconduct in that case. 
Instead of using real scientists to independently review the evidence--as the IG did, by the way--Mr. Freeh and Mr. Shapiro used their own subordinates. And what was their conclusion after reviewing the VANPAC allegations, Mr. President? `Whitehurst's allegations are not supported by any facts.' That's what it says in their report. 
Now we have a new account--by the Associated Press--that gives us an insight into what the IG found in VANPAC. And it seems to conflict with the FBI's interpretation. Remember, the IG followed up on Dr. Whitehurst's suggestion, and did an independent review. And, the IG went out and recruited five of the world's most renowned lab scientists for his investigation. In other words, the IG did a proper review. 
According to the AP, the IG report states that `a lab witness overstated test results during the trial.' And that's not all. Let me quote further from the AP story: `In addition to overstated testimony in VANPAC, the report found the lab lacked databases to support its conclusions, used unvalidated tests, lacked written test procedures, inadequately documented why it discounted test results that undercut its conclusions and lacked any record for some tests.' 
Now, this is interesting if true, Mr. President. Because less than 2 months ago, on January 23, Mr. Freeh told his deputy, Weldon Kennedy, `Based upon the VANPAC allegations investigated by the Office of the Inspector General [OIG], and despite their findings that none of the allegations regarding VANPAC are substantiated, I have decided to recuse myself from any of the Whitehurst-related disciplinary or administrative matters contained in the OIG report regarding the FBI laboratory.' 
Mr. President, I'm not sure whose version is correct--Director Freeh's or the AP's. But if this AP story is correct, this is the second time Mr. Freeh has been misleading on what's in the IG report. On February 26 I pointed out on this floor Mr. Freeh's other discrepancy. He said he had been unaware of the Tobin memo: Remember, he's the other scientist I referred to earlier who lodged complaints. I questioned how he could possibly say that when the IG report containing the Tobin allegations had been on his desk for a full month. 
In sum, Mr. President, we're beginning to see some patterns that back up Dr. Whitehurst, and contradict Mr. Freeh and the FBI. First, other scientists have surfaced with allegations--not just Dr. Whitehurst. Second, it appears that three cases reviewed by the IG found misconduct and/or sloppiness. 
When I was growing up back on the farm in Iowa, we had a saying. If you reach into a barrel of apples for the first time and pull out a bad one, the chances are pretty good there's more bad apples in there. Maybe a barrel-full of bad apples. 
So far, based on press reports, that's three bad apples--three out of three. Those are pretty high odds. 
What's to be done? Director Freeh made a big splash yesterday announcing a new way to handle internal reviews of alleged criminal behavior and misconduct. He will increase the number of people working on such reviews from 30 to 60. 
The Director doesn't seem to get it, Mr. President. The issue is that the FBI can't police itself. Doubling the number of self-policers won't change the bottom line. Zero times two is still zero. 
I'm beginning to think those 60 slots are a lot better off--from the taxpayers' point of view--being moved to the IG instead. And I intend to discuss this with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee. 
The FBI does not have a long and proud history of self-policing notwithstanding what Mr. Shapiro leads us to believe. Look at Ruby Ridge. That case certainly doesn't inspire confidence in the FBI's ability to self-examine. 
Mr. President, I believe the American people are being mislead by the FBI on the problems we're seeing in its crime lab. And all that does is continue the erosion of confidence the people have in the FBI. 
It's time the Bureau stopped its narcissistic infatuation with its own image. It's time to stop selling an inferior product with false advertising. The American people deserve from its chief law enforcement agency a product with integrity. They deserve an FBI that does what it would have you believe it does. This is an issue of leadership. Quite frankly, I am beginning to join the ranks of those whose confidence in the Bureau's leadership is diminishing. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I do not see any other Members ready to speak, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in December, the Department of Health released annual figures on teenage drug use. As in the preceding 3 years, what the numbers showed was a continuing, alarming increase in teenage drug use. The number of eighth graders using any illicit drug in the year before the survey has almost doubled since 1991, from 11 to 21 percent. The proportion of increased use among 10th graders has risen by almost two-thirds, from 20 to 33 percent. It has risen by almost 50 percent among seniors in high school, from 27 to 39 percent. Stop for a minute and think about the reality behind the numbers. 
One in every five 13 year olds has used an illicit drug in the last year. One in every three 15 year olds and close to two of every five seniors have used drugs. Marijuana use is leading the way. Regular use of marijuana by kids is on the rise. Nearly 1 in every 20 seniors now uses marijuana daily. We know from bitter experience, that marijuana use, especially regular use, increases dramatically the likelihood of further, more serious drug use. We know only too well that such use leads to dramatic increases in addiction, violent crime, treatment dependency, and a cycle of hurt that can endure for years. 
Moreover, the recent survey reveals that teenage attitudes about the dangers of drug use are also changing--for the worse. An increasing number of young people at younger ages no longer see drug use as dangerous. 
Just this past Tuesday, the Partnership for a Drug Free America released information that showed that kids at younger ages, including kids in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, are starting to try drugs. 
We have not seen increases in use or changes in beliefs about the dangers of use like this since the late 1960's and 1970's. Those of us who are adults today know what that increase in use and changes in attitudes did to this country. We are still living with the consequences of social attitudes that legitimized drug use. We are still paying the costs to treat the addicts that began as teenage users then. 
Let's remind ourselves of a simple truth. The most likely users of drugs are kids. Not adults. Not grown men and women. Not our peers and friends and colleagues. Not our business partners or professional associates. Kids. It begins with kids. Most addicts today began as teenagers. Most addicts tomorrow will begin as teenagers or younger. And whom do the pushers of drugs target? Kids. Whom do the purveyors of drug messages in our movies and popular music target? Kids. 
You do not have to go very far to discover why. Young people are more vulnerable to messages that would have them test limits. They are less aware of long-term consequences for present acts. They are more easily influenced by peers and fashions. It is our kids that are most at risk for messages about drug use. It is in order to protect kids that we take steps to control drugs in our society. Even the majority of the most ardent legalization advocates do not advocate drug use by kids. Most of them draw the line at that. Most. 
But our problem lies in this. We cannot be halfhearted and ambivalent in our counterdrug messages if we are to tell our kids not to use drugs. We cannot, on the one hand, make drugs readily available and condone their use by law and custom and keep them from our kids. We have ample evidence of this in legal drugs, in the problems of teenage use of alcohol and tobacco. 
But I am talking about substances that are far worse and more dangerous. We cannot afford to make these drugs part of our daily lives. The public is aware of that. They oppose it. But what we see is a growing effort by a few to get around that opposition. Ultimately they are not likely to succeed. But they can and have so muddled the public message as to send mixed signals to the very people we want to protect. Kids. 
From music to videos to movies and political campaigns, we are seeing efforts once again to glamorize drugs. We are seeing opinion leaders and members of our cultural elite portray drug use as simply a personal choice that is harmless and benign. Many of these individuals act as if the only issue is for responsible adults to decide for themselves. They speak as if it is only adults that we need to think about. This, however, is not in fact the case. 
If you do not believe this, talk to parents. Talk to teachers. Talk to the health and law enforcement professionals who daily see the consequences. Most important, listen to what kids are telling us about what is happening in their schools. To their friends. 
Like other Members here, I receive mail from many people. Among them are our young people. Their letters are full of concern and hope. One of the concerns is about drugs in school. Thus Byron, 14 years old, writes, `As I have grown up, I have begun to notice more and more people I know using legal and illegal drugs. Never before did I even know `Meth' existed. But now, my school feels there is a need to take courses about it. I agree with you that drug use should stop, and fast.' Or Christina, 12, who writes about her concern for what's being done to stop underage drug use. Or Heath, a senior, concerned about growing use in junior high and elementary schools. Or Jennie, a junior, who has seen peers using PCP and crack or acid. Or the many others who have written confused about what they should think or what our policy is. 
It is to this and following generations that we are responsible for and to. They look to us for guidance. They rely on us to protect them and their futures. That is what is at issue here. The efforts that we undertake to keep our society drug free are the things that we do to protect our kids. We do this because it is the responsible thing to do. We do this because no sane or civilized society can long endure that fails its children. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important tort reform legislation. Tort reform is needed for many reasons--one of which is to free our courts of frivolous lawsuits. Frivolous lawsuits take the courts' time away from trying legitimate lawsuits, and deprive the truly injured of timely resolution of their claims. 
Mr. President, our courts are supposed to be venues for resolving disputes. Lawsuits are supposed to be the means by which injured parties seek relief--they are not intended to be used as weapons to harass, delay, or increase the cost to the other party. Too often entire lawsuits, or claims within ongoing lawsuits, are used as weapons. The bill that I introduce today takes a stab at these lawsuits. It toughens the penalties for filing frivolous lawsuits and insures that if someone files a frivolous lawsuit, that someone will pay. 
Our front-line defense against this misuse of the legal system is rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. This rule is intended to deter frivolous lawsuits by sanctioning the offending party. The 
power of rule 11 was diluted in 1993. This weakening is unacceptable to those of us who want to preserve courts as neutral forums for dispute resolution and who believe that lawsuits are not weapons of revenge, but a means for an injured party to gain relief. 
Senator Brown introduced a bill very similar to this legislation in the last Congress. The Senate adopted the text of his bill as an amendment to the Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act. His amendment passed by a vote of 56 to 37. 
The bill that I am introducing today is similar, but not identical to Senator Brown's bill. The civil rights community raised some concerns with his bill, and my version of the legislation is responsive to these concerns. The provision that was opposed reinstated the rule 11 requirement that allegations contained in motions and other court papers be well grounded in fact when filed, rather than allowing a `reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.' Unlike Senator Brown's bill, my bill does not change this subsection of rule 11. 
My bill does take strong steps to thwart frivolous lawsuits. First, my bill makes sanctions for the violation of this rule mandatory. One of the most harmful changes that took effect in 1993 was to make sanctions for proven violations of this rule permissive. This means that if a party files a lawsuit simply to harass another party, and the court decides that this is in fact the case, the offending party still might not be sanctioned. This is unacceptable. The offending party might not be punished at all, which provides no deterrence for this offending party or anyone else who wants to misuse the courts. My bill reinstates the requirement that if there is a violation of this rule, there are sanctions. 
My bill also removes the limitation on sanctions, and allows sanctions to be paid to the injured party for more than attorneys' fees and expenses. In addition, this legislation allows the sanctioning of attorneys for arguing for an extension of current law if their actions violate this rule. Again, if the rule is violated, there needs to be sanctions. 
Mr. President, this bill will not, by itself, stop the misuse of our courts. It is, however, a good first step. It is a necessary step. It is a bill that we must pass to sanction those who use the legal system to harass and torment others. That is not what the courts were established to do. We must protect the integrity of the courts and preserve them for proper use.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, would you please notify me when I have used 14 minutes, because I want 1 minute on the Hollings issue as well. 
Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of Ms. Charlene Barshefsky as United States Trade Representative. Ms. Barshefsky has served as acting USTR since April 1996. So we are all familiar with her work. I have personally worked with her and her staff on several issues in the past year. And I had the opportunity to watch her in Singapore, at the WTO ministerial, negotiate the Information Technology Agreement. Based on her job performance and her international reputation as a strong advocate for U.S. interests, I am prepared to support her nomination today. 
Mr. President, the next 4 years will be crucial for U.S. trade policy. We are beginning our fourth year under the North American Free-Trade Agreement and third year under the World Trade Organization. The U.S. Trade Representative must closely monitor the implementation of these agreements to ensure they are working to open markets to American exports. 
FAST-TRACK NEGOTIATIONS 
The USTR will also serve as President Clinton's point person in several key negotiations. First, she will have to negotiate with Congress on fast track authority. As you know, Mr. President, fast track means that Congress grants to the administration its authority to negotiate trade agreements. Once an agreement is reached, it must be ratified by Congress within a specified period of time and is not subject to amendment. 
Fast track is necessary because Congress, alone, has the constitutional authority to enter into trade agreements. But as a practical matter, other nations are reluctant to negotiate agreements with the President, that may later be modified by Congress. So I do believe it's necessary that Congress grant fast track authority to the President. 
But fast track is a significant delegation of power. So its crucial that Congress carefully tailor this delegation in order to accomplish its goals. And it's important that the President, in carrying out this delegation, negotiate within the parameters of the authority granted to him. 
Herein lies the problem. Congress and the President often have different ideas of what should be included in trade agreements. This administration has made it clear that they want the authority to negotiate on labor and environmental issues under the fast track process. But most of us Republicans don't believe that these issues should be part of trade agreements. 
So Congress has not given the President fast track authority 
since 1994. And our foreign trading partners now doubt the desire of the United States to lead on trade issues. We are being left by the wayside. For example, after 3 years of NAFTA we are beginning to see very positive results. Through the third quarter of 1996, for instance, exports to Mexico just from my State of Iowa are up over 34 percent. The three NAFTA nations are now the world's largest trading bloc. And it's time to begin looking at expanding this free trade area to other nations in the Western Hemisphere. 
But this cannot happen without fast track. So I implore Ms. Barshefsky to negotiate with Congress in good faith to achieve fast track. Let's put aside our partisan differences. And let's remember that trade is the focus of these agreements. The United States cannot continue to insist on addressing other issues within the context of trade agreements. 
Issues such as environmental and labor standards are very important. But there are avenues other than trade agreements that ought to be pursued to influence the behavior of other countries. And the expansion of trade, itself, with another country can be an effective inroad for making change. 
So let trade agreements stand on their own. They are difficult enough to negotiate without taking on the weight of these other issues. I'll have more to say on fast track as negotiations progress with the administration. 
CHINA'S ENTRY INTO THE WTO 
Mr. President, I hope that Ms. Barshefsky does not have to spend all of her time negotiating with Congress. She also faces very critical negotiations on admitting China as a member of the World Trade Organization. These negotiations could affect the U.S. trade balance for decades. I am reminded of Japan's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in the 1950's. It seems that we are still paying for lowering the standards to let Japan into the GATT. 
In the area of agriculture trade, which is very important to my State, these negotiations may determine whether China becomes our largest export market or our biggest competitor. The stakes are extremely high for American farmers. 
That's why I'm concerned that some members of the Clinton administration want to let China into the WTO at any cost. So I took the liberty of asking both Secretary of State Albright and Ambassador Barshefsky about the terms of China's entry. I want to quote from their answers in order to get their opinions on the public record. 
Secretary Albright said, 
We have requested that China make significant commitments to liberalize its agricultural trading regime, including reforming its state trading system, making substantial tariff cuts, eliminating unjustified sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and binding its subsidy levels. 
She also stated: 
If China is to join the WTO, we will need to have a commercially acceptable protocol package of commitments by China to open its markets in-hand before we will agree to China's accession. That means real market access for U.S. goods and services, including agriculture. 
Then I asked Ms. Barshefsky to comment on Secretary Albright's statements. She said, 
I fully agree with the two above statements. China's WTO accession can only occur on commercially meaningful terms. And, just as you quote Secretary Albright, that means market access for our goods, services and agriculture to the fastest growing economy in the world. 
Mr. President, I am pleased with the way that both Ambassador Barshefsky and Secretary of State Albright responded to my questions. I hope this will continue to be the policy of their agencies. 
I understand that it is very important to integrate China into these multilateral organizations. I have always believed that we can encourage change in China more effectively if we engage them economically. But we cannot sacrifice the interests of American workers and farmers by allowing China to subsidy their industries while keeping their markets closed. 
So I will continue to monitor very closely the ongoing negotiations with China. And I encourage Ms. Barshefsky to continue to take a hard line on this issue. I'm reminded of a meeting that I had with Ms. Barshefsky in Singapore when we were attending the WTO ministerial meeting. Since it was reported in the local press, I don't think I'm breaching any confidences by repeating it here in the Senate. 
There was a meeting of the Quad nations, which is the United States, Canada, Japan, and the European Union, concerning China's entry into the WTO. The local Singapore newspaper reported that Minister Leon Brittan of the European Union argued that bringing China into the WTO was so important that conditions of entry should be relaxed. The Japanese minister disagreed very strongly with this position. And apparently Ms. Barshefsky concurred with the Japanese minister. 
I repeat this incident just to point out that there are different views on this issue. Many nations will seek to treat China with `kids gloves.' So it is crucial that the United States play a leadership role in assuring that our interests are protected.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the drug czar released the national drug control strategy recently, as he is required to do. The President held a press conference to announce the strategy and his budget for fiscal 1998 to combat drug use in this country. This strategy now includes a request for almost $16 billion. That is about a 5.4-percent increase, which is just about average for recent drug budgets. While I welcome the strategy and the increase, I am concerned that it does not live up to the requirements set out in the law. I am even more concerned that the strategy seems to walk away from the war on drugs. This strategy would seem to have us believe that we can combat the problem of rising teenage drug abuse by simply treating the wounded. It is walking away from a war on drugs to talking about fighting a cancer. 
I have heard Mr. McCaffrey on this issue before. The view seems to be that a `war' is the wrong metaphor for our efforts. It seems that we must act as if our problem is more akin to therapy. We must treat the problem of illegal drugs and not combat it. In this view, it is time to trade in our old car for a sleek new model. I appreciate the drug czar's sensitivities on this issue, but quite frankly, this trade-in is going to buy us a lemon. 
This walking away from years of efforts to combat drug abuse and instead substituting `phrases about treating a condition' is simply waving a white flag. It sends the signal that instead of combating illegal drugs we must accept them like we would a disease. While I agree that the problem of illegal drug use and smuggling are deeply imbedded in our society, I do not buy the idea that we need to tolerate this situation. 
I do not think we gain much by blurring the language we use. I do not believe that we gain ground with our efforts to keep kids off drugs by sending weaker signals about our efforts. This is even more true at a time when kids are using more drugs. 
I am concerned that the present strategy simply doesn't have the juice needed to get us moving. The real story about the present situation of drug use in this country today is that we are losing. By the only standard that matters, whether more kids are deciding to use more drugs, our efforts are failing. In every reporting mechanism that we have, it is clear that in the last 5 years, more kids are using more drugs. 
It is clear that fewer kids are seeing drug use as dangerous. It is clear that drug use is increasingly glorified in our popular culture, in movies, music, and on TV. It is clear that legalization themes are gaining a wider circulation among our elite media and cultural leaders. With all of these things happening under our very noses, it is clear that we have a crisis on our hands. 
Today, there are some 3 million hardcore addicts in this country. Reflect for a moment on how we got this population. Most of these individuals decided to use drugs the last time this country flirted with idea that drugs were OK. Their decision in the 1960's, 1970's, and early 1980's left us with a major abuse problem. We were making progress, however, in keeping new generations from making the same mistake. That is now changing. And it is changing rapidly. We face a problem of major dimensions. In that context, we need to have a clear idea of what we need to be doing. We need to know how we are going to make a difference. 
Unfortunately, as I read the present strategy, I do not come away with a sense that we have a plan that comes to grips with the problem. 
According to section 1005 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the drug czar is required to submit to Congress each year a strategy that includes `long-range goals for reducing drug abuse in the United States,' and short-term objectives which the Director determines may be realistically achieved in the 2-year period beginning on the date of the submission of the Strategy.' It was the intent of Congress that this strategy include standards of measurement so that we could see what was being achieved. Last year, I wrote Mr. McCaffrey on this issue and made it clear that Congress expected to see clear, straightforward language on measurable standards. The House communicated a similar message. 
What we find, however, is a series of goals and objectives that contain no measurable standards. What we find is the promise that at some future date we will see an effort to have such standards. What we find is a watering down of our drug control efforts by trying to present vague guidelines in a 10-year strategy that does not address our present crisis in teenage drug use. 
We know from every survey on drug use done in this country that teen use of drugs is increasing dramatically. We know that increasingly kids see fewer dangers in using drugs. We know that kids at younger ages are starting to use drugs. We know that the legalization movement in this country is working overtime to get dangerous drugs accepted as part of normal life. 
In my view, when we are failing in our goal to keep kids off drugs, we are failing in our job. The present strategy does not tell us how we are going to reverse this trend. Certainly, vague goals and objectives and the effort to bury the need for decisive action in a 10-year approach falls short of the mark. 
This strategy is disappointing and it seeks to avoid accountability. We are in the midst of a crisis of teenage drug abuse and increasing legalization talk. Yet, the strategy avoids addressing this crisis in a clear and straightforward way. It tries to bury this crisis in tables and charts that talk about progress made in reducing drug use in the 1980's and early 1990's. This is a sandwich without the beef.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, what responsible parent has not forgone something he or she wanted for the benefit of a child? We make sacrifices today for the tomorrows of our children. We defer doing things, we give up buying something, we go out of our way. 
But it is not just in our own lives that we do things for our children's sake. We support public education. We pass safety laws. We take steps to ensure the well-being of kids. We do this out of responsibility as parents. We do this as members of a civilized community that knows the importance of investing in its future through future generations. 
Those of us who are adults today benefited from the efforts and sacrifices our parents made on our behalf. And their parents before them. 
It is in acknowledgment of these simple truths that I wanted to talk briefly about this Nation's drug problems. I want to talk about the serious challenge that we face to the health and well-being of our tomorrows in the lives of our children today. 
While we were out on the recent recess, something happened that needs concern us. In essence that was the advancement of an effort to legalize drugs in this country. It was not a fair fight. The American public, overwhelmingly, in just about every opinion vehicle I can think of, has indicated its enduring opposition to drug legalization. The well-funded legalization lobby knows this. They know they cannot fight for legalization on the merits. They cannot tell the truth about what their real agenda is. So they resort to weasel words and fast talk. As the old saying goes, you can fool some of the people some of the time, and that's usually good enough. 
What I'm talking about in this case is that those who promote legalization of drugs have resorted to appealing to the public's sense of care and concern for the sick and dying to promote drug legalization. The notion that is advanced by the legalization advocates and their money men is that smoking marijuana is a treatment for a number of physical disabilities and terminal illnesses. Relying on anecdotal evidence and the exploitation of the public's generous and caring impulses, they have slipped in legalization measures in two States and are targeting a number of others for similar treatment. They are also using this approach to go around Federal controls on illegal drugs and international treaties that commit the United States to maintaining adequate drug control policies. 
Briefly, I want to review what is being claimed and the tactics that have been used. First, let's recall a little history. We are not inexperienced in this country in seeing the medicalization of dangerous substances. At one time in this country, individuals and businesses could market anything as a medicine and make any claim for its effectiveness. In this fashion, opiates and cocaine were freely marketed in nostrums sold over the counter and through the mail. The makers of these drugs claimed miracle cures for their products. They also had endless testimonials from satisfied 
customers on how well the products performed. Here was no evidence for the claims, however. There was an increasing number of addicts, hooked on self-administered, dangerous substances marketed as medicine. As a recent article in the New Republic noted, as a result of these freely available over-the-counter drugs, addiction in this country soared in the early years of this century. Public health officials estimated that 1 in 200 Americans, including children, were addicted. 
In addition to marketing these dangerous drugs, unscrupulous businesses, and individuals also sold many concoctions made from unknown ingredients. And they made claims that these could cure anything that ailed humanity. 
Again, they could call upon boxcars full of anecdotes to support their claims. We have coined a word for these so-called medicines. We call them snake oil. We also have a word for the people who pushed them--snake oil salesmen or quacks. Our grandparents, who had to deal with these practices, woke up to the fraud that was being perpetrated on the public. They realized that dangerous drugs were creating a major addiction problem. They realized that unknown ingredients were doing great harm, either directly by poisoning people, or by keeping people from seeking real treatments for real problems. They demanded better. They demanded that we control dangerous drugs sold to the public. They insisted on truth in advertising. And they required scientific support to establish the value of things offered to the public as medicine. 
In addition, they also took steps to ban dangerous drugs and to determine what drugs had medical uses that also could be demonstrated to be safe and effective. Based on this experience, our predecessors in this body passed the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. They created the Food and Drug Administration in 1938 to ensure the availability of safe medicine. They also passed a variety of laws to deal with the use and distribution of dangerous drugs. We have continued these efforts. 
Among more recent efforts, were the development of schedules for drugs that laid out categories for dangerous drugs and their proper control in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. These schedules include a classification of drugs for their potential for abuse and their medical value. This scheduling system gives us a handle on what science and experience continue to tell us about dangerous drugs. Marijuana, along with PCP and LSD, are included in the category of drugs with a high potential for abuse and no recognized medical use in its smoked form. 
But we have not stopped here. In response to public pressure in our last major drug epidemic, we created the drug czar's office to help coordinate our national efforts. We mandated better coordination of Federal efforts through high-intensity drug trafficking areas. In addition, this body continues these efforts. We have spent a good deal of legislative time insisting that our international partners also take steps to stop the production and distribution of dangerous drugs. We are signatories to various international treaties, such as the 1988 U.N. convention, that commits us to maintaining a drug-free environment. 
These facts do not mean that various individuals stop trying to smuggle illegal drugs and sell them to the public. It does not mean that unscrupulous business enterprises or individuals stop trying to sell snake oil to the public. We cannot afford to abandon lightly the idea that things offered to the 
public as medicine must meet exacting standards and scientific validation. 
We must be cautious when confronted with sophisticated advertising campaigns that seek to circumvent Federal and State laws and establish procedures for determining safe and effective medicines. 
Indeed, it should give us pause if any group seeks to push a so-called medicine through the electoral process. One has to stop and ask why. If the motive is to provide a medicine, why is it that this so-called medicine requires an effort to by-pass science, to ignore experience, and to rely on methods wholly unsuited to the concern at hand. What we see is that various individuals are resorting to testimonials, anecdotes, and junk science. They do this to legitimize the notion that marijuana should be made available for just about any condition one can name. This is not a path that leads us to responsible public policy, sound medical practice, or a caring and compassionate approach to the sick. 
In the case of medical marijuana, we see an effort underway that seeks to by-pass good science and responsible medicine. There is no valid science that demonstrates the medical usefulness of smoking marijuana. 
Indeed, as recently as February 1994, the U.S. District Court in Washington, DC, denied a petition by marijuana legalization groups to have marijuana rescheduled. Not only did the court deny the petition of the legalizers, it specifically noted that their appeals for rescheduling were based on anecdotes and testimonials. No valid scientific studies were offered to support their claims. As the opinion notes each of the various legalization experts admitted, under oath, that he was basing his opinion on anecdotal evidence, on stories he heard from patients, and on his impressions about the drug. The science supporting the claims was not there. 
In fact, there is considerable and growing evidence to the contrary. Many of the carcinogens that accompany tobacco are present in similar or greater quantities in marijuana smoke. Moreover, a growing body of evidence indicates the serious, harmful, long-term effects for health and mental development from smoking marijuana. No major medical association or research institute supports the claim for the medical uses of smoking marijuana. The claims remain anecdotal. No major industrialized country endorses its medical use. Just recently, Holland, which condones limited public use of marijuana, has noted no medical utility for marijuana. 
On the contrary, the principal source of support for marijuana as a medicine comes from groups that favor legalization of drugs. Again, one ought to ask what is really going on when it is not the medical community clamoring for action but rather lobbying groups that seek to legalize certain drugs. 
Major funding for campaigns to support the idea of marijuana as medicine comes for individuals and groups that favor drug legalization or liberalization. The major support for the effectiveness of marijuana as a medicine comes from anecdotes. It is not based on science because the science doesn't support the claims. The legalization groups know this and have hit upon methods to try to 
legalize drugs, at this point marijuana, by other means. 
They make no pretense among themselves about the agenda. They do, however, resort to misdirection in their public pronouncements. Thus, they exploit the public's trust and goodwill to accomplish an agenda that the public has repeatedly opposed. This is not about medicine for sick people but about playing on people's sympathies to legalize a dangerous drug. 
They have sought to turn responsible public policy on its head. It is their argument that drugs are dangerous because they are illegal, not that they are illegal because they are dangerous. They would have us believe that our real problem is only the laws that make heroin or cocaine or marijuana or methamphetamine illegal for anyone to buy and use as they see fit. 
They would have us forget our own experiences. They would have us disregard the wisdom of our grandparents and others who learned a bitter lesson all those years ago. As Bill Bennett said, drugs are illegal because they are dangerous. They are not dangerous because they are illegal. We forget that simple reality at our great cost. And it will be our kids who will pay the price. 
As another old saying goes, fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, on behalf of myself, Senator Conrad, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Hollings, I am introducing two bills. If enacted, these bills would increase access to primary care for Medicare beneficiaries in rural and inner-city communities. The Primary Care Health Practitioner Incentive Act of 1997 would reform Medicare reimbursement to nurse practitioners [NP's] and clinical nurse specialists [CNS's]. The Physician Assistant Incentive Act of 1997 would reform Medicare reimbursement for physician assistants. We introduced these bills in the last three Congresses. We are reintroducing them today to improve access to primary care services for Medicare beneficiaries, particularly in rural and underserved areas. This legislation would reform Medicare policies which, under certain circumstances, restrict reimbursement for services delivered by these providers. Similar measures are included in the President's Medicare proposal and were part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. 
The Medicare Program currently covers the services of these practitioners. However, payment levels vary depending on treatment settings and geographic area. In most cases, reimbursement may not be made directly to the nonphysician provider. Rather, it must be made to the employer of the provider, often a physician. The legislation authorizing these different reimbursement arrangements was passed in an incremental fashion over the years. 
The Medicare law, which authorizes reimbursement of these providers, is also inconsistent with State law in many cases. For instance, in Iowa, State law requires nonphysicians to practice with either a supervising physician or a collaborating physician. However, under Iowa law, the supervising physician need not be physically present in the same facility as the nonphysician practitioner and, in many instances, can be located in a different site from that of the nonphysician practitioner he or she is supervising. 
Unfortunately, Medicare policy will not recognize such relationships. Instead, the law requires that the physician be present in the same building as the nonphysician practitioner in order for the services of these nonphysician providers to be reimbursed. This is known as the incident to provision, referring to services that are provided incident to a physician's services. 
This has created a problem in Iowa, Mr. President. In many parts of my State, clinics have been established using nonphysician practitioners, particularly physician assistants, to provide primary health care services in communities that are unable to recruit a physician. The presence of these practitioners insures that primary health care services will be available to the community. Iowa's Medicare carrier has strictly interpreted the incident to requirement of Medicare law as requiring the physical presence of a supervising physician in places where physician assistants practice. This has caused many of the clinics using physician assistants to close, and thus has deprived the community of primary health care services. 
Mr. President, in 1995 the Iowa Hospital Association suggested a number of ways to improve access and cost effectiveness in the Medicare Program. One of their suggestions was that this incident to restriction be relaxed. They said: 
In rural Iowa, most physicians are organized in solo or small group practices. Physician assistants are used to augment these practices. With emergency room coverage requirements, absences due to vacation, continuing education or illness and office hours in satellite clinics, there are instances on a monthly basis where the physician assistant is providing care to patients without a physician in the clinic. Medicare patients in the physician clinic where the physician assistant is located have to either wait for the physician to return from the emergency room or care is provided without this provision. 
If enacted, this legislation would establish a more uniform payment policy for these providers. It would authorize reimbursement of their services as long as they were practicing within State law and their professional scope of practice. It calls for reimbursement of these provider groups at 85 percent of the physician fee schedule for services they provide in all treatment settings and in all geographic areas. Where it is permitted under State law, reimbursement would be authorized even if these nonphysician providers are not under the direct, physical supervision of a physician. 
Currently, the services of these nonphysician practitioners are paid at 100 percent of the physician's rate when provided `incident to' a physician's services. If enacted, this legislation would discontinue this `incident to' policy. Medicare reimbursement would now be provided directly to the nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists and it would be provided to the employer of the physician assistant. These bills also call for a 10-percent bonus payment when these practitioners work in health professional shortage areas [HPSA's]. Senator Conrad and I believe these provisions will encourage nonphysician practitioners to relocate in areas in need of health care services. 
Mr. President, legislation closely paralleling these bills we are introducing today is being introduced this week in the House by Representatives Nancy Johnson and Ed Towns. In addition, these provisions are included in the President's Medicare proposal. Historically, this legislation has received bipartisan support in both Houses. Comparable legislation was included in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, as well as several other health care measures in previous Congresses. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I introduce a bill which would reinstate the Medicare-Dependent Hospital Program. 
This program expired in October 1994. As its title implied, the hospitals it helped were those which were very dependent on Medicare reimbursement. These were small--100 beds or less--rural hospitals with not less than 60 percent of total discharges or with 60 percent of total inpatient days attributable to Medicare beneficiaries. The program enabled the hospitals in question to choose the most favorable of three reimbursement methods. 
The program was extended, and phased out down to October 1994, in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. That act retained the choice of the three original reimbursement methods. But it reduced the reimbursement available from those original computation methods by 50 percent. 
My legislation would not extend the program as it was originally enacted by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. Rather, it would reinstate for 5 years the provisions contained in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. It would not have retroactive effect, however. The program would be revived for fiscal year 1998, and would terminate at the end of fiscal year 2002. 
As I noted above, the hospitals which would benefit from this program are small, rural hospitals providing an essential point of access to hospital and hospital-based services in rural areas and small towns. Obviously, if we lose these hospitals, we will also have a hard time keeping physicians in those communities. 
Mr. President, 44, or 36 percent, of Iowa's 122 community hospitals qualified to participate in this program in 1994, and 29, or 24 percent, chose to participate. I believe that this was the largest number of such hospitals of any State. 
For these hospitals, the percentage of all inpatient days attributable to Medicare patients was 77.4 percent in 1994, and Medicare discharges represented 65.5 percent of total discharges. Across all Iowa hospitals, the Association of Iowa Hospitals and Health Systems indicates that the Medicare share of inpatient days and discharges has increased in recent years, as non-Medicare admissions have dropped. As a result, it is likely that the program will provide a lifeline for even more Iowa hospitals now than in 1994. 
The expiration of the program has had a devastating effect on many of these hospitals, including a number with negative operating margins. The bottom line is that many of these hospitals have had, and will have, a very difficult time continuing to exist without the Medicare-Dependent Hospital Program. 
Mr. President, I am also going to continue to work for a limited service rural hospital bill. This bill will essentially extend the EACH/RPCH Program--the Essential Access Community Hospital and Rural Primary Care Hospital Program--to all the States. 
Taken together, these two pieces of legislation will allow the smaller hospitals in Iowa--and throughout America--to modify their missions in a deliberate and nondisruptive way, and to continue to provide the health care services essential to their communities.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, yesterday I spoke to my colleagues about management problems within the FBI, and within the Bureau's reputed crime lab. I spoke about the consequences of this mismanagement. Confidence and trust in the Nation's premiere law enforcement agency is dwindling. It is because of the FBI's own abuses of its very enormous powers. 
Yesterday, I mentioned that I would talk about a specific case, with specific allegations. The case involves apparent false statements and evidence tempering by an FBI agent in a high profile case brought before the Federal judicial system and the U.S. Congress. 
In a letter to me dated February 21, FBI Deputy Director Weldon Kennedy stated that the Justice Department inspector general `found no instance of perjury evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory evidence.' 
Mr. President, my first response to that is as follows: The IG investigation was not a criminal investigation. It therefore would not find perjury, evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory evidence. If it had been a criminal investigation, I believe Mr. Kennedy would not have said what he said. His credibility is undercut by the facts. 
This morning's Washington Post contains a story about how one FBI agent, Special Agent Michael P. Malone, apparently shaved evidence, provided false statements, and tampered with evidence for an Eleventh Circuit Court proceeding involving then-Judge Alcee L. Hastings. Mr. Hastings is now a Member of the House of Representatives. Mr. Malone is still an FBI agent, and has testified in thousands of cases. 
Despite well-documented evidence of this wrongdoing, the FBI covered it up. The evidence was documented by an FBI lab scientist, who performed lab tests on a piece of evidence in the Hastings case. Malone falsely claimed to have done the tests himself. 
The FBI scientist who made the allegations is not Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, the more well-known whistleblower from the FBI lab. Rather, it is Dr. William Tobin of the same lab. By the way, this undercuts the FBI's assertion that Dr. Whitehurst is the only one in the lab making these allegations.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Higher ups in the FBI never did a thing about this problem. Yet, it speaks to exactly the charge made by Dr. Whitehurst; namely, that the culture within the FBI is to overstate lab results to get a conviction. They do this by withholding any data that might show the opposite. 
That makes me think of an analogy, Mr. President. Imagine me standing by a dog. You ask me if my dog bites. I say `no.' You reach down to pet the dog, and he bites you. You say, `I thought you said your dog doesn't bite.' And I say, `That's not my dog.' 
The point is, I withheld valuable information to keep you from having an informed judgment. That is what the FBI does, according to Dr. Whitehurst, and in this specific case according to Dr. Tobin. And when the IG's investigative report comes out next month, we'll see if there are other examples that need following up. 
In an interview with Federal investigators, Dr. Tobin called this `forensic prostitution.' Those were his words, Mr. President. Forensic prostitution. It must be really bad when a senior, supervisory agent in the FBI's own lab calls that practice `forensic prostitution.' What does that say about the standards in the lab? And does not that back up what was charged by Dr. Whitehurst? Of course it does. 
The impact of the Tobin memo, in my view, is not whether it would change the outcome of the Alcee Hastings case. I have heard arguments on both sides. I don't know, for instance, whether it would make enough of a difference for me to have changed my vote to convict Mr. Hastings. One thing is for sure: Agent Malone sure thought it was important. But is not it simply a matter of fairness for Mr. Hastings? 
And that is not the only issue. The impact is much broader, much more serious. It raises questions about the integrity of the criminal justice process, especially the FBI's role. It raises the inference, in this highly visible case before the American people, that other evidence could have been tainted. 
This alleged wrongdoing by an FBI agent wasn't done to a terrorist, or a mad bomber. He was a sitting Federal judge, a man who held a position of prestige and influence in a separate and coequal branch of our Government. The testimony was used in a court of law, and before the U.S. Congress. 
Senior officials in the FBI knew about this. Nothing was done to correct the record. And nothing was done to discipline the agent. Is this because the culture in the FBI condones this? Is Dr. Whitehurst correct? Is Dr. Tobin correct, that forensic prostitution is condoned? 
Last night, Director Freeh issued a statement saying that this was the first time he was aware of the Tobin memo. I don't understand this, Mr. President. The Justice Department's inspector general looked into this matter. It is in the report that has been sitting on Mr. Freeh's desk since January 20. How can he say that this is the first time he has heard of this? 
Instead, he has his deputy, Weldon Kennedy, out making misleading statements to the public about how the IG didn't find any problems in the lab. I detailed this in my statement yesterday. And now we hear the Director telling us he was unaware of an issue that was on his desk for over a month. 
There is another serious issue, Mr. President. There appears to be a missing document. The Tobin memo was written after the fact of Agent Malone's allegedly false testimony. But the original report by Dr. Tobin of the testing he did on the evidence has been missing. Director Freeh's statement last night alludes to that document and the fact that it was sent to the chief counsel of the 11th Circuit, which found Judge Hastings unfit to serve. 
However, there was not a copy of that report within FBI headquarters, where it should have been. The reason it should be there is in case the inspector general or others wanted to investigate what happened. The fact of Mr. Freeh document, and that the eleventh circuit has it, does not answer the relevant question. 
Also not mentioned in the Freeh statement are concerns about the public's perception of all this. The public's confidence in Federal law enforcement is already on the wane. The FBI lab situation will only add to that. I sense that the FBI is still dancing around the truth and full disclosure. Nothing short of the truth can and will be tolerated. 
I have written today to the Justice inspector general requesting that he investigate the circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the original Tobin analysis. I have also written today to the Attorney General asking that the IG take the lead on this investigation because of possible conflicts of interest for the FBI. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me reiterate a warning I made yesterday about action against Dr. Whitehurst or any of the other scientists who might come forward. This Congress will not tolerate action against Dr. Whitehurst, or any other individual who might come forward with the truth. And that message goes for Justice Department officials, as well, who have now removed authority from the FBI for any action taken against Dr. Whitehurst.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reports of alleged mismanagement within the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been in the news, recently. Most of the reports reflect issues in the FBI's vaunted crime lab. These allegations of mismanagement come on the heals of FBI management disasters with Waco, Ruby Ridge, Filegate, and Atlanta, as well as others. 
The average citizen is wondering if this premiere law enforcement agency is out of control. The deputy director of the FBI, Weldon Kennedy, understands the significance. Two weeks ago, he said the following: 
The single thing most responsible for the success of the FBI is that `people are confident that if they come to the FBI, the matter will be handled professionally and well. If that trust ever breaks down, not only is the FBI in trouble, but the American people are in trouble. 
Mr. President, that is the issue. Weldon Kennedy hit the nail squarely on the head. 
The issue is trust and confidence in the Nation's No. 1 law enforcement agency. And in the context of other, recent management fiascos at the FBI, skepticism is validly the order of the day. 
Indeed, allegations of problems in the FBI lab are troubling. I have been working, parallel to the Justice Department's inspector general, to find out if the allegations are true or not. The IG's report is due for public release on or about March 14. 
So far, the FBI has responded to the allegations in a less than credible way. First, they shot the messenger--Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, the lab scientist who first raised the allegations. 
Next, the FBI used the typical `everything's okay' strategy to make the public think there was no problem. But that was contradicted by the facts. Weldon Kennedy said the problems in the lab wouldn't compromise any past, present, or future case. 
That statement raised a lot of eyebrows. The deputy attorney general, Jamie Gorelick, refused to confirm Mr. Kennedy's wild optimism. Her refusal to do so totally undercut Mr. Kennedy's statement. Mr. Kennedy's credibility came into question. Even Mr. Kennedy had to back off his own statement. On February 6, he admitted, `Maybe I was overstating the case.' 
But then, in a letter to me dated February 21, Mr. Kennedy went right back to defending his wildly optimistic statement--that no past, present or future case is in danger. In my view, Mr. Kennedy is playing fast and loose with reality, with a purpose to mislead the public, and mislead Congress. The simple fact is, it is much too premature for Mr. Kennedy to be making groundless predictions. For him to do so anyway shows a strategy to mislead. 
Third, I have learned that it is not just Dr. Whitehurst who has alleged wrongdoing in the FBI crime lab. Others have as well. So in the near future, I will resume speaking to my colleagues about this issue, Mr. President. At that time, I intend to discuss a very specific case with specific allegations of alleged wrongdoing. Today, however, I intend for my remarks to remain general. 
Finally, I fear the FBI has covered up the lab's shortcomings. The FBI has been aware of many of these specific problems for more than 10 years. Yet, there have been few, if any, fixes to the problems. I suspect the reason is that the obvious solution is for the lab to be accredited; but the lab is so poorly configured and maintained that it can't be accredited. So instead, the FBI calculated that it's better to `cover it up' until the new lab is constructed down at Quantico in the year 2000. 
If true, Mr. President, this decision by the FBI would be appalling. I am not prepared at this time to conclude that this is the FBI's intent. But if it is, not only is the FBI in trouble, so are the American people, as Mr. Kennedy so aptly put it. Because if this is true, it is not just a problem with the FBI crime lab; it's a problem with the FBI's overall leadership. 
As I mentioned, the IG report will be released to the public no sooner than March 14. Meanwhile, the FBI is out there spinning. In Mr. Kennedy's February 21 letter, he says the IG report, once we all read it, will ultimately reveal no problems. Here's what he says:  
[T]he Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General found no instances of perjury, evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory information. 
That's true, but irrelevant. Mr. President, never in my 16 years of sitting on the Judiciary Committee have I found a more misleading statement by an official of the FBI. It has a designed purpose of making the public think everything is under control at the FBI crime lab. 
Well, everything is not under control. The fact of the matter is--and the FBI is well aware of this, which is why Mr. Kennedy made this statement--the IG did not investigate to determine if there were any crimes committed by FBI agents--like, perjury, evidence tampering, evidence fabrication, or failure to report exculpatory information. The IG's charter was to determine management problems and administrative problems--not crimes. 
The criminal investigation comes next. Because the IG also has the right the refer issues for possible criminal referral. And I predict, Mr. President, that the FBI will have to back off of that statement as well, when all of this is over. 
Mr. President, what we're seeing in the FBI lab issue is systemic. It reflects a culture that says the FBI is more interested in a conviction than they are in the truth. They don't reveal all the facts. Only enough to make their case. This is what I intend to show in a future statement before this body. The issue will be the FBI shaving evidence to get a prosecution. 
That's not cricket. It's not American. And it can't be tolerated. I grew up the son of a farmer. My father taught me to be proud of the FBI. Its image was that it could do no wrong. A whole generation of people like me grew up believing the FBI could do no wrong. Now, that confidence, that trust, has been shaken. 
Finally, Mr. President, let me send a shot across the bow. There are rumors I'm hearing that the FBI intends to fire Dr. Whitehurst right after the IG report is released. My message today to the Bureau is, `you fire Dr. Whitehurst, and you will cause a protracted battle with the Congress over the integrity of the FBI's leadership.' 
In the end, it will be shown that the standards of the FBI crime lab have been far short of their vaunted reputation. It will be shown that the FBI was well aware of these problems, but chose to do little, if anything, to fix them. It will also be shown that the problems, would not have been addressed by the IG were it not for the courage of Dr. Whitehurst. 
This is a wake-up call to the FBI. The public will not tolerate an arrogant response by the FBI in this matter. Too much is at stake; namely, the integrity of the criminal justice system in America. I intend to keep this issue before the American people. I will make sure they understand they have a choice between an FBI with integrity, and an FBI that plays fast and loose with the truth.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, over the next few days, we have an opportunity that we want to take advantage of to correct the course of years of unrestrained Government spending. Just like a consumer who has too many credit cards, barely keeping his head above water, particularly because he is paying big interest on his balance, so, too, is the Federal Government sinking under an ocean of debt. This deplorable state of affairs will force the Federal Government to make an annual payment of $248 billion this year 
alone. 
We have already tried to instill fiscal discipline through a lot of other measures that we passed in the last 10 years, including spending caps and deficit control mechanisms. They simply are not working efficiently enough to sustain the level of economic growth that we are now experiencing. If we had the deficit under control and interest rates down, we would be creating many, many more jobs than what have been created by this economy. Without the discipline of a constitutional amendment, we will see our interest payments further drag down the economy. By 2007, interest payments on the national debt will increase to $340 billion. 
Just imagine, if we were not paying the interest right now, we would have no budget deficit whatsoever. In fact, we would be running a surplus until the year 2004. 
When talking about the balanced budget amendment, one of the first things to do is set the record straight on the issue we have been talking about since last night: the issue of Social Security. 
Some of my colleagues, well-meaning but wrong, have signaled that they would be willing to support the balanced budget amendment if Social Security was exempt from the amendment. I say wrong. Why? Because exempting Social Security would create more problems for the program. They argue that a balanced budget amendment threatens the viability of Social Security and would harm vulnerable seniors in the process. If that were true, I would not be supporting this resolution. But that is not true, and unless we get the deficit of the Federal Government under control, this Government and our economy will never be strong enough to ever meet the needs of the baby boomers when they go into retirement just 13 years from now. 
Proponents of the Reid amendment apparently still believe that by passing Senate Joint Resolution 1, there would be some sudden groundswell of support for cutting Social Security benefits to reduce outlays. They are wrong. Given the popularity and the need of Social Security for our seniors, because it is part of the social fabric of American society, this Congress would not let that happen. Even if this Congress were inclined to let that happen, the American people would not let that happen. That just isn't going to happen. 
I am committed to the idea that balancing the budget is not about cutting Social Security. I voted for a resolution last year which promoted that view, but opponents of the amendment are not satisfied by words--I suppose everybody is cynical about words from Members of Congress--but past experience dictates otherwise. Even though we have submitted budget resolutions which achieve balance in the year 2002 without harming Social Security, the opponents of the balanced budget amendment continue to try to derail this amendment by claiming that those of us who have always fought to protect Social Security will turn around and try to harm Social Security. How could that ever happen, when the experience of the last 60 years to protect Social Security has been just the opposite, the experience of this Congress, the track record of this Congress, has been just the opposite? 
Our budget proposal does take into account the Social Security surplus, projected to be about $465 billion cumulative by the year 2002. Requiring a consolidated or unified budget in this constitutional amendment is the right thing to do. First, we must set our policy in accordance with the long-term health of this Nation's economy and the people of this country. 
By chance, there is a Social Security surplus today. If we had tried to pass a balanced budget amendment like this in the early 1980's, we would not have to worry about this argument because Social Security had no surplus. 
If we waited until the year 2029 to balance the budget, we would not be hearing this argument because there would be no surplus in Social Security at that time. It would be bankrupt. Social Security will be running a very real deficit by the year 2029. Whether Social Security is off or on budget, the decisions made about borrowing will have to take this deficit into account, even though it will look as if we are in full compliance with the Constitution. How can we expect the people to have confidence in Government if this kind of ghost accounting continues to go on? 
But this message does not seem to be getting through. Listen to comments of the Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. His comments seem to be ignored on the issue of the unified budget. At a hearing of the Senate Budget Committee held 3 weeks ago, Chairman Greenspan testified that `for the purposes of fiscal evaluation of the budget of the United States, the unified budget is the appropriate one * * *' 
Chairman Greenspan is right--financial markets take into account all Government activity. It is not segmented out into various trust funds as the sponsors of this amendment on Social Security would want us to believe. If we exempt Social Security we will make our job harder. That could have serious ramifications for the economy, and for other programs in the budget. If we are forced to make up the $295 billion lost from the Social Security surplus, we will have to find places to make further, unnecessary reductions. 
I see no compelling reason to exempt Social Security. It is beyond dispute that should Congress scrap the unified budget and exempt Social Security, truly draconian cuts in important social programs would be absolutely necessary to balance the budget. 
So, in the spirit of truth in budgeting, I challenge the supporters of scrapping the unified budget to identify what programs will be cut and how large those cuts will be. Prior to the 104th Congress, those who supported the balanced budget were repeatedly asked to provide details of how a balanced budget would be achieved. I believe the same standard should apply to those who propose exempting Social Security. Where is the beef in their proposal? 
One final reason I do not support exempting Social Security from the resolution is the possibility that the exemption will turn into a magnet for new spending that is not offset with cuts--all with a simple majority vote. This does not seem too far-fetched, Mr. President, at a time when President Clinton is proposing to shift home health care spending from one Medicare trust fund to a second trust fund which is largely funded by the general Treasury. 
I believe it is clear that the best way to protect Social Security now as well as in the future is to reject ill-advised efforts to exempt Social Security from the balanced budget amendment. In fact, the respected Robert Myers, a former chief actuary of the Social Security Administration who continues to be a strong supporter of the program of Social Security, is a strong supporter, as well, of this balanced budget amendment as it is written. 
Mr. Myers recognizes that continued fiscal irresponsibility on the part of the Federal Government is the greatest threat to Social Security, a program that is part of the social fabric of America, protecting America's seniors in retirement. If we continue to run up the deficit, interest payments will continue to rise. When the time comes for Social Security to start cashing in its bonds, possibly as soon as the year 2012, the Federal Government may find it very difficult to find a creditor when the debt we carry exceeds $8 trillion. 
We have another opportunity to rid ourselves of this unsustainable spending. I hope that we can, once and for all, keep our promise to balance the budget without hanging the Social Security noose around the necks of those of us supporting the balanced budget amendment. Contrary to the hue and cry that we hear from the other side, the balanced budget amendment is the best way to continue ensuring a good quality of life for seniors while preserving the American dream for all Americans. 
Also Mr. President, I want to correct an incorrect characterization of a memorandum by Congress Daily. 
The Congress Daily refers to a CRS analysis which supposedly says that the balanced budget amendment will hurt the Government's ability to pay Social Security benefits. 
Let me read from the report: `Now, of course, this does not mean that Social Security benefits could not be paid.' I don't know how much clearer you can be on this subject. The balanced budget amendment will not prevent Congress from honoring its commitments to seniors. 
Better yet, the same CRS researcher who produced the report which some have mischaracterized has produced yet another clarifying memo. Let me quote from that newest report: `We are not concluding that the trust fund surpluses could not be drawn down to pay beneficiaries.' That seems perfectly clear to me. Social Security will not be harmed by the balanced budget amendment. 
I think that it's unfortunate that those who oppose the balanced budget amendment are using such deceptive arguments and tactics. We are making important decisions for the future of this great Nation. I wish we could have an honest debate about the balanced budget and not resort to trickery. 
The Congress Daily article also quotes several of my Democratic colleagues referring to a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. As everyone knows, this group is a liberal interest group that opposes the balanced budget amendment. That's what they testified to earlier this year before the Judiciary Committee. 
So, in conclusion, this page and a half CRS analysis actually reaffirms what the supporters of the balanced budget amendment have always been saying: the balanced budget amendment will not harm Social Security.

 Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to report to the Senate on an official trip I took with a House Ways and Means Committee delegation in December 1996 to Hong Kong, Beijing, and Singapore. I was privileged to be the only United States Senator to serve as an official delegate to the first ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organization. 
The WTO was formed by the Uruguay Round Agreement, ratified by Congress in 1994, and is the successor to the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. It serves as a forum for multilateral trade negotiations and a dispute settlement body. The first ministerial was called to measure progress on the implementation of Uruguay round commitments and seek further liberalization in selected areas of trade. Although I discuss the various meetings of the delegation in Hong Kong and Beijing, this report will focus on our meetings in Singapore. 
FRIDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1996 
Upon arriving in Hong Kong, the delegation met with U.S. Consul General Richard Boucher and several Hong Kong business and government officials. The primary topic of discussion was Hong Kong's transition to Chinese control on July 1, 1997. 
SATURDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1996 
On Saturday, the delegation met with representatives of the American Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong. The upcoming transition was again discussed as was the annual debate in the Congress on China's most-favored-nation status. 
MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1996 
On the first day of the ministerial, the delegation was briefed by Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hunt. Ms. Barshefsky stressed the importance of completing negotiations on the Information Technology Agreement while in Singapore. She believed that an agreement was imminent but sought our support when discussing the ITA with other countries, delegations. 
The delegation asked Ms. Barshefsky about the negotiations to bring China into the WTO. I stressed the need for China to open its markets for U.S. agricultural products and to reduce the authority of its state trading enterprises. Ms. Barshefsky stressed three points relating to China's entry into the WTO. First, China must remedy its bilateral problems with the United States, especially on agriculture and intellectual property rights. China must increase market access to U.S. agricultural exports. Finally, China must abide by the decisions and policies of a rules-based system, the WTO. 
Mr. Hunt briefed the delegation on the telecommunications negotiations. Mr. Hunt said that the focus in these talks will be on deregulation in order to open the global communications industry to foreign competition. Since the United States has one of the most open markets, our companies have the most to gain by liberalizing trade in this area.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Maine had a very good statement that we all ought to take cognizance of, and that is based on her experience, being that her husband was Governor of Maine and they had to live within a balanced budget, year after year after year. It does force discipline upon policymakers. She gave an eloquent statement from that point of view, as well as a lot of other good reasons why we need a constitutional amendment to balance the budget.

Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to speak on a problem that I have been speaking about in the Department of Defense, but it also emphasizes the need for having a balanced budget, because the shenanigans that go on in the Defense Department would not go on if we had more discipline in this town in regard to the expenditures of taxpayers' money. 
On January 28, I spoke here on the floor about irresponsible financial accounting policies being pursued over at the Department of Defense. This policy is the responsibility of the chief financial officer at the Pentagon. The person holding that position now is Mr. John Hamre, but it would be applicable to anybody holding this position. The chief financial officer is supposed to be tightening internal controls and improving financial accounting. That is exactly why we passed, in 1990, the Chief Financial Officer's Act. Mr. Hamre should be cleaning up the books at the Pentagon and watching the money like a hawk. If that had been the case, we would not need to have a constitutional amendment for a balanced budget, if we had been doing that properly over the last 25 years. 
Sadly, the job is not being done. To make matters worse, the bureaucrats are pushing a new policy on progress payments that will loosen internal controls and cook the books. This new policy is embodied in draft bill language that was being circulated in the Pentagon for review as recently as January 30. I expressed my concerns about the new policy in my statement on January 28. In a nutshell, this is what I said then and it is still appropriate today: 
I am afraid that this new draft language would subvert the appropriations process that is so key to keeping tight control on how the taxpayers' dollars are expended by the Congress of the United States. 
I even alerted the chairman of the Appropriations Committee to the bad aspects of this language. The new language is not one bit constructive. It would not fix Defense's crumbling accounting system. It would merely condone and perpetuate crooked bookkeeping practices.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Hamre's letters tell me that he may not understand this issue. He seems confused. It is confusion like this that dictates more fiscal discipline in this town, and that can only come from a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. 
His letter of January 29, I think, contains two contradictory statements. In one breath he says that payments and appropriations are in sync. In the next breath, he admits that payments and appropriations are out of sync. 
But then he goes on to say that the cost of getting them in sync would just be too high, that we cannot worry about whether payments are matched with a particular product or a particular invoice or appropriation account. He says, `that would not be good business sense.' It would place an unfair burden on the contractors. 
Just think, when it comes to matching disbursements of money with an invoice, it might also place an unfair burden on contractors and government accountants. 
So just what is the thinking of the chief financial officer? Clearly, there is a problem in the Department of Defense's payment process. There is a major disconnect. On the one hand, we have a whole body of law governing the use of appropriations; on the other, we have payments for factory work that are supposed to be matched with corresponding appropriations. 
Unfortunately, the law and the payments just don't mesh. They can't be reconciled. So long as the two are not in sync, the Pentagon is operating outside the law, and it doesn't reflect the fiscal discipline that we need in this town and that we would get with a constitutional amendment. 
Unfortunately, the new policy in this draft language that is floating around the Pentagon does not put them back in sync. It will keep them out of sync permanently. 
To understand the root cause of this problem, we need to step back in time. Bureaucrats do not like it when congressional overseers revisit history, but that is what we need to do. We need to revisit an old IG report, the inspector General's audit report dated March 31, 1992. That is number 92-064. It is on the Titan IV Missile Program. 
That is where the problem was first detected and exposed, and that is the problem the bureaucrats are trying to cover up in this new policy. 
The Titan IV was not an isolated case. Unfortunately, the practices uncovered on Titan IV typified common practices throughout the Department. This report showed the Defense Department regularly violates the laws that the draft language would undo. Instead of fixing the problem, this proposed language would legalize the crime. 
Mr. President, the laws that were violated were designed to protect Congress' constitutional control over the purse strings. Progress payments to Martin Marietta on the Titan IV contract were made in violation of those laws. Those payments were made on a predetermined sequence of appropriations. Those are words that mean the money was drawn from available appropriation accounts using a random selection process. 
What a way--random selection to justify the expenditures of the taxpayers' money. That is a blatant violation of the law. That is the inspector general talking, Mr. President, not the Senator from Iowa. 
Yet, as difficult as it may be to comprehend, this unlawful procedure was sanctified by Air Force Regulation 177-120, starting February 15, 1988. In other words, that is an outlaw decree. 
Congress appropriates money for specific purposes. Those purposes are specified in law, and that is how the money must be spent. That's what the law says. The Pentagon bureaucrats promise to straighten up this mess after the fact, down the road, after the money goes out the door. They try to retroactively adjust--that's their language--adjust the ledgers--to make it look like the payments and the appropriations were in sync. 
That is fine and dandy, Mr. President. It makes the books look nice and neat, but the books then do not reflect the reality of how the taxpayers' money was spent or what the appropriators intended. The books do not tell you how the money was really spent. If they don't do that, then they are inaccurate, and that's what I call cooking the books. 
Back in 1992, the inspector general tried to shut down the Defense Department's unlawful payment process. Mr. President, the inspector general told the Department to get on the stick, obey the law, fix the problem. 
Well, guess what? The big wheels over at the Pentagon nonconcurred with the IG. That means, take a hike, in other words. They said the payment process was working just fine; it doesn't need any fixing; don't mess with it. 
We should be thankful that the IG had courage and did not back down. 
This dispute came to a head, after years of talk, in March of 1993. There was a high-level powwow at that time. The financial wizards in the Pentagon got together and signed a peace treaty. They said, basically, obey the law. 
They were given 120 days to do it. 
The treaty was signed by: Ms. Eleanor Spector, Director of Defense Procurement; Mr. Al Tucker, Deputy Comptroller; and Mr. Bob Lieberman, assistant IG for auditing. 
Mr. President, 4 years have passed since that agreement was signed. Those same officials are still in the same place. But nothing has been fixed. 
Now, we have the DOD CFO telling us that nothing will be fixed. The status quo will be institutionalized and legalized. Titan IV is the model for the future.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Wyoming. He has made very clear the need for this amendment. Most importantly, he has stressed what can legitimately be stressed on the floor of this body: that the political laboratories of our American system of Government, our State governments and our State legislatures have had much success with constitutional requirements for a balanced budget, making those State legislatures, be they controlled by liberals or by more conservative people, have a sounder fiscal policy, and a sounder spending policy than what we have had in the U.S. Congress. This is all due to the fact that each one of those State legislators takes an oath to uphold the laws and the constitution of their State, and when those respective constitutions require a balanced budget, they are carrying out their duty, not only to be fiscally sound, but also carrying out a constitutional mandate that they swore to uphold. 
So those of us who support a constitutional amendment suggest that we need the fiscal discipline that will come from a constitutional amendment, which would not be necessary if the Members of the Congress in the last quarter century had been as responsible as the Members of Congress in the first 175-year history of our country. During that period of time, except during wartime, we had balanced budgets, in a majority of the cases, and had just a general understanding that it was our responsibility for a present generation to live within its income and not put off, as we have been doing for the last quarter of a century, the debt to children and grandchildren. 
We are at it again in 1997, like we have in most of the recent Congresses, trying to get just one or two more votes to pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, which takes a two-thirds vote. When you are one or two votes short of, over the last decade, getting it passed, that means that the vast majority of the Members of this body feel it necessary to amend the Constitution but, quite frankly, coming up just a few votes--last year, just one vote--short of the required two-thirds vote to pass it. 
So all of the hue and cry that you hear from the other side, from the opponents of this approach of amending the Constitution to require a balanced budget, represents a minority of this body, a small minority of this body, just a third or just a little over a third. This year we hope that the opponents are just a little bit less than a third, so we get the two-thirds necessary to pass it. 
These are the diehards who still believe that it's fine for us to spend in our generation and let our children and grandchildren pick up the bill for our living high on the hog. 
We have heard several concerns which have been raised by the opponents of a balanced budget amendment, and I believe that these concerns are simply a mask for the opposition to the balanced budget amendment. I want to address those concerns. 
First of all, some in Congress have argued that the balanced budget amendment would result in the Federal courts becoming heavily involved in the budgetary process that was meant by our constitutional writers to be a legislative prerogative. It is my firm belief that such a concern is completely unwarranted. It is just another excuse not to enact a balanced budget amendment, which the American people want by huge margins, and which will force fiscal discipline on those who are making this argument against this constitutional amendment. Experience has shown that the Federal courts are very reluctant to enter into the budgetary issues and the political controversies. 
In order for Federal courts to hear a case, the person filing a lawsuit must have what lawyers call `standing to sue.' 
That is, the person must show that he or she has suffered a unique injury resulting from the balanced budget amendment and that this injury can be corrected by the Federal courts. If the person suing the Government cannot meet these requirements, then he or she has no standing and the court will not hear the case. 
For several reasons, I believe that it is unlikely that the courts would determine such a person has standing to bring a case under the balanced budget amendment. 
The courts are very strict in insisting that standing requirements be met by citizens who wish to sue the Government. In case after case, the Federal courts have refused to permit citizens to challenge Government action solely on the basis of being a taxpayer. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to fear a flood of litigation over the implementation of the balanced budget amendment. 
The most important reason I do not expect to see a flood of Federal cases is that once the balanced budget amendment is passed and ratified, Congress, taking the oath to uphold the Constitution, will naturally abide by it. With the force of a constitutional amendment mandating fiscal responsibility, we will be obligated to produce a balanced budget. By obeying the constitutional law, there will be no reason for any citizen to take Government to court. 
Having seen such an amendment work in my home State of Iowa, I am confident that it will force us here in Washington to be disciplined in our spending. In my view, the courts will have no need to become involved in the budget. 
Clearly, the balanced budget amendment does not provide any basis for the court to micromanage the budget process, as has been indicated by the opponents of this amendment. Without mentioning the issue of judicial review, the sponsors of the resolution have refused to give congressional sanction to the courts to involve themselves in the budgetary decisions. I believe that explicitly putting language on the issue of judicial review in the balanced budget amendment implies that the Federal courts might have power that we do not intend them to have and that they should not have. 
Furthermore, should there be any unwarranted infringement in the process by the Federal courts, which, as I have stated, is highly unlikely, the Congress has the right, under article III of the Constitution, going back for 200 some years, to limit the Federal courts' jurisdiction. 
Another baseless concern which has been raised regarding the balanced budget amendment is that it will allow the President to impound funds. Again, this is simply false. There is nothing in the balanced budget amendment giving the President new powers in the budget process. He must submit a balanced budget to the Congress. But beyond that, his role is not changed in any way. 
In fact, the balanced budget amendment reaffirms the Supreme Court's ruling that the President is required to faithfully execute the law and to spend funds as directed by statute. The President therefore does not have impoundment authority over the Social Security trust fund since he must spend it. 
Arguments against the balanced budget amendment on the grounds that it gives the President some new impoundment powers are simply unfounded. So, Mr. President, I think we can conclude that it is now time to pass this amendment. The American people are tired of all the excuses we have been hearing from a small minority of people who oppose amending the Constitution to force fiscal discipline upon the Congress. They know that we have to impose fiscal discipline on Washington if we are to preserve the American dream for future generations of our young people. 
The American people are smart enough to know the empty excuses that have been heard today, and particularly those involving the courts, are mere delaying tactics meant to derail the balanced budget amendment. 
I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we cannot allow ourselves to lose our focus on the major purpose of the balanced budget amendment--putting an end to the Federal deficit and keeping the budget balanced in the future. Let us keep our eyes on the ball and not be distracted or deterred by phony arguments. Senate Joint Resolution 1 has been carefully considered and analyzed by its supporters on both sides of the aisle. We must not allow a vocal minority and narrow partisan concerns to derail this critically important legislation and put the American dream in jeopardy. I say we need to send the balanced budget amendment to the States and let the American people decide.  
Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRASSLEY. I rise in support of this constitutional amendment. I have had an opportunity each and every time--and I suppose this is the fifth or sixth time now--in the period of time I have been in the Senate to vote for a constitutional amendment because I believe that such a statement in the Constitution would be a legitimate part of the Constitution. I learned that from serving in a State legislative body where I worked with such a statement within our State constitution, and I saw it bring discipline to both Republicans and Democrats in State legislative bodies to balance the budget, to be fiscally responsible, and have each generation pay its own way. 
I have also voted for it because there is not such a statement within the Federal Constitution, and I have seen the lack of discipline in the Congress of the United States to balance the budget. Since I have seen that discipline work at the State legislative level and since State governments tend to be laboratories for our political system, I think we can, with a great deal of certainty and ease of mind, feel confident that we are doing the right thing by placing that discipline on Members of Congress. 
The rule of law is something that is traditional to our British-American legal system. Other societies as well might have a rule of law not exactly like ours but still have a respect for basic documents. The purpose of the rule of law is predictability and stability for the future. 
Constitutions are part of the rule of law. Constitutions are adopted by societies because it brings discipline to policymakers in Government. It brings a certainty to the relationship of people who govern and the people who are governed. Part of that certainty is discipline on the part of policymakers like those of us in the 
Congress. So we have a Constitution, and it has worked well to bring stability, to bring discipline, and to bring predictability to the relationship between those who govern and those who are governed. 
We see that discipline works in most of the policymaking between the Federal Government and our people, but we have not seen discipline work in the fiscal arena. Has it always been that way? No, it has not always been that way, because for the first 160 years of our country, except during times of war, we had more years where we had budgets balanced and surpluses than years we ran deficits. It was pretty well understood that fiscal discipline, even though it was not written in the Constitution, was an integral part of the tradition of America. 
Since the year 1969, or for most of the time since World War II, that has not been the case. We have shown anything but discipline when it comes to being a caretaker of the tax dollars we raise. The American public sees that. That is why, overwhelmingly, in mail and surveys and everything else, the people of the United States are telling the Congress we need discipline in fiscal matters and that they see a constitutional amendment as bringing that discipline. 
It has been 28 years since the time we last ran a surplus. Congress in that period of time has made some feeble attempts to bring our national debt under control--but has failed. I have served with many fine Congressmen and Senators who have made valiant efforts to curb runaway spending. Regardless of their good faith, no balanced budget was produced. The goal has remained out of reach. In the end, then, we must conclude the will to balance the budget has been weak. That is why we desperately need the discipline of a constitutional amendment. 
The scope of the national debt is immense. Every year this monster grows as it gobbles up the American dream for our young people. That American dream says that our children should have a better life than our generation as we had a better life than our mothers and fathers, as our mothers and fathers had a better life than our grandfathers and grandmothers. But the American dream is being snuffed out because of fiscal irresponsibility. 
This situation has gotten so bad that we now spend nearly 40 cents of every dollar that we collect in income taxes just to pay interest costs on this national debt. The danger of this for the economy and the potentially disastrous effects for future generations have become impossible to ignore. You have to look long and hard these days to find public servants who do not say that they support balancing the budget. That is on both sides of the aisle. Rhetoric in support of budgetary control is at an unprecedented level. But it ends up that talk tends to be too cheap, I am sorry to say, and, as a result, the budget still remains unbalanced. 
We must then have the structural discipline of a balanced budget amendment. Fortunately, there has been some progress made lately in bringing down the deficit. For the most part, this is the result of two actions--one by the Republican-controlled 104th Congress, and the other by President Clinton. In the case of the Republican-controlled 104th Congress, some spending restraint that we enacted; in the case of President Clinton, it was his suggestion for the largest ever tax increase that passed in 1993. 
Now, of course, some of this reduction in the deficit can be explained by better than expected economic growth, which was mainly the result of the Federal Reserve's wise economic policies. And, despite initial budgets of President Clinton which projected deficits as far as the eye can see, the Congress has been able to submit a budget which balances by the year 2002. This is all good news. But the political balance is fragile, and we are still waiting for the debt to be tamed. 
The American people have had enough. That is why they are telling us, by an overwhelming percentage: Adopt the fiscal discipline of a constitutional amendment. They sent us here to work to restore the American dream for our children and grandchildren. 
I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will work with us on this amendment. The national debt has become the gift that keeps on taking. It is unconscionable that we would saddle our children and grandchildren with such a backbreaking public debt. But, if we do not impose the fiscal restraint that only the balanced budget amendment can provide, this debt will be passed on to future generations, and they will be faced with crippling high taxes. Americans will be working harder and longer for less and less. 
Such a scenario simply cannot be tolerated, and is not tolerated today at the grassroots. It is only tolerated here, in this Disneyland of Washington, DC. 
Passing the buck of the Federal debt to our children and grandchildren is not just an economic problem that they face. It is an immoral problem for us. Because, when you get right down to it, this deficit spending is evidence that this generation, my generation, can live high on the hog and leave the bill to our children and grandchildren to pick up. We must bring the spending binge under control. And the only way to do this in a serious and lasting way is to pass the balanced budget amendment. 
I say this after having served as both a Congressman and a Senator and having worked through several attempts to get the national debt and deficit under control. Everything we have tried to date has failed. The Budget and Impoundment Control Act, Gramm-Rudman I and II, and so many other well-intentioned acts and procedures have all come up short. I'll have more to say on this later. 
Mr. President, now, more than ever, we have a moral duty to pass the balanced budget amendment. It will force both the Congress and the President, regardless of which party is in control, to live up to their constitutional responsibilities of confronting the national debt. And when those of us here in Washington are forced to live within our means, just like American families do, every American will benefit. Interest rates will go down, which will mean lower payments for car loans, student loans, and mortgages. And by reducing the cost of living, the American dream will still be attainable. This is especially important today when it often takes two wage earners to make ends meet. 
When I talk with the folks back home in Iowa, they let me know that we have to get our fiscal house in order. An overwhelming majority of them support the balanced budget amendment. It has been our experience in Iowa that the state constitutional balanced budget requirement works. Whether the legislature is controlled by Democrats or Republicans, our elected officials have abided by it. We here in Washington have a great deal to learn from Iowa and the many other States where similar procedures have been successful. 
As the only family farmer in the Senate, I think it is also important to note that the American Farm Bureau Federation supports the balanced budget amendment. Even though many farmers, 
including those in my home State, have had to shoulder a large part of the load in budget reduction recently, they know that their livelihood depends on the long-term economic health of the country. They know that there can be no future for the American farmer, or anyone else, if deficit spending is not reined in. We need the budget discipline mandated by the balanced budget amendment in order to guarantee the survival of the American dream for farmers and everyone who benefits from their labor. 
Another alarming aspect of our Federal debt is the growing percentage which is held by foreign interests. The proportion of overseas holdings in our debt is approaching 20 percent. In essence, we have seen the slow drip of national sovereignty going down the drain. If we do not control the Federal debt soon, this drip will become a steady stream. So, in a very real sense, irresponsible Federal budgeting has compromised our national security. The time to put a halt to this trend is now. 
So, Mr. President, I conclude today by saying it is a moral imperative that we pass the balanced budget amendment. This is not a decision I come to lightly. I am very hesitant about making additions to our Constitution. But our Founding Fathers knew that there would be critical moments in our Republic's history when problems of great difficulty would arise which would require constitutional force in order to solve them. That is why the Constitution was designed to be amended in such circumstances. I would remind my colleagues that all we in Congress can do is send this measure to the States and let the people of America decide whether it will become law. Why is a vocal minority here in Congress so afraid of letting democracy work and letting the people decide? 
Our ever-expanding national debt is a problem of fundamental importance which justifies a constitutional solution. We cannot let another Congress go by in which we do not confront this issue and impose discipline on this institution. Our future and that of our children and grandchildren depend on it.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have had a victory--at least a temporary victory, but a good victory--with the IRS. Fifty-seven of us introduced a bipartisan bill, Senator Dorgan leading for the Democrats, myself for Republicans. The bill was introduced to do for farmers what has been the law since 1981, that if deferred sales contracts were used, farmers were still taxed on the year that the money was received. 
The IRS made a ruling that for alternative minimum tax purposes that income would be taxed the year that the sale was made, not the year that the money was received. Well, obviously this, if it were to go forward, would create a tremendous hardship in the agricultural community because farmers would be taxed on two crops in 1 year, rather than the planning that normally goes on in cash accounting farming. 
Common sense and reasonableness have prevailed at the IRS. Last night at about 6:30 I received a telephone call from the IRS stating their decision to delay for 1 year the enactment of their latest rule so that farmers now will be able to do during the current tax filing system what they have been doing for the last 15 years, to just keep on accounting for their income for tax purposes the way that it has legally been done. 
Then just within the last hour Commissioner Richardson had delivered to me her letter in response to my letter of December and also the latest recommendations as far as the regulations are concerned implementing her decision. 
The fact of life is, Mr. President, that the Internal Revenue Service was aware of 57 Members of this Senate in a bipartisan spirit--and maybe her decision was because she is an appointment of the President and that it then reflects the new attitude at the White House of bipartisanship during this congressional session. 
Regardless of what brought this about, I am thankful that common sense and reasonableness have prevailed. I thank each of my 57 colleagues who have been involved in this issue for their timeliness in helping us sponsor this legislation, getting it in. We will now move forward to change an erroneous IRS ruling that has been backed up by an erroneous district court case so that law reflects what Congress has intended since 1981 when deferred sales contracts were made legal and, second, when we passed the alternative minimum tax legislation in 1986.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for my 85 colleagues who have served with me in past Congresses, what I am going to speak of is nothing new. It is about the lack of discipline and integrity in financial accounting at the Pentagon. This lack of integrity and discipline in accounting is the basis for the waste of the taxpayers' money that we have had at that institution for a long period of time. 
But for the nine Republicans and six Democrats who are new Members of this body, I would ask them to be cognizant of the fact that what I am addressing is a crusade that I have been on for a long period of time to bring accountability to the expenditure of taxpayers' money at the Department of Defense. It is especially important for us Republicans to make sure that we are accountable for the taxpayers' money at the Defense Department where we tend to be somewhat lax, let me say, candidly. We should expect the same sort of accountability that we expect of liberals in this body when they spend money through the various domestic departments of Education, Labor, Health and Human Services and other departments of State government that maybe we Republicans ride herd on to a greater extent than we do the Defense Department. 
So that subject is a breakdown of discipline and integrity in accounting at the Pentagon. When Mr. John Hamre became Comptroller of the Defense Department in 1993, I felt very hopeful. He made a personal commitment to clean up the books and to get control of the money. I really believed that he would get the job done. In fact, I have complimented him on this floor several times for making some changes--maybe not as fast as I would like to have had them made, but making changes. That is quite an accomplishment in that very bureaucratic organization.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I join the minority leader today in introducing two important bills regarding agricultural trade. The first is a bill that requires the U.S. Trade Representative to determine whether the European Union has violated its trade agreements with the United States by failing to certify U.S. beef and pork processing plants for export to the European Union. The failure to certify our plants has cost the pork industry alone as much as $60 million annually. 
The problem arises under the E.U.'s so-called Third Country Meat Directive. This directive, which has been in place since 1985, calls for E.U. inspection and certification of U.S. meat plants as a condition for accepting exports from those plants. Simply put, if a plant has not been certified, it cannot export to the E.U. member nations. Since the mid-1980's the E.U. has used this directive to prohibit over 400 U.S. facilities from exporting beef and pork to the E.U. 
Many bilateral discussions have taken place between the E.U. and the United States on this issue since 1985. But no satisfactory resolution has ever been reached. In early 1991, the then-U.S. Trade Representative, Carla Hills, initiated an action under section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. After a year of consultations and the certification of some U.S. plants, we entered into a settlement agreement, known as the 1992 meat agreement. In exchange for the settlement agreement, the United States agreed to withdraw its 301 action. 
Under the 1992 meat agreement, the E.U. agreed that U.S. plants would be certified if their inspection systems are equivalent to the E.U.'s. In spite of this agreement, and its commitments made under the WTO Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, the E.U. has not made any significant progress in certifying U.S. plants. Europe effectively remains a closed market for United States beef and pork. 
What this bill does is require the USTR to determine under section 306 whether the E.U. has violated its trade agreements. This is important because once a determination has been made, the USTR is required to take action. The action could take the form of unilateral retaliation, for example. Furthermore, the bill requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture to reconsider our certification of European plants if this problem continues. 
Mr. President, the impact of the E.U.'s blatant disregard of our trade agreements is substantial for the U.S. meat industry. Our cattle and hog farmers have been effectively shut out of the entire European market. This comes at a time when American agriculture is becoming more dependent on foreign markets. In fact, USDA calculates that American farmers will soon derive up to 30 percent of their net income from foreign trade. So global market access is critical to the viability of the family farmer. 
This bill sends a strong signal to the E.U. that we are no longer willing to tolerate this egregious behavior. Bilateral negotiations have failed. It is time to take swift and strong action to eliminate this barrier to our value-added agricultural products. 
We must also send a signal to our other foreign trading partners. Trade agreements must be followed. Commitments must be kept. The United States will no longer sit idly by as the rest of the world thumbs it nose at their responsibilities as a trading partner. The stakes are simply too high in terms of American jobs and standard of living. 
This leads me to the second bill that I have cosponsored today with the minority leader. This bill requires the USTR to identify, on an annual basis, those countries that deny market access to our value-added agricultural products. It also requires identifying countries who are violating the sanitary and phytosanitary provisions of the GATT. This procedure is similar to the special 301 procedure for intellectual property rights. 
It is necessary to identify and understand the trade barriers faced by American agriculture so we can work to eliminate them. Not only is foreign trade vital to American farmers, it is vital to the U.S. balance of payments. Agriculture trade is the shining star in an otherwise increasing trade deficit. But we cannot rest on the success of the past. In existing markets we could be doing much better in terms of market share. And many markets remain closed to U.S. ag products. 
This bill will help pinpoint our successes and our failures so we can move forward on bilateral negotiations and, eventually, a new round of agricultural negotiations in the World Trade Organization, beginning in 1999. This annual report will serve as a blueprint to achieving worldwide access for the commodities produced on America's family farms. 
I appreciate the minority leader's hard work on these two pieces of legislation. And I look forward to working with him during this Congress to get these bill enacted into law.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, as I introduce this legislation called the Family Farm Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 1997, it is a way that 54 of us in this body--and we will still yet get more cosponsors, I am sure--are saying, `Shame on the Internal Revenue Service.' This is our effort to hold the tax-collecting bureaucracy of the U.S. Government accountable to what Congress intended. We are holding them accountable to the taxpayers, and we will reduce somewhat the power of the IRS which comes through intimidation. I have worked very closely with three other Senators in a bipartisan fashion, Senator Dorgan, Senator Gorton, and Senator Baucus. I thank them for their leadership and their cooperation. We have been joined now by 50 of our colleagues in a broad bipartisan effort, with the support of the leadership of both parties, meaning Senator Lott and Senator Daschle. I think that the sort of membership cosponsoring this legislation speaks louder, frankly, than anything I can say about the rationale behind this bill. 
This bill repeals a very large problem created by the IRS regarding farmer-deferred contract arrangements. The problem is currently at a crisis level because it is income tax time. Particularly, it is income tax time for the farmers of America who must file earlier than others. 
The IRS has found a way to tax farmers for their deferred sales contracts. This is contrary to congressional intent. I know the Presiding Officer is from Kansas and he understands this, but some might not. A deferred sales contract is a situation where a farmer delivers his crop this year and gets paid by the local cooperative elevator, or privately owned elevator, or some other buyer next year. Since Congress intends farmers to be able to use the cash accounting method, deferred contracts have been a perfectly acceptable method to defer income to another year for taxation. It has been perfectly legal over a long period of time. 
Now the IRS has unilaterally decided to deem these traditional deferred sales contracts as if, in the words of the IRS, these were `installment sales' agreements. The problem is that installment sales are subject to the alternative minimum tax. Then, of course, by doing this, the IRS puts the family farmer in trouble for things that, over a long period of time, have been entirely legal. 
This IRS initiative is a way for the IRS to deny farmers the use of the cash accounting method. When Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, it specifically intended that farmers retain the cash accounting method. That same act repealed the income averaging method for farmers. Income averaging was a way for farmers to level out their regularly large fluctuations of income between years. Farmers can have those fluctuations because, while local farmers are affected by local weather and the weather all over the world. 
Listen to the prices of soybeans today. You will find that whether or not it rains right now in Brazil or Argentina is impacting the price of soybeans in Iowa and Kansas. The crop prices are affected by crop disease and a host of other things that ordinary taxpayers take for granted, that farmers have no control over. When income averaging was repealed, Congress intended farmers to retain the cash method of accounting. We are here today with this bill because the IRS has effectively repealed cash accounting, in opposition to the intent of Congress. 
Cash accounting is repealed because the traditional deferred sales contracts are the practical application of cash accounting. By applying the alternative minimum tax, IRS has repealed the deferral in deferred contracts. They are contracts but no longer deferred income. Thus, the IRS has unilaterally broken the promise that Congress made to farmers, and our legislation rights that wrong. 
Ironically, the IRS knows it is in the wrong on this matter, but, of course, the IRS is going to go ahead anyway. After all, they encourage, from the top to the bottom of the IRS bureaucracy, auditors to go out and find all the income they can to tax, and to stretch the law as far as they can. And if they do it in this instance, in the case of taxing deferred sales contracts, do you think the Internal Revenue Commissioner or the Secretary of the Treasury is going to say to some auditor out there--slap their hands and say, `You are wrong'? No, they are not going to do that. That would be the right thing to do, but they are not going to do that because that would discourage this attitude we have had in the IRS. They want to go out and get every dollar they can, even if they have to stretch the law to do it. 
Well, in a sense, the Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin--and I thank him--and IRS Commissioner Richardson--and I thank her--have agreed that this problem results from what they call legislative oversight in 1986, because they do not want to say their auditors may be wrong. So, they have agreed, in the spirit of this Presidency, this second term of office, that we are going to be bipartisan and we are going to work together to solve these problems. So Secretary Rubin and IRS Commissioner Richardson have said they would not oppose this legislation. They agree that Congress did not intend for farmer deferred contracts to make these contract incomes subject to the AMT. However, as I indicated, these two individuals believe they still must enforce what they know to be a bad law. Hence, the urgent need for our legislation. 
You know, it would be really simple for the Commissioner to say, `We are wrong. We are not going to collect this money.' But they cannot do that, presumably. 
Not only is this ruling of the IRS effective right now and into the future, it is also retroactive. It is retroactive because, since it is a new interpretation of an old law, the IRS can pretend it has not changed its position, though it obviously has. Since it is retroactive, farmers are exposed to audit, not only for the current year and upon future years, but also on previous years. This problem is now in crisis proportions for farmers. The IRS made its retroactive change in October of 1996. At that time, much of the 1996 crop was already harvested. Farmers had already entered the traditional binding deferred contracts. They normally do this throughout the 12 months of the year. So, do we wonder why it is all of a sudden a crisis among farmers? 
Before the IRS release, farmers had every reason to believe they would enjoy the same legal tax treatment previously allowed by IRS. 
Congress and the President must address and solve this problem as soon as possible. Farmers are required to file their tax returns before March 1, 1997. This is unlike most other taxpayers who have until April 15. If Congress waits until after March 1 to fix this problem, then hundreds of thousands of farmers all across this country will already have been injured. 
The IRS knows it is wrong on this issue, but it is out of control. It injures its own public relations by actions such as this. It is a sad commentary that it takes an emergency action of Congress to make the IRS do its job as Congress intended. Nonetheless, our bill will do exactly that. 
Mr. President, besides being on the Finance Committee where this legislation will be considered, I happen to also be a member of a commission the Congress set up last year to restructure the IRS. There are two Senators, two House Members, and 13 people from the private sector on that commission. We have 1 year from last fall to make our report to the Congress. 
The charter from the Congress to all 17 of us is to, in a sense, make the IRS more user friendly. Although we are at the same time kept from recommending changes in tax policy, how we administer the existing Tax Code is what we are dealing. We are examining how the IRS does its work and what we can do to enhance that from an efficiency standpoint. We want to save the taxpayers money and also to make IRS more customer friendly. 
After 6 months of being on this commission--though the ultimate good is making the IRS more efficient and more customer friendly--it is my opinion that we need to make the Tax Code so simple that every single taxpayer understands the Tax Code as well as any IRS auditor understands that Tax Code. The complexity of the Tax Code gives the IRS its power. It is the mystery of the Tax Code, a mystery that the bureaucrat can sort through and understand, and the inability of the taxpayer to do that which brings the power of the auditor that gives IRS its power. The power to intimidate comes through the tax system. 
So I ask my colleagues to observe the action of the commission to restructure the IRS and work with Senator Kerrey from Nebraska and myself as representatives of the Senate on this issue. Let us know your opinions, but also understand that the complexity of the Tax Code is the major problem that we must fix. The bill that I am introducing today is just one very small example of the complexity of the Tax Code. It is an action against the intimidation of the IRS and impacts. In most cases, IRS usually attacks maybe just a few hundred taxpayers throughout the United States on some issues. On this particular issue, affecting a practice that has been legal by the farmers of the United States of America for decades, they are attacking thousands and thousands. They want farmers to think that all of a sudden what they have been doing is now presumably wrong. 
I hope that Congress will work very quickly to pass this legislation before that March 1 deadline. It is badly needed to prevent an irreparable injury to farmers, and to make the Tax Code more understandable for the taxpayers. We also are sending a clear signal to the IRS: Shame on you.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota. I thank him for his cosponsorship of this legislation, because in the State of Minnesota obviously he has, as in my State of Iowa, many farmers who are affected by the action of the IRS. I yield 5 minutes.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today is the first day in which the Senate will entertain legislation for the 105th Congress. I rise today to compliment various tax bills introduced by my colleagues for myself. Some of this legislation is in the leadership package. Other legislation has been introduced separately by other Senators. All of this legislation will reduce taxes on Americans trying to live the American Dream. I applaud these efforts. In fact, I have had a hand in writing or cosponsoring much of it in the 104th Congress. With this new Congress, we must break down the barriers that stand in the way of the next generation's shot at the American Dream. Our future depends on it. 
The initiatives I support include, reinstating the income tax deduction for interest on student loans, reducing the capital gains tax, expanding individual retirement accounts, extending the employer provided education assistance programs, and finally, reducing the estate taxes. Collectively, these tax bills will provide necessary relief for all taxpayers. Hard working families and individuals deserve nothing less from their Federal Government.

Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Moynihan and I are introducing Legislation today to spell out more specifically the requirements for the office of Deputy Director for Demand Reduction at the Office of National Drug Control Policy. I know it is Senator Moynihan's view, and mine, that this office requires an incumbent of the highest qualifications in the demand reduction area. This is especially true at this time. We have seen 4 years of rising teenage drug use in this country. We have seen initiatives that move us perilously close to legalizing a dangerous drug. We have seen the cynical exploitation of the public's trust in order to do this. In response, we need credible, visible leadership of the highest caliber in the Nation's chief demand reduction office. These qualifications were what Congress had in mind when we created the Drug Czar's office and the position of Deputy Director for Demand Reduction. Today, we are introducing legislation that will spell out more clearly this intent. 
Last year, Congress increased funding to restore the Drug Czar's office to effective staffing levels. This year we will be reviewing the reauthorization of the office. Congress remains deeply interested in ONDCP and I and others will be working to ensure that it is meeting the expectations that we have in it. 
As we work during this Congress to ensure a drug-free future for our children, we must have an individual in charge of our national demand reduction efforts who can command the respect of parents, doctors, treatment and prevention specialist, and the public. I am pleased to join Senator Moynihan in this effort. Our legislation will ensure that we will see candidates for this important post who command universal respect. I welcome the support of our colleagues. I look forward to having someone of outstanding capabilities with whom we can work and in whom the public can have confidence.
