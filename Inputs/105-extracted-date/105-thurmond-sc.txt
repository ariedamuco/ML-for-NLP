Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the Senate considers H.R. 2263, a bill to authorize the President to award the Medal of Honor to Theodore Roosevelt for his actions on San Juan Heights in cuba during the Spanish-American War, I want to clarify what we are doing. This bill does not award the Medal of Honor to Theodore Roosevelt. It does authorize the President to award the Medal of Honor to then Colonel Roosevelt. 
Colonel Roosevelt's actions on San Juan Heights may well merit the award of the Medal of Honor. However, in order to make such a determination, one must carefully review the historical record, including any eyewitness accounts that may be available, and evaluate the record against the criteria for award of the Medal of Honor that was applied to other members of the Armed forces who were recommended for the Medal of Honor during the Spanish-American War. In my opinion, this is a task that can only be performed by the military services. 
In fact, in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996, we established a procedure in which the military services would evaluate recommendations for awards for past actions and notify the Committee on Armed Services of those found to be meritorious. Each year, in the National Defense Authorization Act, we waive the time limits for those awards recommended by the Secretaries of the Military Departments so that the award may be made.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this bill should not be seen as a precedent for Congressional decisions on military awards. Our legislation in 1996 established a procedure designed to ensure that heroic and meritorious actions do not go unrecognized solely due to the passage of time. However, the procedure also preserves the integrity of the military award system which is important to our military services and the American people. 
Mr. President, in closing, I want to commend Congressman McHale for his determined efforts in bringing this matter to our attention. It is my fervent hope that Colonel Roosevelt's action will be appropriately recognized while preserving the time honored processes and traditions within our military services for awarding our Nation's most hallowed award for valor, the Medal of Honor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the nomination of Edward Damich to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. I believe he is a fine choice for this important position. 
Before joining the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 as Chief Intellectual Property Counsel, Mr. Damich served as a Commissioner of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel. In that capacity, he was involved in numerous copyright issues, including the proper distribution of millions of dollars in copyright licensing fees. Further, for many years, he served as a Professor of Law in the area of intellectual property, first at Delaware Law School and later at the George Mason University School of Law in Virginia. 
Mr. Damich has been an asset to the Senate Judiciary Committee in recent Congresses. He is a strong supporter of property rights and has brought a wealth of knowledge of intellectual property law to his work. He has played an important supporting role on many important pieces of legislation in this area, including most recently the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. 
Mr. Damich is well qualified to serve on the Court of Claims, and I am pleased to support his nomination.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for Judge Margaret Seymour, President Clinton's nominee to be a United States District Judge for the District of South Carolina. Judge Seymour will replace Judge William Traxler, an excellent jurist who I recommended to the President for the District Court and who has just been elevated to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Judge Seymour had a varied legal career in the private sector and in government service before becoming an Assistant United States Attorney in South Carolina in 1990. During four of her six years in the U.S. Attorney's office, she was Chief of the Civil Division. Also, she twice served as Interim United States Attorney, once in 1993 and again in 1996. 
She was appointed a United States Magistrate Judge for the District of South Carolina in 1996, where she serves today. In that capacity, she is known as a diligent and fair jurist. She is also a person of character and integrity. 
I am very pleased to support her, and I am confident she will be a very able addition to the District Court.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of the utmost importance to the safety and security of every American--the timely restoration of tritium production to maintain our nuclear deterrent. Some have attempted to focus this debate on cost. Mr. President, the most significant issue in this debate is not cost--it is the National Security of the United States. 
For those who do not know, tritium is a radioactive gas and is an essential component of modern nuclear weapons. It decays at a rate of five-and-a-half percent per year, so in order to maintain our nuclear deterrent the tritium must be continually replaced. We have not produced tritium in this country since 1988, when the reactors at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina were shut down. Since that time the Department of Energy has examined countless options and technologies, but has not yet selected a new source. The end result of almost a decade of stalling is millions in wasted taxpayer dollars and no progress in meeting the requirements of the Department of Defense. If the Department of Energy is unable to begin the production of tritium before 2007, the impact will be unilateral U.S. nuclear disarmament. Mr. President, given the perilous international security environment that exists, we cannot afford to allow this to happen. The National Security interests of our Nation demand that we have a reliable source of tritium. 
For a variety of reasons, the Clinton Administration has mismanaged this program by delaying implementation, issuing torrents of misinformation, and failing to acknowledge the true liabilities of the commercial light water reactor option. Make no mistake, through its actions, and inaction, this Administration has put our nuclear deterrent in jeopardy. This matter is of the utmost importance to the Nation and I feel compelled to raise my concerns with my colleagues here today. 
The Department has narrowed its choices down to two options--the use of a commercial light water reactor at the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) or the use of a defense linear accelerator at a dedicated defense site. In my opinion, the only viable option, in terms of cost, reliability, ability to meet Defense Department needs, and maintain a high non-proliferation stance, is the Accelerator for the Production of Tritium (APT). 
Over the past three months, a variety of inaccurate and misleading claims have been made regarding the APT option. To date, I have not come to the floor to correct these inaccuracies because my efforts were focused on completing work on the National Defense Authorization Act Conference Report. The enactment of this bill is essential to the armed forces of the United States. It provides the men and women who wear the uniform of our Nation with a much needed pay raise, it includes many vital readiness enhancements, and provides for the long-term modernization of our military. However, now that the Conference Report has been signed by the President and is law, I wish to take a few moments to voice my concerns with the Department of Energy's tritium production program. 
Despite the flood of misinformation, one fact remains abundantly clear and irrefutable--that we must have new tritium production source very soon or leave our Nation without the nuclear deterrent that has kept the peace so well for the past 50 years. Mr. President, let me state this plainly. My fear is that the commercial light water reactor option may never yield the tritium needed to maintain our defense nuclear stockpile. The regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission make a commercial reactor vulnerable to third party intervenor lawsuits and as a result, that litigation could easily block that facility from coming on-line before it ever produces the first kilogram of tritium for defense purposes. Only tritium produced in an accelerator, at a dedicated defense site, will assure that we have the tritium we need when we need it. 
Mr. President, the cold war is over, but many dangers remain. In fact, the world may be a much more uncertain place today than it was during the height of the cold war. Despite President Clinton's rhetoric on stemming the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, we continue to see new and troubling proliferation trends. Recently, we learned that Iraq's nuclear program is much more advanced than previously thought. Earlier this year we witnessed the very public entry of two new nations--India and Pakistan--into the nuclear weapons club. In the last few months we have witnessed other nations boldly demonstrate their ability to deploy missile systems capable of delivering nuclear or chemical/biological warheads onto U.S. soil. 
Mr. President, these are very troubling developments indeed. All of these events demonstrate the need for the United States to maintain a viable nuclear deterrent. They also require consistent leadership on the part of the United States. Our policies on non-proliferation must be, as Secretary of State Albright said, `unambiguous, decisive and clear.' Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration's actions do not match up with its rhetoric. One prime example is in the area of tritium production. 
By the end of this year, the Clinton Administration is required to identify its preferred method to produce new tritium. One of the options being considered is the use of a civilian nuclear reactor to produce tritium for use in U.S. nuclear weapons. Such a decision would end a five-decade-long U.S. policy which has been upheld by every President since Harry Truman. That policy states very clearly and unquestionably that the separation of civilian and military nuclear energy programs is in the best interests of the United States. It states that we should not try to turn civilian nuclear power plants into nuclear bomb plants. 
Some are claiming that because the Tennessee Valley Authority is a government agency that producing nuclear weapons materials in their reactors is consistent with U.S. policy. I can tell you that it is not. The Atomic Energy Act, which governs this policy, was never intended to condone the use of commercial-use facilities to produce nuclear weapons materials. Additionally, the reactors that present the greatest threat to U.S. national security interests are, in fact, owned by the governments of Korea, Iran, Iraq, India, and Pakistan. The implications of changing our policy concerning civilian-use nuclear power reactors, despite whether they are owned by a government or a commercial entity, are far-reaching and potentially disastrous. 
Anyone who is concerned about National Security and nonproliferation must acknowledge that designating a commercial-use reactor as the new tritium production source would signal to the world that it is now acceptable to use commercial-use reactors to produce materials for nuclear weapons. Let me say that one more time--it would tell the rest of the world that we believe there should be no distinction between civilian and military nuclear facilities. 
Sending that message would also signal the end of commercial nuclear sales overseas. Now, every time a U.S. vendor attempted to sell a reactor to a foreign government, we would have to assess the potential of that plant becoming a nuclear weapons production site. The National Security of the United States demands that we operate at a higher standard--setting ourselves apart as a World Leader. 
I am a proponent of nuclear power and I support finding alternative missions for nuclear reactors, but using a commercial reactor to create nuclear weapons materials would be devastating to the nuclear industry. If we allow this ill-conceived Clinton Administration proposal to go forward, we will no longer be able to preach from the bully pulpit on non-proliferation. We will no longer be able to tell other nations that it is unacceptable to forgo the use of their commercial reactors for military purposes. We 
will have crossed that formerly well defined boundary that every President knew should never be violated since the dawn of the nuclear age. This President, however, seems to feel that it is perfectly acceptable to say to the rest of the world, `do as we say, not as we do.' Mr. President, we cannot allow this Administration to take such an action without the intense scrutiny of Congress. 
How could we go to the United Nations or the G-8 Summit and condemn nations like Iraq, Libya, Iran, North Korea, or any other nation that is so eager to establish a nuclear weapons program if we are not living up to our own standards? The simple answer is that we will not be able to do so, because civilian workers in a Tennessee Valley Authority commercial nuclear power plant will be producing weapons grade materials. Our moral authority will be lost in a cloud of hypocrisy.

Mr. THURMOND. For the past two years, I have expressed my concern with the Administration's plans to turn civilian reactors into materials production plants. I have communicated that concern to the Secretaries of Energy and Defense. As a part of last year's Defense Authorization Act, we included a provision that required the Administration to clearly state what proliferation risks were entailed in the commercial light water reactor option. That report was not delivered until well after both the House and Senate Defense Authorization bills were completed. It stated, however, that there were non-proliferation concerns with the use of commercial light water reactor for tritium production, but indicated that such concerns were `manageable.' Mr. President, given the volatile proliferation risks were are facing in South Asia, the Middle East, and other quarters of the globe, do we want to settle for a `manageable' non-proliferation policy? This finding is hardly a glowing endorsement of the reactor option being considered by the Clinton Administration. I suggest that today's international security environment requires U.S. non-proliferation policies to be absolutely unquestionable. 
To establish any other policy for the United States will not go without consequences. The series of nuclear tests carried out by the Governments of India and Pakistan is clear evidence that the Clinton Administration's credibility with the rest of the world is being questioned when it comes to non-proliferation matters. This Congress has to step up to this issue and state that civilian and military nuclear programs cannot and will not be mixed. 
In addition to claiming that there is no problem with producing tritium in a non-defense facility some proponents of the reactor option have made many false statements concerning the costs of the different options. 
First, many point to a review of the United States nuclear weapons program conducted by the Congressional Budget Office at the request of the Clinton Administration as proof positive of the lower cost of the reactor option. This initial review, conducted over a year and a half ago, included an assessment of DOE's tritium program only as a cursory footnote in the larger report. The CBO did not assess the current modular accelerator design, which everyone agrees is dramatically cheaper, nor did the CBO conduct any assessment of the proposed cost to complete the reactor option. 
Several months ago, the CBO attempted to justify its earlier report by updating its findings. The result was an even more inaccurate depiction of the two tritium

Mr. THURMOND. Here are just a few of the glaring errors. CBO did not consider the independent cost evaluations conducted on the accelerator design and construction estimates. CBO did not even mention the significantly lower cost modular accelerator design, which is the design currently being considered by DOE. Their report made no mention of the ancillary benefits of the accelerator that could help lower its operating cost. There was no contingency cost assessed for the reactor-based options, yet the estimated cost for the accelerator was increased an astounding $500 million without any justification. There was no consideration of TVA's sizable debt service costs in the reactor option. The Tennessee Valley Authority currently has an outstanding $4.6 billion debt on the incomplete reactor that would have to be recovered over the life of the reactor option. This would dramatically reduce the revenue stream projected for the reactor option. Current law requires that TVA recuperate such costs on a schedule and basis that advantages the ratepayers. In short, if the gross revenues projected by TVA fall short or operating expenses cost more, TVA would face a legal conflict--fulfill its contractual obligation to pay DOE a share of gross revenues or fulfill its legal obligation to recover the costs. CBO did not account for this liability. There were no management and support or startup cost included in the reactor option. 
The CBO analysis also ignored many programmatic requirements found in the Department's August 1998 Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Production of Tritium in a Commercial Light Water Reactor (EIS). The EIS states that `at least two reactors would be needed' and further states that `DOE could use as many as 3 reactors.' The CBO report should have included additional costs in the reactor option to account for the requirement to operate at least two reactors if a reactor-based option were selected. The entire reactor-based option rests on whether or not it can meet our nuclear defense needs for tritium. The CBO failed to address this fact. It should not have been ignored and therefore undermines the credibility of the entire analysis of the commercial reactor option. 
The CBO report failed to include any contingency costs in the reactor option to account for TVA's poor record in completing large reactor projects. The average TVA cost overrun on reactor construction projects is well over 150 percent. This fact was also ignored by the CBO analysis. 
These are but a few of the deficiencies in the CBO cost analysis. Yet, this is the report that some are relying on when they tell you that the reactor is the lowest cost option. Well, I don't buy that. I also don't put much stock in the argument that says the reactor option can't cost more, because it is a fixed price contract. Given the Department's recent setbacks in fixed price contracting, it is inconceivable that DOE or CBO would simply accept a `fixed price' offer at face value and not consider the issues I have just raised. Many are aware of the fixed price contract that DOE signed at the Idaho Pit 9 facility. Those who are aware of this contract know that DOE spent several hundreds of millions of dollars on this cleanup project and not one square inch of that facility has been cleaned up. Three years later, that matter is still in dispute. We cannot afford to allow such delays to threaten an activity as vital as tritium production. 
I have asked the CBO to re-examine this matter and provide a thorough and complete assessment to Congress by early 1999. In addition, I have requested that the GAO provide a complete and independent review of the competing tritium production options. I ask unanimous consent that my letters of August 26 and September 4, 1998, be printed at the conclusion of my remarks.

Mr. THURMOND. I have just told you about the CBO review. Now let me tell you about an analysis conducted by the Congressional Research Service which was an exhaustive and complete examination of both the reactor and accelerator options. This assessment 
was released June 18, 1998, by the defense staff at the Congressional Research Service. This report found that the reactor and the accelerator options are `competitive on a cost basis.' The CRS report states that the cost of the reactor option ranges from $2.5 billion to $3.7 billion, while the cost of the accelerator ranges from $2.5 to $2.9 billion. In other words the accelerator could cost less than the reactor. 
The CRS assessment is the most in depth assessment conducted on the costs of the two tritium options to date. It represents the most recent information available and it says the costs of the reactor and the accelerator are comparable, that there are no technical risks associated with the accelerator, and that the accelerator actually has a greater chance of returning revenue to the U.S. Treasury than the reactor. 
The revenue producing potential of the accelerator is one of the many things that the CBO assessment failed to account for fully. Because the accelerator will operate on a continuous basis, it is possible to use a portion of the accelerator beam to produce much needed medical isotopes which can be used to treat prostate, breast, and many other types of cancers. The production of these isotopes will have no impact on the facility's tritium production. This `swords to plowshares' approach could, conservatively, raise $100 or $500 million per year in revenue for the Federal government. This compares with the $25 to $100 million annual revenue projected to be available from the reactor option, and the accelerator produces no hazardous legacy materials like spent nuclear fuel while at the same time maintaining our strong non-proliferation policies. 
It is critical that the facts about the options for producing tritium are known. Choosing to produce this nuclear defense material in a commercial light water reactor will sacrifice our position as the world leader on this issue. The accelerator is the right option for our Nation. 
I have mentioned a few of the advantages of the accelerator, but the real advantage is that it is the technology of the future. Unlike the reactor option, the accelerator generates no nuclear waste, cannot threaten surrounding communities, and requires no hazardous materials to be shipped across the country. 
In fact, the accelerator may actually help destroy the ever growing volumes of spent nuclear fuel and other nuclear wastes. The accelerator could be used in a full-scale demonstration of a process known as the accelerator for the transmutation of waste (ATW). This innovative new process could reduce by 95 percent the volume of high level nuclear waste currently planned to be buried in a repository in the Nevada desert. The ATW would also generate electricity in the process. 
As I previously stated, the accelerator could be used to create medical isotopes. The U.S. has very little indigenous isotope production capability. The accelerator will make it possible to create revolutionary new medical treatements to treat a wide variety of cancers. For example, one isotope that can be created in the accelerator would allow victims of prostrate cancer to be fully treated without any surgery. The radioactive medicines created in the accelerator could be designed specifically to attack only cancerous cells, obviating the need for surgery or radical, whole body radiation treatments. New treatments could also be developed for breast and other terminal cancers. In addition to medical isotopes, industrial isotopes can be created which have important and beneficial applications for both our National Defense and NASA. 
There are many other uses for the accelerator that could enhance the lives of citizens throughout the country. These ancillary benefits are achieved without the generation of a single cask of spent nuclear fuel, without any compromise in our stance against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and without any added cost to the Department of Energy or Department of Defense. 
It is because of these concerns that I rise to express my opposition to the use of a commercial facility to produce tritium for defense purposes and wholeheartedly endorse the APT as the preferable choice to protect the National Security interests of the United States.

Mr. THURMOND. I join my colleagues in support of extending the tax credit for Fuel Production from Nonconventional Sources. Through this credit, Congress has emphasized the importance of establishing alternative energy sources, furthering economic development, and protecting the environment. The alternative fuels credit strikes a proper balance between each of these objectives. I support efforts to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion, early in the next Congress.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a brief colloquy with my colleague, the Honorable Chairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Richard Shelby. 
Included in the Senate Appropriations Committee Report accompanying the Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1999, is a provision directing that additional research be conducted on a product that I believe could greatly improve highway pavement quality and maintenance. I am speaking of the use of fiber polymer additives--also known as `binders'--in asphalt and concrete, the use of which appears to yield significant results in pavement quality and longevity. 
While only a limited amount of research has been completed on this product, the few applications tested under real world circumstances have shown very positive results. If this product is as good as it appears to be in initial test results, it would revolutionize the industry and save states and the Federal Government significant resources for use on other critical infrastructure needs. 
Not only does this product appear to add significant longevity to pavement life, it also serves an environmental benefit. Mr. Chairman, as you know, recycling allows us to conserve our natural resources, it diverts additional material from our landfills, and saves energy. A company in my home state of South Carolina, Martin Color-Fi, Inc., has empirical data that shows substantially improved life expectancy for highways constructed with polymer additives in the pavement. Their success, and that of others in this area, is encouraging news for improving the quality and longevity of our Nation's highways. 
I note that the Statement of Manager's language accompanying the Transportation title of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, unlike the Senate Committee report, does not specify the amount of funds in the Highway Research, Development and Technology Program for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to conduct additional demonstrations of this technology. It is my understanding that Chairman Shelby shares my commitment to this research. Further, it is my understanding that he and other members of the committee would join me in strongly encouraging FHWA to work with an academic institution, and give priority consideration to applying at least the amount of research funds specified in the Senate-passed Transportation Appropriations bill, in order to create an academic and industry-led consortium to demonstrate the application of polymer additives in pavement for civil engineering purposes.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, over the past several weeks, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a series of hearings to review the status of our armed forces. I scheduled these hearings because I have been concerned for some time that the Administration's defense budget was inadequate to maintain readiness and because members and staff were bringing back anecdotal information indicating the readiness of our armed forces was declining. 
On September 29, the committee heard from General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other members of the Joint Chiefs, General Reimer, Admiral Johnson, General Ryan, and General Krulak. The hearing has been described by the media as adversarial, however, I would describe it as open, candid and productive. It was not surprising that the Chiefs acknowledged the U.S. military is falling into a readiness crisis and faces the danger of becoming a `hollow' force if appropriate measures are not taken. They specifically indicated the need for additional resources now and in the out years. Most illustrative of the testimony is the following quote by General Shelton: 
I must admit up front that our forces are showing increasing signs of serious wear. Anecdotal and now measurable evidence indicates that our current readiness is fraying and that the long-term health of the Total Force is in jeopardy. 
Mr. President, on October 6, the committee followed up the hearing with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with a hearing at which Secretary of Defense Cohen and General Shelton testified. Although the focus of the hearing was to be primarily on world trouble spots, the readiness status of our forces also became a subject of intense debate. Secretary Cohen reiterated the concerns of the service chiefs and indicated that he would seek additional funds in the fiscal year 2000 budget. 
Mr. President, the indicators that most concerned the service chiefs and brought them to the realization that readiness was clearly declining included downturns in recruiting and retention, a shortfall in unit training, and widespread equipment breakdowns and spare parts shortages. These are basic indicators whose impact is felt throughout the ranks, in units throughout all the services and affect operations, training, morale and esprit de corps. 
Mr. President, when pressed to explain the reasons for the decline in readiness, Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff attributed the cause primarily to the high operational tempo and the under funding of the defense budgets. General Reimer encapsulated the problem in this way during the September 29 hearing: 
Soldiers are asking, `When is it going to stop? When will the downsizing end? When will our leaders stop asking us to do more with less?' Our soldiers are smart, hard working, and dedicated. They are also very tired. 
For many of us, the acknowledged shortfall in defense spending is not a surprise. Last year, during the Senate debate on the budget resolution, I expressed my concerns that funding levels for defense considered in the budget agreement would not provide sufficient funds to adequately sustain over time the personnel, quality of life, readiness and modernization programs critical to our military services. Regretfully, my concerns have become a reality sooner than expected and we must now take measures to resolve these problems and reverse the decline in the readiness of our military services. 
Mr. President, as long as the administration continues to pursue a foreign policy that requires the U.S. military to be a global police force, our troops will be challenged by an operational tempo higher than that of the cold war. If the administration persists in this endeavor, we must ensure that our armed forces have the funds to carry out these operations while maintaining a force structure that withstands the impact of the high operational and personnel tempos associated with our current aggressive foreign policy. 
More importantly, we have the responsibility to correct those quality of life and modernization shortfalls identified during our hearings. General Shelton recommended the following: 
My recommendation is to apply additional funding to two very real, very pressing concerns. First, we need to fix the so-called REDUX retirement system and return the bulk of our force to the program that covers our more senior members--that is, a retirement program that provides 50 percent of average base pay upon completion of twenty years of service. Second, we must begin to close the substantial gap between what we pay our men and women in uniform and what their civilian counterparts with similar skills, training, and education are earning.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Joint Chiefs described alarming indicators of declining readiness. I strongly believe that if there is an actual emergency that should be addressed in this omnibus supplemental bill, it should be military readiness. The Joint Chiefs testified that while the $1 billion readiness supplemental requested by the Department of Defense would be helpful, it is inadequate to maintain the readiness of our military forces. I believe that, as the highest priority, the Congress should have provided an emergency supplemental for military readiness of at least $2 billion. Mr. President, while I appreciate and commend the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the majority leader for negotiating this agreement under difficult circumstances, I regret that the final agreement provides only half that amount which I believe is required now to shore up our military readiness. 
Mr. President, next year, we are going to have to face up to the serious fiscal problems our military services are experiencing in addition to already existing outlay problems. The Secretary of Defense is conferring now with the Office of Management and Budget to determine how additional funds can be provided for defense next year and in the out years. I do not believe the administration will request the additional $20 billion or so which the Joint Chiefs indicated will be required annually over the next 5 years to address personnel, readiness, and modernization deficiencies. 
The Congress will have to come to grips with these funding realities or consider significantly scaling back our worldwide commitments. We cannot continue to have it both ways. It is unfair to our men and women in uniform and cannot be sustained over time. 
Mr. President, our hearings have substantiated the readiness and funding problem facing our armed forces. The solution to these problems will require the close cooperation between the Congress and the administration. It will require the Congress to relook the balanced budget agreement and will require challenging decisions by all parties. We have no choice but to make careful and deliberate decisions. The future of our Nation and the lives of our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines depend on it.  
Exhibit 1 U.S. SENATE, 
Committee on Armed Services, Washington, DC, October 8, 1998. 
Hon. William S. Cohen, Secretary of Defense, Washington, DC. 
Dear Mr. Secretary: In light of your recent testimony and the testimony of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before the Committee, it is obvious that maintaining the delicate balance among the key components of personnel and quality of life, readiness and modernization in the FY2000-2005 Future Years Defense Plan will be difficult. The current discussions of `catch-up' pay raises, returning to a richer military retirement system, funding modernization programs, providing adequate training funds and controlling high personnel and operational tempos make your task of setting priorities a significant challenge. 
As you develop the defense budget request for fiscal year 2000, it is imperative that the Department thoroughly analyze any proposals to address the pay gap or return to the pre-August 1986 military retirement system. We are totally committed, as we are sure you are, to taking care of our military personnel and their families. However, before enacting any proposals in this area with significant long-term costs, the Department of Defense and the Congress must have a clear view of the likely impact of the proposals on recruiting, retention, and military readiness. 
During our hearing on October 6, 1998, you testified that you would address the issues of military pay and retirement in your fiscal year 2000 budget. As you and the Chiefs testified, there are a number of programs that combine to make up Quality of Life for our military personnel and their families, including pay, retirement, housing, health care, personnel tempo and morale and recreation programs and facilities. We believe that recommendations included in your budget request for the areas indicated above must be fully supported by careful analyses justifying the costs and providing assurance of measurable increases in recruiting, retention and military readiness. 
We look forward to reviewing your recommendations in the FY 2000 budget request. 
Sincerely,

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment that we will not have the opportunity to vote before the end of this session on passage of S.J. Res. 40, the Constitutional amendment to protect the flag of the United States. 
Recently, the Majority Leader made a reasonable request for time for debate and then a vote on this amendment. However, the minority unfortunately would not agree. There is not time for extended debate on this issue in the last days of this session, but extended debate should not be necessary. 
We have considered this issue in the Judiciary Committee and on the Senate Floor many times in the past. In fact, we have been debating this matter for almost a decade. I have fought to achieve Constitutional protection for the flag ever since the Supreme Court first legitimized flag burning in the case of Texas v. Johnson in 1989. We have held numerous hearings on this in the Judiciary Committee, most recently this past July. 
In our history, the Congress has been very reluctant to amend the Constitution, and I agree with this approach. However, the Constitution provides for a method of amendment, and there are a few situations where an amendment is warranted. This is one of them. 
The only real argument against this amendment is that it interferes with an absolute interpretation of the free speech clause of the First Amendment. However, restrictions on speech already exist through Constitutional interpretation. In fact, before the Supreme Court ruled on this issue in 1989, the Federal government and the states believed that flag burning was not Constitutionally-protected speech. The Federal government and almost every state had laws prohibiting flag desecration in 1989. 
Mr. President, flag burning is intolerable. We have no obligation to permit this nonsense. Have we focused so much on the rights of the individual that we have forgotten the rights of the people? 
During moments of despair and crisis in our history, our people have turned to the flag as a symbol of national unity. It represents our nation, our national ideals, and our proud heritage. It is much more than a piece of cloth. 
One of the most vivid reminders of the importance of the flag is the Battle of Iwo Jima during World War II some 53 years ago. On the fourth day of the battle, after our troops fought their way onto the beaches and over dangerous terrain, six men raised a United States flag on the highest ridge on Mount Suribachi. That was February 23, 1945, but the battle raged on until March 15, 1945. During those weeks of fighting, the flag served as an inspiration for our troops to keep pressing forward to victory. 
Many times, American soldiers have put their lives on the line to defend what the flag represents. We have a duty to honor their sacrifices by giving the flag the Constitutional protection it deserves. 
Since we will not be able to turn to this amendment in the closing days of this session, this issue will have to wait for the next Congress. We must not be deterred. I am firmly committed to fighting for this amendment until we are successful.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, while each of us is looking forward to adjournment so that we may go home and spend time with our constituents and being closer to our family and friends, the end of the 105th Congress is a somewhat bittersweet occasion as many of our colleagues are concluding their careers in the Senate. One member who will not be back with us in January is my friend, Senator Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho. 
Senator Kempthorne arrived in Washington six-years-ago and very quickly established a reputation for not only being dedicated to the duties and responsibilities of his office, but for being an individual with a keen mind who approached matters before this body in a very thoughtful and deliberative manner. His opinion on issues was always well regarded and void of partisan rhetoric. Though one will never have every member of this Body agree with their position, everyone gave considerable weight to the remarks and positions of the Senator from Idaho. 
One of Senator Kempthorne's committee assignments was to the Armed Services Committee and I quickly spotted his leadership ability, and in a relatively short period of time, assigned him the chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Personnel. This was a demanding job, especially in this era when we are not only trying to determine what the appropriate size of the military should be, but also because of a number of highly emotional issues related to personnel matters. Regardless of the issue that was before his subcommittee, Senator Kempthorne worked hard to ensure that he discharged his responsibilities impartially, and with the best interests of our men and women in uniform in mind. 
Beyond earning a reputation for being an intelligent student of public policy, Senator Kempthorne also earned a well deserved reputation for being a decent man. He was unfailingly polite and cordial to everyone with whom he dealt. Whether it was a witness before the Committee, a debate opponent on the Senate Floor, or one of the thousands of support staff that work in the Senate, Dirk Kempthorne was pleasant, respectful, and cordial. 
It is truly our loss that Senator Kempthorne has decided to leave the Senate and return to Idaho, but the citizens of that state will indeed benefit when our friend is elected Governor. The ability he demonstrated for leadership and civility will serve both he and his constituents well and I am certain that Idaho will be regarded as one of the most efficiently run states in the Union before the end of his first term. My counsel to the members of this Chamber is that Dirk Kempthorne is a man to keep your eye on, and frankly, I would not be surprised if he were to return to Washington one day, though to take an office that is at the opposite end of Pennsylvania Avenue. Regardless, I wish both he and his lovely wife Patricia health, happiness, and great success in the years to come, we shall miss them both.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, there is perhaps no other legislative body in the world that attracts a more competent group of public servants than the United States Senate. In the almost 45 years I have spent in this institution, I have had the good fortune to serve with a number of very capable, dedicated, and selfless individuals who have worked hard to represent their constituents and do what is best for the nation. One person who is an excellent example of the high caliber of person who is drawn to public service is my good friend and colleague, Dan Coats. 
The Mid-West has the uncanny way of producing men and women of imminent sense and decency, individuals who have the ability to see to the heart of a matter and find a way to resolve a problem. Such skill is extremely valuable in the United States Senate, a body by its very design that is supposed to foster compromise between legislators on issues before the nation. Without question, Dan Coats is a Senator who worked hard to bring parties together, find common ground, and to get legislation passed. That is certainly a fine legacy with which to leave this institution. 
More than being an able legislator, Senator Coats developed a strong expertise on defense matters, particularly those related to his responsibilities as Chairman of the Airland Subcommittee of the Committee on the Armed Services. In this role, Senator Coats was responsible for providing advice and helping shape policy on matters related to how to describe what the threat and future threats to our Nation are, how our military should be structured in order to guarantee our security, and what sort of ground and aviation assets our troops need in order to do our jobs. Senator Coats had to be well versed in everything from the GoreTex booties that go into the boots of our soldiers to the advanced aerodynamical concepts that are being used in the helicopters and jets being developed for our forces. Few other individuals could have mastered these disparate topics so well, and that Senator Coats was able to do so, and make it look so easy, is a testament to this man's intellect, dedication, and ability. 
Without question, we are going to miss the many contributions of Senator Coats, both to the Committee and to the full Senate. He had a wry sense of humor, a civil demeanor, and a desire to serve our nation. His departure from the Senate is truly a loss, but I am confident that he will continue to find a way to serve and to make a difference. I will miss him, both as a friend and a colleague, and I would like to take this opportunity to wish both he and his lovely wife Marcia great success and happiness in all his future endeavors.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, though the 105th Congress will soon come to a close, and each of us will return home to meet with constituents, or take fact finding trips throughout the nation or the world, one of our colleagues has not only already left town, but is headed for a most unusual destination, that of outer space. I speak, of course, of our friend, John Glenn who is ending his career in the United States Senate. 
Like most people, I first learned of John Glenn in 1962 when he orbited the Earth, but when the people of Ohio elected him to this Body in 1974, I had the opportunity to come to know him personally. In the subsequent years, we worked closely together on a number of issues, especially those related to national security as we served together on the Senate Committee on the Armed Forces. Naturally, his experiences as a Marine Corps officer gave Senator Glenn valuable insight into defense matters and he played an important role on the Committee and in working to help provide for a military adequately capable of protecting the United States. 
The same qualities that made John Glenn a successful Marine and astronaut, served him well here in the United States Senate. Without question, he is a determined man who has earned our respect for his honor, ability, and dedication. His desire to serve our nation is an inspiration, and in keeping with the highest traditions of public service. Without question, he has set an excellent example for others to follow and it is my hope that more people, from Ohio and throughout the United States, will follow his lead and find a way to make a difference in their communities and to our nation. 
Mr. President, the United States Senate will just not be quite the same place without the presence of Senator John Glenn. We appreciate the many ways in which he has served so admirably and wish both he and his lovely wife Annie health, happiness, and success in the years ahead.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, Kentucky is famous for many things, including its bourbon and the Derby, but what I have come to associate most with the `Bluegrass State' over the past 24-years is Senator Wendell Ford, who I regret to note is leaving the Senate at the end of the 105th Congress. 
Senator Ford is a man with a deep and unwavering commitment to public service. He served in the United States Army during World War II and continued his military service as a member of the Kentucky National Guard. He has held elected office at both the state and federal levels, holding the titles of state senator and governor before being elected to the United States Senate in 1974. 
Each of us understands that our primary job as Senators is to make the law, but many of us also believe that we should use our offices to help the people of our states. This is a sentiment that Senator Ford and I share, and over the years, my friend from Kentucky has worked tirelessly to help his state develop and prosper. While Kentucky, like South Carolina, is still a largely rural state, thanks in no small part to the efforts of Wendell Ford, the people of Kentucky are enjoying opportunities and economic growth that has been substantial. 
During his time in Washington, Senator Ford has held a number of key positions, both in the Senate and in political organizations. His leadership roles as an Assistant Leader and a former Committee Chairman stand as testament to both his abilities and the regard in which he is held by his peers. 
I am certain that Senator Ford did not easily come to the decision to retire, but I am certain that he and his lovely wife Jean are looking forward to their new life. I wish both of them health, happiness and success in whatever endeavor they undertake.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, one of the things that makes the Senate such a unique and enjoyable place to work is the fact that there are 100 unique personalities that make up this institution. While each member takes his or her duties seriously, I hope that I do not offend anyone when I say that not all are gifted orators. One person who definitely can engage in articulate and compelling debate, and is also able to bring a little levity to our proceedings through his wit and ability to tell a story is the Senator from Arkansas, Dale Bumpers. 
First elected to the Senate in 1974, Senator Bumpers arrived with an already well established and well deserved reputation for having a commitment to serving is constituents and our Nation. He served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II, as well as the Governor of Arkansas, having been elected to that post in 1970. Clearly, his training as the chief executive of his home State, along with experiences as a trial lawyer, gave him the skills that would make him an effective and respected Senator. 
For the past more than 20-years, Senator Bumpers has worked hard to represent his State, and in doing so, has made many valuable contributions to the U.S. Senate. I regret that we have not shared any committee assignments, but I have always respected and valued the opinions of the Senator from Arkansas. His exist from the Senate leaves this institution without one of its most impressive and effective advocates. 
I am certain that Dale  and his lovely wife Betty will enjoy the more deliberate lifestyle and pace that bring out of politics will afford them and I wish the both of them health, happiness and success in the years ahead.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the framers of the Constitution worked to lay out the foundation of the United States, they very wisely decided that the military forces of this nation should be subservient to civilian leadership. For the past 224 years, this arrangement has worked well proving the wisdom of the men who drafted the document that serves as the cornerstone of our democracy and government. 
One of the reasons that civilian leadership of the military has worked so well is because Presidents search tirelessly to find qualified individuals to fill the critical positions of the service secretaries. If we were to look across the Potomac and into the `E' ring of the Pentagon, we would find a group of selfless men and women serving as the civilian leadership of America's armed forces. One of those individuals is Secretary of the Navy John H. Dalton, who will be stepping down from his position at the end of this year. 
When John Dalton raised his right hand on July 22, 1993, swore his oath and became the 70th Secretary of the Navy, he came to the office well trained to discharge the duties of his new office. Not only was he a successful corporate executive with invaluable experience in managing a large organization, he graduated from the United States Naval Academy and served as an officer aboard the submarines USS Blueback and USS John C. Calhoun. Additionally, he served in the Carter Administration as a member and chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. 
The challenges of essentially being the first post-Cold War Secretary of the Navy were significant. Secretary Dalton had the unenviable task of being responsible for the reshaping of the Navy and the Marine Corps to meet the security needs of the United States in a world that is no longer bi-polar. Under his direction, the Navy and the Marine Corps implemented the new doctrines of `Forward, From the Sea: Anytime, Anywhere', and `Operational Maneuver from the Sea', both which will help America meet its short and long-term tactical and strategic needs. Furthermore, Secretary Dalton worked to achieve acquisition initiatives seeking to establish practices resulting in the procurement of the best equipment for our sailors and marines, at the fairest cost to the taxpayer. The new attack submarine teaming arrangement, the DDG-51 multi-year procurement, and the testing and evaluation of the F/A-18 E/F are all examples of such successful endeavors. 
Unquestionably, the Navy and Marine Corps that Secretary Dalton will turn over to his successor are institutions that have benefitted from the leadership of this charismatic and kind Texan. His efforts have earned him the respect and accolades of people in the Congress, in the Executive Branch, in industry, in academia, and around the world, and even resulted in his being awarded with the National Security Caucus' prestigious International Leadership Award in 1997. He is the first service secretary to be recognized in this manner and his winning this award is a testament to the regard in which he is held. 
Mr. President, I have worked with a lot of service secretaries in my almost 45 years in this body and I say without reservation that John Dalton is one of the finest individuals to have ever served in that capacity. He is a man of honor, ability, and dedication and he will certainly be missed. I know that everyone in this chamber joins me in wishing him `fair winds and following seas' as he completes his public service to the Department of the Navy and the United States of America.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the nomination of William Fletcher for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
When this nomination was first considered in the Judiciary Committee in 1996, I opposed it because I believed that the anti-nepotism statute, 28 U.S.C. 458, prohibited him from serving on the Ninth Circuit based on the fact that his mother, Betty Fletcher, is a judge on the same court. There has been some dispute about whether this statute applies to judges rather than only inferior court employees, and the Senate yesterday passed legislation by Senator Kyl to clarify that the statute does apply to judges. However, the revision is prospective in nature and does not apply to Professor Fletcher. In my view, Professor Fletcher's nomination violates the statute as it existed before the Senate's clarification. Thus, I must oppose this nomination because I believe it violates the anti-nepotism laws. 
Moreover, I have serious reservations about Professor Fletcher's judicial philosophy. I believe we have a duty to oppose nominees who do not have a proper respect for the limited role of a judge in our system of government. 
One of the strongest and most influential advocates for an activist Federal judiciary in this century was Supreme Court Justice William Brennan. He believed that the Constitution was a living document and that judges should interpret the Constitution as though its words change and adapt over time. I have always believed that this view of the Constitution is not only wrong but dangerous to our system of government. The words of the Constitution do not change. They have an established meaning that should not change based on the views of a judge. They should change only through an amendment to the Constitution. It is through the amendment process that the people can determine for themselves what the Constitution says, rather than unaccountable, unelected judges making the decisions for them. 
Professor Fletcher has written in strong support of Justice Brennan and his activist judicial philosophy. In a 1991 law review article, he praised Justice Brennan for his, quote, `sense that the Constitution has meaning beyond the bare words of the text.' He stated that some parts of the Constitution are, quote, `almost constitutional truths in search of a text.' He even approvingly quoted Justice Brennan's famous statement regarding Constitutional interpretation that, quote, `the ultimate question must be what do the words of the text mean in our time.' 
I firmly believe that the role of the judge is to interpret the law as the legislature intended, not to interpret the law consistent with the judge's public policy objectives. A judge does not make the law and is not a public policy maker. Professor Fletcher has been critical of the modern Supreme Court for its lack of political and governmental experience. In a 1987 law review article, he criticized recent landmark Supreme Court decisions on the separation of powers, saying the Court, quote, `read the Constitution in a literalistic way to upset what the other two branches had decided, under the political circumstances, was the most workable arrangement.' What is convenient in a political sense is irrelevant to a proper interpretation of the Constitution. 
Moreover, Professor Fletcher has been nominated to the Ninth Circuit, and the Supreme Court routinely finds it necessary to reverse the Ninth Circuit. Indeed, in recent years, the Ninth Circuit has been reversed far more often than any other circuit. This trend will be corrected only if we confirm sound, mainstream judges to this critical circuit. I do not see that problem abating with nominees such as the one here, who even characterizes himself as being in his words, quote, `fairly close to the mainstream.' 
If Professor Fletcher is confirmed, I sincerely hope that he turns out to be a sound, mainstream judge and not a judicial activist from the left. I hope he helps to improve the dismal reversal rate of the Ninth Circuit. 
However, we must evaluate judges based on the record we have before us. As I read Professor Fletcher's record, it does not convince me that he is an appropriate addition to the Court of Appeals. Therefore, because of my interpretation of the anti-nepotism statute and my concerns about judicial activism, I cannot support this nominee.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for the Conference Report to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. As one of the conferees, I believe this bill represents a fair compromise between the House and Senate versions of this most significant legislation. 
Intellectual property is an increasingly important part of the American economy. This bill recognizes the significance of our copyright laws as America and the world have become increasingly computerized. The Internet is rapidly changing our lives, and our copyright laws must keep pace. 
This legislation implements the WIPO treaties to help protect the property rights of the creative community in our global environment. It also clarifies the liability of on-line and Internet service providers regarding their liability for copyright infringement and permits fair use of works. Together, these provisions do a great deal to accommodate the interests of the owners of copyrighted works with those who use or facilitate the use of those works in the digital age. 
A final title of the bill is the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act. Although it was not part of the Senate version of the legislation, it was accepted at conference. I share Senator Hatch's concerns about this controversial title. It contains not only industrial design protection, which itself has created controversy in the past because of its impact on consumers and others, but it protects functionality of vessel hulls in addition to aesthetic aspects. It is my understanding that functionality is protected from copying through patent, and this title is a significant departure from that principle, although for a specific narrow area. 
Also, I wish to note that although data base protection is not included in this bill, I think it is important that we make every effort to address this significant issue next year. 
In closing, I wish to thank the Chairman of the conference, Senator Hatch, and all of the other members of the conference for their cooperation in resolving this matter. I am very pleased with the outcome.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue of serious consequence in the Intelligence Authorization Conference Report. Although I have signed the conference report and intend to support it on the Senate floor, I feel compelled to voice my concern over the manner in which the conference report deals with the Future Imagery Architecture, a program managed by the National Reconnaissance Office. I make these remarks with the complete understanding that conference is always difficult, and always improve compromises. 
Although there are reasons to be concerned about cost growth in the FIA program, I am just as concerned that the intelligence conference report will have negative and unforeseen consequences for this important program. The conference report mandates fixed deployment dates, fixed costs, and fixed portions of the budget for subsidizing the commercial sector. Perhaps more troubling, the conference report fences one hundred percent of the FIA budget for fiscal year 1999 pending the completion of several significant tasks, a number of which are outside the purview of the NRO. Since FY 1999 has already commenced, this means that none of the FIA budget can be accessed for many months, even to support completion of the tasks that the conference report has mandated. In my view, imposing such limitations before a contract has even been awarded is an unprecedented and unwarranted degree of micro-management. 
Based on my concerns, I have requested the views of the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The preliminary report that I have received indicates that OSD and JCS have serious concerns similar to mine. 
It has been asserted that the FIA program must live under a congressionally imposed cost cap in order to prevent it from `eating' the entire National Foreign Intelligence Program. Some who make this argument, however, also want to see FIA's capabilities to support military users reduced so that savings can be used to support other programs within the NFIP that have a more `national' orientation. The fact of the matter is, however, even though FIA is funded in the NFIP, by its nature and the mission of the NRO, it must provide robust support to military forces. The Intelligence Committees must ensure that their bill supports these military missions as well as the other programs and missions funded within the NFIP.

Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I wish to express my support for S. 505, the Copyright Term Extension Act, as amended. I wish to thank the Majority Leader, Senator Hatch, and others in the Senate for their commitment to this important issue. I also wish to thank Speaker Gingrich, Congressman Sensenbrenner, and others in the House for their hard work in this regard. 
This bill will greatly benefit the American copyright community by making our copyright term protections consistent with Europe. At the same time, it provides meaningful relief to small businesses, including restaurants, hair salons, and many other establishments, regarding licensing fees for broadcast music. It exempts eating and drinking establishments to a certain square footage and other establishments to a certain square footage of a lesser degree. It also creates a fairer venue for rate dispute resolution through the circuit court venue. 
It is also my understanding that nothing in Section 512(4) of the Copyright Act, as amended by the bill, is intended to change the burden of proof with respect to rates or fees under applicable consent decrees, which places the burden of showing a reasonable rate or fee on the performing rights society. 
The agreement is not nearly as extensive as S. 28, the Fairness in Musical Licensing Act, which I introduced at the start of this Congress. However, this legislation represents a fair compromise to this important and complex issue of National significance. I am pleased that we have reached this resolution.

These awards were recommended by the Secretary of the Navy based upon requests from Members of Congress. These procedures were established by section 526 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 to resolve a dilemma under which deserving individuals were denied the recognition they deserved solely due to the passage of time.

Mr. THURMOND. I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the intent of this provision. The Conference Report authorizes children of Customs Service employees to attend the Department of Defense school in Puerto Rico during the period of their assignment in Puerto Rico. Our intent was to remove the five-year limit on the eligibility for children of non-Department of Defense personnel to attend the DOD school in Puerto Rico since Customs employees are routinely stationed in locations like Puerto Rico longer than five years. The provision does not require the Customs Service to pay tuition costs for these children to attend the DOD school; however, the Secertary of Defense may work with the Secretary of the Treasury to provide reimbursement for the tuition costs for children of Customs Service employees.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today the Senate considers the conference report to accompany the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. I want to thank all the members of the conference committee for their hard work and cooperation. To give the Members of the Senate some insight into the complexity and magnitude of the work involved in the conference process, we had to reconcile nearly 1,000 funding differences and craft compromises for over 570 legislative issues in disagreement between the House and Senate bills. The conferees succeeded in settling the many difficult issues in this complex process only by putting the national interest above all others. I particularly want to thank Senator Levin, the ranking member of our committee, for his continued leadership and support. 
I also want to acknowledge the contributions of Senator Coats, Senator Kempthorne, and Senator Glenn. This is their last defense authorization bill. On behalf of the committee and the Senate, I wish to thank them again for their dedication to the national security of our country and their support for the young men and women who serve in our armed services. We will miss their valuable counsel next year.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I also wish to recognize the members and staff of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. We have worked more closely together this year than ever before. I want to express on behalf of the Armed Services Committee our appreciation to Chairman Stevens and to the members and staff of the Defense Subcommittee for their cooperation and support. 
Working together, we have produced a bill which keeps the Department of Defense on a steady course and is consistent with the balanced budget agreement. It is a sound bipartisan approach to some very difficult policy issues. This is reflected in the fact that for the first time in memory, all of the conferees in both committees have signed the conference report. This bill sends a strong signal to our men and women in uniform and their families that we are fully committed to supporting them as they perform their dangerous missions around the world. 
The conference report addresses three challenges to maintaining a strong national defense in the 21st century: the training and readiness of our military forces, the modernization of weapon systems and other defense equipment, and the preservation of quality of life programs for our military personnel and their families. The conference report, for example, authorizes funding of increases to a number of readiness accounts totaling nearly $1 billion above the administration request. 
We have also authorized the construction of six new ships, increased the procurement of new tactical aircraft, and provided an increase of approximately $90 million for advanced space systems and technologies as well as an increase of about $132 million for strategic force upgrades. 
In the conference, we have authorized a 3.6-percent pay raise and a comprehensive series of accession and retention bonuses and special pay to reduce the financial sacrifices involved with military service. In order to enhance the quality of life for our service personnel and their families, we have authorized increases totaling $666 million above the request for military construction and family housing. 
The conferees have also crafted a number of management initiatives to ensure that limited budgets are managed more efficiently and that the burdens of service for our men and women in uniform are kept to a reasonable level. The bill includes provisions to ensure that commercial sole-source spare parts are procured in a cost-effective manner. The conference report authorizes a series of initiatives to test new health care benefits for Medicare-eligible military retirees. The bill also requires the Department of Defense to address the Year 2000 information technology issues in a more comprehensive fashion. 
Mr. President, this conference report is a sound and balanced approach to meeting our national security needs with constrained resources. It is my hope that the Senate will vote to adopt the report overwhelmingly. 
This is the 40th defense authorization conference report on which I have worked since joining the Armed Services Committee in 1959. It is the fourth and last as chairman of the committee as I have announced my intention to step down as chairman at the end of this year while retaining my seat on the committee. I regard my work on the committee to ensure a strong national defense as among the most important accompishments of my public service. My tenure as chairman over the last 4 years has been the culmination of that service. Words cannot express the pride and appreciation I feel for the honor my colleagues have bestowed by designating this authorization bill as the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. 
Looking back over the national security issues that have challenged the United States over the past 40 years and turning forward to the 21st century, I am very concerned about maintaining our ability to meet foreign policy ambitions with declining defense resources. If we do not change course soon, present and projected defense investment levels will expose the people of the United States to unacceptable levels of risk. We will have abdicated our fundamental responsibility to provide for a strong common defense. 
We are in the midst of a period of unprecedented commitment of U.S. military forces in peacetime. The United States is using military forces to respond to a growing spectrum of international aggression, ethnic unrest, and domestic conflict. The operational tempo of each of our services is at an all time high as we respond in a sustained manner to crises in Africa, the Persian Gulf, and the Balkans. As we struggle with supporting these operational deployments, the backlog of modernization and real property upgrades continues to climb. Moreover, the imperative of maintaining our defense technological superiority over the next 10 to 15 years will soon generate a further requirement for substantial new investment. 
Yet our defense spending is declining. The authorization for new budget authority in this conference report is $270.5 billion, which is $2.6 billion below the inflation-adjusted level for fiscal year 1998. We are currently spending barely more than 3 percent of our gross domestic product on defense. This level is consistent with defense spending during the Depression-ridden 1930's. That level is projected to decline even further to 2.6 percent by 2002. We cannot hope to meet increasing foreign policy commitments with such declining resources. 
We are already seeing the effects of this mismatch of resources and commitments. The Chiefs of the military services indicate that they have now hit rock bottom in readiness and modernization. We are seeing increasing spare parts shortages, increased cannibalization, declining unit operational readiness rates, cross-decking of critical weapons, equipment and personnel. Personnel retention rates--especially for skilled personnel such as pilots--are in a steep decline.

Mr. THURMOND. The extent of current and future readiness problems were laid out in stark detail Tuesday morning by the Joint Chiefs of Staff at a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The service Chiefs all testified on the manner in which our current readiness is fraying and the long-term health of the Total Force is in jeopardy. While additional funding in fiscal year 1999 will help address the most pressing short-term concerns, it is imperative that we provide significant continuing increases in funds for modernization above that for additional pay and benefits. The Marine Corps estimates a shortfall of $1.8 billion per year in modernization over the Future Years Defense Program under the current administration projections. The Army estimates an annual $3 to $5 billion per year shortfall during the same period. We must embark on a course of sustained increases in defense investment over the next several years. 
Mr. President, at the beginning of this Congress, I called for developing a clearer strategic context within which to design an effective, affordable national defense to meet our foreign policy commitments. The need for this clarity has never been greater. With the belated recognition by the President of the need for increased defense resources, we have an opportunity to free the determination of U.S. strategy from being a by-product of the budget process. As I said in February 1997, let us seize the day. We must work in a cooperative, bipartisan fashion to avert a certain military decline. The first step in that process is the rapid and overwhelming approval of this conference report.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I agree with the view expressed by my colleague, the Ranking Minority Member of the Armed Services Committee. He has stated correctly the views of the Senate and the House in agreeing to Section 1512 during the conference on the defense bill. 
With regard to concerns that the requirement for a 15-day advance certification concerning the export of items listed in the MTCR Annex to the PRC would delay the ability to provide spare parts for in-service civilian commercial aircraft in an emergency while in the PRC, it is not the intent to delay the export of items for emergency repair of in-service civilian commercial aircraft while in the PRC. 
This view, however, should not be mistaken as a green light to stockpile technology and spare parts which are on the MTCR Annex above what is necessary to provide emergency service for in-service commercial aircraft.

The bipartisan support of both the majority and the minority leaders is critical to successful passage of the conference report of such magnitude. 
The majority leader, Senator Lott, a former member of our committee, recognizes the importance of this bill and has always given his full support and assistance in passing a bill of this nature. I thank him for his time and support and all he has done in this respect. 
I extend my appreciation to the leadership staff and the floor staff for their assistance which is essential to passing this large, complex bill. 
In that connection, Mr. President, I wish to especially commend Les Brownlee, staff director of the Armed Services Committee. He has rendered yeoman service to this committee, and I can't say enough in support of all he has done. George Lauffer, the deputy staff director, has also been most faithful and has done an outstanding job. We appreciate that and thank him for what he has done in this connection. I also wish to thank David Lyles on the other side, and those who worked with him, for their fine cooperation and support. They have been most cooperative and have rendered a great service. 
Mr. President, we appreciate the work of two House Members. We thank Floyd Spence, who happens to be from my State, for handling the House bill. He is an outstanding gentleman of character and ability, and I thank him for all he has done in cooperating with us on the defense legislation. Ike Skelton, a Democrat, who works with Congressman Spence, has also been cooperative and helpful, and I express my appreciation to him, too. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the Senate takes up the conference report on the national defense authorization bill, it brings to an end a process that began in February with the introduction of the President's defense budget by Secretary Cohen. During the intervening months, the committee conducted more than 50 hearings which identified the declining readiness status of our military. In response, the committee formulated a bill that addressed these issues and garnered the support of both the civilian and military leadership of the Department of Defense. 
The committee completed the markup of the defense bill in mid-May. However, due to the intervening debate on the tobacco bill, the Senate took more than four weeks to complete action on the bill. Although the floor debate was protracted, I want to thank my colleagues for their overwhelming 88 to 4 vote in favor of the bill, and for their contributions during the floor debate. 
The Senate's strong support of the bill was a key factor during the difficult conference with the House. When we began the conference to resolve the differences between the House and Senate bills, we faced a veto threat on four provisions. I am pleased to report that we were able to mitigate each of these objections. At this point, I am not aware of any remaining veto issues, and expect that the President will sign this bill. 
Mr. President, tomorrow prior to the vote on final passage, Senator Levin and I will provide specific details on the conference report. Suffice it to say that this is a very good bill and contains vital provisions necessary for the security of our nation. However, like all compromise bills it does not please everyone and, unfortunately, one Senator has objected to provisions in the bill and delayed action on the report despite the fact that all members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House National Security Committee signed the conference report and despite the fact that the House passed the bill by a vote of 373 to 50. I am disappointed that it took until today to get the report to the floor, but am certain that the Senate will show its strong support for the bill when we vote tomorrow. 
Mr. President, I want to emphasize again that this is a sound bill. It provides the best possible outcome for our national security while complying with the guidelines established in the balanced budget agreement. I recommend the conference report on the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1999 to the Senate and urge its adoption.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, earlier today, my good friend, the junior Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, entered into a colloquy with Senator Warner and others regarding the tritium provisions included in the Defense authorization conference report. Senator Kyl later made a statement about the agreement we negotiated in conference on the tritium issue. While I appreciated the kind words he said about me, I was somewhat surprised by some of his comments made about the tritium agreement we negotiated in conference. I'm reminded of something my old friend, Will Rogers used to say, `It's not what he don't know that bothers me, it's what he knows so well, that ain't so.' 
I want to take this opportunity to clarify what the conference agreement actually does. The tritium provision included in this bill will not cause any meaningful delay in the resumption of tritium production. Let me repeat that so all of my colleagues are clear about this point--our conference provision on tritium does not cause any meaningful delay in the Department of Energy's tritium production program. 
Energy Secretary Richardson stated this fact in a letter dated September 24, 1998, in which he said that the conference provision will have a `minimal impact' on DOE's tritium program. 
Just so all Senators will understand the compromise agreement we made on the tritium issue, I want to take a few moments to explain it. 
First and foremost, we require the Secretary of Energy to select his preferred technology on time, in December of this year. Second, the Department of Energy is prohibited from spending only about 5 percent of the overall tritium program budget in fiscal year 1999. The conference agreement does not, however, limit the DOE from spending funds for design, research, or demonstration activities. These design, research, and demonstration activities account for approximately 95 percent of the program that DOE presented to Congress this year, which the Congress authorized. Thus, virtually all of those activities which the Department intended to conduct in fiscal year 1999 are authorized to be conducted by the conference agreement and the conferees expect the Secretary to complete those activities in fiscal year 1999. This includes much of the work to be conducted on the tritium extraction facility, which would be constructed regardless of which technology were selected by the Secretary. Third, and most importantly, we require the Secretary of Energy to submit a comprehensive plan in January, 1999--just 20 days after he makes his preferred technology selection--on how tritium production will be restored. Such a plan does not exist currently, nor has one been proposed by the administration. This comprehensive implementation plan goes to the very issue raised by the Senator from Arizona. 
So I hope all Senators can readily see that we managed to achieve a compromise on this very difficult issue, with virtually no adverse impact on the tritium program, while avoiding a veto threat, and satisfying most of the desires of most members. 
This is a very strong bipartisan bill. Every member of the conference committee--both Democrats and Republicans--have indicated their strong support the conference agreement by signing the conference report, which as many of my colleagues know has not happened in many years. This is a good conference report and it should be passed with unanimous support.

Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise today in support of cloture on S. 2176, the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. This legislation should be entirely nonpartisan because it is essential to the advice and consent role of the Senate. 
Recent Administrations, both Republican and Democrat, have failed to send nominations to the Senate in a timely manner. Instead, they have appointed people to serve in an acting capacity for long periods of time without seeking confirmation. 
This is a matter of great significance. One of the primary fears of the Founders was the accumulation of too much power in one source, and the separation of powers among the three branches of government is one of the keys to the success of our great democratic government. An excellent example of the separation of powers is the requirement in Article 2, Section 2 of the Constitution that the President receive the advice and consent of the Senate for the appointment of officers of the United States. As Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the Supreme Court a few years ago, `The Clause is a bulwark against one branch aggrandizing its power at the expense of another branch.' 
The Vacancies Act is central to the Appointments Clause because it places limits on the amount of time that the President can appoint someone to an advice and consent position in an acting capacity without sending a nomination to the Senate. For too many years, the Executive Branch has failed to comply with the letter or the spirit of the law. 
I raised this issue for the first time this Congress in April of last year at a Justice Department oversight hearing. At the time, almost all of the top positions at the Justice Department were being filled in an acting capacity. They included the Associate Attorney General, Solicitor General, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, and Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. 
President Clinton allowed the Criminal Division of the Justice Department to languish for over two and one half years before submitting a nomination. The government had an Acting Solicitor General for an entire term of the Supreme Court. Most recently, the President installed Bill Lann Lee as Acting Chief of the Civil Rights Division in blatant disregard of the Judiciary Committee's decision not to support his controversial choice. Mr. Lee has been serving as Acting Chief for ten months, and the President apparently has no intentions of nominating someone the Judiciary Committee can support. 
Let me be clear. The issue is not about any one President or any one nominee. It is about preserving the institutional role of the Senate. A Republican President has no more right to ignore the appointments process than a Democrat President. 
I responded to this problem by introducing a resolution about one year ago. However, I soon realized that a total rewrite of the Vacancies Act with an enforcement mechanism would be required to force the Executive Branch to follow the law in this area. Thus, earlier this year, I sponsored a bill on behalf of myself and the Majority Leader to rewrite the law regarding vacancies. 
Today, I am pleased today to be an original cosponsor of S. 2176, the bill that we are debating today. It contains the two primary objectives that I outlined when I testified before the Governmental Affairs Committee earlier this year: the need to totally redraft the Vacancies Act and to provide a mechanism for enforcement. Senator Thompson has done a fine job in drafting S. 2176 and in shepherding it through the Governmental Affairs Committee. He has worked hard to create a bipartisan consensus for this legislation. In that regard, I am pleased that my distinguished colleague who is an expert on the institution of the Senate, Senator Byrd, is an original cosponsor of this legislation.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment. I believe that it is a very important amendment. Other countries are going forward and developing missile systems. Can we afford not to do it? For the sake of our people and the sake of this Nation, we should seize this opportunity to go forward on this matter promptly. It is in the interest of our Nation and the people of this country that we take that step. 
I thank the Senator, very much, for yielding to me.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of cloture on the motion to proceed to S.1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, which will be voted on later today. This legislation is urgently needed to address abuses of our bankruptcy laws and help make sure bankruptcy is reserved for those who truly need it. 
We have had Federal bankruptcy laws for 100 years, and no one disputes that some people must file for bankruptcy. Some people fall on hard times and have financial problems that dwarf their financial means. They need to have the debts that they cannot pay forgiven under chapter 7. 
However, other people who file for bankruptcy have assets or have the ability to repay their debts over time. These people should reorganize their debts under chapter 13. Bankruptcy should not be an avenue for someone to avoid paying their debts when they have the ability to do so. People should pay what they can. 
Unfortunately, too many people today who file for bankruptcy choose to discharge their debts rather than reorganize them and pay what they can. The reason may be because filing for bankruptcy does not have the moral stigma it once had. It may be because the person needs to be educated on how to better manage their money. Maybe attorneys do not encourage enough people to reorganize their debts. Whatever the reason, it is a big problem today. 
The problem is becoming more serious because more and more people are filing for bankruptcy every year. In fact, more Americans filed for bankruptcy last year than ever before, about 1.35 million people.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, last Thursday the Armed Services and foreign Relations Committees held a joint hearing to hear testimony from a courageous and dedicated American--Major Scott Ritter. Major Ritter began his opening statement by saying, 
Last week I resigned my position with UNSCOM out of frustration because the U.N. Security Council, and the United States, as its most significant supporter, were failing to enforce the post-Gulf War resolutions designed to disarm Iraq. I sincerely hope that my actions might help to change things . . . 
For nearly three hours, Major Ritter responded to Senators' questions, describing how U.S. policies in support of United Nations Security Council resolutions were not being honestly implemented. He also expressed his views regarding the dangers associated with Iraq's continuing pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and how this Nation's victory in the Persian Gulf war was being squandered. 
Major Ritter served as an intelligence officer in the Marine Corps during the Persian Gulf War to liberate Kuwait from Iraq. He became a United Nations inspector in 1991 and acted under international law created by the United States and the United Nations. His job as an inspector was to plan and conduct inspections to eliminate illegal weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Major Ritter was deeply dedicated to his duties. He explained that his duty as a weapons inspector represented a vital continuation of what many Americans had fought and died for during the Gulf War. Finding and destroying these dangerous weapons is critically important to the United States and our allies. These weapons of mass destruction could one day be used again by Saddam Hussein to attack his neighbors, dominate the region and threaten vital interests of the United States. Major Ritter was dedicated to reducing the threat from such weapons. He earned a reputation as a tough, demanding inspector. Saddam Hussein feared his perseverance and tried to get him removed from UNSCOM and Iraq. I regret that he has resigned. I felt better knowing Major Ritter was on the job. However, Major Ritter found that he was repeatedly and systematically hindered from performing his duties. The very laws he was asked to enforce were not now being supported by the U.N. Security Council nor his own government. 
Major Ritter's resignation from his position as an UNSCOM inspector was a selfless and patriotic act. However, his resignation and the reason for his resignation deserve our immediate attention and action. I hope that his personal sacrifice will spur the Congress and the Administration to act with the same courage and urgency as Major Ritter. 
During the hearing, Major Ritter was asked all the most difficult questions to challenge his judgment and veracity. His challengers were unsuccessful. He simply told the truth, and the truth is a National embarrassment. Although Major Ritter had the courtesy not to say it, his message was clear. `Congress, I have done my job. It is now time to do yours.' Our job in Congress requires the same courage Major Ritter displayed last week and for the past nine years as a weapons inspector for the United Nations. I am deeply disappointed that such a brave and bright young American was forced into choosing to resign from his duties because of his principles. His actions clearly send us a message. `This Nation's actions must be consistent with its policies.' 
I believe that our Nation and the world are far less safe as a result of Saddam Hussein's programs of weapons of mass destruction. We must insist that UNSCOM be allowed to do its job. We in government must say what we mean, and do as we say. We have not been doing this recently in our foreign and national defense policies. 
Mr. President, it is now Congress' responsibility to ensure that this happens. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

For as long as he has been in the Senate, and the longer I have dealt with him, I am more impressed with him. He is a member of the opposite party from me, but we can't go by party in deciding the merits of a man. We have to decide his own qualities.

I can't thank enough the Members of the Senate for their kind words--Senator Lott, the majority leader; Senator Daschle, the minority leader, Senator Byrd, Senator Biden, Senator Conrad, Senator Wellstone, Senator Hollings, Senator Coats, and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. I will not take time now to say much. I just want to express my appreciation to all of them for their kind words. 
I have been in the Senate now for 44 years, and I have never known or served with finer people than we have here. I have cast my 15,000th vote. The quality of the people in this body is just outstanding, and I wish all of them to stay here until they could cast 15,000 votes. It is an experience to be in this body that one will never forget. As time goes by I think we appreciate more and more the Members of this body, what they stand for, and their outstanding service. 
Again, I thank all of them for their kind words. I thank all of you for listening, and I deeply appreciate everything that you have done for me and to help me. After all, inspiration is one of the finest qualities, and you people here have inspired me, and I hope I have been able to be of some inspiration to you. Good luck and God bless all of you.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who was a friend, a leading businessman, and one of the most public spirited South Carolinians I have ever had the honor to know, Buck Mickel, who passed away last week. 
Buck is best known and remembered for his leadership of the Fluor Corporation, one of the leading construction companies in the world. Buck began his career with Daniel Construction Company, which would later merge with Fluor, in 1948 and he very quickly began his climb up the corporate ladder. By the beginning of 1965, he was elected President and General Manager, and in 1974, he was elected as Chairman of the Board, a position he retained until he retired in 1987. 
Not surprisingly, a businessman who possessed the talents Buck did was respected and admired throughout the corporate community. As a result, he was asked to participate in many different ventures. He held more than twenty directorships and served on numerous boards. He was recognized with honors that included being named the 1983 `Businessman of the Year' by the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, and being inducted into the South Carolina Business Hall of Fame. 
In his role as a corporate executive, Buck certainly helped to make significant contributions to South Carolina by creating jobs and generating revenues for the Palmetto State, but his efforts to benefit our home state went far beyond what he was able to accomplish as a businessman. Buck was a tireless and enthusiastic advocate for education, and served as a life trustee of both my alma mater Clemson University, and of Converse College, as well as on the boards of the Georgia Institute of Technology, Furman University, Presbyterian College, and Wofford College. Furthermore, he was a member of the Advisory Boards of the South Carolina Foundation of Independent Colleges, the University of South Carolina Business School, and the National Advisory Council. His efforts to promote higher education in South Carolina not only earned him the respect and admiration of citizens, educators, and government officials, but helped to create a better education system in the Palmetto State. 
Buck's sense of service certainly must have been instilled in him at a very young age as he served in the United States Merchant Marine during World War II, and then in the Army during the Korean War. This desire to contribute continued throughout his life and manifested itself in many ways, including his commitment to education, and through his philanthropic actions, both as a private citizen and as the Chairman of the Daniel/Mickel Foundation. 
On a more personal note, Buck was a devoted friend and supporter who was always ready to help me however he could. He served as an officer on several of my re-election campaigns and played an important role in helping to get the Strom Thurmond Institute built at Clemson University. 
Mr. President, it is never easy to summarize the accomplishments of a man such as Buck Mickel who has given so much of himself and achieved so much. That he passed at such a young age only compounds the sadness all who knew him feel at his death, but we all take consolation in the fact that he leaves behind an enviable record of successes as a businessman and of helping others. My condolences go out to his widow, Minor Herndon Mickel; their children Minor Shaw, Buck, and Charles; as well as their five grandchildren. They can be proud of the work their husband, father, and grand-father did, as well as the reputation he leaves behind.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, even those who possess essentially no knowledge of military affairs or military history understand the significance of the green beret worn by those who serve in the United States Army Special Forces, as well as what that headgear indicates about the soldier wearing it. 
Established in the early days of the cold war, the Green Berets were intended to be a versatile, unconventional force that could do everything from serve as instructors and advisors to carryout both humanitarian and direct action missions. Over the past almost fifty years, those who have served in the Special Forces have established a well deserved and well respected reputation for bravery, dedication to duty, and patriotism. There is ample reason that so many people, not only in the United States but throughout the world, know just how special an individual the man who wears the Green Beret is. Today, I rise to pay tribute to one of those men. Major Preston Johnson, who has left his assignment at the Special Operations Command Office of Legislative Affairs to attend the Marine Corps Command and General Staff College. 
Major Johnson began his military career the tough way, by enlisting in the United States Army following his 1985 graduation from Rice University. His ability and leadership skills were obviously apparent from his early days in the Army as a recruit going through basic training, as he was selected to attend Officer Candidate School. A little more than one year after graduating from basic training, Preston Johnson pinned on the gold bar of a Second Lieutenant and the crossed rifles brass of the Infantry and began what has been a career dedicated to not only the Army, but to special operations. 
Over the past thirteen years Preston Johnson has accumulated a resume of impeccable credentials in Army special operations. He began his career as an Infantryman in the 3rd Ranger Battalion, in Fort Benning, Georgia, and continued it after OCS as both a Rifle Platoon Leader and Long Range Reconnaissance Platoon leader in Fort Lewis, Washington where he served with the 2nd Battalion/47th Infantry and the 1st Squadron/9th US Cavalry. The Rangers are well known for their toughness, expertise in small unit tactics, and for an impressive record in battle. Certainly, the lessons Preston Johnson learned when he wore the black beret of the Regiment served him well not only as an Infantryman in the deep woods of Fort Lewis, but when he volunteered for Special Forces training in 1990 and in the years he has served in the Green Berets as well. 
Over the past eight-years Preston Johnson has held a number of assignments in the Special Forces that have led him around the world and have included serving as: Detachment Commander of Special Forces Operational Detachment A-363 in the 3rd Special Forces Group (Airborne); Company Commander of the Special Forces Selection and Assessment Company; Aide-de-Camp to Major General William Garrison, the Commanding General of the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School; and as the Battalion Operations Officer of the 2nd Battalion, 1st Special Warfare Training Group (Airborne). Additionally, he has earned recognitions that reflect that Major Johnson is truly a member of one of the nation's most elite military forces. 
Of course, many of us know him from his last assignment with the Special Operations Command Office of Legislative Affairs, where he has worked hard, especially with members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, to assist us with our efforts to create a military force capable of meeting the security challenges of the post-Cold War era. If we are going to protect the citizens, borders, and interests of our nation, we must be prepared to counter possible threats that include nuclear, biological and chemical warfare; ethnic warfare; intranational warefare; and, regional conflicts. Furthermore, we must build strong bilateral ties with the militaries of other nations, and there is no question that we will have to rely increasingly upon those who serve in special operations units to meet these goals. The skills and unique capabilities the special operations community possess will be invaluable in ensuring that the United States enjoys peace and stability into the 21st Century. 
On almost every continent around the world, members of the United States Special Operations Command are carrying out missions that help to protect American security and vital national interests. They operate in a world that requires that they rarely acknowledge their purpose, and they almost never receive credit for a job well done. Recognition, however, is not what motivates these `quiet professionals', and we are indeed fortunate to have such selfless individuals who are willing to serve our nation and make the sacrifices they do. Major Johnson is an excellent example of the caliber of individual who volunteers for a career in special operations. He has represented the Special Operations Command well on Capitol Hill and I have every confidence that he will continue to distinguish himself in the years to come.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, a few hundred miles south of here, stands Fort Bragg, a sprawling military installation that is the home of the 82nd Airborne Division, and where thousands of paratroopers are ready to go anywhere in the world, `stand in the door', and jump into harm's way in order to protect the national security and vital interests of the United States. Today, I am pleased to remind my colleagues that August 16, 1998 has been designated `National Airborne Day' as a way to honor all those who have worn the winged parachute badge on their uniform. 
Though the concept of using airborne troops in warfare is only a little more than fifty years old, the versatility and effectiveness of these forces is above question. In particular, `America's Guard of Honor', the 82nd Airborne Division, has established an especially proud record over the past five decades. 
During World War II, the paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division participated in the campaigns of Anzio, Normandy--where I landed with the 325th Glider Infantry Regiment--, and the Battle of the Bulge. In the years that have passed since the surrender of the Axis powers, the 82nd Airborne Division has been involved in almost every major military operation undertaken by the United States. Among other places, paratroopers have deployed to the Dominican Republic; Vietnam; Grenada; Panama; and Southwest Asia in order to protect the security, interests, and citizens of the United States. In each and every instance, those who wear the `Double AA' patch on their shoulder have distinguished themselves as brave soldiers, determined warriors, and great Americans. 
Mr. President, we are indeed fortunate to have the 82nd Airborne Division as an integral part of the United States Army. That the paratroopers of the 82nd are ready to deploy anywhere in the world with just a few hours notice is testament to the bravery, professionalism, and patriotism of these soldiers. I think it is only fitting that we honor all those who have ever served in the 82nd Airborne Division, or who have ever worn the parachutist badge, by remembering them on August 16, `National Airborne Day'. This is a small, but worthy, way to recognize the contributions that the Airborne Soldiers of our Army have made to keeping the United States free and safe.

 Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today a Senate Resolution which authorizes and requests the President to designate the week beginning September 20, 1998, as `National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week.' 
It is my privilege to sponsor this legislation for the thirteenth time honoring the Historically Black Colleges of our Country. 
Eight of the 104 Historically Black Colleges, namely Allen University, Benedict College, Claflin College, South Carolina State University, Morris College, Voorhees College, Denmark Technical College, and Clinton Junior College, are located in my home State. These colleges are vital to the higher education system of South Carolina. They have provided thousands of economically disadvantaged young people with the opportunity to obtain a college education. 
Mr. President, thousands of young Americans have received quality educations at these 104 schools. These institutions have a long and distinguished history of providing the training necessary for participation in a rapidly changing society. Historically Black Colleges offer our citizens a variety of curricula and programs through which young people develop skills and talents, thereby expanding opportunities for continued social progress. 
Mr. President, through passage of this Senate Resolution, Congress can reaffirm its support for Historically Black Colleges, and appropriately recognize their important contributions to our Nation. I look forward to the speedy passage of this Resolution.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in expressing their shock, dismay, and most significantly, sorrow at the tragic events that unfolded not far from this chamber last Friday. 
The killing of a police officer is always a disturbing event as a mortal attack on a law enforcement officer is also an attack on society at large. After all, it is those men and women who are sworn law enforcement officers who stand between the law abiding citizens of the United States and those elements within our society that seek to do harm. Being any sort of law enforcement officer is a thankless job fraught with danger, two facts that it is sometimes easy to forget. 
The deaths of Capitol Police Officers Jacob Chestnut, known as J.J., and John Gibson not only remind us of just how dangerous a profession law enforcement is, but also of the admiration we have for those who protect us. What makes their deaths all the more disturbing is that they were attacked in the United States Capitol, a place that is more than an office building; it is a symbol of our Nation. What makes their deaths all the more saddening is that being of close interaction each of us has with Capitol Police Officers, we have come to think of these men and women as much more than simply protectors, we have come to view them as friends. 
Since its founding in 1828, the United States Capitol Police and its officers have worked, largely in anonymity, to protect Members of Congress, their staffs, the Capitol, and all those who visit this magnificent building. They are a force that carries out its responsibilities professionally and effectively, and they manage to bring credible security and protection to one of the most publicly accessible places in the world. Last Friday, fate forced Officers Gibson and Chestnut to shed their anonymity in the most tragic and brutal of manners, but the manner in which they put duty and aiding others above personal safety is a credit to not only each of them, but to all the members of the United States Capitol Police. The members of the South Carolina Congressional Delegation feel a special sense of grief as `J.J.' Chestnut was both a native of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and a 20-year veteran of the United States Air Force who retired as a Master Sergeant 
Many have likened Capitol Hill to a small town, as this is a place where people know each other, stop to talk, and where there is true sense of congeniality and hospitality. That spirit is certainly evident in the outpouring of grief, support, and sympathy we are seeing for these two slain officers. Sadly, no amount of expressed condolences or high praise will bring these two brave men back to their families and loved ones. I thin, however, that each of us hopes that these expressions will convey the high regard we hold for these two men, and our inexpressible gratitude that Officers Chestnut and Gibson were on duty. Their actions truly saved the day and they will no doubt forever be remembered as `heroes.'

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of cloture on S.2271, the Property Rights Implementation Act. Put simply, this bill is a modest effort to help property owners get their day in court. 
Currently, it is very difficult for many landowners to get into court. When a landowner wishes to develop property, he must seek approval from local land use authorities, who should quickly evaluate the request and make a decision. However, local bureaucracies may take years to make a decision or may require the landowner to make countless reapplications. There is nothing the landowner can do because the courts will wait on a final administrative determination before taking any action. 
Under this bill, the courts eventually must act if the bureaucracy refuses to make a final decision. The fundamental role of local authorities in property development decisions does not change. A reasonable administrative determination of a claim is still required before the owner can go to court. In other words, the locality will still have the upper hand, but it will not hold all the cards. 
After a negative administrative decision, the bill allows a landowner to choose to go to Federal court rather than state court, but only under certain limited circumstances. If a landowner brings any claims under state law, even if the state claims are secondary to the Federal claims, the case must proceed in state court. It is only if the landowner brings solely a Federal claim for a Constitutional taking that the landowner must be permitted to proceed in Federal court if he wishes. Moreover, once in Federal court, if an unsettled question of state law arises in the case, the question must be certified to the state court where possible. 
Some opponents to this legislation have said that it will result in a great shift in public power to regulate land. They say that property owners will be put at a great advantage over state and local authorities who are charged with controlling development, causing property owners to win many more claims. This argument will not prove to be correct. It cannot because the bill does not change the standard for determining a property rights claim. The legislation does not provide property owners any more rights than they have today, even though the rights they now have are limited and uncertain under case law. It is very difficult for a property owner to show that property has been taken for purposes of the Fifth Amendment, and that will not change under this bill. 
The legislation only makes it easier to get to Federal court for a takings claim. It simply gives landowners a fair opportunity to get a decision. It does not make it any easier for them to win. 
A limited option of Federal court access should exist when someone is trying to adjudicate their property rights secured by the Constitution. When other Constitutional rights are violated, such as the right to free speech, the person can go immediately to Federal court for relief. Why should the right to just compensation for a taking be any different? Indeed, for free speech issues involving obscenity, the court must look to the standards in the local community, but the claimant can still go immediately to Federal court. As Chief Justice William Rehnquist has written for the Court, `We see no reason why the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as much a part of the Bill of Rights as the First Amendment and Fourth Amendment, should be relegated to the status of a poor relation.' 
I agree with the Supreme Court. This bill would solve that major problem. Yet, it makes only modest changes in the current system. I hope my colleagues will support this small but important step for fairness in property rights.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, while the Senate was recessed last week, South Carolina lost one of its most prominent citizens, Ellison `Bubby' McKissick, Jr., who was best known as a leader in the textile industry both in the Palmetto State and throughout the United States. 
Bubby McKissick passed away, after a long illness, at the rather young age of 69. Though his passing came too soon, he distinguished himself in many ways throughout his life. Not the least of these achievements was serving as the Chairman of Alice Manufacturing, the McKissick family mill and one of the largest textile companies in the Southeast. Additionally, he was a past president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, and a forceful advocate for measures that would make the textile industry more competitive, including promoting education. 
While his career ultimately took him to the boardroom, Bubby McKissick learned the textile business from the ground floor of one of his family's facilities, working in some of the most demanding jobs in any mill operation. Additionally, Bubby McKissick served in the United States Marine Corps during the Korean War, earning the rank of Sergeant, and having the unenviable distinction of being wounded in combat. This was a man who truly did not have anything handed to him on a silver platter, and who knew well the valuable lessons that one can only learn from experience and hard work. 
Bubby McKissick's passing is all the more saddening because he was a loyal supporter, and more importantly, a valued friend. I had known Bubby almost literally from the day he was born as his family was well known to me. I was pleased to watch the successes and achievements of this man, both professional and personal, and I take consolation in the fact that he lived a full and rewarding life. 
Mr. President, Bubby McKissick's passing leaves a tremendous void not only in our state's corporate community, but in the lives of the many men and women who called him friend. Bubby McKissick will not soon be forgotten, and I am certain that all those who knew him would join me in sending condolences to his family.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address an undue burden that has arisen out of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
The purpose of the ADA to give disabled Americans the opportunity to fully participate in society and contribute to it. This was a worthy goal. But even legislation with the best of intentions often has unintended consequences. I submit that one of those is the application of the ADA to state and local prisons throughout America. 
Last month, the Supreme Court ruled in Pennsylvania Department of Corrections versus Yeskey that the ADA applies to every state prison and local jail in this country. The circuit courts were split on the issue. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, my home circuit, forcefully concluded that the ADA, as well as its predecessor and companion law, the Rehabilitation Act, did not apply to state prisoners, focusing on federalism concerns and the fact that the Congress did not make clear that it intended to involve itself to this degree in an activity traditionally reserved to the states. 
However, the Supreme Court did not agree, holding that the language of the Act is broad enough to clearly cover state prisons. It is not an issue on the Federal level because the Federal Bureau of Prisons voluntarily complies with the Act. The Supreme Court did not say whether applying the ADA to state prisons exceeded the Congress' powers under the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, but we should not wait on the outcome of this argument to act. Although it was rational for the Supreme Court to read the broad language of the ADA the way it did, it is far from clear that we in the Congress considered the application of this sweeping new social legislation in the prison environment. 
The Seventh Circuit recognized that the `failure to exclude prisoners may well have been an oversight.' The findings and purpose of the law seem to support this. The introductory language of the ADA states, `The Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure quality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency' to allow `people with disabilities * * * to compete on an equal basis and to pursue those opportunities for which our free society is justifiably famous.' Of course, a prison is not a free society, as the findings and purpose of the Act envisioned. Indeed, it is quite the opposite. In short, as the Ninth Circuit explained, `The Act was not designed to deal specifically with the prison environment; it was intended for general societal application.' 
In any event, now that the Supreme Court has spoken, it is time for the Congress to confront this issue. The Congress should act now to exempt state and local prisons from the ADA. If we do not, this law will have broad adverse implications for the management of these institutions. Prisoners will file an endless number of lawsuits demanding special privileges, which will involve Federal judges in the intricate details of running our state and local prisons. 
Mr. President, we should continuously remind ourselves that the Constitution created a Federal government of limited, enumerated powers. Those powers not delegated to the Federal government were reserved to the states or the people. As James Madison wrote in Federalist No. 45, `the powers delegated to the Federal government are few and definite. * * * [The powers] which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.' The Federal government should avoid intrusion into matters traditionally reserved for the states. We must respect this delicate balance of power. Unfortunately, federalism is more often spoken about than respected. 
Although the entire ADA raises federalism concerns, the problem is especially acute in the prison context. There are few powers more traditionally reserved for the states than crime. The crime laws have always been the province of the states, and the vast majority of prisoners have always been housed in state prisons. The First Congress enacted a law asking the states to house Federal prisoners in their jails for fifty cents per month. The first Federal prison was not built until over 100 years later, and only three existed before 1925. 
Even today, as the size and scope of Federal government has grown immensely, only about 6% of prisoners are housed in Federal 
institutions. Managing that other 94% is a core state function. As the Supreme Court has stated,  
Maintenance of penal institutions is an essential part of one of government's primary functions--the preservation of societal order through enforcement of the criminal law. It is difficult to imagine an activity in which a State has a stronger interest, or one that is more intricately bound up with state laws, regulations, and procedures. 
The primary function of prisons is to house criminals. Safety and security are the overriding concerns of prison administration. The rules and regulations, the daily schedules, the living and working arrangements--these all revolve around protecting prison employees, inmates, and the public. But the goal of the ADA is to take away any barrier to anyone with any disability. It requires the authorities to provide `reasonable accommodation' for essentially any disability unless doing so would impose an `undue burden' or `a direct threat to the health or safety of others,' as broadly defined by the courts. Accommodating inmates will interfere with the ability of prison administrators to keep safety and security their overriding concern. 
The practical effect of the ADA will be that prison officials will have to grant special privileges to certain inmates and to excuse others from complying with generally-applicable prison rules. 
The ADA presents a perfect opportunity for prisoners to try to beat the system, and use the courts to do it. There are over 1.6 million inmates in state prisons and local jails, and the numbers are rising every year. Indeed, the total prison population has grown about 6.5% per year since 1990. Prisons have a substantially greater percentage of persons with disabilities that are covered by the ADA than the general population, including AIDS, mental retardation, psychological disorders, learning disabilities, drug addiction, and alcoholism. Further, administrators control every aspect of prisoners' lives, such as assigning educational and vocational training, recreation, and jobs in prison industries. Combine these facts, and the opportunities for lawsuits are endless. 
For example, in most state prison systems, inmates are classified and assigned based in part on their disabilities. This helps administrators meet the disabled inmates' needs in a cost-effective manner. However, under the ADA, prisoners probably will be able to claim that they must be assigned to a prison without regard to their disability. Were it not for their disability, they may have been assigned to the prison closest to their home, and in that case, every prison would have to be able to accommodate every disability. That could mean every prison having, for example, mental health treatment centers, services for hearing-impaired inmates, and dialysis treatment. The cost is potentially enormous. 
Adequate funding is hard for prisons to achieve, especially in state and local communities where all government funds are scarce. The public is angry about how much money they have to spend to house prisoners. Even with prison populations rising, they do not want more of their money spent on prisoners. Often, there is simply not enough money to make the changes in challenged programs to accommodate the disabled. If prison administrators do not have the money to change a program, they will probably have to eliminate it. Thus, accommodation could mean the elimination of worthwhile educational, recreational, and rehabilitative programs, making all inmates worse off. 
Apart from money, accommodation may mean modifying the program in such a way as to take away its beneficial purpose. A good example is the Supreme Court's Yeskey case itself. Yeskey was declared medically ineligible to participate in a boot camp program because he had high blood pressure. So, he sued under the ADA. The boot camp required rigorous physical activity, such as work projects. If the program has to be changed to accommodate his physical abilities, it may not meet its basic goals, and the authorities may eliminate it. Thus, the result could be that everyone loses the benefit of an otherwise effective correctional tool. 
Another impact of the ADA may be to make an already volatile prison environment even more difficult to control. Many inmates are very sensitive to the privileges and benefits that others get in a world where privileges are relatively few. Some have irrational suspicions and phobias. An inmate who is not disabled may be angry if he believes a disabled prisoner is getting 
special treatment, without rationally accepting that the law requires it, and could take out his anger on others around him, including the disabled prisoner. 
We must keep in mind that it is judges who will be making these policy decisions. To determine what vague phrases like `reasonable accommodation' and `undue burden' mean, judges must get involved in intricate, fact-intensive issues, Essentially, the ADA requires judges to micromanage prisons. Judges are not qualified to second-guess prison administrators and make these complex, difficult decisions. Prisons cannot be run by judicial decree. 
The Supreme Court in recent years has recognized this. In apply Constitutional rights to prisoners, the Court has tried to get away from micromanagement and has viewed prisoner claims deferentially in favor of the expertise of prison officials. It has stated that we will not `substitute our judgment on difficult and sensitive matters of institutional administration for the determinations of those charged with the formidable task of running a prison. This approach ensures the ability of corrections officials to anticipate security problems and to adopt innovative solutions to the intractable problems of prison administration, and avoid unnecessary intrusion of the judiciary into problems particularly ill suited to resolution by decree.' 
Take for example a case from the Fourth Circuit, my home circuit, from 1995. The Court explained that a morbidly obese inmate presented corrections officials `with a lengthy and ever-increasing list of modifications which he insisted were necessary to accommodate his obese condition. Thus, he demanded a larger cell, a cell closer to support facilities, handrails to assist him in using the toilet, wider entrances to his cell and the showers, non-skid matting in the lobby area, and alternative outdoor recreational activities to accommodate his inability to stand or walk for long periods.' It is not workable for judges to resolve all of these questions. 
It is noteworthy that a primary purpose of the Prison Litigation Reform Act was to stop judges from micromanaging prisons and to reduce the burdens of prison litigation. As the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court recently recognized, the PLRA is having some success. However, this most recent Supreme Court decision will hamper that progress. 
Moreover, the ADA delegated to Federal agencies the authority to create regulations to implement the law. State and local correction authorities must fall in line behind these regulations. In yet another way, we will have the Justice Department exercising regulatory oversight over our state and local communities. 
Prisons are fundamentally different from other places in society. Prisoners are not entitled to all of the rights and privileges of law-abiding citizens, but they often get them. They have cable television. They have access to better gyms and libraries than most Americans. The public is tired of special privileges for prisoners. Applying the ADA to prisons is a giant step in the wrong direction. Prisoners will abuse the ADA to get privileges they were previously denied, and the reason will be the overreaching hand of the Federal government. We should not let this happen. 
Mr. President, the National Government has gone full circle. We have gone from asking the states to house Federal prisoners to dictating to the states how they must house their own prisoners. There must be some end to the powers of the Federal government, and to the privileges it grants the inmates of this Nation. I propose that we start by passing this important legislation.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I share the Senator's concerns regarding the need to provide adequate resources to such worthy projects. Therefore, the bill we have before us fully authorizes the President's budget request for the Department of Defense Child Development Program. The committee has also recommended an additional $23.0 million in this bill to construct five new child care centers. 
Unfortunately, the Defense budget has declined so dramatically over the past several years that we cannot afford to reduce other programs below their current levels without significantly jeopardizing near and long-term military readiness. Furthermore, I believe that this amendment has some technical problems.

Mr. THURMOND. I oppose this amendment offered by Senator Harkin, and I will make my statement short. We have had the debate on defense spending, and I do not need to repeat those arguments. The level of defense spending was set with the Administration in the budget agreement. This agreement was widely supported by this body and should not be disregarded. Some of my colleagues have argued that the money for defense is unnecessary and they have always found other uses for this money. Thankfully, Mr. President, this body has not agreed with these arguments and has provided the resources necessary to meet our national security needs. 
Mr. President, the budget agreement does not fully fund defense. The budget agreement represents what funds are available. The fact is, Mr. President, our Armed Forces have been reduced. Since the end of the cold war, the active military end strength has been reduced from 2.2 million men and women to a little over 1.4 million. Annual defense spending continues to decline from the build up of $400 billion to about the $260 billion, in equivalent, inflation adjusted dollars. 
Mr. President, I am not opposed to increasing the funding for veterans' health care, but not at the cost of our national security. We have been warned of funding problems in defense. We must not further reduce defense spending, but instead, reverse the downward trend we have experienced over the last decade in defense spending. I sincerely hope we will heed the hard lessons we have already learned, and not have to learn the same painful lesson over and over? 
Mr. President, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment and not further aggravate a serious underfunding of our defense. 
I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend Senator Coats for the excellent remarks he made on this subject. I also wish to commend Senator Kempthorne for his outstanding remarks. 
Mr. President, I will have to oppose this amendment. There have been some good points mentioned by those who favor the amendment, but I do not think it is wise. It is one that we have debated several times on the floor of the Senate. 
The current law prohibits abortions from being performed in military facilities except in the case where the life of the mother would be in danger or in the case of rape or incest. The Congress enacted the current legislation in 1995 and reaffirmed it again in 1996 and in 1997. 
In 1996, this same amendment passed the Senate by a voice vote after the motion to table failed. However, in order to achieve agreement with the House of Representatives in the conference, the conferees were required to return to the current provisions of law. Last year, this same amendment failed to achieve Senate approval. 
Mr. President, I would suggest that extended debate on abortion within the Senate is unlikely to change any Senator's vote. I hope we can agree to limit the discussion and vote. 
The question comes down to this. This is the question, and I would like for Senators to listen to this: If you want to have abortion on demand performed in military treatment facilities overseas at the expense of the Government, then this amendment is for you. If you want to preserve the life of the baby except in the case of rape, incest, and when the life of the mother is at risk, then you should vote against this amendment. 
It is just that simple, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Feingold amendment to terminate the Navy's Extremely Low Frequency communications system. 
The so-called Project ELF is a vital communications system that allows the United States to send messages to submarines that are traveling in very deep water. These messages tell submarines to come closer to the surface to receive more detailed communications. ELF is the only way to get a message to attack and ballistic missile submarines when they are at their normal operating depths. 
Contrary to the argument made by the Senator from Wisconsin, Project ELF is not a cold war relic. The system remains as vital as ever. The need for the United States to have a survivable submarine force remains essential. ELF is not only needed to send messages to U.S. ballistic missile submarines but also to attack submarines. 
In the post-Cold Ware era, the United States will place even greater emphasis on the submarine force for strategic deterrence. A survivable Trident submarine force is essential. This was reaffirmed in the Administration's Nuclear Posture Review, which recommended the retention of 14 Trident submarines for the foreseeable future. In a letter to the Armed Services Committee the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, wrote the following: `Both ELF communications sites, operating simultaneously, are needed to meet our worldwide requirements. Dismantling this critical system would unacceptably impact the survivability and flexibility of our submarine force.' Just this week the nominee to be the next Commander-in-Chief of Strategic Command, Admiral Richard Mies, reaffirmed STRATCOM's strong support for the ELF system. 
The need for a survivable U.S. submarine force did not end with the Cold War. Russia retains an aggressive anti-submarine warfare program designed to develop advanced capabilities to track and destroy all types of U.S. submarines. The United States continues to invest billions of dollars to maintain and modernize our submarine force. Other countries, such as Iran, are also acquiring an attack submarine force. 
Congress continues to strongly support development of a New Attack Submarine. This important submarine modernization program is justified, in part, by Russia's aggressive ASW program. If the Senate is willing to sustain such programs, we should sustain Project ELF. If we terminate this communications program we will save approximately $10 million per year, but put at risk a multi-billion dollar investment in our submarine force. 
The assertion has also been made that the ELF system may pose a public health threat. There is no evidence to substantiate this assertion. This question has been extensively studied. Each assessment has concluded that there is no risk to public safety. 
The Department of Defense opposes the Feingold legislation to terminate project ELF. In a letter dated May 7, 1997, the DOD General Counsel wrote that: `The Department of Defense, Joint Staff, the Department of the Navy, and U.S. Strategic Command all agree on the necessity of maintaining the ELF system.' The letter also stated that: `ELF is the only communications system available that ensures the maintenance of these critical communication links. Costly new research and development would have to be done to provide another communications path to our submarines to ensure our ability to communicate at speed and depth.' 
Mr. President, in summary, this amendment would jeopardize the security of the entire U.S. submarine force. There is no benefit to canceling this program and the risk of doing so is extremely high. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this amendment would authorize a 3.6 percent pay raise for military personnel. 
Mr. President, increasing military pay is something the Committee wanted to do when we marked-up our bill. However, when we completed our mark-up six weeks ago, it was just not possible. Many Senators will recall that we were facing an almost insurmountable outlay problem in the defense budget. The Budget Committee, the Armed Services Committee and the Appropriations Committee were engaged in intense discussions to find a solution that would not adversely impact our national security. 
Now that we have been able to review and analyze the defense authorization and appropriations mark-ups of both bodies, we have identified programs which are hollow. We will use this hollow budget authority and outlays to pay for increasing military pay from the 3.1 percent requested by the President to the 3.6 percent level indicated by the Employment Cost Index. We will, of course, make the necessary adjustments to eliminate the hollow programs during our conference with the House. 
Mr. President, I have discussed this amendment with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Both Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye have joined the Members of the Armed Services Committee as co-sponsors of the amendment. 
Several weeks ago, the Joint Chiefs were briefed on recruiting and retention problems in the services and directed their staffs to review actions they could take to increase military pay. I am pleased that we are able to find a way to give our military personnel the pay raise they deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. THURMOND. I understand the position of the Senator from Alabama. As he knows well, I support the accelerator alternative. He also understands well that the dynamics of the House Senate conference preclude me from making any pre-conference agreements on conference outcomes. However, I assure the Senator from Alabama that despite my own interests, and my position as Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, that I will not work personally to disadvantage the Bellefonte alternative in the conference. With this understanding, I am prepared to accept the Senator's amendment.

I thank from the bottom of my heart Senator Lott, the distinguished majority leader, and the distinguished minority leader for what he had to say. And I thank all of you for your cooperation. We could not have gotten through this bill or all the other bills in the past without your cooperation. Every one of you are true patriots. We are proud of you.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as a wind-up, I would like to speak for about 3 minutes. 
Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for their support of this bill. It was their suggestions and comments that make this a strong bill--a bill that I am extremely proud will bear my name. I appreciate the support of the able majority leader, Senator Lott. As a former member of the Armed Services Committee, I know he recognizes the importance of this bill to the Nation and our military. I thank the able minority leader for his fine cooperation and leadership. 
Mr. President, I want to thank the members of the Armed Services Committee for their loyalty and support over the past years. I want to especially recognize Senator Warner for his leadership during the past hours. It will serve him well in the future. 
Finally, I want to recognize Senator Carl Levin, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. During the past 2 years, he has been my friend and counsel. I have the highest respect for his abilities and concern for the security of our Nation, I shall always call him my friend. 
In closing, I want to recognize the hard work of the staff--both on the committee and in the personal offices. Under the leadership of the staff directors Les Brownlee and David Lyles; they have accomplished wonders. 
I would be remiss if I did not recognize the work of the floor staff. They have spent countless and dedicated hours supporting the Senators and our staffs. Without their efforts, it would have been impossible to pass this bill. 
Mr. President, this is a good bill for our Nation and most important to the men and women who wear the uniforms of our military services. It is and always will be my greatest honor to be associated with these patriots. 
I thank the President and yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the committee has worked very hard to achieve consensus on an amendment that would represent the majority views of the committee. Since May 13, at the request of several Members, the committee has met at least five times to discuss possible amendments on Bosnia that would be offered to the defense bill. The committee also conducted a hearing with Ambassador Robert Gelbard and General Wesley Clark to discuss the status of progress in implementing the Dayton Agreement. 
Despite all meetings and discussions, the committee was not able to reach consensus on an amendment on Bosnia. However, following the committee's meeting on June 19, Senator Coats and Senator Levin, met, and, using a compromise amendment that I had proposed as a starting point, continued the effort to craft an amendment, which I support and which I believe the Senate can support. 
While I am aware that there are Senators who would prefer to do more, I believe that this amendment represents the view of most Senators. 
I am pleased to join Senators Coats and Levin, and I urge the Senate to adopt it. Let me emphasize, this amendment does not represent a committee amendment, it merely represents the tireless efforts of several Members. 
This amendment would express the concerns of the Congress that U.S. ground combat forces should not be deployed indefinitely in Bosnia, and that efforts should be taken by the President to work with our Allies in Europe so that U.S. ground combat forces could withdraw in a safe and orderly fashion from Bosnia within a reasonable period of time. Additionally, the amendment would express our views that the European allies should take appropriate steps to develop forces to take on the responsibilities of the Stabilization Force in Bosnia, if necessary, to continue to implement the Dayton Agreement. 
Mr. President, by December 1998, U.S. ground forces will have been deployed in Bosnia for three years, and the United States will have spent almost $9 billion dollars for its share of the operations. That is two years more than the President, Secretary Perry, Secretary Christopher and General Shalikashvili told us in 1995 that our forces would be in Bosnia, and $8.0 billion more than their original cost estimate. 
I believe it is imperative that the United States make strong efforts to work with our NATO and European allies to provide a situation where U.S. ground combat forces can leave Bosnia. The United States has world-wide commitments, and the continued deployment of U.S. forces in Bosnia is starting to take a toll on the readiness of our military forces. The deployment in Bosnia along with our other commitments produces an operational tempo which impacts heavily on the morale of our forces and our ability to retain personnel. 
I believe this amendment sends the message that we have been in Bosnia too long, and that we should begin working our way out. I also believe the amendment sends a message that our European allies should assume a more equitable leadership role on their borders, while at the same time ensuring some continued level of continued U.S. support. 
I believe this is a good amendment, and urge its adoption.

The proponents of this provision have worked long and hard to resolve all of the stakeholders' interest related to this military land withdrawal and have put together a good provision. 
I strongly support Senator Kempthorne's substitute amendment to title XXIX of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999 and the continued efforts to secure enhanced military training in Idaho. 
Madam President, we have both Senators from Idaho in accord on this matter. The Governor of Idaho is in accord on this matter.

Mr. THURMOND. I want to thank the able Senator from Maine for the excellent remarks she made on this subject. 
Mr. President, I am sympathetic to the Brownback amendment, however, last year, the Congress established a commission to review the conduct of military training and gender-related issues, we should await the outcome of its findings. That commission is constituted and working. One of the areas which the commission must specifically address in its final report is a recommendation as to how to provide for a safe and secure living environment for young men and women in basic training. This amendment would preempt the work of the commission by establishing a statutory requirement that basic trainees be housed in separate barracks. 
I join Senator Brownback and others in insisting that the military services provide a safe and secure environment for all military personnel, but especially those in basic training who may be the most vulnerable. 
On June 8, 1998, Secretary Cohen asked us not to legislate a specific solution as Senator Brownback's amendment does. Secretary Cohen urged that we give the Service Chiefs the flexibility to house and train their personnel in the manner determined to be most effective for that service. We all recognize that each of the four services is unique. Each service has its own culture, history and traditions. I agree with Secretary Cohen that we should not legislate how they must house and train their personnel. 
Mr. President, I could support an amendment that would require the Service Secretaries to provide for a safe and secure environment without specifically requiring a standard solution for three of the four services. Senator Brownback's amendment goes beyond requiring a safe and secure environment and will require millions of dollars in military construction and renovation projects to make their barracks conform to the requirements in the amendment. 
I prefer to allow the Congressional Commission to do its work and make its recommendations next March before we act. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee expressed its views regarding base closure when it voted 10 to 8 against an amendment that would have authorized additional base closure rounds. I fully support that decision although I have an open mind on future legislation, especially if the Administration makes a better case for additional rounds and the rounds are scheduled after the current base closure activities are completed. 
In regard to the amendment before us, I believe it will have little if any impact on whether or not we will close additional bases. The amendment is in reaction to the Department's threat to close bases by attriting personnel below the 300 threshold set by section 2687 of title 10. While I do not believe that this is an idle threat, reducing the threshold to 225 personnel will have little or no impact. 
To close or realign bases under section 2687, the Department of Defense must notify Congress as part of its request for authorization of appropriations and must provide the Congress an evaluation of fiscal, local economic, budgetary, environmental, strategic, and operational consequences of proposed closures and realignments. One of the most important drawbacks to the section 2687 process is the requirement to complete a full environmental study under the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act before a closure or realignment decision is made and sent to Congress. While such studies are under way, usually for a period of 12 to 18 months, litigation is likely to arise, effectively derailing the proposed closure and realignment. Additionally, individual actions can be thwarted by withholding the appropriation of funds to execute a closure or realignment. Section 2687 has effectively prevented DoD from reducing its infrastructure through closures or realignments at any of its significant facilities. 
Mr. President, this legislation is unnecessary and I urge the Senate to reject the amendment.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment offered by Senators Harkin and Wellstone to reduce defense spending, and any amendment which lowers defense spending below the levels set in the budget agreement. When the Congress approved the budget agreement, the spending limits for each function were set. The Armed Services Committee's challenge was to develop a defense program, within the limits of the budget agreement, that not only supports the national security strategy, but balances the needs of short-term readiness with that of the modernization of our forces--all within the context of a foreign policy that drives an unprecedented frequency of military deployments. 
The gap between our military capability and our commitments around the world continues to increase. The unprecedented frequency of deployments places hardships on our young service members and their families, producing serious retention and readiness problems. Contingency and ongoing operations, such as those in Bosnia and Iraq, continue to drain needed resources for future force modernization and the current readiness of our forces. Since 1996, the Department of Defense has been forced to offset almost $9.0 billion for such operations. The costs of these ongoing operations, in this fiscal year alone, are expected to exceed more than $4.1 billion. Therefore, I strongly believe--and I have stated this previously--that funding for Bosnia and Southwest Asia operations, and other emerging contingencies, must come from sources other than the defense budget. The funding of such activities should not be allowed to adversely affect modernization efforts or current force readiness. 
In the past three years, the Congress has added more than $21 billion to defense budget requests. Even with these increases, defense spending has continued to decline in real terms. This fiscal year the defense request again represents, in real terms, a 1.1 percent decline. Defense spending as a percentage of GDP in fiscal year 1998 is expected to be 3.2 percent falling to 2.8 percent by fiscal year 2003--the lowest figures since 1940. The resource levels, as stated in the Budget Resolution, continue this decline in defense spending. While I continue to support the balanced budget agreement, I am concerned about our ability to modernize our forces and the effects of unbudgeted contingencies and ongoing operations on current readiness. 
Testimony and recent visits to our units by both members and staff of the Armed Services Committee have revealed disturbing trends: personnel shortages, lack of spare parts, extremely high unit operating and personnel tempos, and retention problems--especially with our pilots. General Crouch, Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, testified to the Committee; In recent years, we have maintained readiness at the expense of our modernization accounts. That is no longer a viable strategy. 
Mr. President, we have an obligation to adequately fund for our national security and ensure we provide our servicemen and women with the best equipment available. I grow increasingly concerned when the Armed Services Committee receives testimony from one of our Service Chiefs stating that his funding is inadequate. General Krulak, Commandant of the Marine Corps, has told the Committee: I state for the third year running that our budget request is not adequate to meet our needs. 
He further stated in a letter to the Committee: . . . we are quite literally mortgaging today's health at the expense of tomorrow's wellness--and have been for at least the last eight years--in spite of the critically important congressionally mandated adds to our accounts in the last two years. 
Mr. President, there is a price for freedom. There is the price for world leadership. As Secretary Cohen stated: Having highly ready forces that can go anywhere at any time really spells the difference between victory and defeat and it also spells the difference between being a superpower and not being one. 
Mr. President, as a result of the budget agreement reached last year, non defense discretionary spending received significant increases while defense continued its downward spending trends--not even keeping pace with inflation. During the fiscal year 1998 appropriations process, the national security appropriations bill had the lowest percentage increase from fiscal year 1997 funding level than any other of the appropriations bills. In fact, military construction appropriations had a negative change over the fiscal year 1997 funding levels, making funding for national defense grow at one-fifth the rate of domestic spending increases. 
Mr. President, I am not opposed to increasing the funding for Veterans' health care, but not at the cost of our national security, and I strongly urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment and not further aggravate a serious underfunding of our defense. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment that would require the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on the Department of Defense's use of the authority provided by section 2667 of title 10, United States Code. 
Mr. President, Secretary Cohen has recommended additional base closures citing 23 percent excess base capacity and the need to achieve savings that could be used for modernization. However, both the House and Senate, for various reasons, have not supported the request, although both acknowledge that there is excess capacity. My amendment suggests that the Department of Defense use its existing authority under section 2667 of title 10, United States Code, to put the excess capacity to beneficial use. Section 2667 permits the lease on non-excess real or personal property to the private sector for financial or in-kind compensation. 
Since the Department does have the authority to close or eliminate its excess capacity, the leases authorized by section 2667 would use this capacity while providing some revenue and savings to the Department and the military installations. Additionally, since the property would be under a long-term lease, the services would have it available for future expansion or surge capacity. 
Under section 2667, a service secretary may lease property to a lessee under such terms as he considers will promote the national defense or be in the public interest. Additionally, the funds collected from these leases are deposited in a special account in the Treasury. Sums deposited in this account will be available to the military department, as provided in appropriation Act, as follows:--50 percent of such amounts will be available for facility maintenance and repair or environmental restoration at the military installation where the leased property is located. 50 percent of such amounts will be available for facility maintenance and repair and environmental restoration by the military departments concerned. 
Mr. President, my amendment would ask the Secretary to report on the following issues regarding the use of section 2667: 
The number and purpose of leases entered under 2667; the types and amounts of payment received; the cost, if any, foregone as a result of the leases; the positive and negative aspects of leasing; the efforts to promote these type leases to the private sector; any legislative proposal to enhance the Department's capability to lease to the private sector; an estimate of income that could potentially be accrued because of enhanced leasing capability; and a discussion on retaining any income from these leases at the installation. 
Mr. President, I believe the authority provided the service secretaries by section 2667 does not eliminate the need for base closure. It does provide the opportunity to use this property for the benefit of the military installations. I will carefully review the Secretary's report and, if required, include legislation in next year's defense authorization bill to maximize the use of this authority. 
Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this past March, General Tilelli, Commander, of U.S. Forces in Korea, testified before the Committee on issues faced by his Command. One of the foremost concerns he expressed was the impact of the antipersonnel landmine moratorium that would be imposed on February 12, 1999. General Tilelli prevailed upon the Committee to provide legislative relief from this requirement. 
On May 1, Secretary of Defense Cohen and General Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, wrote asking the Committee to include a provision in the defense authorization bill that would allow the Secretary to waive the moratorium for national security interests. 
Today, I offer an amendment that would provide the President authority to waive the moratorium on antipersonnel landmines that would go into effect on February 12, 1999. 
The potential negative effect of this legislation on the ability of U.S. forces to fight and win battles and to defend U.S. forces and allies, if necessary, is unacceptable, and would not be in the national security interest of the United States. 
I am concerned about the impact of this moratorium on the ability to undertake missions, such as the kind of mission that may have been necessary, had Iraq chosen to invade one of our allies in the Gulf, during the most recent standoff with Iraq over the arms control inspections. 
I believe it is in the national security interests for U.S. forces to be able to employ self-destructing anti-personnel landmines and self-destructing mixed anti-tank systems to defend themselves and our allies, if necessary. It is for this reason, that I believe the President should have authority to waive the moratorium for national security reasons. 
I urge the adoption of my amendment.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a special date in the lives of two of my friends, Clement and Jessie Stone, who celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary this past weekend. 
Mr. Stone is well known to people throughout the world as a successful executive, a generous philanthropist, and for his writings on topics related to business, management, and positive thinking. Millions of people have read his inspirational books, and his insightful advice on the above topics has changed countless lives for the better. Few people are as well known, well read, or well regarded, as Clement Stone and he can truly be proud of all that he has accomplished in his rich and long life. 
Despite his considerable wealth, his many awards and recognitions, and his international fame, I am certain that the one thing Clement Stone values and treasures more than anything else in life is his marriage to his high school sweetheart, a union that has lasted three-quarters of one century. It is almost unheard of for two people to be married for 75-years, but Jessie and Clement have not only done so, but I am told that their affection and regard for one another has not waned one bit since they exchanged vows on June 16, 1923. Without question, they are an inspiration to one and all. 
As Clement and Jessie mark this auspicious milestone in their lives and their marriage, they will be doing so with friends and family, including a large number of grandchildren and great grandchildren. I join all of them in wishing the Stones a happy anniversary and many more years of health and happiness.

<DOCNO>105-thurmond-sc-37-19980619</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment that would extend by five years the Department of Defense Laboratory Revitalization Demonstration Program. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Levin, Santorum, and Lieberman, in sponsoring this amendment. Senator Santorum, as the Chairman of the Acquisition and Technology Subcommittee, has been one of the strongest advocates for strengthening our Nation's defense research and development capabilities and I want to thank him for that leadership. 
The Senate Armed Services Committee approved the original two-year Laboratory Revitalization Demonstration Program in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996. The purpose of the legislation was to afford the Secretary of Defense the flexibility to improve laboratory operations. The specific authority included: 
A raise in the minor construction threshold from $1.5 million to $3.0 million for projects that the Secretary concerned may carry out without specific authorization. 
A raise in the threshold for unspecified construction projects for which operations and maintenance funds may be used from $300,000 to $1.0 million. 
A raise in the threshold for minor military construction projects requiring prior approval by the Secretary concerned from $500,000 to $1.5 million. 
These authorities extended for a two-year period and will expire September 30, 1998, unless specifically renewed by Congress. The legislation also directed the Secretary to submit a report to the Congress regarding the program and specifically provide recommendations as to whether this authority should be extended to all DoD laboratories. 
On May 14, 1998, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, John Hamre, submitted the required report with the recommendation that the authority should be extended to all DoD owned laboratories and test centers for a five-year full demonstration program. 
Mr. President, the experience gained from the two-year demonstration has shown that this program works and that it should be expanded to all laboratories and test centers for a limited time period for further evaluation. Our amendment would support Dr. Hamre's recommendation. At the conclusion of the test the Secretary of Defense would be required to submit a report on the program along with a recommendation regarding the desirability of making the authority permanent. 
Mr. President, our amendment would not require any additional funds and would not impose any additional fiscal burden on the Department of Defense. It does hold out the possibility of improving the facilities that conduct the important research and tests on the Nation's military capabilities. 
I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other side. I urge the Senate adopt the amendment.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I offer an Armed Services Committee amendment that would express the sense of Congress that future year funding for operations in Bosnia be included above the topline in the defense budget and that U.S. forces in Bosnia should not act as civil police. In addition, our amendment would require the President to submit a report to Congress on the status of the establishment of the Multinational Support Unit.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, my amendment would address three items, funds in the future years defense program for operations in Bosnia, concern about the use of U.S. forces in a law enforcement capacity, and the status of establishing the NATO multinational security force. 
Funding for military forces participating in the NATO operation in Bosnia is the responsibility of the contributing nation. It is estimated that the U.S. costs of participating in the NATO operation will be close to $10 billion by the end of fiscal year 1999. 
The Administration has failed to provide adequate funds in the defense budget to fund U.S. participation in the NATO operation since November 1995, consequently reprogramming and rescissions of defense funds, as well as supplemental appropriations have been used to pay for those costs. 
In March, pursuant to legislation in the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization and appropriations bills, the President notified the Congress of his intention to extend the deployment of U.S. forces in Bosnia beyond June 30, 1998, and certified that it was in the national security interests for U.S. forces to remain in Bosnia so that conditions could be established to allow the implementation of the Dayton Accords without the support of a major NATO-led military force. 
The President's announcement to extend the deployment of U.S. forces in Bosnia after June 30, 1998 once again resulted in a funding shortfall for operations in Bosnia for fiscal year 1998, as well as for fiscal year 1999. To take care of the shortfalls in fiscal year 1998, the Congress provided an emergency appropriation. 
Once again, because they were unaware that the President would extend the participation of U.S. forces in the NATO operation in Bosnia, the Department of Defense and the military services did not include funds in the President's fiscal year 1999 budget request for defense. Thereby creating once again, a funding shortfall for operations in Bosnia in fiscal year 1999. To cover those costs anticipated in fiscal year 1999, but not provided for in the defense budget, the Committee has recommended an emergency authorization of $1.9 billion for operations in Bosnia in fiscal year 1999. 
Mr. President, U.S. forces will be in Bosnia for at least another year or two, if not longer, unless the Congress mandates their withdrawal. It is time for the President to include the funds necessary to pay for the operations in Bosnia in the fiscal year 2000 and future year budgets for defense above the top line in the balanced budget agreement. If the defense budget is not increased to pay for the costs associated with this operation in Bosnia, the Congress will once again be faced with reprogramming defense funds, or providing emergency appropriations. 
If the Congress has to reprogram defense funds, or rescind defense programs, the military services will most likely have to transfer procurement and research and development dollars meant for modernization and replacement of equipment before it becomes obsolete and unsupportable. 
Transferring funds from the military service budgets for operations in Bosnia will result in reducing training opportunities, delaying real property maintenance, deferring depot maintenance, or reducing base operations and quality of life. We need to protect the readiness of our forces. Failure of the Administration to increase funding in future defense budgets to pay for operations in Bosnia would cause disruptions and in funding inefficiencies in our acquisition programs. 
My amendment would express the sense of Congress that the President should include funds for operations in Bosnia in the future years defense funds, and that those funds should not come from amounts that would otherwise be proposed for defense or the military services in accordance with the future years defense plan, but should be provided above the top line in the balanced budget agreement. 
My amendment would also express the concerns of Congress, as it did similarly in the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization and appropriation bills, that U.S. forces should not participate in law enforcement activities as civil police. 
The International Police Task Force was formed by the United Nations in response to a requirement in the Dayton Accords. In addition to training and advising local law enforcement authorities and personnel, the responsibility of this international police task force is to monitor, observe and facilitate law enforcement activities. The international police force also has no authority to arrest or detain people, to include indicted war criminals. Because the international police force is not armed, on many occasions NATO military forces have accompanied members of the IPTF to provide protection in the event there is a breakdown in law and order. NATO forces have not intervened during incidents of violence involving unarmed civilians. However, NATO troops have taken action against paramilitary or `special police' units, such as the kind that guard indicted war criminals like Mr. Karadicz. 
Earlier this year, the Congress was informed by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that NATO would be establishing an 800-man paramilitary police force to respond to civil disturbances, such as the ones I just mentioned. 
Lastly, with regard with NATO's establishment of a Multinational Specialized Unit to respond to civil disturbances, my amendment would require the President to report on the status of NATO establishing the MSU, the mission of the MSU, its composition, and the extent to which U.S. military forces will participate in the MSU, if any role. 
Mr. President, I believe the amendment has been cleared by the other side.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today the Senate is back to consider S. 2057, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. I am hopeful that we will be able to finish the floor action on this bill quickly, and I am looking forward to the floor debate. 
Mr. President, this bill is an important piece of legislation that enhances our national security. The Armed Services Committee has reported a sound bill which provides a 3.1 percent pay raise for the uniformed services, restores appropriate funding levels for the construction and maintenance of both bachelor and family housing, and increases investment in future modernization to ensure that the Department of Defense can leverage advances in technology and maintain our future force readiness. 
This bill recommends a number of policy initiatives and spending increases which improve the readiness of the reserve forces and permit greater use of the expertise and capabilities of the reserve components. 
Under the budget agreement, we have not added funds to the defense budget this year. However, as I stated when the Budget Resolution was on the floor, I believe that we are not providing adequate funds for defense and that we must reverse this negative spending trend. 
Mr. President, as a result of the budget agreement reached last year, non defense discretionary spending received significant increases while defense continued its downward spending trends--not even keeping pace with inflation. During the fiscal year 1998 appropriations process, the national security appropriations bill had the lowest percentage increase from fiscal year 1997 funding level than any of the other appropriations bills. In fact, military construction appropriations had a negative 6.2 percent change over the fiscal year 1997 funding levels, making funding for national defense grow at one-fifth the rate of domestic spending increases. 
Since the end of the Cold War, the active military end strength has been reduced from 2.2 million men and women to a little over 1.4 million. Annual defense spending continues to decline from a level of $400 billion in fiscal year 1986 to about $260 billion, in equivalent, inflation-adjusted dollars. 
Mr. President, I have been pleased to hear that many of my 
colleagues including, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the Chairman of the Budget Committee believe, as I do, and have been recently quoted in the press that defense spending must be increased, and the negative spending trend for defense must be reversed. The gap between our military capability and our commitments around the world continues to widen. We can no longer carry out the ambitious foreign policy of this Administration with the level of resources allocated for defense and still maintain our current readiness posture. We will not require less of our servicemen and women in the future. We must meet our obligation to provide adequate resources for our national security. 
In this bill, the Committee has achieved a better balance among near-term readiness, long-term readiness, quality of life and adequate, safe and reliable nuclear weapons capabilities. 
Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and his staff for their close cooperation with our Committee this year. I cannot recall a time when we have worked together as closely as we have this year. I believe that cooperation is reflected in both of our bills, and I commend the Chairman and the Members of the Appropriations Committee and their fine staff for their work this year. 
I urge my colleagues to come to the floor and offer their amendments, but I would also like to remind my colleagues that any amendments to the defense authorization bill that would increase spending should be accompanied by offsetting reductions. 
My hope is that colleagues will support this bill and join the Members of the Armed Services Committee in passing this bill with a strong bipartisan vote. 
I wish to thank the Chair, and yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to commend the able Senator from West Virginia for the remarks he just made. He has told us about that great State that has so many places named for other places in this country, so many places. He has told us about his history and the hardships he underwent and he has overcome. We are very proud of him. I consider him a man of integrity, ability and dedication. All that he has done in this body is a credit to him. 
I have never heard unfavorable remarks about Senator Byrd. Everything I have heard and learned about him has been good. And after hearing his talk this morning, I am convinced that all the experience he has in his life has influenced him throughout his entire career, which is quite remarkable. He has brought out so many instances of how other States are connected with his State; his State is intertwined with so many different places. 
Incidentally, in West Virginia there is a town or community named Thurmond. I don't know whether the Senator is familiar with it or not. He did not mention that, but I mention it to show that South Carolina has a connection with West Virginia, and we are very proud of the connection that we have with the Senator and his State. Again, I wish the Senator long life and much happiness and continued success in all of his undertakings.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who nearly lost his life in the pursuit of Justice, Mr. Ronald Waters, of Columbia, South Carolina. 
Waters was driving along Interstate 95 in North Carolina around noon on September 23, 1997 when he noticed a North Carolina Highway Patrol car on the side of the road and a Cumberland County Sheriff's car in the median. Upon approaching the scene, he observed one of the officers laying face down next to his patrol car. He then noticed two unidentified men moving between the patrol car and a green Toyota, also parked on the side of the road. Waters called 911 emergency on his cellular phone and informed the operator of the situation. He then pulled off the road to investigate, and upon getting out of his car he heard several gun shots. 
The two unidentified men then drove off in the Toyota and Waters followed the suspects, all the while relaying their position to the 911 dispatcher. The two men then exited the interstate and traveled down a dirt road. Waters, out of concern for the victim's families, pulled to the side and waited for their return. 
About five minutes later the Toyota returned and Waters drove in the opposite direction, hoping the suspects would assume he was just another motorist. Once they were out of sight he moved towards the entrance ramp of the interstate, mistakenly under the impression that the two men were in front of him. Not seeing them on the ramp, Waters looked in his mirror and noticed that they were parked on the overpass behind him. Waters then pulled off the ramp and stopped, once again informing the dispatcher of their location. 
About that time the Toyota began closing in on him at a high rate of speed. As Waters pulled out the two men began to fire at him with an AK-47 assault rifle. The suspects fired several rounds which struck a critical portion of his vehicle, leaving it disabled. Now stranded on the side of the road, Waters watched as the two men pulled up along side him. Then one of the men pointed the assault rifle directly at Waters and pulled the trigger. Waters felt at this point that he would never see his wife or infant son again, but for some unexplained reason, the rifle jammed and would not fire. The two men then sped off, only to be arrested by officers shortly thereafter, due in large part to the constant contact Waters had with the dispatcher in relaying their position to the authorities. 
Unfortunately, the two police officers who were shot in this incident, Highway Patrol Trooper Ed Lowry and Cumberland County Sheriff's Deputy David Hathcock, were both killed as a result of gun shot wounds inflicted by the two suspects. While it may not serve to make this tragic loss of life any easier for the victim's families, it certainly goes to show that crime does not pay, and those who commit these atrocities will be apprehended. 
This display of courage by Waters exemplifies the characteristics of true heroism, and serves to reassure the many law abiding citizens that good really does triumph over evil. So often acts of selflessness such as this go unnoticed simply because the danger faced is of a lesser degree, but Ronald Waters is one of many who have risked their lives for what they know to be right. 
I am pleased to stand before you today, Mr. President, to relay this story of courage and valor personified to its greatest degree. I join the State of South Carolina in honoring Ronald Waters for his adamant service and devotion to Justice, and I thank you for allowing me the time to speak. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. This legislation is essential to help preserve and strengthen the advice and consent role of the Senate as mandated in the Constitution. 
One of the greatest fears of the Founders was the accumulation of too much power in one source, and the separation of powers among the three branches of Government is one of the keys to the success of our great democratic government. An excellent example of the separation of powers is the requirement in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution that the President receive the advice and consent of the Senate for the appointment of officers of the United States. As Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote for the Supreme Court a few years ago, `The Clause is a bulwark against one branch aggrandizing its power at the expense of another branch.' 
The Vacancies Act is central to the Appointments Clause because it places limits on the amount of time that the President can appoint someone to an advice and consent position in an acting capacity without sending a nomination to the Senate. However, for many years, the executive branch has failed to comply with the letter of the law. The Vacancies Act has no method of enforcement, so the executive branch just ignores it. When confronted with the act, the Attorney General makes very weak legal arrangements about its inapplicability. This is what the Attorney General did over one year ago when I raised the Vacancies Act at an oversight hearing. At the time, almost all of the top positions at the Justice Department were being filled in an acting capacity. I exchanged letters with her about the Vacancies Act, and detailed the fallacy in her argument. It was to no avail. 
I became convinced that legislation to rewrite the vacancies law and provide some remedy for violating it was the only way to get the executive branch to properly respect the advice and consent role of the Senate. Senator Lott and I introduced legislation earlier this year, and I testified about it before the Governmental Affairs Committee. 
I detailed for the Committee some prominent examples of how the Act was being ignored. President Clinton allowed the Criminal Division of the Justice Department to languish for over two and one half years before making an appointment. The Government had an Acting Solicitor General for an entire term of the Supreme Court. Most recently, the President installed an Acting Chief of the Civil Rights Division in blatant disregard of the Judiciary Committee's decision not to support his controversial choice. 
However, let me be clear. This bill is not about any one President or any one nominee. It is about preserving the institutional role of the Senate. A Republican President has no more right to ignore the appointments process than a Democrat President. 
Today, Senator Thompson, Senator Byrd, Senator Lot, and I are introducing a bipartisan bill to address the problem. It gives the President 150 days to send a nomination rather than the current 120 days. If he does not comply, the office must remain vacant and the actions of any person acting in that office after that time are null and void, until a nominee is forwarded to the Senate. The bill also clarifies the application of the Vacancies Act to reject the Attorney General's flawed interpretation. 
Mr. President, we must act to preserve the advice and consent role of the Senate. As the Supreme Court has stated, `The structural interests protected by the Appointments Clause are not those of any one branch of Government but of the entire Republic.' Reforming the vacancies law is essential in this regard. Let us reaffirm the separation of powers for the sake of the Senate and the entire Republic.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who has rendered a great service to the State of South Carolina through his efforts as a professional law enforcement officer, Carl B. Stokes. 
Just like his father, who was the Sheriff of Darlington County, Carl Stokes has literally dedicated his life to crime fighting. As a matter of fact, I am told that he is supposed to be the longest serving lawman in the Palmetto State, and his distinguished career began in the 1950's while he was still attending the University of South Carolina and joined the South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division (SLED). In just a few weeks, he will bring that career to a close when he retires from his position as System Vice President for Law Enforcement and Safety for the University of South Carolina. 
For more than 25-years, Carl Stokes held a number of positions within SLED, including undercover operations, crowd control, investigations, and forensics. As a trusted, competent, and reliable member of SLED, Carl Stokes caught the attention of that agency's chief, J.P. Strom, who tapped Stokes to undertake an innovative and important project-creating a computer system for law enforcement in South Carolina. He is also credited with implementing the first incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting System, which is used by all law enforcement agencies in the Palmetto State. 
In addition to his work at SLED, Stokes made a number of important contributions to professionalizing law enforcement in South Carolina. He was involved in many organizations, associations, and committees that worked to make law enforcement at all levels more professional and efficient. Through his involvement with these groups, he became very well known throughout the state and region, and his expertise was respected by many. This varied and progressive experience made him an ideal candidate to head up law enforcement and security operations at the University of South Carolina, and in 1981, Carl Stokes returned to college, this time not as a student, but as a cop. 
Law enforcement on college campuses has changed tremendously in the past twenty years. Colleges and universities have diverse populations that are essentially the size of small cities, and it is critical that such institutions have professional police forces that are trained in everything from community relations to resolving a hostage crisis. Such a responsibility is a tremendous task, but Carl Stokes was able to carry out his duties with seeming ease. Over the past seventeen years, he has helped to make certain that students, faculty, and staff are safe and secure in housing, classrooms, and university property. He and his department have worked closely with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Secret Service, the Department of State, the United Nations, and a host of other national and international law enforcement agencies in order to provide security to visiting dignitaries as well as to provide police services on the nine USC campuses. Impressively, Carl Stokes also worked to ensure that the University of South Carolina Division of Law Enforcement and Safety gained national accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies. This is an especially noteworthy achievement as this is one of only fifteen college and university police departments in the United States to earn such a professional recognition. 
I am certain that after such a long and distinguished career, it must be difficult for Carl Stokes to take off his badge and hang-up his gun, but he can do so knowing that in his more than four decades as a law enforcement official, he made countless contributions to the safety and security of society. I am pleased to note that all three of his children have followed in his footsteps in one way or another, his two sons are involved in law enforcement and his daughter works for the University of South Carolina. I wish Carl and his wife health and happiness in the years to come, I know that they will both enjoy being able to spend time with their children and grandchildren and reflecting on a full life.

Today, I am pleased to have this opportunity to pay tribute to the Army on the 223rd anniversary of its founding. 
Formed on June 14, 1775, the United States Army is older than the nation itself, and for more than two centuries, its soldiers have stood tall as they carried out their duties patriotically and selflessly. In the history of the Army, more than 42 million Americans have raised their right hands, both in times of crisis and peace, to take an oath to protect and defend the nation from all enemies foreign and domestic. In that time, soldiers have been called to arms numerous times in order to preserve this Republic. From the Battle of Cowpens during our War for Independence, to Bosnia, where our troops help to maintain a fragile peace, those who serve prove that there is no finer citizen, no better warrior, and no more compassionate peacemaker than a soldier in the United States Army. 
The success and excellence of our soldiers and Army are due to many contributing factors, but certainly the most important is that we live in a nation founded on the ideals of a democratic government. We have created a society that truly affords more liberties, more freedoms, and more opportunities than any other nation in the world. While we may have some differences amongst ourselves, and some problems which must be resolved, no quarrel or dispute will ever undermine the unity of our 50 States. It is this Constitutionally mandated, democratic form of government, where every citizen is free to speak his or her mind, where every American is protected by the laws of the land, and every person has the chance to succeed that makes the United States a promised land to people throughout the globe. All of us recognize this is a nation and system worthy of defending, and our soldiers are the men and women who have volunteered to carry out this critical mission. 
While our soldiers have always been `America's Finest', those who serve in today's Army are truly a breed apart. These are men and women who are well educated, well trained, and well equipped. They are individuals who possess a desire to serve, a strong sense of patriotism, and a willingness to make sacrifices so that others may be safe. We have created a fighting force that uses its mind as much as its might. A force that is able to adapt to fluid contingencies just as effectively as it is able to stick to a battle plan. There is no military force in the world that can match the abilities, capabilities, and spirit of the American soldier or the United States Army, there never has been and there never will be. 
The very history of this nation and its Army helps to forge the spirit of the modern soldier. The soldier of today can look back on more than 200 years of heritage and fighting spirit that helps to mold the mettle of those who stand firm for democracy and the safety of our nation. Rogers' Rangers, who fought in the New Hampshire mountains during the French & Indian Wars are the forefathers of today's Ranger Battalions. The same grit and determination that saw the first American soldiers through a brutal winter at Valley Forge was evident in Bastogne, Belgium in 1945 when the 101st Airborne Division, though surrounded and outnumbered by German Forces, refused to surrender and by stubbornly standing fast, they helped to win the Battle of the Bulge. The bravery demonstrated by Captain Roger Donlan, a Special Forces Officer who commanded Camp Nam Dong in the I Corps Tactical Zone in 1966, who was repeatedly and seriously wounded while battling off an enemy battalion of superior size was recognized by his winning the first Medal of Honor awarded during the Vietnam conflict. Twenty- seven years later, two Special Operations soldiers were decorated with the Medal of Honor for making the ultimate sacrifice in the streets of Mogadishu, Somalia fighting to protect a critically wounded American helicopter pilot. Their sacrifice allowed that pilot to live, and their actions proved that there is no greater bond than the one between soldiers. 
Throughout the Army's history, success has been based on an ability to resist complacency, and while today's soldiers are justifiably proud of their past, they are looking and working toward the future. In battle labs across the nation soldiers, strategists, scientists, and designers are working in concert to field an Army that will be able to dominate the battlefield of the next century. Revolutions in weapons, communications, tactics, and strategy are taking place and are being incorporated into Army Doctrine. By the Year 2000, the Fourth Infantry Division will become the first fully digitized division in the Army, and by 2004 the Army will have its first digitized corps. These digitized forces will ensure that commanders know where they are, where their troops are, and where the enemy is, and with this information, dominate the battlefield. Through research and development efforts like the ones that led to the digital division, we are assured that we will remain one step ahead of any nation that might threaten our security, and that we will truly have a force capable of meeting and defeating any threat to our nation, her people, and our interests. 
As we mark this 223rd anniversary of the United States Army, it is an appropriate time to celebrate the successes of that service; the sacrifices made by millions of soldiers, including the ultimate sacrifice; and the invaluable contribution these men and women have made to keeping the United States and her citizens safe and free. Indeed, the history of our Army is a proud one, and as we approach the 21st Century, I know that its future will eclipse all its previous accomplishments.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who was known to many of us in this Chamber, retired Major General Jim Pennington, who passed away on June 5, 1998. 
Those of us who worked on national security and veterans related matters knew General Pennington very well. He served as both the President of the National Association for Uniformed Services and the Administrator for the Society of Military Widows. In those capacities, he was an able and effective advocate for a strong defense and for providing for an appropriate quality of life for those who serve and have served the Nation as members of the armed forces. 
General Pennington had an impressive career as a soldier. He joined the Army on June 6, 1944, the day the Allies invaded Normandy and began their march toward Germany and victory, and he fought in the Battle of the Bulge. In his more than 37-year career, Jim Pennington rose from the rank of private to sergeant major, and then ultimately major general, the rank he held when he retired from military service in 1981. 
As many tens of thousands of other World War II veterans did, Jim Pennington used the G.I. Bill to get a college education. This was an invaluable program that not only provided an important benefit to those who spent years of their lives in military service, but it created a generation of Americans who possessed the skills and knowledge required to make the United States the world's leader in matters of commerce, global security issues, and technology. 
I had the pleasure of working closely with General Pennington on a number of issues throughout his tenure as the President of the National Association of Uniformed Services and the Administrator of the Society of Military Widows. I always welcomed his advice and insight, and without question, he served the members and organizations he represented well. Jim Pennington will be greatly missed and my sympathies go out to his family and friends.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the Judicial Improvement Act. This legislation contains various important reforms of the judicial branch that will help keep the powers of the courts in check with the other branches of government and with the will of the people. 
This comprehensive bill contains provisions that are important to many senators, and I am especially pleased that two bills that I have introduced and advocated for years are included in this reform package. One would prohibit judges from imposing tax increases, and the other would clarify the retroactive application of legislation. 
This Act states that a Federal judge does not have the authority to order the Federal government or units of state or local governments to raise taxes as a legal remedy. In 1990, in Missouri v. Jenkins, the Supreme Court permitted a district court judge to order local authorities to impose a huge tax increase to pay for his plan to desegregate a school district. 
One may wonder why a desegregation plan would be so expensive as to warrant a massive tax increase. The reason is this plan was not simply an attempt to bring schools up to basic standards. Rather, it was an elaborate social experiment in the name of education. Money was no object. Among other mandates, the plan called for 15 computers in every classroom, a 2,000 square-foot planetarium, a 25-acre farm, a model United Nations, an art gallery, movie editing and screening rooms, and swimming pools. 
Money was no object because there was no control over the judge. There was no accountability. The only supervision was a higher court, and a slim majority of the Supreme Court gave the judge a free reign. 
The dissent in that case clearly explained what should have been obvious: it violates the Constitutional separation of powers for a judge to order that taxes be increased. In the Constitution, Article I contains the legislative powers. Article I, Section 8 begins by stating, `The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes.' Article III provides for judicial power, and makes no mention of the power to tax. Therefore, a Federal judge does not have the power to tax under the Constitution. 
This is more than a matter of proper Constitutional interpretation. It is an essential check on power. The ability to tax is an awesome power. It is true that, as Justice John Marshall once wrote, `the power to tax involves the power to destroy.' This authority must be carefully checked, and the best source of control is the people. Thus, in the Constitution, the ability to tax was given to the legislative branch, which is directly accountable to the people through the ballot box. 
By design, the Judicial Branch is different. It is not responsible to the people. The Framers intentionally did not provide for judges to be elected by the people and even gave judges life tenure. They wanted judges to be insulated from the political climate and have the freedom to interpret the law appropriately, rather than make decisions based on the will of the majority at any given moment. It is entirely reasonable and appropriate that judicial power does not include the power to tax. 
As Justice Kennedy stated in his thoughtful dissent in Missouri v. Jenkins, the Supreme Court's `casual embrace of taxation imposed by the unelected life-tenured Federal Judiciary disregards fundamental precepts for the democratic control of public institutions.' 
The Framers of the Constitution fully intended to separate power in this manner and did not mean for judges to be involved in taxation. As Alexander Hamilton stated in the Federalist No. 78, `The judiciary . . . has no influence over either the sword or the purse.' In my view, judicial taxation is simply taxation without representation, no different from the complaints of the American colonists about taxation without representation during the days of the Stamp Act in 1765. 
Mr. President, if a judge can order a tax increase for a school, why not a similar social experiment for a prison? It is hard to imagine any limits on a Federal judge's power as expressed in Missouri v. Jenkins. I believe it is imperative that the Congress act to control the power of the judicial branch in this regard. 
Another provision of the bill that I have long advocated would clarify the retroactivity of legislation. Often the Congress will pass legislation but not state whether that legislation should be applied retroactively to conduct that occurred before the law was passed. An excellent example is the Civil Rights Act of 1991. It took years of litigation with decisions in over one hundred Federal courts throughout the country before the Supreme Court finally decided the question. 
The provision simply states that legislation is not retroactive unless the bill expressly says it is. This simple rule will eliminate a great deal of uncertainty. As a result, it will reduce litigation costs and help our judicial system better focus to reserve its limited resources. 
This clarification should not be controversial. The Judicial Conference of the Federal courts indicated in a report in 1995 that it did not oppose this legislative fix, and the Clinton Justice Department stated in a letter to me in 1996 that it did not object to this clarification. I hope both of these provisions are passed this year. 
The Judicial Improvement Act contains many other needed reforms that I will not attempt to detail, such as a requirement for a three-judge panel to enjoin the enforcement of certain laws. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the judicial reforms contained in this important legislation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to direct that the vessel, Yesterdays Dream, official number 680266, be accorded coastwise trading privileges and be issued a coastwise endorsement under 46 U.S.C. sections 12106 and 12108. 
This vessel was purchased in 1984 by Duncan MacRae of Columbia, SC, for a pleasure boat. In attempting to establish a charter service, he discovered that the boat could not be used in a chartering business because the vessel was foreign built. For this reason, the boat did not meet the requirements for coastwise trading privileges in the United States. When Mr. MacRae bought his boat, he was unaware that it could not be legally used for its intended purpose. 
Therefore, Mr. MacRae is seeking a waiver of the existing law because he wishes to use the vessel for charters. If he is granted this waiver, he intends to comply fully with U.S. documentation and safety requirements. The purpose of the legislation I am introducing is to allow Yesterdays Dream to engage in the coastwise trade and fisheries of the United States.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to speak a word or two about Senator Barry Goldwater. Senator Goldwater was a man of integrity, ability, and dedication. When he announced he was going to run for President, I changed parties that year because I wanted to support this particular man on account of the high principles for which he stood. I did support him. Whether he had a chance to be elected or not, I wanted to have a part in supporting a man who stood for values, who stood for America, and who stood for the good things of life. 
Senator Goldwater served here for about 30 years. I enjoyed serving with him. On account of that opportunity to serve with him--I knew a good man when I saw one--that is the reason that I supported him for President. He carried my State, and he carried about five or six other States. I was sorry he was not elected. He would have made a great President of the United States. 
I extend my deepest sympathy to his family in this time of grieving. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the United States fought World War II, Americans mobilized in support of the war effort like they never had before. Everyone was trying to find a way to help our troops battle the Axis and keep the world free and safe. Whether it was children flattening and saving tin cans that were used for scrap metal, or people growing fruits and vegetables in `Victory Gardens', everyone tried to find a way to make their own contribution to winning the war and supporting our men and women in uniform. 
It was at this time that the American Red Cross took on the responsibility of collecting blood that would ultimately be used to help save the lives of Soldiers, Sailors, Marines, and Army Air Corpsmen wounded in action. The efforts of the Red Cross were truly a success as they helped to reduce the death rate among the wounded by fifty percent.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about our former colleague and Majority Leader, Senator Robert Dole. 
There are few people who have given more to this Nation than Bob Dole. He has dedicated his life to public service. He was a young Army officer during World War II, helping to liberate Europe, where as we all know, he suffered his lifelong wounds. He served in the Kansas State House, in the United States House of Representatives, and ultimately in the United States Senate, as Majority Leader, where he left his greatest mark. Even though he no longer holds elected office, Bob still finds ways to contribute to the public good through a variety of efforts, not the least of which is his work on the World War II Memorial. He is truly a man who has distinguished himself through his selflessness, who has rendered the Nation a great service, and is worthy of the respect and admiration of all Americans. 
A few weeks ago, another one of our former colleagues, Secretary of Defense William Cohen, made certain that Senator Dole knew the high regard in which he is held by the men and women of our armed services by holding a full dress parade in his honor and bestowing upon him the Department of Defense's Distinguished Public Service Award. This was an especially impressive ceremony that weaved together pageantry, heritage, and patriotism in a stirring tribute to both Senator Dole and his service to the United States. I was particularly moved by the remarks of my two friends and want to share them with my colleagues in the Senate, and with the Nation through the Congressional Record. I am certain that all who read these speeches will agree with me that they provide both insight into a modest and private man and a fitting tribute to a true American hero.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the very foundation of our Nation lies in the rule of law, and there is perhaps no symbol more closely associated with the process of justice than the courthouse. Not only is the courthouse where justice is dispensed, but it is a reminder to all citizens that the judiciary is the third branch of our system of government. 
Recently, the Edgefield County Courthouse was rededicated, and Judge Joe Anderson, of the South Carolina District Court, was the keynote speaker at the ceremony. His remarks were very well received by the crowd and helped to make the event a great success. Though I was unable to attend this event, I heard from a number of friends who did that Judge Anderson's remarks were truly excellent. After requesting a copy of his speech, I came to the very same conclusion and thought that my peers in the Senate would enjoy reading them as much as I did.

I want to thank all members of the Committee who have worked so hard this year to bring this bill to the floor. I particularly want to thank Senator Levin, the Ranking Member, for his cooperative support. 
I also want to acknowledge the contributions of Senator Coats, Senator Kempthorne, and Senator Glenn. This will be their last defense authorization bill. On behalf of the committee and the Senate, I want to thank them for their dedication to the national security of our country and their support for the young men and women who serve in our armed forces. We will miss these three outstanding Senators who have served our country and the committee so well. 
Mr. President, I also want to express my appreciation to the members of the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee. We on the Committee are very proud of our staff. I believe that we have the most competent and professional staff on Capitol Hill. They work well together in a very bi-partisan way and all of us on the Committee are indebted to them for their selfless dedication. I ask unanimous consent that a list of the members of the staff be included following my remarks.

Mr. THURMOND. This is the 40th defense authorization bill on which I have worked since I joined the Armed Services Committee in 1959. It is my fourth as Chairman of the committee and as I indicated earlier this year, while I intend to remain on the Committee, this will be my last year as Chairman. I look forward to the floor debate on this bill as well as the conference with the House. I am hopeful that we are able to complete the bill and send it to the President before the July 4th recess. It is essential that we complete floor action before the Memorial Day recess in order to meet this ambitious schedule. 
We have accelerated significantly our process this year. I cannot recall ever bringing the defense authorization bill to the floor this early in the year. If we are successful in completing conference in late June, we may be setting a modern day record. 
Mr. President, the Defense Authorization bill for Fiscal Year 1999 which I bring before the Senate today is only 3.1 percent of Gross Domestic Product--the lowest since 1940. Defense outlays peaked in 1986 at 6.5 percent. President Reagan's defense buildup was one of the great investments in our history. As a result of President Reagan's strong leadership and our strengthened military, we won the Cold War. Therefore, we have been able to reduce our defense force structure. These reductions enabled the Nation to reduce the deficit and achieve a balanced budget. The victory in the Cold War and the resulting peace dividend, which began, by the way, under President Reagan, is now saving us over $250 billion per year--the major factor in achieving a balanced budget. 
Mr. President, we haven't debated the levels for defense spending on the floor of the Senate for some time. Maybe its because defense doesn't rank very high these days in the polls which reflect the concerns of the American people. Or maybe it's because everyone assumes that the defense budget is adequate and there is no reason to debate it. I am concerned first of all because I believe there is a clear shortfall between the ambitious foreign policy of this Administration and the resources we are willing to provide for national defense. 
The operational tempo of our military forces is at an all time high. American forces are deployed literally around the globe. The foreign policy of this Administration has raised the number of separate deployments to the highest in our history. Our servicemen and women spend more and more time away from their homes and families on more frequent and extended deployments. As a result, recruiting grows more difficult and retention is becoming an extremely serious problem--especially for pilots. 
We are also beginning to see increasing indicators of readiness problems. Spare parts shortages, increased cannibalization, declining operational readiness rates, cross-decking of critical weapons, equipment and personnel foretell a potential emergence of readiness difficulties that could seriously cripple our military forces in the very near future. The Chiefs of the military services indicate that they are on the margin in readiness and modernization. The Chief of one of our military services has recently stated orally as well as in writing that his budget for fiscal year 1999 is, for the third year in a row, inadequate. 
While, at the present time, the American people may not be expressing concern about threats to our national security or the 
readiness of our armed forces, we in the Senate are not relieved of our responsibilities to ensure that we have capable, effective military forces ready to defend our nation's vital interests. It is our job in the Congress to examine the readiness and capability of our armed forces and ensure that we have provided adequate resources and guidance to the Secretary of Defense so that he can carry out his mission to protect our national security. I believe, as I have stated so many times on this floor, that nothing that we do here in the Congress is as important as providing for our national security. I intend to continue to make this point whenever I believe that we in the Senate may not be paying enough attention to this most critical issue. 
Mr. President, the Congress has endeavored over the past several years to shore up our defense budgets with annual add-ons. However, reductions in the defense budgets over the last 3 years to pay for Bosnia have denigrated the effect of those Congressional plus-ups. Almost half of the $21 billion we added to the defense budgets over the last 3 years, which was intended to enhance readiness and modernization, was spent instead for operations in Bosnia. The maintenance of our forces in Bosnia and in the Persian Gulf, places great strain on our military forces and budgets. 
As many of you are aware, we have been forced to cope with a $3.6 billion outlay shortfall in the defense budget resulting from scoring differences between the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office. The Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici has been very helpful in working out a solution to help alleviate this problem. I am sure the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee joins me in thanking Senator Domenici and his staff for their assistance. 
Under the budget agreement, we have not added funds to the defense budget this year. I do not believe that a majority of Senators would support adding funds to the defense budget in violation of the budget agreement. Therefore, we have conducted our markup consistent with the budget agreement. However, I have stated in the past and I say again, I believe that we are not providing adequate funds for defense. The Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House National Security Committee have also called for increases in the defense budget. It remains my firm belief that we should provide additional funds for our national security. 
In this bill, the Committee has achieved a balance among near-term readiness; long-term readiness, through investments in modernization infrastructure and research and development; force levels; quality of life and ensuring an adequate, safe and reliable nuclear weapons capability. The Committee modified the budget request to improve operations and achieve greater efficiencies and savings and to eliminate spending that does not contribute directly to the national security of the United States. 
The Committee recommended provisions to provide a 3.1 percent pay raise for the uniformed services; to enhance the ability of the services to recruit and retain quality personnel; and to restore appropriate funding levels for the construction and maintenance of both bachelor and family housing. The bill recommends increased investment in research and development activities to ensure that the Department of Defense can leverage advances in technology. 
The Committee remains concerned about the level of resources available for the reserve components and the continued lack of a spirit of cooperation between the active and reserve forces. The Committee recommended a number of policy initiatives and spending increases intended to continue the improvement of the readiness of the reserve forces and to permit greater use of the expertise and capabilities of the reserve components. One such measure is the authority for the reserve components to prepare to respond to domestic emergencies involving the use or intended use of a weapon of mass destruction. I am proud to be able to recommend this important legislation which will enable the Nation to be prepared for the most unimaginable terrorist incident. 
I do want to tell my colleagues that this defense bill does not include a long list of new major projects or new initiatives. Quite simply, there is no money to support new major projects or new initiatives. However, I should note that over the past three or four years, the Committee on Armed Services has produced defense bills with major new program starts, reforms of the acquisition process, initiatives related to missile defense and counter proliferation, and programs to achieve efficiencies and enhance readiness. The Secretary of Defense must now implement these major programs. As the Department of Defense executes the programs we enacted over the past several years, I anticipate that they will come back to the Congress to suggest modifications addressing areas in which they believe they need additional flexibility. 
Mr. President, I would like to remind my colleagues that any amendments to the defense authorization bill that would increase spending should be accompanied by offsetting reductions. 
Mr. President, this is a sound bill. It provides a road map to take our Nation's Armed Forces into the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to join the Members of the Armed Services Committee and pass this bill with a strong bipartisan vote. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of the Armed Services Committee. 
This amendment implements an agreement between the Armed Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee. Pursuant to this agreement, the Armed Services Committee has agreed to reduce by $275 million funds in the pending bill for nonintelligence programs and to increase by $275 million funds for the next Foreign Intelligence Program, which is also part of this bill. 
The Armed Services Committee has considered the range and options for implementing this agreement, all of which involve making difficult choices to cut defense programs. After considerable deliberation, the committee has decided to reduce funding for the Theater High Altitude Area Defense Program by $250 million and the Advanced Medium Range Air-To-Air Missile System by $21 million. These funds are now assigned to these two programs.

Next, I want to commend him for the long, faithful service he has rendered to this committee. I don't know of any member of the committee that has worked harder and has stood stronger for defense and has been more knowledgeable in accomplishing what we have been able to do than the able Senator from Indiana. He is truly an expert on armed services matters. I wish him well in all that he does in the future. 
I regret that he has seen fit not to run again. We will miss him here. A vacuum will be created. It will be hard to fill. He is such a fine man, such a knowledgeable man, and such a dedicated man. I want him to know that our country appreciates what he has done. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of the Cuban Assistance and Solidarity (SOLIDARIDAD) Act that my distinguished friend and Chairman of the foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms, is introducing today. I commend the Chairman for his leadership on this issue and strongly support him in this endeavor. 
The intent of this legislation is very simple * * * to actively assist the repressed Cuban people and those dedicated to ending the regime of Fidel Castro. 
This Act will authorize $100 million in humanitarian assistance over four years for food, medicine, and medical supplies, donated by the U.S. government. In addition, direct flights to deliver this humanitarian aid will be authorized and monitored to ensure that all aid is directly delivered to the Cubans who need it most, those who are unable to afford to make purchases in the Castro controlled dollar-only stores. 
Mr. President, this is an important piece of legislation. This bill will eliminate Castro's claims that the U.S. embargo is the cause of the hardships suffered by the Cuban people. It effectively creates a Catch-22 for him. If he allows the aid, he loses his control by deprivation. If he prohibits the aid, he will no longer be able to prevent the people from receiving food and medicine without the knowledge that he is responsible for their pain and suffering, not the United States. 
Further, this bill requires the President to take several timely and appropriate pro-democracy steps regarding Cuba, such as strengthening support for democratic opposition within Cuba; seeking a U.N. Security Council resolution on free elections; beginning `freedom broadcasting' through Radio and TV Marti; producing a series of reports on the plight of average Cubans; authorizing increased personnel to expedite American medical sales licenses; and obtaining the International Court of Justice indictment in the downing of two unarmed planes and the murder of four people in 1996. 
Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to take a proactive stand for the people of Cuba and support the SOLIDARIDAD Act.

Mr. THURMOND. I thank the Senator. I just need about 7 minutes. 
Mr. President, I rise today to express my views on S. 1186, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act of 1998. This bill will consolidate vocational education, adult education and Federal employment training programs. I generally support this effort. However, I do have some concerns regarding the treatment of current veterans' employment and training programs. 
This Nation has a long history of providing assistance to our veterans, dating from colonial days. Since World War I, several laws have been enacted to address veterans' employment problems. Such legislation has reaffirmed and strengthened the federal government's role in promoting wider employment and training opportunities for veterans. The Federal government has a legitimate role in veterans' employment issues since it is the action of the Federal government that gives an individual the status of `veteran.' 
Currently, the primary programs to assist veterans are those administered by the Department of Labor, through the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS). These include the Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program (DVOP) and the Local Veterans' Employment Representative (LVER), which are grant programs to the States, and will continue in their present form. 
The current provisions of Title 38 of the United States Code were designed to address services provided to veterans in a traditional Job Service delivery system. However, this system is changing. We now see a wide variance in delivery system design, configuration, and service delivery providers. Some states are contracting with private business, community agencies, or other units of government. Other states are focusing on electronic services. 
This changing environment makes it difficult to guarantee that government is providing maximum employment and training opportunities, with priority of service for veterans. 
To maximize these opportunities and to protect that priority, the Veterans Employment and Training Service is required by Federal law to promote and monitor participation of veterans in federally funded employment and training programs. 
Because of the national interest in veterans' programs, I supported language in this bill that (1) authorized a veteran representative to the Statewide Partnership; (2) required the State plan to assure coordination with veterans programs; (3) provided assurances in the State plan that veterans will be afforded services under the employment and training subtitle `to the maximum extent practicable'; (4) required performance reporting on workforce investment activities provided for veterans; and (5) included dislocated Department of Defense civilians, contractor personnel, and members of the Armed Forces as eligible participants in National emergency grants. 
While these provisions help provide visibility of veterans programs at the national and state level, I am concerned that veterans employment and training programs are not represented at the local level. The bill does not provide for a veterans representative on the local workforce investment partnership. This partnership has the responsibility of setting policy for the local area and ensuring that local performance measures are met, that needs of employers and job seekers are met, and is responsible for continuous improvement of the system. Furthermore, the local partnership develops and implements the operating agreements for the one-stop customer service centers. 
I can support this arrangement in principle, where local business, labor and government leaders develop and oversee a plan to meet local community needs. However, where veterans programs are included in the one-stop center, veterans should have representation. This will ensure, if it becomes apparent that veterans are being underserved in any given local workforce investment area, that steps will be taken to address and correct the disparity. 
I encourage those Senators who are conferees to consider carefully the commitment our veterans made to the Nation, and the commitment this Nation has made to its veterans. I urge the conference to adopt language that will (1) ensure that maximum employment and training services are made available and provided to veterans; (2) require State and local plans to include information to track services to veterans; (3) include veteran representatives on local partnerships; and (4) provide that nothing in this Act shall be construed to repeal or modify any special rights or privileges for veterans including priority of service. 
Mr. President, I believe these modifications to the bill will strengthen this measure and protect the interests of our veterans. I look forward to working with the bill managers and with other conferees.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, if one wants to find an excellent example of a private organization making a significant difference in the lives of young people, one need look no further than the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. This organization has dedicated itself to providing invaluable services and activities for our Nation's youngest citizens, and their efforts have not only helped to provide a diversion from the many destructive temptations that face our children in this day and age, but have also made neighborhoods throughout the United States better places to live. 
For the past forty-two years, Errol Sewell has dedicated his life to promoting the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and helping to make this organization the success it is today. Mr. Sewell's association with the Boys & Girls Clubs began in Valdosta, Georgia where he was a member of the clubhouse in what was then a small, sleepy southern town near the Florida border. In 1956, Mr. Sewell made what was a natural transition, from that of `club member' to `club staffer', and he began what became a lifelong association with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. 
Mr. Sewell's abilities and talents as a manager and a leader did not go unnoticed, and he was brought to the national staff in 1969 in the capacity of field representative for the Southeast region. Over the past almost twenty years, he has worked tirelessly to promote the Clubs, and has steadily moved up the organization ladder to the position of senior vice president. In that capacity, Mr. Sewell established what will be his most lasting legacy of service and accomplishment in the Boys & Girls Clubs of America organization, he is credited with being one of the key people in almost doubling the number of members of this organization. 
In the late 1980's when Mr. Sewell became Senior Vice President for Field Services, there were approximately one million boys and girls who belonged to about 1,000 clubs across the nation. It became the vision and the goal of senior officers of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America to double the size of its membership in five years, and largely through the determination and hard work of Errol Sewell, that goal was reached. Today, there are almost three million children who are members of the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and clubhouses are added to this organization at a rate of about four a week. This is truly an impressive accomplishment, and it is one that is worthy of commendation. Errol Sewell and the Boys and Girls Clubs of America are deserving of credit and our gratitude. 
Mr. President, Errol Sewell is retiring from the organization that has been a part of his life since his childhood. As this dedicated man steps down from his duties, he can take great pride in all he has accomplished, not the least of which is securing the most lucrative endowment the organization has ever received, $10 million to establish the `Joseph B. Whitehead Leadership Development Fund'. Unquestionably, Mr. Sewell leaves the Boys & Girls Clubs of America a bigger, better, and stronger organization thanks to his efforts, and I know that he will be missed by all those who have had the pleasure of working with him. I am certain that all my colleagues would join me in congratulating him on his successes and wishing him continued health and happiness in the years to come.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, NATO has been the foundation of European security since its creation in 1949, containing the Soviet Union for more than forty years and providing security to Western Europe. With the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1989, and the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, NATO now stands as possibly the most successful alliance in history. Since that time, however, the Alliance has been forced to consider the continued relevance and future of NATO, and the United States has reviewed its role in Europe. 
Since 1995, when the Alliance announced its intentions to enlarge NATO, the Armed Services Committee in particular, and the Senate in general, have conducted numerous hearings on enlarging the Alliance. 
On February 27, the Committee forwarded its views on NATO enlargement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Those views are incorporated in the Executive Report of the Committee, which is before members of the Senate, along with the resolution of ratification. 
During the Armed Services Committee's review of NATO enlargement, the following concerns were raised: the cost of enlarging the alliance; adapting NATO to the post-Cold War strategic environment; and, NATO relations with Russia. 
Defense spending has declined steadily since 1985, from $423 billion to $257 billion--the amount of the defense budget request for fiscal year 1999. Because of the increasing scarcity of defense funds, the Committee focused extensively on the issue of costs, as the majority of the funding for the NATO budget is requested through the defense budget. 
The Congressional Budget Office estimated the cost of enlarging the NATO to be as high as $125 billion over a fifteen year period, while the NATO Military Committee estimated the cost of enlarging NATO to be $1.5 billion over ten years. I remind my colleagues that the differences in the cost contained in the four estimates are primarily due to differing views on the threat, current and future military requirements of NATO forces, the condition of infrastructure and facilities in the prospective new member countries, and the activities identified by NATO as eligible for NATO funding. 
Concerns were also raised about the willingness and commitment of current NATO members to bear their share of enlargement costs, as well as to continue to develop and modernize their military forces to defend their national borders and fulfill their Article V collective defense obligations as well. 
Cost estimates developed by the Department of Defense for U.S. participation in the NATO operation in Bosnia raise concerns about the validity of cost estimates. In December 1995, the Secretary of Defense testified to the Committee that the cost of deploying U.S. forces to Bosnia for one year to implement the Dayton Agreement would be $1.5 billion, and additional $500 million to provide logistical support. Before the year was over, the Committee was advised that the cost of deploying U.S. forces to Bosnia had increased to $3.0 billion. Mr. President, you are aware that the cost of deploying U.S. forces to Bosnia over the past three years is now approaching $10 billion. We may once again be discussing the need for funds for Bosnia, as there are no funds available now in the budget resolution for the continued deployment of U.S. forces in Bosnia in fiscal year 1999. 
The Senate has been assured by the foreign and defense ministers of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic that they will live up to their financial commitments. Our current allies have likewise given us the same assurances. If they fail to do so, the Senate can revisit the issue of burden sharing. Likewise, if the new NATO members, or current allies, do not live up to their financial obligations, I would expect the Administration to take appropriate action in the NATO military committee to revise the amount of the U.S. contribution. 
With regard to adapting NATO to a new strategic environment, the committee was very clear on its position that collective defense should remain the primary mission of NATO, and recommended in its letter to the Foreign Relations Committee, that the resolution of ratification include an understanding to that effect. Regardless of changes in the 1991 Strategic Concept of NATO's mission restructuring it to deal with potential new challenges of out of area operations and to support peacekeeping and peace enforcement operation, first and foremost, NATO is a military alliance. NATO must remain militarily strong in order to execute its Article V obligations. 
I understand that the NATO Policy Coordinating Group has developed suggested revisions to the 1991 Strategic Concept, which were circulated to Allies in late January. I also understand that the process in NATO for changes to be made to its strategic concept will take over a year. I believe it is 
important that the Senate be advised of any recommended revisions to the Strategic Concept, before the United States agrees to them. In particular, I believe it is important that the Senate be advised of any recommendations to change or dilute the core mission of the Alliance, revisions that would affect the distribution of forces in peacetime and redeployment capabilities, any recommendations to further enlarge the Alliance, and revisions that would affect the strategic balance in Europe. 
As I stated earlier, since the dissolution of the Warsaw pact and the Soviet Union, many Americans wonder why we need NATO at all, much less an enlarged NATO with expanded security obligations. Skepticism about NATO's continued value is at least as widespread as support for an enlarged NATO. Frankly, I do not believe that the Administration has made the case to the public, or the Congress on why NATO should be enlarged, and why the United States should remain engaged in Europe. As a consequence, I worry that the lack of public support will result in a weak domestic political foundation, where the United States will find it difficult to maintain an expanded commitment in a future crisis. 
We need to think about NATO enlargement in relation to national interests of the United States and our global strategy, and not just narrow political, organizational or even vital security interests. I believe NATO is still vital to U.S. interests. However, all Americans must first understand the magnitude of the commitment we are undertaking, and why it should be made. 
I support a renewed and enlarged NATO because it ensures a U.S. involvement in the European community, and a `seat at the table' to the world's most vital, productive region. Quite simply, the U.S. has clear, abiding and vital interests in Europe. Europe is the soil where our deepest roots run. We are bound to Europe by innumerable links of trade, finance, communications, and technology exchange; ties of history, culture and shared values, and nearly five decades of mutual security arrangements. 
A free and stable Europe has always been essential to the United States. In this century we have intervened in two bloody world wars to prevent the domination of Europe by aggressive dictatorships. We paid a high price for forty-five years of Cold War to prevent the domination of Europe and the Eurasian landmass by Communist imperialism. This long U.S. involvement and stabilizing presence have made the United States in effect a European power. 
I do not believe Europe can remain stable and prosperous, to the mutual benefit of the United States and our European allies, if its post-Cold War boundary is drawn along the borders of Germany and Austria. Such an artificial division would leave a power vacuum in each central Europe, and consign millions of people who share our democratic values and aspirations to an uncertain fate. I do not believe a new European security framework will hold up unless it reflects the realities of the political upheaval that marked the end of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. The new strategic environment includes the reorienting of former East Bloc states toward the West. 
Some have said that the end of the Cold War spelled the `end of history.' I believe we are seeing the opposite. The end of the confrontation between the Soviet Empire and the Free World has unleashed historical forces suppressed for forty-five years. Nations and peoples are reverting to their patterns of the past. 
One of those patterns of the past is Russian imperialism. Czarist Russia was an expansionist, aggressive regional power long before the Bolshevik Revolution. Although there is no longer a Soviet Union, Russia is still a great power--if no longer a super power--and is exerting its will in the so-called `Near Abroad'. The brutal suppression of the revolt in Chechnya and Russia's intervention in Georgia, Azerbaijian and Moldova are worrisome examples. 
America's primary national security goal in Europe should be to ensure that Russia makes the transition to a stable, free-market and democratic nation, but especially one that remains within its borders. Democracies do not make war on their neighbors. We should do everything within reason to help Russia's transition to democracy, to maintain warm and friendly relations, and to avoid unnecessary provocations. Likewise, Russia should take the hard steps required to transition to a stable, free-market and democratic nation. However, we cannot afford to let Russia's opposition decide the course of NATO enlargement. 
In taking steps to assist Russia to transition to a stable and democratic nation, both the United States and NATO have established programs to reach out to, and cooperate with, Russia. With regard to NATO, just prior to the Madrid Summit, President Yeltsin, President Clinton, and NATO leaders signed the NATO-Russia Founding Act. This Act established a forum in which Russia 
can consult with NATO on issues of mutual interest, called the Permanent Joint Council. The United States has established programs in the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy to assist Russia in controlling its strategic arsenal, and to meet its arms control commitments. 
The committee did, however, point out in its letter to the Foreign Relations Committee its view that activities in the Permanent Joint Council should not distract NATO from its core function. Again, while I believe we should take steps to aid Russia in transitioning away from its communist and imperialist past, I do not believe the Permanent Joint Council should be allowed to be used by Russia to participate in NATO matters, not used as a platform to divide the Alliance, or denounce U.S. policy. 
The Clinton administration's policy toward Russia places all its stakes on the fate of Boris Yeltsin, and it does not appear to be having the desired effect. Moreover, the Administration's Russia-centered policy has caused us to neglect building solid relations with Ukraine and other former Soviet states. This also does not serve our goal. In fact, the policy of giving such sustained preferential treatment to Russia, and depending too much on President Yeltsin is the most destabilizing factor in Eastern Europe. 
We have to face the very real possibility that our policies may not succeed. Russia may not make the transition to a stable, democratic nation, nor one content to remain within its borders. In fact, an unstable Russia, torn by factions and internal strife, may not even be able to agree where its natural borders lie. 
The greatest potential threat to peace, stability, and security in Europe is the return to power of Russian hard-liners. President Yeltsin's popularity has sunk so low--that since his illness and heart operation--there is almost no yardstick against which to measure. 
The United States and its allies need to look seriously at bringing into NATO the states of the East and Central Europe which share our democratic values, and which are able to assume mutual security obligations inherent in the Alliance. Only a strong NATO that includes those states can keep a future, resurgent Russia contained and deterred. 
There are other reasons to expand membership of NATO, for example, the lessening of international tensions between members, and facilitating the resolution of conflicts. But we must not lose sight of the fact that NATO has been successful because it was a defensive alliance. Turning it into something else could fatally weaken it. Unless we understand that NATO's underlying and abiding purpose remains to defend Europe, the burdens of the Alliance over time will cause NATO to crumble. 
As a great maritime power and trading nation, America has intervened all over the globe to protect freedom of the seas and our vital interests, from the earliest days of our existence as a nation. Over time we formed strong alliance to protect mutual interests, demonstrating that free democratic nations acting collectively, can survive the threat of tyranny. These kinds of alliances, the kind represented by NATO, with allies who share our democratic values, should be the cornerstone of our foreign policy. 
Mr. President, I believe Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic share our values, and have worked hard to transition toward democratic nations and stabilize their economies. They have shown their willingness to act collectively with the United States by contributing forces to the coalition during the Persian Gulf War, and more recently, by sending military forces to work with NATO in Bosnia. Equally important to me, they have demonstrated their support for the United States during the most recent crisis with Iraq. They represent the type of nations which are deserving of membership in NATO, and I believe will be allies which the United States can look to in the future for support in areas of mutual defense and foreign policy interest. 
The Senate will have to vote on behalf of the American people by a two-thirds majority to ratify the admittance of any new country to NATO. I do not want to see the Senate become an obstacle to progress toward the Nation's national security interests. For the reasons that I have outlined, I will vote to support NATO enlargement.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, for the past week, the United States Army Reserve has had a number of events to help celebrate the 90th anniversary of their founding. Appropriately, the United States Senate, led by Senator Helms who was joined by 28 of our colleagues, passed a resolution last night commending the Army Reserve and its citizen-soldiers on an impressive heritage and on the invaluable contributions they have made to keeping the United States free and safe. 
As a former Army Reservist, I was naturally interested in reading this resolution and I am certain you can imagine my surprise when I discovered that it was also a tribute to me and the service I rendered the United States as a Soldier. I was, and am, humbled and flattered by this very touching gesture, you have touched the heart of this old `trooper', and I thank each of you for your kind act. 
I join each of you in commending all those who have served in the Army Reserve throughout its 90-year history, particularly those men and women who serve today. In this era of skrinking force structure and defense budgets, we will increasingly rely on our reserve forces to meet the security and foreign policy goals of the United States. We should be grateful that there is no shortage of patriotic Americans willing to endure the hardships and demands of reserve service, we are all better off their efforts. I am certain that I speak for the entire Body when I say that we appreciate and value the work and contributions of the Soldiers of the Army Reserve and stand ready to assist them however we can.

Mr. THURMOND. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Military Health Care Fairness Act. A companion measure, H.R. 3613, was recently introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman J.C. Watts and 38 cosponsors. I am pleased to have Senator Coverdell as an original cosponsor of this measure. 
Mr. President, this bill allows those military retirees over the age of sixty-five to sign up for the Federal Employees Health Benefits program (FEHBP) so that they may have another option for health care coverage. It is estimated that approximately 1.3 million retirees, dependents, and survivors meet this criteria. However, it is doubtful that all of them will sign up for the FEHBP. 
The recent base closures and realignments have limited the number of places where some retirees can receive health care. By joining the FEHBP, health care choices will increase. The FEHBP will probably be desirable to those retirees that do not have prescription drug plans or want to limit catastrophic out-of-pocket cost. Further, the retiree is not excluded from using the traditional military medical treatment facilities on a space available basis. When a retiree, under the FEHBP, uses a military facility, the health care plan reimburses the military for the cost of treatment. 
Mr. President, during the first year of this program the costs will be capped at $100 million. This amount increases $100 million per year for five years to cap the costs at $500 million per year. The costs to the individual should be the same as to any other federal employee in a given geographical area. In order to determine the actual premiums, the health plans will be required to establish a separate risk pool to determine whether the military group's risk characteristics such as age, gender, and care-use affect the other federal employees' premiums. While I realize that some might say the costs of this measure are high, something must be done to give health care coverage to those retirees that do not have adequate coverage under the current military health care system. The many men and women who have given so much to protect our Country by serving in the military are to be commended for their sacrifices and we should acknowledge this by giving them adequate health care choices.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to address my colleagues on a subject which is of increasing concern to me. I have spent a great deal of time on the floor of the Senate during our consideration of the budget resolution for this fiscal year and the following 5 years. I have listened intently as the Senate has debated taxes, education, child care, Social Security, Medicare and other issues which Senators have raised with respect to this resolution. 
It has been glaringly evident to me, and I suspect to some of my colleagues, that there has been little or no mention of national security issues during this debate. No one has raised the issue of defense spending. Maybe its because defense doesn't rank very high these days in the polls which reflect the concerns of the American people; Or maybe it's because everyone assumes that the defense budget is adequate and there is no reason to debate it. I am concerned first of all because I believe there is clear shortfall between the ambitious foreign policy of this Administration and the resources we are willing to provide for national defense. 
The operational tempo of our military forces is at an all time high. American forces are deployed literally around the globe. The foreign policy of this Administration has raised the number of separate deployments to the highest in our history. Our servicemen and women spend more and more time away from their homes and families on more frequent and extended deployments. As a result, recruiting grows more difficult and retention is becoming an extremely serious problem--especially for pilots. 
We are also beginning to see increasing indicators of readiness problems. Spare parts shortages, increased cannibalization, declining operational readiness rates, cross-decking of critical weapons, equipment and personnel foretell a potential emergence of readiness difficulties that could seriously cripple our military forces in the very near future. The Chiefs of the military services indicate that they are on the margin in readiness and modernization. The Chief of one of our military services has recently stated orally as well as in writing that his budget for fiscal year 1999 is, for the third year in a row, inadequate. 
While, at the present time, the American people may not be expressing concern about threats to our national security or the readiness of our armed forces, we in the Senate are not relieved of our responsibilities to ensure that we have capable, effective military forces ready to defend our nation's vital interests. It is our job in the Congress to examine the readiness and capability of our armed forces and ensure that we have provided adequate resources and guidance to the Secretary of Defense so that he can carry out his mission with respect to our 
national security. I believe, as I have stated so many times on this floor, that nothing that we do here in the Congress is more important than providing for our national security. I intend to continue to make this point whenever I believe that we in the Senate may not be paying enough attention to this most critical issue. 
Mr. President, the Congress has endeavored over the past several years to shore up our defense budgets with annual add-ons. However, reductions in the defense budgets over the last 3 years to pay for Bosnia have denigrated the effect of those congressional plus-ups. Almost half of the $21 billion we added to the defense budgets over the last 3 years which was intended to enhance readiness and modernization was spent instead for operations in Bosnia. With the increased optempo of our buildup in the Persian Gulf, the strain on our military forces and budgets is more and more evident. 
As many of you are aware, we face a potentially serious problem of $3.6 billion resulting from scoring differences between the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget. The chairman of the Budget Committee, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and I were able to work out an amendment to help alleviate this problem. We appreciate the assistance of the chairman of the Budget Committee and trust that in his discussions with the Secretary of Defense, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Congressional Budget Office, he will resolve this problem. It is critical that this problem be resolved. Otherwise, the impact on the defense budget would be devastating to our military forces. 
The Armed Services Committee will begin work on our markup during the Easter recess period. We intend to have our bill on the floor before the Memorial Day recess. Under the budget agreement, the Congress will not be adding funds to the defense budget. I know that the majority of Senators would not support adding funds to the defense budget in violation of the budget agreement. Therefore, we will conduct our markup consistent with the budget agreement. However, I have stated in the past and I say again, I believe that we are not providing adequate funds for defense. It remains my firm belief that we should provide additional funds for our national security.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to legislation that would completely decertify Mexico as being fully cooperative in the war against drugs. 
I certainly agree with the sponsors of this resolution that Mexico is not adequately fulfilling its role in fighting international narcotics trade: they have failed to take serious action against the Juarez, Tijuana, and Sonora Cartels which dominate the drug trade; there has been no substantial progress to prosecute the leaders of major narcotrafficking groups, even those indicted by U.S. prosecutors; the number of heroin, methamphetamine, and ephedrine seizures are down from the 1996 levels; in all of 1997 and thus far in 1998, not one Mexican national has been extradited and surrendered to U.S. custody on drug charges. In addition, corruption within their law enforcement community, government institutions, and criminal justice system is rampant. This is just not acceptable. 
However, Mr. President, if we decertify Mexico, the problem will not go away but will only be exacerbated. The progress that Mexico has made thus far, albeit modest, will come to a standstill. With the assistance of the Department of Defense (DoD), Mexico has countered extensive drug-related official corruption with unprecedented reform efforts, including identifying and punishing corrupt Mexican officials; increased their effectiveness against drug trafficking, significantly disrupting a number of organizations; completely overhauled their counterdrug law enforcement agency; and participated in interdiction and information sharing. 
It is of vital importance that the DoD continue to provide assistance to the Mexican military to combat drugs. If the Senate votes to disapprove the certification of Mexico, the progress that the DoD has made will be seriously undermined. 
As such, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposition to S.J. Res. 42. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

The three items which will receive temporary duty suspensions are certain electrical transformers, loudspeakers not mounted in their enclosures, and parts for loudspeakers. The tariffs on these items are scheduled for elimination in the Information Technology Agreement II that is currently being negotiated in the World Trade Organization.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to support this supplemental request, and urge my colleagues to speed its passage. I want to commend Senator Stevens, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and Senator Inouye, the ranking member, on this supplemental. It is needed, and the Senate should act on it quickly. 
The Chiefs of our Military Services have testified that without swift approval of this defense supplemental request, they are concerned there will be significant impacts to the readiness and quality of life of our armed forces. The Defense Department has already paid $9 billion for operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf over the past three years and is currently paying the bills for these unbudgeted operations this year, while attempting to maintain already constrained programs for readiness, modernization, and quality of life programs in this year's defense budget. 
I agree with Senator Stevens, chairman of the Appropriations Committee that the defense budget should not be offset to pay for these operations. I understand that the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici also agrees that the defense budget should not be offset to pay for these unbudgeted operations. The defense budget has been steadily reduced over the last fifteen years and is at its lowest point since 1956, while at the same time our military forces are being called on to respond to an unprecedented number of deployments. Contingency and ongoing operations are draining needed resources for current readiness and the future modernization of our military forces. The cost of these operations in fiscal year 1998 alone is expected to reach more than $4.3 billion. We must not allow the costs of these unbudgeted operations to adversely affect the future modernization, current readiness, or quality of life of our military forces. 
Mr. President, I know that there are Senators who do not support the open-end commitment of our troops in Bosnia, which the President has requested. I have some concerns about that commitment myself. However, I suggest to those Senators who are absolutely opposed to our continuing commitment in Bosnia to consider legislation limiting or terminating our role there--and insist on a vote on such legislation. This approach, it seems to me is far more appropriate than proposing that we continue to pay for Bosnia--and the Persian Gulf operations as well--from already scarce resources in the defense budget--which further weakens the readiness of our forces and delays or terminates critically needed modernization and quality of life programs. 
I urge my colleagues to support the quick passage of this much needed defense supplemental request and not require offsets from the defense budget. Continuing the practice of requiring offsets will undermine the capability of our armed forces, many of whom are forward deployed now protecting our national security interests. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. 
Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address a serious, ongoing problem between the Executive and Legislative branches of our government. I am pleased to do so on behalf of myself and our distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott. 
The issue is the advice and consent role of the Senate under the Constitution, and the failure of the Administration to properly respect this authority in Presidential appointments. Too often, when an official holding an advice and consent position leaves the Administration, the President or lesser officials will appoint someone to serve in the vacancy on an acting basis for a long period of time without submitting a nomination to the Senate. The Administration routinely disregards the advice and consent role of the Senate in this manner. 
The Framers of the Constitution surely would not be pleased. The Appointments Clause of Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution is one of the fundamental checks and balances included within our great system of government. As Justice Scalia stated for the Supreme Court last year, `[T]he Appointments Clause . . . is more than a matter of etiquette or protocol; it is among the significant structural safeguards of the constitutional scheme.' 
The Congress has long recognized the danger of the Executive Branch ignoring its role. The Vacancies Act was enacted to prevent this problem, and it has existed with few revisions since at least 1868. The Act sets forth limitations on acting appointments. It sets forth a logical procedure whereby the first assistant or another confirmed appointee takes over until a new nominee is confirmed. Importantly, it limits the time this acting person may serve to 120 days unless the President has submitted a nomination to the Senate. 
There are two problems with the Vacancies Act today. The first is that it is being ignored. The second is that there is no enforcement mechanism to prevent the Administration from ignoring it. 
Today, vacancies in advice and consent positions are a serious problem in this Administration, and many of the people who are serving in these positions in an acting capacity are doing so in violation of the Vacancies Act. Consider the Department of Justice. The President has just nominated someone to head the Criminal Division. That position has been vacant since August 31, 1995, which is for two and one-half years. Also, when the Solicitor General left in June 1996, Walter Dellinger was made Acting Solicitor General without any effort to seek Senate confirmation. He then served for an entire term of the Supreme Court before the President nominated the current Solicitor General. 
The issue that has pushed the Vacancies Act into the headlines in recent months is the President's designation of Bill Lann Lee to serve as chief of the Civil Rights Division in an acting capacity. After allowing the position to remain vacant for six months, which itself violated the Act, the President nominated Mr. Lee. The Judiciary Committee could not support sending his nomination to the Senate floor. However, rather than sending a new, consensus candidate for confirmation, the President blatantly circumvented the confirmation process by appointing Mr. Lee in an acting capacity. 
I believe it is essential that the Senate act to stop the ongoing abuse of its confirmation role. Today, I am introducing the Vacancies Clarification Act of 1998 to help preserve our role by addressing two primary problems with the Act today: its alleged coverage and its enforcement. 
The Administration has an explanation for ignoring the Vacancies Act. The Department of Justice says the Act does not apply to it because of the administrative authorizing statutes that reorganized the Department in the 1950s. In my view, this argument has no merit. These statutes make no mention of vacancies and were certainly never intended to cover what the Vacancies Act already clearly covered. The most obvious flaw in Justice's argument is that all Executive departments have similar authorizing statutes. Therefore, if Justice is not bound by the Act, the other departments are equally free to ignore it, as many of them do. To address this, I propose that the Vacancies Act provide that it is applicable to all advise and consent appointments, unless a different statute provides that the Act is not applicable to a particular position. 
The second problem is that the Vacancies Act has no enforcement mechanism. There is no way to force the Administration to comply except to retaliate against it or to sue in court. Thus, I propose that any person who serves in violation of the Vacancies Act may not be paid while they are in violation of the law. This would be a simple but effective way to bring the Administration into compliance. 
My bill accomplishes these objectives by rewriting the Vacancies Act. The current language is somewhat intricate and dated. After all, the Act has existed with few revisions since 1868. Thus, I have attempted to rewrite the statute as it currently exists but in language that makes its requirements and exceptions as clear as possible. Hopefully, this will close any loopholes that lawyers have created in the words of the Act in its current form. 
It is my hope that this bill can serve as a starting point for bipartisan discussions on reform in this area. It is possible that the Administration may raise legitimate concerns with some of the requirements in the current law, such as that the 120 day period to submit a nomination is not enough time. This is an issue that could be discussed in hearings. 
Indeed, I am very pleased that the Governmental Affairs Committee has scheduled a hearing on the Vacancies Act this week. It is important that the Senate study this matter and address the flaws in the current process. 
Madam President, this is a matter of great Constitutional significance. We cannot allow the Administration to continue to disregard the advise and consent role of the Senate. By revitalizing the Vacancies Act, we can require the Administration to respect the Senate's Constitutional duty.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Mr. Chafee, the ranking member, Mr. Baucus, and the Chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, Mr. Warner, for their skill and their hard work in moving this important legislation through the Senate. 
Senator Chafee has been most courteous in his willingness to listen to the concerns of the donor states during the course of this debate. His efforts to assist us are sincerely appreciated. Mr. Warner introduced the original bill that would ensure that donor states are protected from the devastating rates of return on their allocations that some of us have seen in the past. His determination and his diligence in this have also been noticed and are appreciated. 
I will vote for this measure, but I do so reluctantly. The reason for my dissatisfaction is that under it, South Carolina remains a donor State and would receive only about 90% of its share of contributions back from the program. Many of my colleagues may wonder at the intensity with which we who represent so-called `donor states' approach this issue. South Carolina has sent, every year since the program began in 1956, more money to fund the highway needs of other states than have been sent back to us. The total loss, in the case of South Carolina, now stands at over $1 billion and will continue to rise. At first, this disparity was justifiable to build the Interstate Highway System across the nation, and our constituents accepted this willingly. There was always the expectation that when this good purpose was acheived, we would then be assisted with our own road needs. After all, we had to postpone tending to our own infrastructure while the Federal Government used the gasoline tax for priorities elsewhere. 
However, every six years, with each subsequent highway bill, new justifications are brought forth as to why the needs of other states are greater than ours. Those justifications range from air pollution and aged infrastructure in the Northeast to the completion of the Appalachian Highway System. South Carolina has some roads in the Appalachian Highway System, but we do not consider those roads to be any more or less a priority over needs of others in the rest of our State simply because of that status. We never seem to receive the consideration we deserve. 
All that we ask is that the system be fair. As it happens, not only is fairness in returning to States the same percent as they put into the fund the right thing to do, it is the most efficient system for financing our infrastructure. My colleagues may remember that in the ISTEA bill of 1991, we requested a study by the General Accounting Office on how we should distribute highway funds. The GAO issued that report in November 1995. Its major conclusion was that the amount of gas taxes paid locally is one of the most accurate indicators of where transportation is needed. This makes sense, of course. People should be able to expect the tax they pay to go to maintain the roads they are driving on. Unfortunately, this sensible proposal has been ignored and funds under this bill would be distributed for various political reasons and, apparently, for the main reason that this is the way we have always done it. 
I support this bill as a first step in finally achieving fairness. It is my hope that our colleagues in the House and our colleagues who will sit on the Conference Committee can achieve greater equity.

The men and women who comprise the citizen-soldiers of the Army Reserve, and all our reserve forces, can take great pride in the tradition of service and excellence they have established from the wooded battlefields of World War II to the sands of the Persian Gulf. 
One organization that has worked tireless to promote not only the Reserve forces of all the services, but the security of the United States is the Reserve Officers Association. Located just across the street from the United States Capitol, this association has been one of the leading advocates for an effective and responsible national security policy for the past three-quarters of a century.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 3 p.m. by previous consent. At 3 p.m. the Senate will begin debate on the campaign reform bill. As previously announced, no rollcall votes will occur during today's session of the Senate. However, Members should be prepared for votes during Tuesday's session of the Senate. Also, by previous consent, on Wednesday, February 25, at 11:30 a.m., the Senate will proceed to the consideration of the veto message to accompany H.R. 2631, the military construction appropriations bill, with 2 hours of debate in order and a vote occurring on the veto message upon the expiration or yielding back of that time. However, our former colleague, Senator Ribicoff, passed away, and it is my understanding that a few of our colleagues intend to attend his funeral on Wednesday morning in New York. Therefore, I now anticipate the vote with respect to the veto message to occur at approximately 3 p.m. We will notify all Members as to the votes on Wednesday, February 25, after consultation with the minority leader. 
As Members are now aware, there are a number of important issues that we hope the Senate will be able to address prior to the Easter recess. Therefore, all Members' cooperation is appreciated on the scheduling of votes and floor action.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of great international concern. Since February 1997, when Scottish scientists succeeded in cloning an adult sheep, the world has been consumed with the issue of cloning. There are great social and ethical implications of the potential application of this procedure to totally reproduce human beings. Obviously, there is no acceptable justification for replicating another human being, and the bill before the Senate, S. 1601, the Human Cloning Prohibition Act, would ensure that such a procedure would never take place in this country. However, I am concerned that this bill may be written so broadly that it will restrict future promising research which could lead to improved treatment or even a cure for many serious illnesses. The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation informs me that this bill would prohibit promising stem cell research that could make it possible to produce pancreatic beta cells that could then be transplanted into a person with diabetes. As a consequence, many of the horrible complications of this disease, including kidney failure, blindness, amputation, increased risk of heart disease and stroke, and premature death, could be eliminated. Likewise, I am informed by other representatives of the medical community that this bill could prohibit research into treatment of the following diseases and ailments: leukemia; sickle cell anemia; Alzheimers disease; Parkinson's disease; multiple sclerosis; spinal cord injuries; liver disease; severe burns; muscular dystrophy; arthritis; and heart disease. 
Mr. President, there have been no committee hearings on S. 1601 and, therefore, no opportunity for the medical community to fully explain the implications of this legislation. My daughter, Julie, suffers from diabetes, and I do not want her, or others like her, to be denied the potential life saving benefits of research that this bill could restrict. But without the appropriate committee hearings, we do not fully understand what these benefits may be. This is far too important an issue for us to rush this bill to the floor without committee hearings. While we can all agree that to replicate a human being is immoral, we need to investigate this issue more thoroughly so that we do not deny our citizens and our loved ones of any possible life saving research. For this reason, I will not support cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 1601, and I strongly recommend that this bill be sent to committee so that the appropriate hearings can be held. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the nomination of Frederica Massiah-Jackson for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. I opposed this nominee in Committee, and nothing has changed in the interim to make me any more likely to support her. 
I believe that the President is entitled to some deference in his choice of judges for the Federal Bench, and I try to give his nominees the benefit of the doubt. However, because of Judge Massiah-Jackson's judicial temperament and record of leniency toward criminal defendants, I cannot support her nomination. 
Judicial temperament is an essential quality for judges. They must be professional, civil, and fair. To earn esteem and honor, they must exhibit dignity and be respectful of those who appear before them. 
Unfortunately, Judge Massiah-Jackson has shown a lack of judicial temperament while serving on the Pennsylvania trial court. She has used profane language from the Bench, which I will not repeat here. There is simply no excuse for a judge to use profanity in court. 
Also, we have received numerous letters from bipartisan professionals to the effect that she is hostile and unfair toward prosecutors and police officers. The Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association, which unanimously voted to oppose her nomination, wrote that she has `an anti-police, anti-prosecution bias' and that her actions as a trial judge `at times . . . have bordered on the outrageous.' The Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Michael Fisher, has weighed in against her. The National Fraternal Order of Police wrote that she `has made a career of dismissing out of hand testimony by police officers, treating them as second-class citizens.' The Philadelphia FOP echoed this criticism, saying that her actions `make it appear she is on a crusade against public safety.' The Philadelphia District Attorney, Lynne Abraham, whose office prosecutes criminal cases within Philadelphia where Judge Massiah-Jackson has served as a judge, was resolute. She wrote that the `nominee's record represents multiple instances of a deeply ingrained and pervasive bias against prosecutors and law enforcement officers, and by extension, an insensitivity to victims of crime. The nominee's judicial demeanor and courtroom conduct . . . undermine respect for the rule of law and . . . tend to bring the law into disrepute.' She then compared this judge to others stating, `This nominee's judicial service is replete with instances of demonstrated leniency toward criminals, an adversarial attitude towards police, and disrespect and a hostile attitude towards prosecutors unmatched by any other present or former jurist with whom I am familiar.' 
An example of the judge's hostility toward police that has created much attention is an incident where she pointed out two undercover narcotics agents and told those in her courtroom to take a good look at the officers and, quote, `watch yourselves.' This story was published in a Pennsylvania newspaper, and I asked her about it in writing during the hearing process, which gave her plenty of time to reflect on the matter. She responded, `I have read the 1988 article and it is inaccurate. I would not and did not make any such statement to the spectators.' However, the two undercover agents that the article referred to later signed statements saying she had singled them out and referred to them in this manner. 
She has also made public comments about crime that warrant concern. Although she informed me in response to a written question that she is not opposed to imposing the death penalty, she was very critical of the death penalty in a 1994 speech. Quoting Justice Harry Blackman, she said, `the death penalty experiment has failed.' She added, `It is not a deterrent to criminal behavior.' Later in the speech she said, `Locking folks up is a belated and expensive response to a social crisis.' 
It is very unusual for us to receive opposition to a nominee for the Federal Court from prosecutors and professionals as we have here. I commend the prosecutors and police who have taken this bold stand. They have brought a great deal of attention to a nominee who is simply not fit to serve on the Federal court. 
The public opposition to this nominee from prosecutors and police, in addition to the information we had at the time she was considered in Committee, should be more than enough for Senators to oppose her. It should not even be necessary to consider cases and statistics that have been brought to our attention in the past few weeks. 
Let me close by referring again to the letter from the Fraternal Order of Police. I quote, `To confirm Judge Messiah-Jackson would be an affront to every law enforcement officer and prosecutor in the Nation. . . . We shouldn't have to have the judges and the criminals against us.' 
Mr. President, I agree. I will stand with prosecutors and police on this nomination.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize former Navy and Marine Corps members who received the Distinguished Flying Cross in accordance with section 573 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, which waived time limitations for award of this decoration for specified persons. These awards were recommended by the Secretary of the Navy based upon requests from Members of Congress. These procedures were established by section 526 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 to resolve a dilemma under which deserving individuals were denied the recognition they deserved solely due to the passage of time. I am proud to have established a procedure that enables these distinguished veterans to receive the honors they earned. We are very proud of their dedicated service to our Nation.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise as an original cosponsor of a proposed constitutional amendment prohibiting the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. 
I have fought to achieve Constitutional protection for the flag ever since the Supreme Court first legitimized flag burning in the case of Texas v. Johnson in 1989. To date, we have not been successful in out efforts to pass a Constitutional amendment by the required two-thirds majority. 
However, we have come close, and, most importantly, we have refused to quit. Last year, the House passed the amendment with the necessary votes, and I am very hopeful that we will follow suit in the Senate this year. 
Some say that burning or defacing the American flag is not widespread enough or important enough for a constitutional amendment. I could not disagree more. 
Since the birth of the Republic, the flag has been our most recognizable and revered symbol of democracy. It represents our Nation, our national ideals, and out proud heritage. 
Men and women of our Armed Forces have put their lives on the line to defend the principles and ideals that the flag represents. Soldiers have risked and even lost their lives to prevent the flag from falling. 
To say that the flag is not important enough to protect is to say that the values that hold us together as a Nation are not worth defending. 
Flag burning may be rare, but even it is, it is not acceptable--I repeat, it is not acceptable. It is not tolerable. I hate to see anyone burn or deface the flag to make some statement. Why should society let even one person wrap themselves around some absolute interpretation of the First Amendment to protect indefensible speech? Have we focused so much on the rights of the individual that we have forgotten the rights of the people? 
It is clear that the American public strongly favors this amendment. Opinion polls register overwhelming support. Every state except one has passed resolutions calling for a Constitutional amendment to protect the flag. It is a feeling of great pride to know of the sincere national patriotism that this support represents. 
The House has already acted. It is now our turn in the Senate. We have a profound responsibility to pass this constitutional amendment as quickly as possible so that it can go to the States for ratification. 
I urge my colleagues in the strongest terms to join us in this great effort to restore protection for the American flag. The flag of the United States, the symbol of freedom and democracy, must always be protected, and forever wave over the land of the free and the home of the brave.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man a number of us, especially those who are members of the Armed Services Committee, have come to know over the past several years, Captain John Lynch who retired from the United States Navy during the Christmas Recess. 
There are few careers more demanding or rewarding than those in our armed forces, and in, 1972, John Lynch joined the Navy. Despite Richard Nixon's overwhelming re-election to the Presidency, this was a tension charged era in our Nation, we were in the waning days of our involvement in Vietnam and most young people were seeking ways to avoid military service. Few people were actually entering the armed services on their own volition, but John was an exception, and his spirit of patriotism and selflessness would serve him well throughout his career. In 1974, a young John Lynch donned cap and gown and accepted his bachelor's degree in Industrial Education and earned a commission as an Ensign. Leaving the comfortable and familiar campus of The College of New Jersey, he headed south to the hot, humid weather of the Florida panhandle and the vocal, uncompromising, and unforgiving Marine Corps Drill Instructors who put the aviation candidates through their paces and initiated them into the life of the military. 
By the time then Ensign Lynch graduated from flight school, Vietnamization was fully in place and responsibility for prosecuting the war was squarely on the shoulders of the Republic of Vietnam. Though American military personnel were no longer involved in a `shooting war', the United States was certainly locked into a tense, dangerous, and sometimes deadly Cold War with communist nations. During this period in our history, the United States and, primarily, the former Soviet Union stared at each other over fortified borders, and tested each other's defenses and military capabilities. Certainly one key element in how this Cold War was prosecuted was anti-submarine warfare, where American and Soviet submariners shadowed and evaded each other and the ships and aircraft that tried to detect and monitor their activities. It was as a part of this nuclear weapons cat and mouse game that John Lynch cut his teeth as a young Naval officer and aviator, flying operations looking for Soviet submarines. 
As many will remember, the Cold War would heat up from time to time, and there was a period in the 1980's when events in the Middle East forced the United States to use force to protect our citizens, interests, and security. Inflammatory and hateful rhetoric espoused by radical leaders, coupled with things such as the infamous `Line of Death', the bombing of the Marine Barracks in Beirut, and a campaign of terror directed at the United States and her allies that brought American military assets to bear in the Mediterranean, and John Lynch was among those deployed to that region. As a matter of fact, as the Officer in Charge of the Navy's first dual SH-60B helicopter detachment aboard the U.S.S. Halyburton as it conducted operations off the coast of Libya, John logged nine combat flights in support of the fleet. Those experiences demonstrated the competence, composure, and courage of John Lynch, the essential qualities of any successful leader, whether he or she be in the military, the government, or the private sector. They certainly benefitted him, and those who served under him in HSL-42, during Operation Desert Shield/Storm. 
Of course, Captain Lynch's career was not all dangerous missions flown in the cramped cockpit of Navy helicopters, throughout his 24-years in the service, he held a number of different assignments that promoted Naval rotor wing aviation, including at IBM; Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego; Naval Aide and Flag Secretary at Naval Air Station Jacksonville; and on the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations for Surface Warfare. He earned a Master's Degree from the University of Southern California while he was stationed in San Diego. He also participated in the LEGIS Fellows Program, serving as a Military Legislative Assistant to my friend, United States Representative Tillie Fowler. 
It was during his almost three year tenure as Director of Senate Affairs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense that we came to know John Lynch. In that position, the Captain was responsible for being the liaison between the Department of Defense and all Senators and their staffers, though his primarily interaction was with the members and staff of the Armed Services Committee. A gregarious and competent man, Captain Lynch was an excellent representative of the Secretary of Defense who rendered an important service, helped facilitate positive relations between the Pentagon and the Senate, and made certain that the positions of the Secretary of Defense and the Executive Branch were well represented. He was unquestionably professional and accommodating and he set an excellent example for all those who worked for him in the Office of Senate Affairs, as well as for his successor. 
After more than 20 years in service to the Navy and the Nation, it must be difficult for Captain Lynch to begin a new career, but he can look back on his time as a Naval Officer and take great satisfaction and pride in a job well done. His efforts helped to assure that the United States and her citizens were well protected, and I know Captain Lynch must be proud that his eldest son, Shaun, has chosen to follow in his father's public spirited footsteps by attending the Naval Academy and serving the Nation. I wish John Lynch, his wife Linda, son Shaun, and daughters Laurne and Kelly health, happiness, and success in the years to come.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to address the comments made by James R. Schlesinger, the former Secretary of Defense, Secretary of Energy, and Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, in his appearance last week before the Committee on Armed Services. The purpose of the hearing was to review the Quadrennial Defense Review of the Department of Defense, and the report of the National Defense Panel, in order to determine what measures are necessary to ensure our national security establishment is able to meet the threats of today and tomorrow. 
The testimony provided by Secretary Schlesinger was very sobering in that he provided the Committee with a clear picture of the crisis we are facing due to the imbalance between our foreign policy commitments and the diminished capabilities of our Armed Forces. In his own words, `By early in the next century, at the latest, we shall be obligated to spend far greater sums on procurement. Alternatively, we can watch the force structure itself age and erode--until it will no longer be capable of sustaining the ambitious foreign policy that we have embraced.' 
Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the entire Senate was not able to attend last week's hearing and discuss the problems outlined by Secretary Schlesinger. I believe it is important, especially at a time when the U.S. military may once again be called upon to protect our interests in the Persian Gulf, for all of the members to fully understand the extent to which our military capability has diminished in recent years, and the impact this will have upon our ability to pursue an aggressive foreign policy.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to advise Members of the Senate why I have objected to the Senate consideration of H.R. 2513. This bill, which was sent by the House to the Senate in the closing days of this session, would provide tax relief for certain matters involving active financing income from foreign personal holding company income and sale of stock in agricultural processors to certain farmers' cooperatives. 
First of all, Mr. President, I have no objection to the provisions which provide tax relief in these matters. However, I do object to the manner in which the House has proposed that we pay for these tax reductions. The use of sales of defense stockpiles to finance these tax relief measures is, in my opinion, inappropriate and inconsistent with section 311 of the Budget Act. 
While I am removing my objection to the consideration of H.R. 2513, I want to make clear to Members in both the Senate and the House that I do not consider that a precedent is being established for using defense assets as offsets for non-defense-related expenditures. I want to make it clear also that I intend to object to any similar tax relief legislation which is paid for in such a manner in the future. 
As the majority leader moves to close out the remaining business so that the Senate can adjourn, I want to take this opportunity to commend him for his superb leadership and the outstanding manner in which he has managed the Senate's business as the majority leader. I look forward to continuing to work with him in the future.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am saddened to report the passing of a longtime friend, a man of integrity and honor, and someone who was well respected throughout the United States, Dr. Bob Jones, Jr. 
Dr. Jones was the chancellor and chairman of the fundamentalist Christian Bob Jones University, which was founded by his father in 1927 and moved to South Carolina in 1947. Students who attend this institution learn the fundamentals of Christianity while gaining a valuable education that will prepare them for their future. The university's talented and devoted staff of educators make many contributions to the world through their service to the community and their dedication to teaching others the truths of the Bible. Graduates of Bob Jones University are employed throughout the Nation in many different fields, but each possesses the qualities and values of a good Christian upbringing, and are sound in both mind and body. 
In addition to his service at the university, Dr. Jones was a well respected preacher and Christian leader throughout the Nation. Addressing crowds at church services, conferences, and meetings around the world, he was often touted as an evangelical leader who gained an unequaled respect and admiration from those who had the privilege of hearing him speak. Words cannot possibly express the degree of his devotion to the Christian faith, his community, family, and friends. His death has left a large void that will serve to remind us of the great impact he had upon each of these. Dr. Jones was a dear friend of mine, and I feel a deep loss in his death, as do so many throughout our Nation. 
His family, which includes his wife, Fannie May Holmes Jones; his three children; 10 grandchildren; and his three great-grandchildren, all have my deepest sympathies. They have lost a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, and South Carolina has lost an irreplaceable son.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we come to the end of the session, I want to say that the Senate could not run without competent people. We have been fortunate to have an outstanding majority leader in Senator Lott, who is a man of integrity, ability, and dedication, and an outstanding man in the minority leader, too, Senator Daschle. Both of them have performed outstanding service to their country and this body. I predict that, someday, Senator Lott may become our President. I also want to thank our leadership, including Senators Nickles, Craig, Mack, Coverdell, and McConnell, all who have cooperated and worked together to bring about the results that we have obtained. 
Now, Mr. President, I want to compliment some other people, too, and I will read their names: Elizabeth Greene, David Schiappa, Greer Amburn, of the Republican floor staff; the Democratic floor staff, Lula Davis and Marty Paone; the cloakroom staff, Brad Holsclaw, Laura Martin, Tripp Baird, and Mike Smythers. 
I also want to thank the Secretary of the Senate, Gary Sisco; the Sergeant at Arms, Greg Casey; the Senate Chaplain, Lloyd J. Ogilvie; the clerks of the Senate; the Senate Parliamentarians, the Official Reporters of the Senate, and the Senate Pages, who have all contributed to make this a successful session. We are very proud to commend them for their outstanding work. 
At the close of the session, I want to say that a lot has been done here. In years to come, people can look back and say that the 105th session of Congress accomplished a great deal. It is because of these leaders here and their staffs who worked hard. We could not run this place without these competent staff members. I am very proud of all of them. 
Mr. President, in closing, I want to say that it has been a pleasure to work with all these people, the Senators and the staffs. As the holiday season approaches, I wish them all a happy Thanksgiving and a merry Christmas. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the conference report for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 is before the Senate now. This is an important component of the national security legislation that the Congress must pass each year. 
The Armed Services Committee worked hard this year to produce a bill that will authorize the appropriation of $268.2 billion for procurement, research and development, test and evaluation, operation and maintenance, working capital funds, military personnel, military construction and family housing within the Department of Defense, and for the weapons programs of the Department of Energy and the civil defense. This is an important piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, there are some Senators who will suggest that the Senate should reject this bill in order to protect interests in their States. This is a very large bill with over 600 legislative provisions. The conference report is nearly a thousand pages. In order to reach agreement on a bill of this magnitude, a lot of compromise is required. The conference report includes many programs and policies essential to the Department of Defense and the Nation. However, not everyone got everything that they wanted. As the committee prepared for our markup, we received letters of request from 99 Senators. The committee tried to accommodate as many of these requests as possible, consistent with our national security needs. Mr. President, neither South Carolina nor Michigan got everything Senator Levin and I wanted for our States. 
Defeating the Defense authorization bill because three or four Senators did not get everything they wanted would be the ultimate in partisanship over statesmanship. Let me explain what the Nation would lose if there is no Defense authorization bill this year. 
I believe the single most controversial issue in the conference report is the policy with regard to depots. In the area of privatization, the bill includes an important compromise that provides for open competition for the work at the closing depots at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases. If the bill is not enacted, the opportunity to support full and open competition and to resolve a longstanding and very contentious issue will be lost. The bill would also change the current 60-40 public/private split in The Department of Defense depot maintenance to 50-50, giving The Department of Defense greater flexibility to achieve an optimal mix of public and private capabilities. 
Mr. President, negotiating the compromise on the depot issue was a difficult and complex three-way negotiation. Senator Levin and I worked together in a totally bipartisan manner to ensure a fair resolution that provided for fair and open competition. We are in total agreement on the compromise. I want to commend Senator Levin, and members of his staff, for their tireless efforts and cooperation in achieving this compromise. 
I know that some Senators believe that they should have gotten more, but there are equally as many Senators from States on the other side of the issue who believe they gave up a great deal more. I hope that we agree that open competition will be in the best interests of the public and private sector and the Nation. Secretary Cohen has indicated that he can support the depot compromise. I urge my colleagues to put parochial interests aside and work with us to implement this compromise successfully. 
Mr. President, I could talk for hours about the important legislative provisions that the Department of Defense and our service men and women will be denied if we permit this conference report to be defeated. I will spare my colleagues that recitation, but I do want to highlight some of what we will lose. 
Without the Defense authorization bill, the military pay raise will be less than our service members deserve. The bill includes a 2.8-percent pay raise for military personnel. If the bill is not enacted, the pay raise for military personnel will be limited to 2.3 percent. Federal civilians will receive at least a 2.8-percent pay increase while our military personnel on duty throughout the world will receive a pay raise 1 percent below the inflation rate. Denying military personnel what I would describe as a minimal pay raise is shameful. 
The bill includes authority for significant increases in the special pay and bonus structure designed to respond to critical recruiting and retention problems highlighted by the Department of Defense. Specific groups that would be affected include military aviators, nuclear-qualified officers, dentists, military members on overseas tours, military members receiving family separation allowances and/or hazardous duty assignment pay, and military members serving in 
hardship duty locations. Reducing military pay raises while failing to increase these bonuses through defeast of the Defense authorization bill will punish those who expect us here in the Congress to look out for them. We will be repudiating the commitments we have made to improving the quality of life for military personnel and their families. 
Mr. President, I assure my colleagues that, unless this bill is passed, we will see increases in career personnel leaving the military services. They will see our action as a breach of faith and I cannot blame them. 
The bill provides authority for the Department of Defense to begin construction on the fiscal year 1998 military construction projects including quality of life and training-related facilities. If the bill is not enacted, construction cannot begin. Some may believe that since the military construction and family housing projects are funded in the Military Construction Appropriations Act, they do not need the authorization in the conference report. Let me assure my colleagues that is not correct. Both an authorization and an appropriation are required for military construction projects. 
The conference report includes an exception to the cost limitation for one Seawolf submarine. Without this legislation, the Navy will have to stop work on the SSN-23 later this calendar year. This could lead to significant payments to the shipyard and people who work on the Seawolf Submarines and those who supply materials for the submarines will be laid off. Not only does the Nation need the capabilities of these advanced submarines, the employees and the communities in which these people live will be tragically affected. We cannot allow this to happen. 
In the conference report, we re-authorized the acclaimed National Guard Youth Challenge Program. The bill would make permanent the authority for this important and popular community and youth-oriented program. If the bill is not enacted, the Department of Defense must terminate support for this popular program. Many disadvantaged youth in all our States will be denied the opportunities this worthwhile program provides. 
The President, and most of us here in Congress, strongly profess our support for counterdrug activities. The bill includes provisions that would extend the 1-year authority to provide counterdrug assistance to Mexico and would create a new 5-year authority to provide riverine counterdrug assistance to Colombia and Peru. 
The bill would establish two new assistants to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, representing the interests of the National Guard and the Reserves. This is important legislation designed to ensure that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has the benefit of the best advice with regard to all the reserve forces, in particular as it pertains to their unique capabilities and requirements. 
Mr. President, I could go on for hours on the good things in this bill. Some may propose stripping out some of the provisions I have discussed today and introducing separate legislation in order to avoid denying our service members key benefits. This is a shortsighted and unacceptable notion. The conferees worked very hard for many weeks to craft a bill that includes those items they agree are essential to the national security. To fracture this process would be irresponsible. Those who may propose such legislation will be trying to take care of a few at the expense of many. This is not our way. I will strongly object to any such proposals. 
Mr. President, suggestions to defeat the Defense authorization conference report because of the compromise on depot maintenance are irresponsible. This bill is important to the young men and women who serve in our military forces. The bill includes pay raises and increases to special incentive pay, including vital aviator bonuses. Provisions in this bill affect every aspect of our national defense including quality of life initiatives, modernization, and readiness. I remind all Senators that all military construction projects require an authorization as well as an appropriation and cannot be executed without this bill.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the House of Representatives has already passed this bill by a veto-proof majority of 286 to 123. The leaders of the Defense Department have indicated that they can make this compromise work and that they need this bill passed. It is hard for me to believe that any Senator would oppose the entire Defense authorization bill at a time when American troops are deployed in Bosnia and serious trouble appears to be brewing again in Iraq. 
I strongly encourage all Senators to vote for this bill. We must send a strong signal to the White House to demonstrate to the President that this bill which is so important to our national security should be signed. We must show the young men and women in uniform serving our Nation around the world, men and women many of whom will spend yet another Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season away from home in service to their Nation, that we are strongly behind them. 
Mr. President, I might add that the conference report is the outcome of a great deal of hard work by Members and staff. I want to especially thank staff on both sides for all that they did to promote this bill. I am confident that without their good work we couldn't have brought to the floor such an outstanding bill. I want to commend Les Brownlee and David Lyles for the excellent work, and other members of the staff who cooperated with them. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky is correct in his interpretation of section 359. First, under the exception contained in new section 2469a(c)(3), these competition requirements do not apply to any contract originally entered into before the date of enactment of the conference bill. Second, under new section 2469a(b), these requirements apply only to workloads that are currently proposed to be converted from performance by DOD personnel to performance by a private sector source for the first time, not to work that has already been converted to performance by a private sector source. For these reasons, the competition requirements in section 359 would not apply to workloads that have already been converted to private sector performance at Louisville or any other similarly situated facility.

Mr. THURMOND. I would be happy to clarify what the conference agreement requires. First of all let me just say that this language does not require the Department of Defense to withdraw depot maintenance workloads from the private sector and perform the work in public depots in order to achieve efficiency. As the statement of managers indicates, it simply requires the Secretary to assign sufficient workload to these facilities to ensure that they are operated as cost efficiently as possible. The report clearly states: 
The provision does not require that maintenance for all weapon systems necessary for the execution of DOD strategic and contingency plans be performed at public facilities. Rather, it requires that the capability to perform maintenance and repair on these systems be retained in the public depot activities and that these activities be assigned sufficient workload to ensure that they are operated as cost efficiently as possible while preserving sufficient surge capacity to support the strategic and contingency plans of the U.S. Armed Forces.

<DOCNO>105-thurmond-sc-12-19971106</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. THURMOND. Absolutely not. The language specifically requires that the public depots retain a surge capacity and reconstitution capability necessary to support any strategic or contingency operations identified by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The requirement for a surge capacity for military emergencies by definition requires less than full utilization of the physical capacity during peacetime.

<TEXT>
Mr. THURMOND. I agree. The Department of Defense maintains a peacetime work force at these depots that can be supplemented with additional personnel 
if they are necessary. Ensuring efficiency while retaining surge capacity and reconstitution capability is accomplished under current policy by having the right number of personnel to perform peacetime workloads and simply adding the necessary personnel, or workshifts, to provide a sufficient surge capacity to support any contingency or strategic operations. In fact, when we drafted this language, we asked the Department of Defense to review it and let us know if the Department had any concerns, or if this did not reflect the Department's current policy. We made a number of changes to address the Department's written comments.

Mr. THURMOND. Not initially. The Department provided the conferees with two rounds of written comments on the draft compromise language. In neither version did the Department suggest that `promote' be changed to `ensure.' It was only on the day that the conference report was finalized that the Department indicated that the use of the word `ensure' might be interpreted in such a way as to require all logistics workloads to be performed at public depots. We informed the Department that the requirement to ensure efficiency does not mean that all logistics workloads must be performed at public depots, and added language to the statement of managers to reaffirm that point.

Mr. THURMOND. Because the Aviation Insurance Program is so vital to U.S. military missions overseas, we thought it prudent to try to reauthorize it in the defense bill, which is a must pass piece of legislation. The military depends on the airlift capacity that commercial carriers provide. Without an insurance program in place, carriers will be less likely to participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, for one.

When and if S. 1193 or a similar House version is signed into law, its language reauthorizing the Aviation Insurance Program should be controlling. If for some reason that bill is not approved before Congress adjourns for the year, and the defense authorization bill is signed into law, the defense bill provisions will serve to reauthorize the program until action on S. 1193 or a similar House bill is taken.

<TEXT>
Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would just like to take a few moments to address some of the issues that were raised yesterday regarding the compromise depot language included in the conference report on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998. I believe it is important to clarify the issue and ensure that all Members are fully aware of the contents of the compromise language, and the negotiation process that resulted in this language which provides for fair and open competitions. 
First of all, I would like to put to rest one very important allegation--that the committee demonstrated bad faith on this issue--that there was some agreement that was subsequently changed in the dark of night. This allegation is simply not true. Given the unprecedented involvement that was afforded to the Department of Defense and the staff of the concerned delegations; given the efforts that were taken to ensure that all interested parties, including those who were not conferees, were kept fully informed on what was taking place; I reject any assertion that the committee treated any Member unfairly, or disregarded any agreement. 
There was never an agreement on any package prior to October 22, 1997. Proposed agreements drafted by the committee and provided to everyone--depot caucus, Texas and California delegations, and the administration, were either rejected or there was no response. This includes the proposed agreement regarding depot-level activities that was provided for everyone's review and comments on October 17, 1997. 
After talking with the interested parties, both in the administration and Congress, the committee put together the October 17 proposed agreement and submitted it for everyone to review and either accept, or provide input to us regarding those changes that would make this proposal acceptable. After reviewing the language, Senator Bennett and other Members expressed concern regarding the language in the bill that stated: No offeror may be given any preferential consideration for, or in any way be limited to, performing the workload in-place or at any other single location. Appropriate consideration may be given to differences in cost or performance risk associated with the location of performance. 
The concern of these Members was simply with the appearance of the language. After agreeing to give up their position that privatization-in-place must be prohibited, a position very important to these Members and their constituents, they believed that the Congress should at least insist on a clear statement that the administration could not give preferential treatment for privatization-in-place. Therefore, they asked that the second sentence be moved from the bill to report language. 
Mr. President, just to be sure that everyone understands, this language does not state that the Department cannot consider cost or risk. In fact, the bill language still requires the Department to take into account: the total estimated direct and indirect costs that will be incurred by the Department of Defense and the total estimated direct and indirect savings (including overhead) that will be derived by the Department of Defense. 
Furthermore: the report language, which Senator Gramm himself declared has the effect of law, states: The Department would be expected to consider real differences among bidders in cost or capability to perform the work based on factors that would include the proposed location or locations of the workload. The consideration of such differences does not constitute preferential treatment. 
Unfortunately, when the committee scheduled a meeting with the staff of the concerned delegations to discuss this and other proposed changes, the Department of Defense as well as the staff of the Texas delegation refused to participate. 
Taking what input we received from those Members who were able to identify concerns, the committee made a couple of changes to the language that we believed were reasonable. This included moving the bill language discussed above to report language and some changes requested by the Department. 
Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Texas that if the sentence that was moved is technical, is inconsequential, there is no reason why it had to be dropped; other than for the sake of appearance. However, since Senator Bennett and other Members wanted a clear statement that preferential treatment could not be given to a bid solely because the workload would be done in place, and since we could not even discuss this with the other Members because their staff refused to participate in meetings, the language was moved. 
Mr. President, given the administration's past attempt to politicize this process by advocating privatization-in-place, Senator Bennett's concerns appear to have merit. The Congress should be on record stating that the most competitive bidder should do this work wherever they can do it best. That is the only way the American taxpayer, and our military personnel, will receive the best deal. 
Mr. President, I would now like to address the issue of the so-called anticompetitive language that was the point of discussion on the Senate floor earlier this week. The assertion that this language is anticompetitive could not be further from the truth. As many of you know, the original language that was rejected by the Senate contained an effective prohibition on such competitions. This provision is not included in this bill. In fact, this bill specifically authorizes such competitions and merely includes some of the criteria that must be considered in order to ensure that they are fair and open. 
Furthermore, the Department would retain complete flexibility to consider any other criteria that the Department believes necessary to ensure that these competitions are fair. In fact, this provision is very similar to what Senator Gramm advocated when he addressed the depot issue on the floor of the Senate earlier this year and asked for competitions with criteria. 
One of the criteria that the Senator from Texas would like to have changed because he believes it to be anticompetitive, is the clause that would require the Department of Defense to allow public depots and private corporations to form teams to compete for the workloads at Kelly and McClellan. I am not sure why this clause, which opens the competition to more potential bidders, would be viewed as anticompetitive. I see no reason why we should preclude the best team, whether public, private, or public/private, from competing to perform this work and doing it if they have the best proposal. In fact, at a recent hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. F. Whitten Peters, the Principle Deputy General Counsel for the Department of Defense and nominee to be the next Undersecretary of the Air Force, stated that he also did not believe such language to be anticompetitive. If someone truly believes that allowing an organization to compete is anticompetitive, they should explain their position to the Congress and the American people. 
Mr. President, the compromise language also amends the current 60/40 law so that the Department might outsource up to 50 percent of its depot maintenance workload. This will provide substantially more flexibility to the Army and the Navy, and some additional flexibility for the Air Force despite the fact that the compromise would also codify the definition of depot maintenance to include interim contractor support and contractor logistics support. 
Furthermore, the depot compromise codifies the Department's own policy of maintaining, within organic Defense depots, the capability to meet readiness and sustainability requirements of the weapon systems that support the JCS contingency scenarios. This does not require that the Department perform depot maintenance on all mission essential weapon systems in public depots. It simply requires that the Department retain a capability to maintain this equipment should it become necessary. 
The Senator from Texas has expressed some concern regarding the use of the word `ensure' rather than `promote' in this provision. He stated that this was a major concern for the Department of Defense because someone might interpret it in such a way that it would require the Department of Defense to perform all depot 
maintenance in public depots. All I can say is that it would take an extremely creative imagination to give that interpretation to this language. Both `promote' and `ensure' are subjective terms that will be interpreted by the Secretary of Defense. He is not going to interpret `ensure' in the manner feared by Senator Gramm when it is clearly contrary to the intent of the Congress. in fact, when the committee asked the Department to provide in writing any concerns they had regarding this language, the Department did not express any concern regarding the word `ensure' or suggest changing the word `ensure' to `promote.' 
Mr. President, the Senators from Texas and California have asserted that the depot compromise contained in this bill `undercuts the ability of the Secretary of Defense to conduct price competition so that we can have bidding on this work.' However, the compromise language specifically requires the consideration of all costs and savings, and would ensure price competition. Most of the Members involved in this issue have always insisted on price competitions as opposed to schemes which would allow more subjective judgment. 
It is also asserted that this language skews the competitions in favor of public depots because it allows them to hide their overhead costs. There is no clause in the depot compromise that allows the public depots to hide overhead costs. The compromise specifically requires that all costs and savings must be taken into account when considering any bid. 
Concern has been raised that this language would require the Department to procure expensive and unnecessary equipment in order to be able to maintain commercial systems that have been integrated into military equipment. This is false. in fact, the provision requiring the retention of a core capability specifically provides an exemption for commercial items. 
Finally, concern has been raised because there was bill language which the Department did not like that was moved to report language. I believe that this must refer to the report language that simply notes that the Department of Defense has denied the General Accounting Office access to information that the General Accounting Office is entitled to obtain by law. I could understand why this would be objectionable if this were not true. Unfortunately, the Department is refusing to disclose information on the earlier C-5 workload competition so that we can be sure that it was fairly conducted. Perhaps the conferees would not have agreed to include such language if the Department would allow the General Accounting Office access to the information necessary to perform the review requested by the committee. 
Mr. President, this bill contains a fair compromise that was drafted by the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee after consulting with all interested parties; including the administration and the concerned delegations. It is fair to assert that none of the parties involved are completely happy with this compromise language, however, that is what happens when you have to compromise. If we all insisted on getting everything our way, nothing would ever be accomplished by the Congress. 
Mr. President, Senator Levin, the ranking member of our committee, and I worked together in a totally bipartisan manner to achieve this compromise and we both agree that this compromise enables the Department of Defense to conduct fair and open competitions for the workloads currently performed at Kelly and McClellan. During the drafting of this compromise language the Department of Defense, as well as the staff of the concerned delegations, were provided numerous opportunities to review this language and identify their concerns. We made significant changes to this language in order to alleviate many of the concerns they raised. 
Mr. President, as I previously stated, this is a good compromise; a fair compromise. It allows all parties to compete for these workloads in a fair and open manner. I ask the other Members of the Senate to support this compromise, and this bill, by voting in favor of final passage.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we close this debate, I take this opportunity to commend Senator Levin for the magnificent work he has done on this bill. 
He is a man of integrity, ability and dedication. It is a great asset to have him on the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
Mr. President, there are a few obvious reasons for Americans to focus on the defense of the United States. While there is no longer a superpower threatening to dominate us, threats still abound. Events in Iraq this week demonstrate that America must be prepared to protect her interests at a moment's notice. Other nations that might pose threats includes Iran, North Korea, and Libya. 
Mr. President, this bill is important to the young men and women who serve in our military forces. This bill includes pay raises and increases to special incentive pay, including vital aviator bonuses. Provisions in this bill affect every aspect of our national defense, including quality-of-life initiatives, modernization, and readiness. I remind all Senators that all military construction projects require an authorization as well as an appropriation and cannot be executed without this bill. 
Mr. President, I want to remind the Senate that all 18 members of the Armed Services Committee support this bill--10 Republicans and 8 Democrats--every one of them support this bill. The House has already passed this by a veto-proof majority of 286 to 123. The leaders of the Defense Department have indicated that they can make this compromise work and that they need this bill passed. It is hard for me to believe that any Senator would oppose and delay the entire Defense authorization bill at a time when American troops are deployed in Bosnia and serious trouble appears to be brewing again in Iraq. 
I strongly encourage all Senators to vote for this bill. We must send a strong signal to the White House to demonstrate to the President that this bill, which is so important to our national security, should be signed. We must show the young men and women in uniform serving our Nation around the world that their services are appreciated and that we are backing them up. 
Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the Guard and Reserves. The National Guard of South Carolina is a magnificent guard, and we appreciate what they have done. And in the whole Nation, the National Guard is so valuable. I happen to have served in the Reserves myself for over 36 years. I appreciate the reservists and commend all of them for voluntarily serving their country. They have to carry on their civilian duties, but they do this extra work. 
I want to say, too, to the Members of this Senate, that this bill took not days, not weeks, but months. We have spent months on this bill. We have done the best we could. We have a lot of able members on the Armed Services Committee. All of them have worked hard on this bill. It is a compromise bill. I did not have my way on everything. Senator Levin did not have his way on everything. No one did. This is a compromise bill. 
National security was the driving force of this bill. We could not satisfy every Senator. We did the best we could to accommodate all we could. But national security was our driving force when we considered this bill. Again, I ask all Senators to support this bill for the good of the country and to support this bill for the good of our troops and to support this bill, too, for the public good. 
I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights. I have reached this conclusion only after much thought and careful consideration. But I am certain that this is the right course. I commend Senator Hatch for his leadership and the excellent statement he delivered on the floor yesterday in this regard. 
When the possibility that Mr. Lee would be nominated for this position was first brought to my attention, I was impressed by what I heard. Mr. Lee was born to a hard-working, determined family of Chinese immigrants. His success at Yale and Columbia University Law School reflects that he inherited a commitment to succeed. I was also assured then, and continue to believe, that he is a man of character, honesty, and intellect. I relayed that impression to the White House. 
After Mr. Lee was nominated, I met with him and made clear that I had an open mind regarding his nomination. I told him that his positions on the issues would be critical, and that the committee was eager to hear his answers to questions. 
Before the hearing, some expressed alarm at many of the cases and positions that Mr. Lee had taken during his leadership in activist civil rights organizations. They were concerned about whether he would use his job and army of attorneys in the Justice Department to advance the same agenda he had pursued for the Legal Defense Fund. I understood this. But, at the same time, I have known since my days as a small town lawyer that a good attorney is a strong advocate for his client, regardless of whether he agrees with everything the client wants. 
Mr. Lee had an obligation to convince us at the hearing that he could transfer from the role of creative advocate for activist civil rights organizations to neutral and objective enforcer of the Nation's civil rights laws. This he failed to do. He would not give any cases or positions that he had brought on behalf of the Legal Defense Fund that he would not bring as head of the Civil Rights Division. He would not cite any difference between himself and the last civil rights chief, Deval Patrick, who was an unwavering proponent of the civil rights agenda of the left. Unfortunately, it became clear during the hearing that Mr. Lee's advocacy is guided by a dedicated personal commitment to the positions he has advanced over the years. 
Mr. Lee started by proclaiming that proposition 209 is unconstitutional. In proposition 209, the people of California voted to end all government preferences and set-asides on the basis of race, sex, or national origin. Then, with the active support of Mr. Lee and his organization, a Federal judge blocked the will of the people, saying the referendum was unconstitutional. The claim was that proposition 209 violated the 14th amendment, when in reality it mirrored the 14th amendment. Far from violating the Constitution, proposition 209 essentially states what the Constitution requires. The Ninth Circuit recognized this simple fact on appeal. Regardless, Mr. Lee is steadfast in his view that it was unconstitutional for the people of California to bring preferences to an end. 
Another disturbing but related issue involves judicial taxation. I firmly believe that Federal judges do not have the Constitutional power to raises taxes or order legislative authorities to raise taxes. It is a simple issue of separation of powers. Taxes are a matter for the legislative branch, the branch that is responsive to the people. The organization for which Mr. Lee works was instrumental in the decision of a Federal judge in Missouri to order that taxes be raised. Mr. Lee would not disavow this approach. Although he stated that if confirmed he would not ask a Federal judge to order a legislative authority to raise taxes in the school desegregation context, he refused to rule out such a request in other civil rights contexts. He fails to recognize that fundamental principles of separation of powers prohibit judicial taxation. 
Mr. Lee's views on proposition 209 and judicial taxation represent support for a dangerous tactic of legal activists. They use the unelected, unaccountable Federal judiciary to accomplish what they cannot achieve through the democratic process. When they lost at the ballot box on proposition 209, they got a lone Federal judge to block the will of the people. When they wanted to implement their lavish desegregation experiment in Missouri, they got a lone Federal judge to raise taxes. They have pursued their solutions in utter disregard of the people. 
Today, Mr. Lee and his allies are failing to find support even in the courts. The Federal judiciary, led by the Supreme Court, is fashioning a civil rights jurisprudence based on the merit of the individual rather than preferential treatment for groups. Mr. Lee has fought against and continues to be uneasy with this constructive, solidifying law. It is clear that he would use his position and arsenal of attorneys to dilute or circumvent this progress toward ending preferential treatment. 
An excellent example of the failed approach of the past is forced busing of school children. At the hearing, Mr. Lee continued to express support for the use of forced busing in some circumstances, even in the 1990's. He would not back away from his unbelievable assertion in a Supreme Court brief that `the term `forced busing' is a misnomer.' 
Mr. President, many of us in the Senate are concerned about judicial activism on the bench, and we have every reason to be. We must keep in mind that a judicial activist decision starts with a proposal by a legal activist. We cannot and should not stop private organizations from advocating legal activism if they wish. However, we have a duty to reject legal activism as the guiding principle for our Nation's top civil rights law enforcement officer. 
I must strongly oppose this nomination. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, next week, November 11, our Nation will observe Veterans Day. Commemorative services will be held throughout the Nation on that day. I expect services will be held at Arlington Cemetery and other national cemeteries, where thousands of war dead are buried. 
As I mentioned in a statement last May, prior to Memorial Day, Mr. President, not all activities at our national cemeteries have honored our Nation's veterans. There have been, unfortunately, instances of vandalism and theft at our national cemeteries. While many of these incidents are minor, many attacks on national cemeteries are serious. The Department of Justice reports that between January 1, 1995, and May 31, 1997, there were 21 reports of vandalism or crime at national cemeteries, where the estimated damage was over $1,000. The total loss to our national cemeteries from these incidents is more than $98,000. In addition, more than 56 incidents were reported, with damage less than $1,000, during that same time period. These incidents caused another $15,000 in losses to the Government. 
The harm resulting from attacks on our national cemeteries, however, is more than economic loss. Such criminal activity is an assault on the honor of our veterans, particularly those who made the supreme sacrifice in defense of our Nation. It is an attack on the heritage and values for which our veterans fought. Such conduct is unconscionable and deserves a strong response. 
The time has come to demand a stop to this type of insulting behavior and punish it when it occurs. That is why I introduced S. 813, the Veterans' Cemetery Protection Act of 1997. This bill imposes criminal penalties for vandalism and theft at national cemeteries operated by the VA, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Interior. 
Specifically, this bill authorizes the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement for any offense against the property of a national cemetery. 
I am delighted that Senators McCain, Inhofe, Inouye, D'Amato, and Sessions have joined as cosponsors. I thank all Senators for their support on final passage. I particularly appreciate the support from the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission. I look forward to passage of this measure by the other body, so this bill can be on the President's desk by Veterans Day.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in a few moments, the Senate will vote to invoke cloture on the Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. As all of you know, we have had a difficult time getting to this point. After months of negotiating on the depot maintenance issue, we finally achieved a breakthrough when those Members of Congress who have depots agreed to a compromise heretofore believed to be unachievable. 
Those Members who have depots gave up on issues extremely important to them substantively and politically. At that time, those of us who had worked over many months to achieve such a compromise believed that we could finally put this very divisive issue behind us. It was simply unthinkable to us that after those with depots had come so far toward the other side's position that the Senators from Texas and California would oppose this compromise. They have always said they only wanted the opportunity to compete. This compromise gives them that opportunity on what the Armed Services Committee believes is clearly a level playing field. 
All 18 members of the Armed Services Committee have signed this conference report indicating their support of the compromise. The ranking member of the committee, Senator Levin, supported the Senators from Texas and California up to the point when this compromise was negotiated. He and his staff were totally involved in drafting and negotiating the compromise. Senator Levin and I join in total support of this compromise which is fair and equitable to all parties. 
This bill is important to the young men and women who serve in our military forces. The bill includes pay raises and increases to special incentive pay including vital aviator bonuses. Provisions in this bill affect every aspect of our national defense including quality of life initiatives, modernization, and readiness. I remind all Senators that all military construction projects require an authorization as well as an appropriation and cannot be executed without this bill. 
All members of the committee support this bill. The House has already passed it by a veto-proof majority of 286 to 123. The leaders of the Defense Department have indicated that they can make this compromise work and that they need this bill passed. It is hard for me to believe that any Senator would oppose and delay the entire Defense authorization bill at a time when American troops are deployed in Bosnia and trouble appears to be brewing again in the Middle East. 
I strongly encourage all Senators to vote to invoke cloture on this bill. We must send a strong signal to the White House to demonstrate to the President that this bill which is so important to our national security should be passed now. I also ask the support of all Senators to defeat any further attempts to delay this bill. Show the young men and women in uniform serving our Nation around the world that we are strongly behind them. 
I yield the floor. I observe the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I will not take 5 minutes. 
Mr. President, I would just like to take a few moments to address the outcome of what was the single most controversial issue in the conference--depot maintenance. The bill contains a fair compromise that was drafted by the members and staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee after consulting with all interested parties, including the administration and the concerned delegations. It is fair to assert that none of the parties involved are completely happy with this compromise language; however, that is what happens when you have to compromise. If we all insisted on getting everything our way, nothing would ever be accomplished by the Congress. 
Mr. President, Senator Levin, the ranking member of our committee, and I worked together in a totally bipartisan manner to achieve this compromise and we both agree that this compromise enables the Department of Defense to conduct fair and open competitions for the workloads currently performed at Kelly and McClellan. In fact, the compromise language specifically authorizes competitions for these workloads. 
Mr. President, during the drafting of this compromise language the Department of Defense, as well as the staff of the concerned delegations, were provided numerous opportunities to review this language and identify their concerns. We made significant changes to this language in order to alleviate many of the concerns they raised. 
Mr. President, no one knows the amount of work that was put into this compromise. We worked night and day. The staffs worked night and day. If this compromise doesn't go through, all of those States will suffer, in my opinion. It is better for us to pass this bill. This is a very important bill. It means a lot to our whole Nation, not just any one State or a few States, but all of the States. 
I ask the Senate to pass this compromise and stand by what has been done and reached heretofore on this important matter. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in the year that the Nation celebrates the 50th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Air Force, we must pause today to mourn the passing of an individual who was one of the key figures in the history of that service, Gen. Robert E. `Dutch' Huyser. 
For almost 40 years, Dutch Huyser helped to protect America through airpower. Drafted into the Army during World War II, he became a B-29 pilot and flew numerous missions in the Pacific in support of Allied efforts to defeat Imperialism. Following the war, when the Air Force was established as a separate military service, he became a bright and promising young officer who would help to shape cold war policy and become known as the father of the program which eventually yielded the C-17 Globemaster aircraft. Before he would reach the highest echelons of the Air Force though, Dutch Huyser still had a lot of flying to do, and he found himself in the cockpits of B-29's over Korea and B-52's in Vietnam when the United States became embroiled in conflicts in those nations. 
Throughout his career, Dutch Huyser established an impressive record of awards, citations, and medals that is far too extensive to cite here. Suffice it to say, he set an excellent example for devotion, patriotism, and professionalism for all Air Force officers to follow, and I am confident that he served as an important role model for many of his subordinates throughout his career. 
An obvious competent and talented officer, pilot, and manager, the career of Dutch Huyser progressed quickly. Following his service in Vietnam, he specialized in airlift matters and later became the Commander of the Military Airlift Command. In that position, he was an advocate for increased lift capabilities for the Air Force, and he fought hard for the modernization and expansion of the transport fleet. As mentioned above, he is universally credited as being the father credited as being the father of the C-17 program, an aircraft that proves its capabilities and worth on a daily basis as it transports troops and equipment to spots around the world. 
After three major wars, almost 10,000 flying hours, and 38-years in the Air Force, General Huyser finally hung his uniform up for the last time in 1981. Though he left the military, he continued to make many contributions to aviation and the security of the United States. 
Sadly, Gen. Robert `Dutch' Huyser passed away earlier this week, but perhaps fitting for a man who dedicated his life to the Air Force, he was on an Air Force base when he died. I am certain that the entire Senate would join me in saluting the many contributions that General Huyser made to the Air Force and the defense of the United States, as well as extending our deepest sympathies to his wife, Wanda, and their two daughters. They can be proud of all that their husband and father did to make our Nation a safer, stronger, and better place to live.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, I am submitting a sense-of-the Senate resolution regarding the Vacancies Act. I am pleased to do so on my behalf, and the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and other members of the Judiciary Committee. Our purpose is to clarify for the Attorney General that the Vacancies Act applies to all executive departments and agencies, including the Department of Justice. 
The Vacancies Act provides that, except for recess periods, when an official serving in an advise and consent position in an executive agency leaves, the President may appoint certain individuals to serve in that position in an acting capacity for no more than 120 days before the nomination of a permanent replacement is forwarded for Senate confirmation. The Vacancies Act, which is codified in sections 3345 through 3349 of title 5 of the United States Code, has existed in some form since at least 1868. 
This act is central to the advise and consent role of the Senate. By limiting the time that the President may temporarily fill a vacant advise and consent position, the act strongly encourages the President to quickly nominate a permanent replacement. 
I have become increasingly alarmed at the Clinton administration's failure to nominate officials to fill the vacancies that have occurred in executive branch positions, and particularly in the Department of Justice. When we held a Justice Department oversight hearing in the Judiciary Committee at the end of April, vacancies existed for the Associate Attorney General, Solicitor General, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, and Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel. 
I asked Attorney General Reno at the oversight hearing whether she was concerned that a failure to nominate individuals for these positions within the 120-day deadline would violate the Vacancies Act. She responded in writing that the Justice Department was not bound by the Vacancies Act. The letter indicated that she could fill these vacancies pursuant to the Department's general administrative authorizing statutes without regard to the Vacancies Act. 
In my opinion, the Attorney General is simply wrong. Her interpretation of the vacancies law in this area is nothing more than an attempt to get around the law. 
First, the plain language of the Vacancies Act since it was amended in 1988 states that it applies to all executive departments and agencies. By law, the Department of Justice is an executive department, so Justice obviously is included. In fact, the original sponsor of the act, Representative Trumbull, stated on the Senate floor in 1868 that the act applied to, quote, `any of the Departments.' 
Also, the Congress flatly rejected the Attorney General's interpretation when it amended the Vacancies Act in 1988. As explained in the report of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, Congress made a choice in 1988 of whether to repeal or revive the Vacancies Act, and it chose the latter. The report stated that it was time `to revitalize' the Vacancies Act and `make it relevant to the modern Presidential appointments process.' One method of accomplishing this was to assist the President by expanding the number of days he had to submit a nominee from 30 to 120 days after the vacancy was created. That way, the President would have more time to submit a qualified replacement. 
The committee report expressly rejected the Attorney General's flawed interpretation. It stated that the Vacancies Act was the exclusive authority for these appointments, and noted that the authorizing statutes of an executive department or agency do not provide an alternative means to fill vacancies. The amendment was made at the recommendation of the Comptroller General, who has battled with the Attorney General for many years over this flawed interpretation of vacancies law. 
Mr. President, this is a matter of great constitutional significance. If the view of the Attorney General were correct, the President could routinely ignore the advise and consent role of the Senate. In the Justice Department, the President would never be obligated to nominate any official below the Attorney General for Senate confirmation after his first appointee left, as long as the President was content for the person to serve in an acting capacity. 
In fact, based on the Attorney General's reasoning, the President apparently would not be bound by the Vacancies Act for officials in any department. Every Federal department from Agriculture to Veterans Affairs has authorizing statutes similar to Justice. Many Federal agencies do, too. Therefore, based on the Attorney General's reasoning, these departments and agencies can all claim to be exempt from the Vacancies Act. In fact, when faced with the Vacancies Act, many make the Attorney General's argument, and claim they aren't bound by it either. Obviously, the Congress would never have intended for its confirmation power to be circumvented in this manner. 
The Framers of the Constitution surely would not be 
pleased. The advise and consent role of the Senate is one of the fundamental checks and balances included within our great system of Government. Under the appointments clause of article II, section 2, of the Constitution, the President has the exclusive power to nominate principal officers of the United States, but the Senate must give its advise and consent. As Justice Scalia stated for the Supreme Court earlier this year, `[T]he Appointments Clause * * * is more than a matter of etiquette or protocol; it is among the significant structural safeguards of the constitutional scheme.' 
The involvement of the Senate is designed to promote a high quality of appointments and curb executive abuses. In the words of Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 76, `The possibility of rejection [is] a strong motive to care in processing.' 
This resolution is designed to affirm the Senate's role by insisting that the Attorney General stop interpreting the act out of existence. It expressly states what should already be obvious from the plain language of the Vacancies Act and its legislative history: that the Vacancies Act applies to all executive departments and agencies, including the Department of Justice. The resolution also states that the Attorney General should ensure that the Department of Justice complies with the act, and that she should inform other executive agencies to abide by it, as well. 
This is not just a technical issue. It is not an idle problem. At some point this year, six advise and consent positions in the Justice Department have been in violation of the Vacancies Act. The position of the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division has been vacant for over 2 years. This is an excellent example of the problem the Vacancies Act was designed to prevent. The Nation's chief law enforcement agency has been without a confirmed chief for crime since August 31, 1995. No name has been forwarded in the 9 months that this Congress has been in session. Mr. President, what message does that send about the Clinton administration's commitment to fighting crime? 
In the meantime, the Attorney General has been in the middle of a tremendous controversy surrounding her reluctance to seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate apparently illegal campaign fundraising practices. Would not having a politically accountable chief of the Criminal Division be helpful to her in analyzing whether crimes were committed? 
Also, consider the Office of Legal Counsel. Walter Dellinger was confirmed to head OLC in 1993, but he was very controversial. Many members of this body could not support him. Nevertheless, effective July 1, 1996, the Attorney General made Mr. Dellinger acting Solicitor General. The Senate may not have confirmed him to be Solicitor General. Of course, we will never know because by simply naming him acting Solicitor General, the administration avoided a fight over his appointment. For an entire year, for a full term of the Supreme Court, the United States was represented by a Solicitor General who was acting in violation of the Vacancies Act, in violation of the law. The President has just officially nominated someone else for the vacancy. 
Moreover, Mr. Dellinger's appointment caused another violation of the Vacancies Act. When the Attorney General moved Mr. Dellinger, she appointed an acting chief of OLC, who served over 120 days without a permanent nomination being submitted. Not only did this appointment exceed 120 days, it wasn't even legal in the first place. The Vacancies Act not only limits the amount of time someone can serve in an acting capacity, it also limits who can serve. Only someone who was the first assistant, which refers to the principal deputy, or someone who was earlier confirmed to a different advice and consent position can serve in the acting position. Mr. Dellinger's replacement did not meet either of these requirements. Thus, the chief of OLC was serving in violation of the Vacancies Act, in violation of the law, from the first day Mr. Dellinger left. 
Mr. President, the vacancies problem is not limited to the Department of Justice. It can be found throughout the executive branch. The Washington Post reported on August 29, 1997, that 30 percent of the top 470 political jobs in the administration remain unfilled. When confronted with the Vacancies Act, many departments and agencies use the Attorney General's argument and also claim not to be bound by the act. 
It is time to put the Attorney General's flawed interpretation of the Vacancies Act to rest. Her reading of the Vacancies Act is a threat to the advise and consent role of the Senate. I am hopeful that my colleagues will join me and my cosponsors in supporting this simple but significant resolution. Let us adopt this important resolution, and reaffirm our constitutional duty of advise and consent.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to support the Tax Relief Act of 1997. I commend the Finance Committee and the leadership, along with the Budget Committee, for their hard work. 
This bill, along with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, fulfills our promise to the American people--to restrain Government spending, and to bring Tax Relief to the American people. 
This tax reduction act has some tax relief for all Americans, at all stages of life. The child tax credit will boost the family budget for parents with children. 
Homeowners, and others with capital assets will benefit from the capital gains tax reduction. The education provisions will encourage savings and assist all students. The bill has provisions for savings and investment, and for businesses. This will encourage economic growth and promote employment. Finally, there are estate tax reforms which will help preserve family businesses and farms. 
Mr. President, this Nation has waited too long for a balanced budget--nearly 30 years; and it has been 16 years since we have delivered any significant tax relief. These measures passed today keep us on the track of smaller government and a strong economy. 
I am proud to support this measure, because it is good for the people of South Carolina and good for the Nation. It is a good down payment toward a simpler, fairer, and less burdensome tax system. 
Finally, Mr. President, these two bills put us on course to fiscal responsibility. We must continue to keep spending within the limits of our resources, and begin to reduce the national debt. We owe no less to our children and grandchildren.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to submit a Senate resolution which authorizes and requests the President to designate the week beginning September 14, 1997, as `National Historically Black Colleges and Universities Week'. 
It is my privilege to sponsor this legislation for the 12th time--I repeat, the 12th time--honoring the historically black colleges of our country. 
Eight of the one hundred and sixteen historically black colleges, namely Allen University, Benedict College, Claflin College, South Carolina State University, Morris College, Voorhees College, Denmark Technical College, and Clinton Junior College, are located in my home State. These colleges are vital to the higher education system of South Carolina. They have provided thousands of economically disadvantaged young people with the opportunity to obtain a college education. 
Mr. President, thousands of young Americans have received quality educations at these 116 schools. These institutions have a long and distinguished history of providing the training necessary for participation in a rapidly changing society. Historically black colleges offer our citizens a variety of curricula and programs through which young people develop skills and talents, thereby expanding opportunities for continued social progress. 
Mr. President, through adoption of this Senate resolution, Congress can reaffirm its support for historically black colleges, and appropriately recognize their important contributions to our Nation. I look forward to the speedy adoption of this resolution.

Although he was born in New York, and was educated at Duke University, the University of Michigan, Harvard, and Oxford, Mr. Lader has called South Carolina home for many years. It is in South Carolina where he established himself as a leader in business and education. He was associated for 10 years with Sea Pines Co., a developer and operator of award-winning recreational communities on Hilton Head Island. In addition, he has held the following business positions: president of Business Executives for National Security; founding director of the South Carolina Jobs/Economic Development Authority; director of First Union National Bank (S.C.) and First Carolina Bank; director of the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce; chairman of the South Carolina Governor's Council on Small and Minority Business; and a member of the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee's Travel and Tourism Advisory Committee. In 1981, he founded Renaissance Weekend, a family retreat for innovative leaders. 
In education, he served as president of Winthrop College in Rock Hill, SC, from 1983 to 1985. During his tenure, Winthrop was awarded the National Gold Medal for general improvements in programs. Academically, he has served as chairman of the South Carolina Rhodes Scholarship Committee, trustee of three colleges, and director of the Alumni Association at Duke University. He has taught courses at many universities and has been awarded honorary doctorates by five institutions. 
Mr. President, for the past several years, Phil Lader has been utilizing his business skills in the U.S. Government. He most recently served as Administrator of the Small Business Administration. Prior to that, he was Assistant to the President and White House Deputy Chief of Staff. He has also been Deputy Director for Management at the Office of Management and Budget and has been chairman of the National Performance Review's Policy Committee, the President's Management Council, and the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency. In addition, he has served on the National Economic Council, the President's Export Council, the Community Empowerment Board, and the Board of Governors of the American Red Cross. Currently, he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. 
Mr. President, all of the business, academic, and Government experience that I have just described are tremendous assets Mr. Lader will bring to the Court of St. James. However, Mr. Lader has even more to offer this position, both professionally and personally. Professionally, he was executive vice president of Sir James Goldsmith's U.S. holding company, which was responsible for the analysis and sales of lands previously owned by Crown Zellerbach and Diamond International Corporations. He was also president of Bond University, the first private university in Australia, a British Commonwealth nation. 
Personally, the Lader family has strong ties to the United Kingdom, particularly England and Scotland. He studied English constitutional history at Oxford University and is an Honorary Fellow of Pembroke College at Oxford. Further, the ancestors of his lovely wife, Linda, emigrated from Henley-on-Thames, just west of London. In fact, her late stepmother, Catherine Marshall, was the author of `A Man Called Peter,' the biography of her husband, the Scottish Presbyterian Minister Peter Marshall, who served as the U.S. Senate Chaplain from 1947 until his death in 1949. Mrs. Lader is a trustee of the American University in London. 
Phil Lader is a man of integrity and honor, whom I hold in high esteem. He has a deep respect for the British people and their beautiful country. I know that he, along with his wife Linda and their two young daughters, Mary Catherine and Whittaker, will represent the United States well at the Court of St. James and will make us all very proud. 
Mr. President, I reiterate my strong support for the confirmation of Phil Lader to be Ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I have no doubt that he will live up to the commitment he made to the Foreign Relations Committee earlier this week and devote his time and energy `not only to the salient matters of diplomacy, but also to the arts and letters, the streets and fields, the industries and entrepreneurs, those who innovate and those in need, all of which preserve and strengthen the heritage and common causes of America and the United Kingdom.' 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, when the President signs the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act, the United States will have joined the rest of the tuna-fishing nations in the Eastern Pacific in pledging that, in the future, no dolphins will be killed in the harvesting of tuna. Further, the transition to better fishing methods will result in a significant reduction in by-catch waste in that portion of the ocean. This is a remarkable achievement. 
My colleagues from Alaska and Louisiana, Senators Stevens and Breaux, have pressed on for 2 years to see that this agreement is ratified. Their perseverance should be recognized and appreciated. Finally, this bill would likely have never become law had the subcommittee chairman, Senator Snowe, not gathered the various parties to work out a compromise that would assure passage of this implementing legislation. She is to be commended for her skill and stamina in seeing this measure to its successful conclusion. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, though the borders of the United States stretch from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Rio Grande to the `Great White North,' the defense of our Nation takes our military personnel around the globe. Point to almost any continent on the globe and you will find American soldiers serving bravely and selflessly, and transporting these men and women to the far corners of the Earth, as well as keeping them supplied with everything from bullets to vehicles, is a challenging but essential task which falls to the Army Materiel Command. Today, I rise to pay tribute to a man who made many innovations in the field of military logistics and who served the U.S. Army in times of peace and war, Gen. Frank S. Besson, Jr. 
General Besson passed away more than 10 years ago, but during his life and military career, he distinguished himself in any number of ways and set an excellent example for service to the Nation and devotion to the Army. A 1932 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, then Second Lieutenant Besson headed north to Boston where he earned a master's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His education and training at West Point and MIT paid dividends for the security of the Nation, and helped to pave his way to leadership positions at the highest levels of the U.S. Army. During his career, Frank Besson served with distinction in Persia, Japan, Europe, and in the United States. He was responsible for important innovations in the areas of military pipelines, steel airplane landing mats, steel treadway bridges, and `roll-on/roll-off' techniques. Though no sane person welcomed the outbreak of World War II, that conflict proved the viability of Frank Beeson's innovations, and the lives of thousands of GI's were made a little easier thanks to his ideas and efforts. As a matter of fact, it was Frank Besson who ordered studies which led to the adoption of the `Bailey Bridge,' a key piece of equipment used during World War II which allowed Allied Forces greater mobility in their march against the Reich. 
At age 34, Frank Besson became the youngest brigadier general in the Army Ground Forces. From 1941 to 1945, while we battled the Axis Powers, General Besson was charged with ensuring that Allied supplies reached Soviet forces through the Persian corridor, and as the Deputy Chief Transportation Officer of Army Forces in the Western Pacific, he played an important role in the war against Japan. When the Imperial Japanese surrendered in 1945, General Besson shifted his efforts from working for the defeat of that nation to helping rehabilitate its rail system and working to rebuild Japan. 
As the shooting of World War II was replaced by the tense stalemate of the cold war, General Besson continued to serve, this time working to contain the Soviet Union by helping NATO plan and meet its logistical challenges. By the end of the 1950's, General Besson had reached the top of his career field, serving as Chief of Transportation for the U.S. Army, and when the Army Materiel Command was formed in 1962, he took command of this new entity. On May 27, 1964, General Besson again made history by becoming the first Army officer to become a four-star general as the head of a logistical organization during peacetime. 
During his career, General Besson earned a long list of awards, commendations, and distinctions, including the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, and the Commander of the Order of the British Empire. There is no question that this was a man who made his mark on military and transportation history, and who dedicated his life to protecting our Nation. While it has been many years since General Besson wore the uniform of the U.S. Army, his accomplishments, leadership, and service have not been forgotten, and as a matter of fact, they are still greatly appreciated by the soldiers of today. In recognition of this unique man's illustrious career, the men and women of the Army Transportation Corps will today induct the late Gen. Frank S. Besson, Jr., into the Transportation Corps Hall of Fame at the U.S. Army Transportation Center and Fort Eustis, VA. This is an honor which is certainly appropriate, and I salute General Besson's distinguished career and add my congratulations to his proud family and friends as they gather to pay homage to this great soldier.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, throughout the Nation, whenever a community leader passes, his or her death is noticed and mourned by many. In small towns, however, the impact of such a loss is always magnified, for in such places, the deceased is more than a well known, but distant figure, he or she is a neighbor, a member of the local church, and more often than not, a friend. Such was the case on June 29 when Edgefield, SC suffered a tremendous loss with the passing of my friend, Joanne Tisdale Rainsford. 
Mrs. Rainsford first came to Edgefield to work as a teacher, and it was not long before she became a well known and liked figure around town. Her civic mindedness led her to become involved in a multitude of organizations and causes, and though not originally from Edgefield, she worked hard on behalf of her new hometown. Among other groups, the Edgefield United Way, the Olde Edgefield Trade Association, and the Edgefield Community Development Association all benefited from the efforts of this tireless, devoted, and enthusiastic woman. 
One of the cornerstones of a small town is the community newspaper, and Joanne Rainsford played an important role in helping produce the local paper, the Citizen News. In the mid-1980's, she spent about a year and a half as the managing editor of that publication, and she later became the president of Edgefield County Communications, the parent company of the Citizen News. 
Though Mrs. Rainsford enjoyed many pursuits, she was particularly interested in history, and she worked hard to save and showcase the unique and rich history of Edgefield County. In recognition of her service as their president, and her leadership in any number of preservation projects, the Edgefield County Historical Society just this past June voted to rename its museum the Joanne T. Rainsford Heritage Center. This was an honor of which I know she was especially proud and the action of the society is all the more meaningful as they approved this recognition shortly before Mrs. Rainsford's death. 
Whether it was through her work as a teacher, in her role as a newspaper executive, or as a civic booster, Joanne Rainsford worked hard to promote Edgefield, to build the local economy, and to make her hometown an even more prosperous and desirable place to live. She was an articulate proponent of the heritage corridor, a unique project that blends history and tourism together over a 14-county region in our State stretching from the coast to the mountains. I was so impressed by her desire to bolster tourism, the No. 1 industry in the Palmetto State, that I appointed her as a delegate from South Carolina to the White House Conference on Tourism.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am saddened to report the passing of a longtime friend, a great supporter, and one of the stalwart members of the South Carolina Republican Party, Mrs. Julia Ravenel Dougherty. 
In the not so distant past, South Carolina was what was known as a one party State, where a victory in a primary election was all one needed to secure office, and where a significant segment of the population had no outlet for its views, opinions, and politics. All of that began to change in the 1960's when a cadre of forward looking politicians and interested citizens began to fight to create a true Republican Party in South Carolina. 
One of the pioneers in that effort was Mrs. Dougherty, who is roundly recognized as having been a woman of great humor, strong organizational skills, and inexhaustible energy, as well as someone who was a tremendous motivator. From the Charleston County Republican Party to the gubernatorial races, and from my own Senate campaigns to the bids of GOP candidates for the White House, Julia Dougherty was always eager to roll up her sleeves and to lend her considerable talents to an election effort. Her loyalty to the party, and activism on its behalf, earned her not only the thanks and admiration of countless people, but also an appointment as a delegate to the 1964 and 1968 Republican Conventions. Her loyalty and efforts were further recognized when in 1968, she was a member of the electoral college, and cast her vote for Richard M. Nixon. 
In addition to her partisan political work, Mrs. Dougherty had a strong commitment to public service, and over the years, she made many contributions to building South Carolina into an even better, safer, and more prosperous State for all its citizens. She was the first female to ever serve on the South Carolina Highway Commission, and in that role, she was a forceful advocate for the modernization of the highway patrol, as well as the increased professionalization of that force. She later served as the State chairwoman of President Carter's friendship force, and during the Reagan administration, she served on an advisory committee to the Department of Transportation. Truly an impressive record, and one of which I know Julia was justifiably proud. 
Despite her great love for politics and her commitment to public service, Mrs. Dougherty never sought elected office herself. This is truly a shame for I believe she would have made even more contributions to the Palmetto State as an elected official, and she certainly would have set a high standard for ability, integrity, and dedication for others to follow. 
The death of Julia Ravenel Dougherty leaves a tremendous void in South Carolina politics and life in the lowcountry. Her family, which includes her cousin and my good friend, State Senator Arthur Ravenel; husband Francis; son Park; daughters Renee and Frances; and four grandchildren, all have my deepest sympathies. Their wife, mother, grandmother, and cousin will be missed by all those who knew this most remarkable woman.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of Joel I. Klein to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Mr. Klein is a fine man and is an outstanding nominee for this important position. I am pleased to support him. 
Mr. Klein achieved an excellent academic record at both Columbia College in New York and Harvard Law School. He then served as a law clerk for the Chief Judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and later for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell. Afterward, he developed a distinguished reputation in private practice, where he argued important cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
For the past several months, he has served as the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division. During that time, he has shown that he is firmly committed to enforcing our nation's antitrust laws. For example, under his leadership, the Antitrust Division has greatly increased its collection of criminal fines. Thus far this fiscal year, which almost coincides with Joel Klein's tenure, the Antitrust Division has collected over $192 million dollars in criminal fines, compared to only about $27 million for all of fiscal year 1996. 
Mr. President, I am confident that Mr. Klein is within the mainstream of antitrust law and doctrine, and will exercise his responsibilities fairly and within the dictates of the law. He is committed to upholding our free enterprise system and to protecting consumers from anti-competitive conduct. 
Under Chairman Hatch's distinguished leadership, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on Mr. Klein's nomination in April, and his nomination was reported out of the Committee unanimously in May. 
In short, I strongly believe that Mr. Klein is a man of unquestioned integrity and great ability. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this nomination. 
Mr. President, in closing I want to commend Senator Hatch, the able chairman of the Judiciary Committee for the position he has taken on this particular nomination. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment by the Senator from New Mexico to reduce funding for the space-based laser program. The space-based laser program is one of the most important technology development programs in the Department of Defense. It could provide for global boost phase defense against all types of ballistic missiles from short-range tactical missiles to long-range strategic missiles. 
It would be shortsighted for the United States to constantly abandon this development effort at a time when the long-range missile threat is growing. The space-based laser program is the only future oriented program remaining at the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. With the exception of space-based laser, BMDO is focused almost exclusively on near-term development and deployment efforts. 
This is an unbalanced approach which mortgages our future for near-term capability, and in my view we should have a more balanced approach, one which continues to invest in high payoff future systems while deploying near-term capability. 
Mr. President, the space-based laser program has been one of the best managed programs in the history of the Department of Defense. Unfortunately, the department has only requested $30 million for this important program in fiscal year 1998. The Armed Services Committee did the responsible thing by adding additional funds to ensure that this program continues to make technical progress. It would be highly irresponsible to cut this funding at this time. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment by the Senator from New Mexico.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am very concerned about this amendment. I realize that the amendment has nearly 50 cosponsors. I have been in the Senate long enough to know that any provision with that many cosponsors will pass. However, that does not make the amendment advisable or good government. 
While the amendment is very attractive from a political perspective, it is not good policy. The amendment would create a new position, the Senior Representative of the National Guard. The incumbent of this position would be a four-star general and would be a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
The amendment does not eliminate the current three-star Chief of the National Guard Bureau nor does it shift any of the duties and responsibilities of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the newly created Senior Representative of the National Guard. This is pure and simple an additional layer of bureaucracy. A new four-star position is created but the incumbent is not a commander. He has no directive authority over any forces. The National Guard is under the control of the Governors during peacetime and under the control of the war fighting CINC's during wartime. This new Senior Representative has no real function. 
This position was not created as the result of studies and analysis. There have not been any hearings to determine whether such a position will actually meet any need or to identify any military requirement for an additional general. This Senior Representative does not enhance the representation of the Reserve forces. He is a National Guardsman and would only concentrate on National Guard issues. I suspect creating such a position will do more to disrupt jointness than to enhance it. 
Currently in the statute, the Chief of the National Guard reports directly to the Secretary of Defense and serves as the principal adviser to the Secretaries of the Army and the Air Force. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau is authorized to coordinate directly with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. 
Giving the Senior Representative of the National Guard membership in the Joint Chiefs is contrary to the tenets of Goldwater-Nichols which we worked so hard to develop and enact in 1986. In Goldwater-Nichols we established the membership of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as the Chairman and the four Service Chiefs. The Vice-Chairman was not made a member of the Joint Chiefs until 1992. This reflects the extensive study and analysis conducted by the JCS, the Department of Defense and the Congress before increasing the size of the Joint Chiefs. This Senior Representative position has not been vetted by anyone. I hope the Senator from Alaska would agree to let the Armed Services Committee hold hearings on this idea and determine whether and how to best meet the need the amendment is trying to address. 
In closing, Mr. President, I know this amendment will be adopted by the Senate. I want my colleagues to know that they are making national security policy by passing a politically appealing proposal. I prefer principle over politics.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this amendment would authorize the Secretary of the Army to enter into a multiyear procurement contract for the family of medium tactical vehicles [FMTV]. This authority is significant for the following reasons: 
First, the Army fleet of aging trucks, the backbone for our premier land force, has reached the end of its useful life and new trucks are required to support the heavy demand we place on these vehicles. 
Second, the Army will complete acquisition of the first round of new FMTV trucks through an existing multiyear in 1998. The soldiers in the field love these new trucks. They are reliable, capable, and are easily maintained. We must continue to field these trucks to our soldiers as quickly as possible. 
Third, the multiyear authority will be exercised within the current budget and will result in 9.5 percent savings over the life of the multiyear or $122.3 million. This means that the Army will be able to field more trucks than would otherwise be possible with current budget constraints. 
Mr. President, I strongly support the fielding of these trucks and believe that this multiyear will make the best use of available resources and will help our soldiers. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which will suspend the duties on two chemicals used in the manufacturing of pharmaceuticals, ultraviolet protection products, and fragrances. Currently, these chemicals are imported into the United States. 
The first chemical, benzyl alcohol, is used to produce esters. In 1996, this product was listed in the pharmaceutical category and carried a duty free status which has been overturned. 
The second chemical, benzophenone, is primarily used to produce pharmaceuticals, ultraviolet protection products, and fragrances. Currently, no domestic producer of this product exists. Therefore, suspending the duties on this item would not adversely affect domestic industries. 
Mr. President, suspending the duty on these chemicals will benefit the consumers by stabilizing the costs of the end products. I hope the Senate will consider this measure expeditiously.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I just want to tell the Senators that we are going to finish this bill this week. If they want their amendments adopted, they better come in and have them considered and debated and acted on. We do not want any further delays. And we want to get time agreements, too. No use to spend hours and hours on one amendment. We ought to get a very limited time on each amendment so we can finish this bill. That is very important. I want Senators to know that we expect to proceed along that line.

The name of the courthouse for Bob Dole is purely a Kansas matter, but I just want to say that no finer person in the United States deserves a courthouse or any other building named for him than Bob Dole. He is a great American. He has rendered this country great service. He was an outstanding leader here in the Senate for many years. We are all proud of him and we will be delighted to have a courthouse named for him.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my friend, Senator Levin, would devastate the function of the Federal Prison Industries, Inc., known as FPI. 
FPI is the Bureau of Prisons' most important inmate program. It keeps inmates productively occupied and reduces inmate idleness and the violence and disruptive behavior associated with it. Thus it is essential to the security of Federal correctional institutions, the communities in which they are located, and the safety of Federal correctional staff and inmates. 
FPI has no other outlet for its products than Federal agencies. The constraints within which FPI operates, cause it to be less efficient than it private sector counterparts. Private sector companies strive to obtain the most modern, efficient equipment to minimize the labor component of their manufacturing costs. FPI, on the other hand must keep its manufacturing process as labor intensive as possible in order to employ the maximum number of inmates. 
Since FPI operates its factories in secure correctional environments, it faces additional constraints that limit its efficiency. For example, every tool must be checked out at the beginning of the day, checked in before lunch, checked out again in the afternoon, and checked in at the end of the day. The costs associated with civilian supervision and numerous measures necessary to maintain the security of the prison add substantially to the cost of production. 
It should be noted that the average Federal inmate has an eighth grade education, is 37 years old, is serving a 10-year sentence for a drug-related offense, and has never held a steady job. According to a recent study by an independent firm, the overall productivity rate of an inmate with a background like this is approximately one-fourth that of a civilian worker. 
FPI must have some method of offsetting these inefficiencies if it is expected to acquire a reasonable share of Government contracts and remain self-sufficient. The offsetting advantage that Congress has provided is the mandatory sourcing requirements in section 4124 of title 18, United States Code. This section requires that Federal agencies purchase products made by FPI as long as those products meet customer needs for quality, price, and timeliness of delivery. If the product is not currently manufactured by FPI, or if the FPI is not competitive in quality, price or timeliness, Federal Prison Industries will grant a waiver to allow the Federal agency to purchase the product from private sector suppliers. 
The Federal Prison Industries preference in title 18 is essential if this program is to prevent inmate idleness on a large scale. Increasing Inmate idleness will risk unrest affecting the safety of prison security personnel and the surrounding communities. 
I urge my colleagues to reject the Levin amendment. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendments offered by Senator Wellstone and any other amendment which lowers defense spending below the level set in the budget agreement. We have a budget agreement with the administration that we should not disregard--an agreement that was widely supported by this body and the administration--and frankly, Mr. President, this agreement itself may not provide enough funding for defense. 
Mr. President, our military forces are beginning to show the stress of constrained budget and too many deployments. Funding for modernization and quality of life initiatives is continually diverted to fund current operations with promises to fix the modernization problem in the future. This is no longer acceptable. It should not be acceptable to any of the Members of this body. 
The Department of Defense is continuing their downsizing. This year's defense budget request represents lowest percent of our GDP in the last 57 years. Force levels have shrunk from 2.1 million service members at the end of the cold war to 1.4 million today. Annual spending in the Department of Defense has decreased in the last 10 years from $375 to $250 billion in inflation adjusted dollars. Even at the level of funding proposed in the budget agreement, the Quadrennial Defense Review is recommending force structure reductions up to 130,000 military personnel as well as reductions in key modernization programs. 
Mr. President, I believe that a mismatch is developing between strategy and actual force capability. GAO and CBO have both given estimates to the underfunding of the modernization accounts. The budget agreement does not fully fund defense. It does represent what funds are available. Funding defense at the levels proposed by these amendments will have serious impacts on the readiness and quality of life of our service personnel. 
Command Sergeants Major Alley, U.S. Forces Command, has summed it pretty well when he stated. 
Our soldiers do not ask for much. What they do ask for is stability in deployments, adequate housing, quality-of-life programs, and adequate compensation. 
Mr. President, if this body allows these amendments or other amendments to lower defense spending below what was agreed to--I repeat, was agreed to--in the budget agreement, we will be responsible for the impacts on the readiness of our forces, we will increase the tempo of our operating forces, and we will not be able to provide the quality of life programs, our service members deserve. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum and I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided between both sides.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may require. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my good friends, Senator Boxer and Senator Grassley. 
Mr. President, I acknowledge that some executive salaries are exorbitant, but section 804 of our defense bill is a sound middle ground on the very controversial issue of payment of executive compensation under cost-type contracts with Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense. The section in our bill recognizes that the industries supplying goods and services to the Federal Government do not do so in isolation from the rest of the economy. They must compete with similar companies in the private sector for the limited pool of the most qualified technical and management people. Salaries for such people are not determined by a Government agency; they are set in the marketplace. Section 804 would provide a framework for ensuring that we can bring the best private sector talent to bear to support our national defense. 
At the same time, section 804 would not permit the Federal Government to reimburse exorbitant salaries or other forms of compensation. The maximum allowable limit for executive compensation covered under this provision would not exceed $340,000, according to the Defense Contract Audit Agency, based on surveys conducted in 1995. In fact, the administration opposes section 804 because it provides too great a limitation on compensation, in their view. The administration wants to pay more, but we limit this to $340,000 in our defense bill. 
Mr. President, section 804 is a sound means to settle executive compensation issues once and for all. It protects the interests of the taxpayer, both in the limits it places on reimbursement under cost-type contracts and by recognizing the relationship between compensation practices in the industries supporting defense and those in the commercial sector. I urge the rejection of Boxer-Grassley amendment. 
We feel that our defense provision here covers it adequately and is in the best interest of the Government.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, would seriously damage the functioning of the Federal Prison Industries, Incorporated known as FPI. 
FPI is the Bureau of Prisons' most important inmate program. It keeps inmates productively occupied and reduces inmate idleness and the violence and disruptive behavior associated with it. Thus it is essential to the security of Federal correctional institutions, the communities in which they are located, and the safety of Federal correctional staff and inmates. Eliminating FPI's mandatory source status in law would dramatically reduce the number of inmates FPI would be able to employ. The inmate idleness this would create would seriously undermine the safety and security of America's Federal prisons. 
In addition to the general benefit of keeping our prison population employed, the Federal Prison Industries Program has the added benefit that 50 percent of the wages paid to prisoners employed under the program are used to pay off fines and provide restitution to the victims of their crimes. This is an important benefit that must not be impeded. 
FPI has no other outlet for its products than Federal agencies. The constraints within which FPI operates cause it to be less efficient than its private sector counterparts. While private sector companies specialize and become highly efficient in certain product areas, FPI, in an attempt to limit its market share in any one area, has diversified its product line. Private sector companies strive to obtain the most modern, efficient equipment to minimize the labor component of their manufacturing costs. FPI, on the other hand must keep its manufacturing process as labor intensive as possible in order to employ the maximum number of inmates. 
Since FPI operates its factories in secure correctional environments, it faces additional constraints that limit its efficiency. For example, every tool must be checked out at the beginning of the day, checked in before lunch, checked out again in the afternoon, and checked in at the end of the day. In addition, Federal Prison Industries factories are occasionally forced to shut down because of inmate unrest or institutional disturbances. The costs associated with civilian supervision and numerous measures necessary to maintain the security of the prison add substantially to the cost of production. 
It should be noted that the average Federal inmate has an 8th grade education, is 37 years old, is serving a 10-year sentence for a drug related offense, and has never held a steady job. According to a recent study by an independent firm, the overall productivity rate of an inmate with a background like this is approximately 1/4 that of a civilian worker. 
FPI must have some method of offsetting these inefficiencies if it is expected to acquire a reasonable share of Government contracts and remain self financing. The offsetting advantage that Congress has provided is the mandatory sourcing requirements in section 4124 of title 18, United States Code. This section requires that Federal agencies purchase products made by FPI as long as those products meet customer needs for quality, price, and timeliness of delivery. If the product is not currently manufactured by FPI, or if the FPI is not competitive in quality, price or timeliness, Federal Prison Industries will grant a waiver to allow the Federal agency to purchase the product from private sector suppliers. 
The amendment proposed by Senator Levin would force the Attorney General to require that Federal agencies purchase FPI products on a case-by-case basis, increasing paperwork and administrative expense unnecessarily. The current FPI mandatory source requirement provides a steady flow of work to the inmate population and reduces the requirement for FPI to expend large amounts of money on advertising and marketing. If such expenses had to be incurred, sales levels and market share would have to be expanded to cover them. This would have an adverse impact on private sector companies in the same businesses as FPI.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to support the Dorgan-Daschle amendment. I think that is the logical step to take at this time. I wish to commend the majority leader, Senator Lott, the assistant majority leader, Senator Nickles, for their excellent talks that they made on this subject. I wish to commend all others who took that position or the opposite position for participating in this debate. This is a very important subject. I am very pleased that so many Senators have taken part in this debate, which is very helpful to our country. 
Mr. President, I am not going to make a long talk. We have had a lot of talk the other day. I expect to speak less than 5 minutes. 
Mr. President, in my judgment, and that of many of my colleagues, the Secretary of Defense has not made a sufficient case for additional base closures. The one point that has been a common theme throughout the debate on additional base closures rounds has been the extent of actual overcapacity in the existing infrastructure. I am not satisfied that we have accurate data on this matter and should not vote for any additional rounds until we have an independent assessment of the overcapacity. 
As a second concern is that I believe that the desire for supposed savings is becoming the sole driving force for additional base closure, without consideration of continuing requirements. The Department has not identified the up-front cost of doing another closure round and I am worried that, based on experience, most of the claimed savings will not materialize, or be used for modernization. 
Mr. President, it is also important that the Congress understands on how the Department plans to proceed with the next BRAC and whether it will focus on facilities where excess capacity truly exists. I do not need to remind my colleagues that we have had four rounds of base closures, and that many of our communities have endured tremendous turmoil and great losses because of them. These communities were under the impression that the closures they endured would resolve the overcapacity problem. I recall the Department's claiming that BRAC 95 would be `The Mother of all BRACs.' In facts, this was a gross overstatement. I suggest that the Presidential campaign had a role in limiting the scope of BRAC 95, and the communities and the Nation are now bearing the consequences of that action. 
Despite the stated good intentions of my colleagues, I oppose taking action at this time. We must have a better understanding of the excess capacity, what the future military requirements will be and how the Department will pay for this expensive undertaking. Until we have that information, I urge the Senate to vote against this amendment.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator Wellstone in regard to the School Breakfast Program. 
I remind my colleagues that the President proposed the repeal of these startup grants during last year's welfare debate. In addition, the Democratic substitute welfare reform bill contained a provision to repeal these grants. Obviously, people across the political spectrum believe this grant program to be unnecessary. 
I also remind my colleagues that this requirement was not identified in the budget request, and presently, about four in every five low-income children already attend a school with a school breakfast program. The breakfast program has expanded to the extent that it is not clear additional funds are necessary or would have the effect of bringing more schools into the program. 
The last point I want to make is that transferring funds from the Department of Defense, even making the authority discretionary, is bad precedent. We shouldn't make this a precedent. We, in the Congress, should make these decisions and not delegate them to the Secretary of Defense. 
Mr. President, we have a budget agreement. We should not void this agreement and our responsibilities to make these decisions. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I propose an amendment that would extend the Chiropractic Health Care Demonstration Program for 2 years and would include the National Capitol region as a demonstration site. 
In the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995, Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to conduct a demonstration program to determine whether chiropractic health care should be provided as part of the military health care system. The legislation requires a comprehensive evaluation of the program. Representatives of the chiropractic health care community are required to be included in the evaluation process. 
The National Capitol region was not one of the 10 sites selected to be part of the demonstration. My amendment would expand the demonstration to include the National Capitol region. In order to include the experiences of chiropractic care in the National Capitol region in the evaluation, I propose to extend the demonstration program for 2 additional years. I am confident that this amendment will result in a better evaluation of the chiropractic care demonstration. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment offered by Senator Wellstone to reduce defense spending. The budget agreement represents what is available for defense spending, not what is required. This amendment reduces defense funding below the amount that was agreed to by both the congressional and administrative budget negotiators. 
Mr. President, we have been down this road before, but it seems that some of my colleagues have forgotten where it leads. Those who oppose a strong defense often attempt to justify their position by reminding us that the cold war is over. They conclude that defense spending should be lower because we do not face an obvious danger from a threat like the Soviet Union. They make a simple argument. This argument is appealing because it provides an easy solution to our funding problems--but the argument is wrong and dangerous. 
While our Nation no longer faces a cold war danger, the world is still a dangerous place. The belief that continual reductions to defense are in order is not only ignoring reality, it also overlooks requirements for both present and future force readiness. We ask our men and women in uniform to respond to crises all over the world every day. Right now, we have United States troops on duty in Bosnia, in the skies over Iraq, and on ships at sea near any actual or potential trouble spot in the world. 
The Chief of Staff of the Army, General Reimer, testified that, 
Requirements have risen 300 percent. . . . Excessive time away from home is often cited by quality professionals as the reason for their decision to leave the military. It is common to find soldiers that have been away from home . . . for 140, 160 or 190 days of this past year. 
The Secretary of the Air Force, Dr. Widnall, testified that, 
Since Desert Storm, we have averaged three to four times the level of overseas deployment as we did during the Cold War. 
The problem remains that we will not require less of our servicemen and women. At the same time, some of my colleagues seek to continue to reduce defense spending. This is not right. Deployments to trouble spots have not slowed down. We have not stopped sending our young service people all over the world. 
Arguments are made that the Pentagon could find all the money it needs by eliminating wasteful spending. Mr. President, this is probably true of many programs, not just defense. No one supports wasteful spending. But concerning the Defense Department, Secretary Cohen is taking action. He has just finished and delivered the Department's report on the Quadrennial Defense Review [QDR], a review of the national military strategy, force structure, and assets necessary to carry out it out. He has recently established another panel to push the Defense Department toward more business-like operations. The Armed Services Committee has already held one hearing concerning the QDR. More hearings will be held. 
Mr. President we must remember that the QDR is an attempt to define our military requirements for our future military security, but we must deter wars with ships, planes, and tanks today. There is a price for freedom. This is the price for world leadership. As Secretary Cohen stated: 
Having highly ready forces that can go anywhere at any time really spells the difference between victory and defeat and it also spells the difference between being a superpower and not being one. 
Mr. President, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to oppose this amendment that would intend to cut defense spending. It is absolutely necessary that we maintain defense for the security of this Nation. I yield the floor. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Inhofe, I propose an amendment that would suspend all burial entitlements in Arlington National Cemetery or any other cemetery administered by the Secretary of a military department to any person convicted of a Federal capital offense. 
On Wednesday, June 18, the Senate passed S-923, denying veterans benefits in Federal capital cases, by a vote of 98 to 0. This legislation was introduced by Senator Specter, chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and was intended to preclude persons convicted of a capital Federal offense, entitlement to veterans benefits, including burial in a national cemetery. 
Mr. President, Arlington National Cemetery, the Soldiers and Airmen's Home Cemetery in Washington, DC and various cemeteries on military installations around the country are administered by the armed services and, as such, are not affected by the change to title 38, United States Code. The amendment that I propose today will deny any person convicted of a Federal capital offense the entitlement to burial in Arlington National Cemetery, the Soldiers and Airmen's Home Cemetery, or any other cemetery administered by the Secretary of a military department. 
This amendment complements the bill introduced by Senator Specter and passed by the Senate this past Wednesday, and completes what I believe was the intent of the Senate in that vote. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

The amendment would return property that Hale County, Alabama donated in 1988 to the Federal Government for the purpose of constructing an Army Reserve center. Now the Army, due to changes in priority, cannot construct on the site until after fiscal year 2000. 
Since the community donated the property with expectations of a Reserve center and the Army has not lived up to these expectations, I believe that returning the property using this special legislation is appropriate. I urge the Senate to adopt the amendment.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I consider this a matter of national security and, therefore, I support the efforts of the Senator from Mississippi to require export licenses for computers --in short, supercomputers to tier 3 countries, such as Russia, China, India, and Pakistan. 
For several years, both the Strategic Subcommittee and the Acquisition and Technology Subcommittee, chaired by the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Smith, have conducted hearings on the administration's export policies on dual-use technologies with military applications. The concerns expressed by Senators Cochran and Durbin is one of the issues which Senator Smith was concerned about, and which he explored during his hearings. 
The export of the high-performance computers to countries of concern could have a significant and potentially detrimental impact on United States and allied security interests. 
The alleged export of the high-performance computers to Russia and China recently causes me great concern. The computers are more capable than any computer known to have been in use in those countries. The export of these computers was accomplished without export licenses. Evidently, the Russian Government told the companies that sold the computers that they would be used for modeling of Earth water pollution. However, subsequent to the sale, officials from the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy stated that the computers would be used to maintain its nuclear weapons stockpile, to confirm the reliability of its nuclear arsenal, and to ensure the proper working order of the nuclear stockpile under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
Mr. President, according to U.S. export policy, the sale of high-powered computers that would directly or indirectly support nuclear weapons activities is prohibited. 
Mr. President, I believe the Senator's amendment to require a license to export high-powered supercomputers with a 2,000 million theoretical operation range is appropriate. 
I ask unanimous consent that I be added as an original cosponsor of the amendment offered by the Senator from Mississippi.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes before the Senate begins consideration of the fiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill to explain why the Armed Services Committee filed two separate Defense authorization bills. 
Yesterday, as most of you observed, there was objection to a consent request to take up S. 924, the bill the committee reported to the floor for consideration. This objection was based on a number of provisions involving public depots--specifically--Air Force Logistics Centers. Senator Inhofe, the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee included these provisions in his subcommittee markup. They were approved by the subcommittee and the full committee in the markup and therefore were included in the bill which the committee voted unanimously to report to the floor. 
Senators from other States who did not agree to these provisions would not consent to S. 924 being considered by the Senate. I believe all Senators acted in the interests of their states and their perception of what was in the best interests of the Government. This issue affects a great many jobs in all of these States and is an important economic issue within each State. 
I want to commend Senator Inhofe for stepping forward and offering to strip these provisions out of the bill. The committee met yesterday and, at his request, reported out a bill that does not include the provisions that provided the basis for objection. Therefore, the Senate can proceed to consideration of the Defense authorization bill, now S. 936. The committee did not publish a report to accompany S. 936 and deems Senate Report 105-29, minus sections 311, 312, and 313, as the report to accompany S. 936. 
I understand the importance of this issue to each of you. I want to especially thank and commend Senator Inhofe for his courageous and unselfish act in moving to remove the basis for objection so that this bill, which is so critical to our Armed Forces and our national security, can be considered by the Senate. 
I want to emphasize that all Senators reserve their rights to offer amendments on this issue on the floor while the bill is being considered. I understand that while the bill is on the floor, Senators and staff will continue to search for a solution to this very difficult issue. 
I want to thank all Senators for their consideration. We hear a lot of talk on this floor about the loss of comity in the Senate. I believe this is an indication of how Senators can act cooperatively on difficult issues. In this case, it took a courageous Senator, Senator Inhofe, to make the difference and I thank him again on behalf of the committee.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, national security remains the federal government's most important obligation to its citizens. The Committee on Armed Services recognizes its critical role within the Senate in carrying out the powers relating to national security which are granted to Congress in the Constitution. These include the power to: declare war; raise and support Armies; provide and maintain a Navy; make rules for the government and regulation of the Land and Naval Forces; provide for organizing, arming and disciplining the militia; give its advice and consent to treaties and to the nominations of officers of the United States. 
The members of the committee further understand the importance of the committee's jurisdiction within the Senate over matters relating to the common defense, the Department of Defense, the Military Departments, and the national security programs of the Department of Energy. 
The Armed Services Committee completed its markup last Thursday afternoon after 4 days of careful deliberation, voting unanimously to approve of the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization bill. I believe we have a good bill with a better balance between personnel quality of life programs, readiness, and modernization. 
The budget agreement reached this year represents a historic endeavor by the Congress and the President to reach a balanced budget by fiscal year 2002. While the budget agreement protects our military forces from unrealistic and unwise cuts, the committee remains concerned that the funding levels for defense may not provide sufficient funds to adequately sustain over time the personnel, quality of life, readiness, and modernization programs critical to our military services. The committee intends that the achievement of a balanced budget will not adversely affect the readiness and capabilities of our military forces and will endeavor, within the funds agreed upon for defense in the budget agreement, to ensure their essential readiness and capabilities. Changes in the world situation or threat, and adverse impacts from funding shortfalls on general readiness or on vital operational capabilities, are among the trends that might indicate a requirement for additional funds for defense. In such cases, the committee believes that national security requirements must take precedence over lesser priorities within the budget. 
In this bill, the committee worked to achieve a more appropriate balance between near-term and long-term readiness through investments in modernization, infrastructure, and research; maintenance of sufficient end-strengths at all grade levels and policies supporting the recruitment and retention of high quality personnel; fielding of the types and quantities of weapons systems and equipment needed to fight and win decisively with minimal risk to our troops; and ensuring an adequate, safe and reliable nuclear weapons capability. 
The committee worked to protect the quality of life of our military personnel and their families. Quality of life initiatives include provisions designed to provide equitable pay and benefits to military personnel, including a 2.8 percent pay raise to protect against inflation, and the restoration of appropriate levels of funding for the construction and maintenance of troop billets and military 
family housing. 
The committee remains concerned about military readiness. To ensure that U.S. Armed Forces remain the preeminent military power in the world, readiness requirements must be adequately funded. 
The committee is also concerned about the continuing migration of modernization funds to operations and maintenance accounts. We have consistently recommended a more robust, progressive modernization effort which will not only provide capabilities requisite for future military operations, but will lower future operational and maintenance costs as well. 
The committee has increased investment in the broad spectrum of research and development activities to ensure that U.S. military forces remain superior in technology to any potential adversary. We believe that effective development of advanced technologies will be a key factor in determining the victors on future battlefields. A program of stable, long-term investment in science and technology will remain vital to United States dominance of combat on land, at sea, in the air, and in space. 
The committee also directed a more detailed programming and budgeting process for the reserve components. The utilization and effectiveness of reserve component forces are dependent on proper funding to enhance their readiness and capabilities. 
Finally, the committee sought to accelerate the development and deployment of theater missile defense systems and to provide adequate funding for a national missile defense system to preserve the option to deploy such a system in fiscal year 2003. This bill also supports expeditious deployment of land and sea-based theater missile defense systems to protect United States and allied forces against the growing threat of cruise and ballistic missiles. 
The committee intends that, within the balanced budget agreement, we will provide adequately for our men and women in uniform to defend our Nation. The committee will continue to examine the adequacy of the funds we allocate to our national security. At the same time, we must search for ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our defense establishment--especially in the support structure--so that we can achieve savings to devote to the cutting edge of our military combat forces. 
The national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998 reflects a bipartisan approach to our national security interests, and provides a clear basis and direction for U.S. national security policies and programs into the 21st century. 
Let me make it clear to my colleagues--we do not have much time to complete action on this bill. If you have amendments, please come to the floor and introduce your amendment now. Remember that if you are adding anything to this bill that requires additional funding, you must provide a legitimate offset. 
Mr. President, I want to close by thanking all the Senators on the committee and commend them for their hard work on this bill. All 18 Senators on the committee voted for the bill. 
I also want to thank the staff on both sides and commend them for their hard work on the bill. I also ask unanimous consent that a list of members of the Armed Services Committee staff be included at this point in the Record in recognition of their dedication and hard work.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, tomorrow it is the hope of the majority leader that the Senate will be able to consider amendments to the DOD authorization bill. Following the DOD bill, the Senate will conduct a period for routine morning business. Votes will not occur on Friday of this week. On Monday, the Senate will begin the reconciliation bill. However, all votes with respect to that bill on Monday will be stacked to occur on Tuesday, June 24, at 9:30 a.m. Therefore, rollcall votes will occur beginning at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday. I remind all Members that there is a lot of work to be done before the Senate adjourns for the July 4 recess. Therefore, I would appreciate all Senators' cooperation in order to complete our business in a responsible fashion.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to favorably report out from the Committee on Armed Services an original bill, without a written report, which is a second version of the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. 
This bill is identical to S. 924, the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998, ordered reported by the Committee on Armed Services on June 12, 1997, except that it does not contain sections 311, 312, and 313, pertaining to depot-level activities of the Department of Defense, which were contained in subtitle B of title III of that bill.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Senate has a very able majority leader. It is his business to take matters up after the committees have acted and to get action one way or the other. The Senate Armed Services Committee has brought forth a bill here. It is ready to be acted on. Why is this delayed? Some Senators are not pleased with what it contains. 
Now, any Senator who is not pleased with any portion of this bill and wishes to amend it or repeal it has an opportunity to offer an amendment to do that. But to say to the Senate, we are going to object to even taking up the bill, even considering the bill, and holding up the work of the Senate--isn't it reasonable to go forward with this bill, let amendments be offered, let them be acted on? That is the democratic way. 
Now, the Senate Armed Services Committee passed this bill out unanimously. Every member of the Senate Armed Services Committee voted for it. Every Republican and every Democrat voted for it. It cannot be too bad a bill in view of the unanimous support it has received. 
Again, I repeat, any Member who is dissatisfied with any portion of this bill has an opportunity to offer an amendment to the bill to their liking. I hope the objections to going forward with the bill and considering it will be discontinued and we can proceed with the welfare of the Senate which is to take up this bill and act on it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senator Hollings, a bill which will suspend the duties imposed on certain equipment used to manufacture earthmoving tires. Currently, these machines are not manufactured in the United States nor is a substitute readily available. Therefore, suspending the duties on these items would not adversely affect domestic industries. 
Mr. President, suspending the duty on these machines will benefit the consumers of earthmoving tires. Currently, demand for these tires exceeds supply and this suspension would not harm other manufacturers. I hope the Senate will consider this measure expeditiously.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the primary mission of any army is to fight and win the wars of the nation which it protects. For the past 222 years, since June 14, 1776, the soldiers of the United States Army have valiantly and successfully defended the interests, ideals, and people of our Nation. 
The American Army that was born on that June day a little more than two centuries ago is very different from the military force that meets our Nation's security needs as we prepare to enter the new millenium. The soldiers of our first Army were largely untrained, were poorly and infrequently paid, and faced tremendous logistical burdens. It is truly testament to the leadership abilities of General Washington that he was able to hold his troops together in the face of such odds. Of course, the men and women who serve in today's Army receive months of intensive and excellent training before they join their units, are paid fair wages on a regular basis, and benefit from a commitment to creating a professional, career oriented force. Despite these differences, one thing that has remained constant about those who have served in the United States Army over the past 222 years is that these are largely men and women who are selfless individuals and who are motivated by a patriotic desire to make a difference. From Valley Forge to Sierra Leone, no nation's army has benefitted more from the efforts of a finer array of people than our's. 
Throughout its history, the American Army and its soldiers have served with distinction on literally every continent of the world. Minutemen, Johnny Reb & Billy Yank, Rough Riders, Doughboys, Dogfaces, and GI Joes have stood up to dictators, deposed tyrants, beaten back communism, defended freedom, and protected all that we hold dear. Additionally, 
our soldiers have served as a grassroots diplomatic corps in combat boots, spreading to people around the globe the knowledge that Americans are peaceful, that there is no finer form of government than democracy, and that we prefer building friendships with the citizens of other nations to fighting them in wars. There is no question that in many ways, a candy bar given to a small child from a smiling GI is the best form of foreign aid and diplomatic relations that can be undertaken by the United States. 
While the battlefield accomplishments of the United States Army are impressive and unequalled in history, the missions of today's Army go far beyond that of warfighting. In addition to being able to act and react decisively to threats to our Nation no matter where they might arise, our Army is now tasked with a number of non-traditional missions which range from providing fresh water to refugees in Rwanda to keeping the peace in Bosnia. Though these missions are more varied and decidedly different from simply containing or destroying our enemies, our soldiers have characteristically embraced their new responsibilities without complaint and are carrying out their duties professionally. 
As we approach the new century and look to the future, Americans have good cause to be optimistic. Our Nation is enjoying a period of prosperiety, the world is in a relativly peaceful state, and we no longer are in a Cold War contest with another superpower, however, we must not allow ourselves to be lulled into a state of complacency. While things are calm now, we must remember that threats to our security and interest can crop up suddenly and we must remain vigiliant for such developments. We cannot ignore our military and those who serve in them, to do so would undermine years of hard work and the significant investment we have made in building the finest and most technologically advanced fighting forces ever known to man. Clearly the Army will continue to have a critical role in assuring that the United States remains secure and that the world remains a stable place where disputes are resolved in manners short of warfare. 
Mr. President, as the Army celebrates its 222nd birthday, it is important that we pause from our duties to remember the men and women who have served in the ranks of this service throughout its history. It is easy to forget that those who protect us and who carryout the policies we develop in this Chamber are individuals who are young, making many sacrifices, and have volunteered to protect the Nation. Their service is invaluable and they should be commended for their efforts. On this occasion I say to each of these soldiers, from the newest graduate of Fort Jackson to Chief of Staff Reimer, a happy 222nd birthday and thank you for all you do to keep the United States free and safe.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in my almost 42 years of service to the U.S. Senate, I have probably had more than one thousand individuals work for me as members of my personal and committee staffs. Among these legions, I have been fortunate to have had a number of particularly capable, dedicated, and selfless men and women who truly went above and beyond the call of duty in assisting me and in carrying out their duties as staffers. Today, I rise to pay tribute to Miss Kathryn Hook, a person who has been with me for just short of 30 years, whose work and efforts have been invaluable, and to many South Carolinians, is as much a part of my office as I am. Sadly, today marks Kathryn's last day on the job. 
A woman with a warm and outgoing personality, Kathryn first arrived in my office in 1967 and immediately began to make friends not only among my staff, but with our neighbors in other Senate offices. I recall that at that time the late Bobby Kennedy was one of my colleagues, and he had an office adjacent to mine. As he would walk down the halls with his dogs, he would almost inevitably stop into my reception room to say `hello' to Kathryn. It is my understanding that later, when Senator Kennedy ran for President, he asked Kathryn if she was interested in working on his South Carolina campaign activities, and as tempting and flattering an offer as that most certainly must have been, commendably, Kathryn chose to stay in my employ. It is a decision that I am grateful she made. 
For almost three decades, Kathryn has been such a fixture on my staff, she has earned the title of `Dean of Women,' and she has made countless contributions to the operations of this office in many different ways. Working at the back of the reception room of 217 Russell, dubbed the `Dogwood Alcove' because of the personal touches she has made to her workspace, Kathryn has pleasantly, politely, and warmly greeted probably tens of thousands of visitors to my office, ranging from constituents who have come by to say `hello,' to senior American and foreign government officials who are making official calls on matters of policy. In each case, she has demonstrated the famed hospitality of South Carolinians, making anyone who enters my suite feel as though they are a long lost friend, and making sure that they know that they are welcome in my office. 
Perhaps more importantly, though, is the influence she has had on young staffers who have worked under her. Kathryn is a woman of high and uncompromising standards, and a strong work ethic. In the course of her career, she has passed these commendable qualities and characteristics on to those who have been her direct subordinates, as well as to many other staffers who have worked with her through the years. There is no question that Kathryn has left her mark on an untold number of Strom Thurmond staffers, and that her influence has benefitted these individuals both while they worked for me, and in subsequent jobs. I have no doubt that there are hundreds of people, particularly women, who owe their success in life to the lessons they learned from Kathryn Hook. 
Of course, Kathryn's contributions go far beyond that of her duties in the reception room and as the personal assistant to my chief of staff. She is the point of contact for any number of South Carolinians, particularly those from her hometown of Florence, who know Kathryn and feel comfortable contacting her on a multitude of issues that range from correcting problems with a relative's Social Security check, to legislative issues. Kathryn's intimate knowledge of office policy, procedures, and history has made her a useful resource for staff members who need advice and guidance on issues or have a question that can only be answered by her institutional memory. 
Mr. President, Kathryn Hook is a unique and special woman in many different ways, and it is impossible to cite all of the highlights of her career or to adequately summarize the impact she has had in my office. Suffice it to say, her efforts over the years have helped me do my job as a legislator and in assisting the people of South Carolina. Kathryn's long tenure of invaluable service to our State was recently recognized and honored by the Governor of South Carolina who presented her with our State's highest award, `The Order of the Palmetto,' in a ceremony held in the Strom Thurmond Room of the U.S. Capitol. Regrettably, I do not have an equivalent commendation with which I can present her, but I hope she knows that I have valued her faithful service, will certainly miss her sense of humor and energetic personality, and that I am pleased to count her among my friends. It is a bittersweet day on which I say goodbye to Kathryn Hook, as not only is it her last day on my staff, but it is her birthday as well. I wish her many more years of health and happiness, and I thank her for her many years of devoted and selfless service. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it hardly seems that almost 43 years have passed since December 24, 1954, when I first became a U.S. Senator by raising my right hand and taking the oath of office from then Vice President Richard Nixon. Though it is only 527 miles, this is certainly a long way from where I began my career in public service in 1923 as a teacher in a high school in rural McCormick, SC. I am pleased to say that it has been a rewarding and gratifying journey. 
When I graduated from Clemson College and took my first job, my only ambition in life was to be able to help people. As I worked to educate my students in McCormick--and later in Ridge Spring and in Edgefield--I quickly realized that I could have a greater impact in providing for the learning needs of the children of South Carolina by shaping policy. I ran for, and was elected Edgefield County Superintendent of Education in 1928, and during my tenure in that post, I implemented many measures which raised the standards of education in that county. I also got my first taste of how much impact a person can have through elected office. 
At that time, South Carolina was an economically challenged place well before the great crash of the stock market which sent the Nation plummeting into the Great Depression. Without trying to sound melodramatic, life was hard back then, the banks were failing, businesses were closing, and people were very concerned about the future. As someone who was eager to try and improve conditions in my home county, as well as throughout the Palmetto State, I declared for State Senator in 1932 and was elected to office. For 5 years, I helped shape policy that guided South Carolina out of the depths of the Depression by, among other things, strengthening education; establishing a rural electrification program; helping our farmers; and by establishing the South Carolina Public Service Authority known as Santee-Cooper. 
In subsequent years I became involved in a number of different public service endeavors, some of which have been mentioned by others here today in their flattering floor statements about me. One position after another, and though I did not deliberately set out on this path, each job I had--State senator, State circuit court judge, Army officer, attorney, and Governor--seemed to be leading toward the U.S. Senate. 
To those who want to dedicate a part of their lives to serving the Nation, I can think of no better place to do so than in the U.S. Senate, and my time in this institution has truly been the happiest and most rewarding in my life. Over the past four decades, I have been pleased to have been a part of hundreds, if not thousands, of worthwhile endeavors through my duties as a Senator, and my service on the Committees on the Judiciary and Armed Services and Veterans' Affairs. 
I knew when I moved up here with my first wife, the late Jean Crouch Thurmond, that I would never earn wealth from my tenure in the Senate, but financial gain was never a consideration for me when I ran for this office. In fact, financial compensation is not why I or anyone else becomes involved in public service. We do it for the opportunity to help others and to give back to the Nation which has provided us with so many opportunities. 
There is no other job in the world that allows us to have a more direct impact in rendering service than that of a Senator. The work we do here benefits millions of Americans, and how can one not help but take great satisfaction and pride in such important service. Through oversight, legislation, and old fashioned constituent service, each of us is able to help the citizens of our respective States, as well as build a Nation which is stronger and better for all who live here. I am very proud of the fact that over the past four decades, I 
have had a role in building the finest military force that history has seen. I am proud of the work we have done on the Judiciary Committee which has helped to safeguard the Constitution, keep the judicial branch independent, and provided sound policies to help make our streets safe. Most importantly, I am pleased that I have been able to use my Senate office to help hundreds of thousands of South Carolinians interact with a government bureaucracy that can sometimes be confusing, unyielding, and intimidating. 
It has been a special pleasure for me to help the veterans who serve this Nation in times of war, as well as the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. 
As I stand here and reflect upon my career, I have nothing but positive memories. During the course of my tenure, I have had the privilege of serving with some of the truly great figures in the history of this Body. I have been fortunate to make many good friends through my service in the Senate. I am often asked how I want to be remembered, and my answer today is the same as it was in 1954, or would have been in 1923--for being an honest, patriotic, and helpful person. I would like to be remembered as one who cares; cares for his family, his friends, and cares for his Nation. 
Though I look forward to completing this term, when I finally retire in 2002, I hope that if I leave any legacy, it is that answering the call of public service is an honorable and worthy vocation. It is only through the efforts of men and women, regardless of their political ideology, who believe in working for the greater good that we will be able to assure that the United States remains a bastion of freedom, justice, and hope. 
In closing, I wish to thank my colleagues for their beautiful words concerning my public service. It has been a privilege to serve with such able dedicated, and wonderful people. I thank them for their many courtesies. God bless this magnificent body and the United States of America.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today a Senate resolution proclaiming August 16, 1997, as `National Airborne Day.' 
On June 25, 1940, the War Department authorized the Parachute Test Platoon to experiment with the potential use of airborne troops. The Parachute Test Platoon, which was composed of 48 volunteers, performed the first official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940. The success of the platoon led to the formation of a large and successful airborne contingent that has served from World War II until the present. 
The 82d Airborne Division was the first airborne division to be organized. In a 2-year period during World War II, the regiments of the 82d served in Italy at Anzio, in France at Normandy--where I landed with them--and at the Battle of the Bulge. During this tumultuous period in our Nation's history, these brave soldiers served with distinction, as they have done for 55 years. It is only fitting that we honor them. 
I urge you to join with me in sponsoring National Airborne Day to express our support for the members of the airborne community and also our gratitude for their tireless commitment to our Nation's defense and ideals.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to greatly increase the economic benefits to our Nation from cruise ship tourism. This measure, called the United States Cruise Tourism Act, will implement one of the recommendations of the White House Conference on Travel and Tourism. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Murkowski in introducing this bill. 
Pleasure cruises aboard ocean-going vessels represent one of the fastest growing segments of our tourism industry. Over the past 5 years, cruise ship tourism has grown by 50 percent and is expected to grow at a rate of 5 1/2 percent annually over the next few years. When a cruise ship is in port, as much as $250,000 is spent on maintenance and supplies, and cruise passengers spend an average of $205 a day. Although 85 percent of these cruise passengers are Americans, most of the revenues now go to foreign destinations. 
This export of American tourist dollars is the unintended consequence of the outdated Passenger Vessel Services Act [PSA] of 1886. This act prohibits non-U.S.-flag vessels from carrying passengers between U.S. ports. Unfortunately, since the U.S.-flag fleet is now down to one cruise ship, this restriction makes passenger cruise travel between U.S ports virtually impossible. Today, the passenger cruise industry in the United States consists primarily of foreign flag vessels which, under current law, must sail to and from foreign ports. This prevents many of our mid-coast ports such as Charleston, San Francisco, Baltimore and others from participating in the cruise industry because of their distance from foreign ports. As a result, potential cruise itineraries on the east and west coast, the gulf coast, the Great Lakes and the coast of Alaska have yet to be developed. 
Mr. President, our legislation would allow our port cities and shore-based tourism businesses to take advantage of this booming area of tourism while providing incentives for the rehabilitation of the U.S.-flag cruise industry. This bill would enact a narrow waiver to the PSA to permit large, ocean-going, foreign-flag cruise ships to carry passengers between U.S. ports. Subsequently, as U.S. companies become attracted to the business, U.S.-flag ships will enter the market. When this happens, foreign vessels would be required to reduce their capacity to make room for more U.S. competitors. This provision also addresses the concern expressed by many of our shipyards. They have complained that the uncertainty over the continuation of the PSA was chilling their efforts to obtain investment in a U.S.-built cruise ship. If enacted, our bill would assure a market for the ships they build. 
Finally, Mr. President, this legislation in no way affects the Jones Act. The Jones Act is an entirely separate statute enacted in 1920 to protect our cargo fleet and assure that we have a qualified merchant marine in times of war. Also, this measure does not waive the PSA for any trade where there currently exists an American competitor. U.S. ferries, river boat cruises, and cruises on the Atlantic intra-coastal waterway would not be affected. 
Mr. President, our country has a beautiful coastline and Americans should not have to join the armed services or buy a yacht to see it. Moreover, our tourist industry is one of the most successful contributors to the economic growth of our Nation. We should not permit artificial barriers to inhibit the good work of the people in this industry. This legislation will remove that barrier. I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this coming Monday, May 26, our Nation will observe Memorial Day. For some Americans, Memorial Day is simply the opening of the summer vacation season. However, for millions of patriotic Americans this day is much more. To us, Memorial Day is the day we pay tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defending this Nation and our freedoms. 
Honoring those who died in war is a practice and custom of many cultures and countries. In the United States, tributes to fallen soldiers took place in many locations during the War Between the States. An early observance occurred on May 30, 1865, in Charleston, SC, when a group of school children scattered flowers over trenches in which the remains of several hundred Union soldiers had been interred. Another commemoration occurred in Columbus, MS, on April 25, 1866, when a group of women visited a cemetery to decorate the graves of Confederate soldiers who had fallen in battle at Shiloh. Flowers were placed on the nearby bare and neglected graves of Union soldiers as well. Throughout the North and South, this practice of decorating graves became more widespread. 
On May 5, 1868, Gen. John A. Logan issued a general order that designated the 30th day of May, 1868, as a day for decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country. Decoration Day, as it came to be celebrated, was first observed that day at Arlington National Cemetery, which held the remains of 20,000 Union dead and several hundred Confederate dead. By the end of the 19th century, Memorial Day, or Decoration Day ceremonies were being held throughout the Nation. In 1971 Memorial Day was declared a national holiday, and was placed on the last Monday in May. 
Mr. President, Memorial Day services will be held throughout the Nation next Monday, in our national cemeteries, where thousands of war dead are buried. A national service will be held at Arlington Cemetery. Local traditions will be included in ceremonies at the Punchbowl Center in Hawaii. Decorations will be placed in the 114 national cemeteries operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs National Cemetery System. A few other national cemeteries are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense and the Department of Interior. I encourage my colleagues, and all citizens of this Nation, to visit these cemeteries and pay respect to those who have given their life for their country. 
Mr. President, unfortunately not all activities at our national cemeteries have honored the dead. There have been, unfortunately, instances of vandalism and theft at our national cemeteries. Last month, the Punchbowl in Hawaii, the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, was desecrated by vandals. Vandals caused over $20,000 in damage by spray painting racial epithets and obscenities on graves, marble memorials, and other parts of the cemetery. Other cemeteries, private and State, were also damaged that same weekend. Last year, at the Riverside National Cemetery in California, engraved grave markers were stolen from 128 graves. Months before that incident, over 500 markers were stolen from a storage facility. 
The time has come to demand a stop to this type of insulting behavior. That is why I am introducing the Veterans' Cemetery Protection Act of 1997. This bill is a companion bill to one introduced in the House, H.R. 1532. This bill imposes criminal penalties for vandalism and theft at national cemeteries operated by the VA, the Department of Defense, and the Department of Interior. Penalties for vandalism and theft, are consistent with similar crimes against other Federal property. In addition, the bill establishes penalties for attempted vandalism and theft. I am delighted that Senator McCain, a fellow veteran and true national hero, joins me in introducing this bill. 
Mr. President, as we pause to remember our fallen comrades, it is appropriate that we protect their final resting places. I invite may colleagues to join Senator McCain and me in supporting this legislation.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, when people think of special operations forces, the image that immediately comes to mind is that of the Army's Green Berets and Rangers, or the Navy's SEAL's. Few realize that the Air Force has a special operations element which is robust and impressive. Air Commandos, Combat Controllers, and ParaRescue personnel have all made important contributions to military operations and National Security over the past five decades, and today, I rise to pay tribute to one member of that community, Major Randy O'Boyle, who is about to assume command of the 551st Flight Training Squadron. 
For the past several years, Major O'Boyle has been a tireless and diligent advocate as the Deputy Director of Legislative Affairs for the United States Special Operations Command. In that capacity, he has worked closely with Senators, Representatives, and their staffers in order to explain the missions and needs of this unique, joint-service Command. In the process he has helped to give Members of Congress a better understanding of the capabilities of our Nation's special operators and has provided us with the information necessary for us to help shape policy and the future of our special warfare elements. 
Major O'Boyle was particularly effective in his job as he brought with him to Washington both extensive experience as an Air Force Officer and as a special operator. An accomplished pilot, Randy O'Boyle has literally thousands of hours behind the stick of the Air Force's Pave Low helicopter, an aircraft specifically modified to support special operations. During Operation Just Cause, Randy demonstrated his abilities as a pilot and his coolness under pressure as he flew combat operations in support of Army, Navy, and Air Force special forces personnel as they fought to liberate Panama from the grasp of the dictator Manuel Noriega. Major O'Boyle's experience and expertise was put to good use a little more than a year later during the Gulf War, where he played an instrumental role in helping to plan the coalition forces' first strike into Iraq, kicking off Operation Desert Storm. His intimate knowledge of what is required of both a successful tactical and planning officer provided Major O'Boyle with an unusual insight to how the Special Operations Command functions. His understanding of what the needs of Special Operations personnel are, from the newest member on a Special Forces or SEAL Team to the Commander of one of the SOCOM Theater Commands, assured that he was able to speak knowledgeably and eloquently on literally every aspect of special operations. In addition, his easy-going Midwestern demeanor, engaging personality, and quick-witted sense of humor all assured that he established a bond with those he worked with both in the Department of Defense and in the halls of Congress. 
As Major O'Boyle leaves Washington and heads west to the famed painted landscapes of New Mexico, he leaves many friends who have enjoyed working with him during his assignments here. Though the ranks of the Special Operations Command are filled with nothing but capable individuals, I am certain that SOCOM Legislative Affairs will miss Major O'Boyle's positive and determined attitude and his effective representation of the Command. Without a doubt though, the young Air Commandos who will come under his command at the 551st Training Squadron will benefit greatly from his tutelage. I am especially pleased to note that Randy will pin on the silver oak leaf of a Lieutenant Colonel on June 1, I hope that he continues to enjoy great success in the years to come.

Mr. THURMOND. I planned to speak about 10 minutes on defense, but I did not know that these wonderful accolades were going to come up at this time. I wish to express my deep appreciation to the able Senator from West Virginia, who has been minority leader, majority leader, and every position the Senate had to offer. I guess no man in the history of this country has filled more important positions in the U.S. Senate than Senator Byrd of West Virginia, and he has filled them well. Everything he has undertaken he has done it well. I deeply appreciate the kind words he said today. 
I wish to thank my able colleague, Senator Hollings. Senator Hollings and I are different parties but we have been here a long time together. We respect each other. And I have had the opportunity to work with him on many matters of various kinds and it has been a pleasure to do that. We have never had an argument that I recall. Although we do not always vote alike, we hold each other in respect. I wish to thank him for his kind remarks. He is, as someone stated, the longest-serving junior Senator in the United States, but after this term, if he is still here, maybe he will get to be the senior Senator. Again, I wish to express to Senator Hollings my appreciation for serving with him and working with him. It has been a pleasure to do so, Fritz, and I thank you. 
I wish to thank the able Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. When I came to the Senate I watched different Senators come and go. When Senator Specter came I soon recognized that here was a man of unusual talent, a man of great ability. It has been a pleasure to serve with him. He is a great historian. He can tell many stories about different people on different things and amuse you to the fullest. I deeply appreciate his fine friendship and thank him for his kind remarks here today.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this budget resolution represents a historic endeavor by the Congress and the administration. For the first time in 28 years, we have agreed on a path designed to balance the Federal budget by the year 2002. The fiscal irresponsibility that drove us into a national debt of more than $5 trillion, with interest payments amounting to 15 percent of our annual Federal budgets, was surely leading this Nation toward a day of economic reckoning with severe consequences. I am delighted that, aided by a strong economy, we seem to be moving toward setting our fiscal house in order. 
Despite my enthusiastic support for a balanced budget, I must admit that I remain deeply concerned about the state of our national security and plans for funding our defense establishment in this post-cold-war era. 
When the Clinton administration took office in 1993, it immediately began to cut defense spending. Within the context of the bottom-up review, they cut over $120 billion out of the Future Years Defense Program. Despite this severe underfunding of our military forces, the administration has shown no reluctance to use them. Multilateral peacekeeping operations under the United Nations became the vogue during the early years of the Clinton administration. The debacle in Somalia, where 18 American soldiers were killed in the streets of Mogadishu, awakened the Congress and the American people to the folly of these policies. Despite this concern, less than 2 years later the administration was dispatching U.S. troops to Haiti and then to peackeeping operations in Bosnia. During the first 4 years of the Clinton administration, our military forces were dispatched on more separate deployments than at any other time in our history. 
The tempo of these operations has put tremendous strain on our diminished force structure and its aging equipment. Indeed, the administration's willingness to employ our military forces in peacekeeping operations without regard to the adverse effects of these deployments has further eroded our capability to execute two overlapping major regional contingencies. Defense funds authorized and appropriated for military readiness, personnel and equipment have been depleted to pay for unbudgeted operations that have exceeded $15 billion since 1993. Furthermore, the unprecedented personnel tempo from these operations has dramatically stressed our military personnel and their families. 
The administration's proposed budgets have neglected the necessary immediate investment in force modernization, and justified this by projecting significant funding increases in the outyears, when the administration promised to recapitalize our military forces. Unfortunately, these outyears never arrived. For 6 straight years, the administration's projected increases in the modernization accounts did not materialize. In fact, the amounts requested for the modernization accounts were lower each year than projected by the administration in the previous year. 
In 1995, Republicans gain control of Congress and passed a budget resolution intended to alleviate at least some of the problems caused by the underfunding of the defense budget. Over $18 billion was added to the defense budgets of the 104th Congress. Most of these funds were directed into the modernization accounts which had been so drastically neglected by this administration. 
During negotiations on the recent budget agreement, I urged our budget negotiators to adopt the congressional budget resolution for fiscal years 1998 and 1999, since those numbers were above the administration's request. I also urged that we accept the administration's request for fiscal years 2000 through 2002, when the projected spending targets were above those in our congressional budget resolution. By agreeing to the administration's spending targets in the outyears, we would, in effect, capture in the budget agreement the elusive recapitalization funds for modernization. 
This agreement before us today protects our military forces from unrealistic and unwise cuts in defense. I was encouraged that Secretary Cohen has also supported these more favorable, higher numbers for defense. We do not yet know the full impact on the defense budget resulting from the budget agreement and possible effects of outlay shortfalls in the later years of this agreement. However, I remain concerned that even the highest levels for defense considered in this agreement may not provide sufficient funds to adequately sustain over time the personnel, quality of life, readiness and modernization programs critical to our military services, especially if we continue to use funds from the defense budget to pay for unbudgeted peacekeeping operations. 
Preliminary results emerging from the QDR indicate that the two MRC strategy will remain essentially unchanged. However, even using the administration's higher funding in the outyears, the QDR recommends force structure reductions of up to 130,000 personnel to free minimal funds for essential modernization. Key force modernization programs will also have to be significantly reduced in order to remain within the funding limits of the administration's defense program. 
I hope that, within the balanced budget agreement, we will provide adequately for our men and women in uniform to defend our Nation. It is clear that we must continue now and in the future to examine the adequacy of the funds we allocate to our national security. At the same time, we must continue to search for ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our defense establishment--especially in the support structure--so that we can achieve savings to devote to the cutting edge of our military combat forces. 
It is gratifying to me, after almost 42 years in the Senate, to see the possibility of a balanced budget with adequate funds also provided for our national security. It has been worth fighting for. I pledge to continue the fight. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to revise the formula by which the highway trust fund is apportioned and distributed to the States under the Federal Aid to Highways Program. This measure is cosponsored by Senators Coats, Hollings, Helms, Faircloth, and Hutchinson from Arkansas. 
The current formula was established in 1956 to support the building of a nationwide, interstate highway system. At that time, it was necessary to redistribute the tax revenues from some States to those with large land areas and low population. As it exists now, the present formula is inefficient and unfair. It is inefficient because it is based upon population statistics that were current in 1980. There is no allowance for population shifts in the future and, as a result, high growth areas of the country are left on their own to provide the infrastructure to support growing populations. It is unfair because the disparity in the rates of return creates a policy that, in effect, values a mile of road in one State three times as much as a similar mile of road in another State. 
Mr. President, the interstate highway program has been an enormous success and is now virtually complete. However, the circumstances which gave rise to the present formula have changed and it is now time for a new one. Our legislation corrects both the inefficiency and unfairness of the current formula. It amends the law to provide that the minimum annual allocation to each State from the highway trust fund be equal to that State's share of contributions to the fund. This formula will allocate funds where they are most needed. The General Accounting Office, in a November 1995 study, noted that highway trust fund contributions bear a high correlation to the need for highway funding in a given area. Moreover, under this new formula, as population grows and economic activity increases, additional infrustructure funding will be available. 
Mr. President, this bill presents a fair and workable formula for distributing funds under the next highway bill. I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this legislation.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the CFE Flank Document resolution of ratification. My support of the CFE Flank Document is based largely upon the 14 conditions that the Foreign Relations Committee attached to the resolution of ratification. I am particularly pleased that the Foreign Relations Committee included condition 9, which deals with the Senate's prerogatives on multilateralization of the ABM Treaty. This has been an issue with which the Armed Services Committee has been deeply involved for many years. 
I would strongly oppose any effort to dilute or eliminate condition 9 from the resolution of ratification. Condition 9 does not take a position, as such, on the ABM Treaty or treaty succession. It simply seeks to protect the Senate's prerogatives in case the treaty is substantively changed. I find it difficult to believe that any Member of this body would be opposed to this objective. In my view, it is a solemn and fundamental obligation of a Senator to consistently guard the rights and prerogatives of the Senate, regardless of which political party may occupy the White House at any given time. 
 Mr. President, although international law is ambiguous on the question of treaty succession, the U.S. Constitution and statutory law is clear. As section 232 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995 states, `the United States shall not be bound by any international agreement entered into by the President that would substantively modify the ABM Treaty unless the agreement is entered pursuant to the treaty making power of the President under the Constitution.' This provision originated as an amendment sponsored by Senator Warner of Virginia and Senator Wallop of Wyoming, two of the Senate's foremost experts on the ABM Treaty. 
Notwithstanding the administration's assertion that treaty succession is an executive branch responsibility, or any argument that one might derive from international law, the real issue is simple and clear. Only one overarching question needs to be answered: Does multilateralization of the ABM Treaty constitute a substantive change to the treaty? If so, the President has no choice, under the law and the Constitution, other than to submit such an agreement to the Senate for advice and consent. 
Ironically, those who have asserted that the President does not need to submit the multilateralization agreement to the Senate for advice and consent have not even attempted to answer the one relevant question: Is it a substantive change or not? Instead they have chosen to base their views strictly on ambiguity-laden international law and a simple assertion of executive prerogative. 
If one carefully analyzes the issues associated with ABM Treaty multilateralization, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the ABM Treaty will indeed be modified in several substantive ways. The conferees to the fiscal year 1997 Defense Authorization Act recognized this in stating that `the accord on ABM Treaty succession, tentatively agreed to by the administration, would constitute a substantive change to the ABM Treaty, which may only be entered into pursuant to the treaty making power of the 
President under the Constitution.' This conference language, which was supported overwhelmingly on a bipartisan basis, was the culmination of 2 years of effort by several key Senators on the Armed Services Committee: I have been joined in this fight by Senator Lott of Mississippi, Senator Warner of Virginia, Senator--now Secretary of Defense--Cohen of Maine, and Senator Smith of New Hampshire, as well as other stalwart supporters of the Senate's prerogatives. 
Why would multilateralization of the ABM Treaty constitute a substantive change? First, because the basic strategic rationale for the treaty would be altered. The ABM Treaty was intended to be part of an overarching arms control regime for regulating United States-Soviet competition in strategic offensive forces. But under a multilateral ABM Treaty, some members will have neither strategic offensive nor strategic defensive forces, and hence no direct stake in the treaty's subject matter. Overall, the United States faces strategic and political circumstances that are vastly different than those that existed in 1972 when the ABM Treaty was signed. The Senate must carefully consider how these bear on the issue of treaty succession. 
Second, the ABM Treaty will change from a treaty between two equal parties to one in which different parties have different rights and obligations. Some states will be entitled to a deployed ABM system, others will not. The United States will also face four states rather than one at any future negotiation concerning the future of the treaty. This clearly diminishes the weight of the American vote in the Standing Consultative Commission and increases the complexity of seeking changes or clarifications to the treaty. 
Third, the actual mechanics of the ABM Treaty will be altered by multilateralization since the treaty is largely defined in terms of `national territory.' Some items that are regulated by the treaty, including large phased array radars, are currently located outside the national territory of any of the states that plan to accede to the ABM Treaty. Also, those former Soviet States that opt not to stay in the treaty would be legally permitted to deploy an unlimited ABM system even though their national territory was formerly covered by the treaty's definition of Soviet `national territory.' 
Mr. President, these are only a few of the ways in which a multilateral ABM Treaty would constitute a substantive change from the original treaty. The evidence is overwhelming. For the Senate to do anything other than to insist on its right to provide advice and consent to such an agreement would be an abandonment of its rights and obligations. I urge my colleagues to stand together on this important constitutional prerogative of the Senate. The executive branch must not be permitted to circumvent the Senate on a matter of such fundamental importance.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by my able friend from Virginia, Mr. Warner. 
As the Senator has stated, the Department of the Treasury made an accounting error in 1994 by under reporting $1.59 billion in gas tax receipts for that fiscal year. When the error was discovered in December, fiscal year 1995, the money was credited to the highway trust fund. However, crediting the 1995 trust fund with 1994 money only compounded the mistake because parts of the distribution formulas of our Federal-aid-to-highways program are based on the receipts of the 2 previous years. Consequently, the 1996 and 1997 distributions were severely impacted. 
Following the adjournment of the 104th Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury moved the income from 1995 back to 1994. Subsequently, the Department of Transportation, which has the duty of distributing the money, adjusted its calculation of the contract authority and obligation authority to be distributed to the States under the program for fiscal 1997. No corresponding correction was made for 1996. As a result, 10 States have yet to receive the obligation authority totaling $140 million for fiscal year 1996. 
The Secretary of Transportation proposed legislation purportedly to correct this problem. However, this legislation would not restore the money owed to the 10 States, but rather requests an appropriation of $318 million to make up the difference between what States expected to receive for fiscal year 1997 and what they actually received. 
In the bill before us, there are provisions to restore the $140 million to the 10 States, $318 million to satisfy the expectations for 1997, and an additional $475 million so that donee States would benefit as well. Further, the formula for distributing this last amount of money is not the formula that would apply under the existing authorization, but an entirely new formula contained in the bill itself. This new formula conveniently strips away the one equity adjustment in the ISTEA law that effectively protects donor States--that is the 90 percent of payments adjustment. This provision of ISTEA was enacted to ensure that no matter how badly a State fares in any year under the underlying formula, it could count on the fact that the distribution it receives would not be radically below the amount it puts in. 
The Warner amendment simply recognizes that this is supplementary appropriations for fiscal year 1997 and the money should go out under the ISTEA formula in the regular way. 
This is the proper way to proceed. I commend my friend from Virginia for offering this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to state for the record what I believe the Senate just agreed to in supporting the amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin that would prohibit the obligation or expenditure of funds available in S. 672, the supplemental appropriations bill, for operations or activities of the United States forces stationed on the ground in Bosnia. 
This amendment in no way endorses the actions taken unilaterally by the President to extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia for an additional 18 months beyond the 1-year time frame stipulated in Senate Joint Resolution 44. 
The President never consulted with the Congress to extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia, and the Senate has not voted, by accepting this amendment, to approve the President's decision to extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia until June 1998. 
The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee in October 1996 that United States forces would not be withdrawn from Bosnia until March 1997. They did not consult with the Congress about this short extension, and they assured the committee at the time that there were no plans to extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia beyond that time frame. However, they did note for the record that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was reviewing whether a continued NATO force presence was needed beyond the March 1997 time frame. The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs promised that the Congress would be consulted prior to agreeing to extend the United States force in Bosnia. In fact, the President assured the American public prior to the Presidential election in November that United States forces would not be in Bosnia beyond the time-frame necessary to safely withdraw. 
Very shortly after the United States elections in November 1996, the President announced his intention to support a decision by NATO to extend the presence of a NATO force in Bosnia to implement the Dayton agreement. Following the recommendation of the NATO that a NATO presence remain in Bosnia, the President announced in December 1996 that United States forces would remain in Bosnia, as part of a NATO force until June 1998. 
Once again, I want to emphasize what agreeing to this provision does not do--it does not provide congressional approval for the President's unilateral decision to extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia beyond the 1-year time frame he announced in November 1995 to the American public. 
The President has not consulted with the Congress on his decision to extend the participation of United States forces in a NATO operation in Bosnia. The President has not sought approval of the Congress for that decision to extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia until June 1998. The Senate has not provided its approval, or authorization for the President's decision to extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia. The amendment merely ensures that U.S. forces are taken care of, until such time as they are withdrawn in June 1998, whether or not substantial progress is achieved in the civil implementation of the Dayton agreement, as the President promised. The amendment does not constitute congressional authorization or approval to extend the presence of United States forces in Bosnia.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to recognize the work done on this treaty by the floor managers--both in opposition and in support of this very important international treaty. Both sides have made laudable arguments in supporting their different positions. This subject is one of great importance. I want to especially commend our able majority leader for the long hours he spent working with both floor managers and the administration. 
Mr. President, during the Senate Armed Services Committee's review of the national security implications of the Chemical Weapons Convention, I raised concerns about the ability of the U.S. to comply with the treaty obligation to destroy our chemical stockpile within the timeframe stipulated, the universality of the treaty, the verifiability of the treaty, and the administration's interpretation of the provision on the defensive use of riot control agents by U.S. forces. 
During the committee's hearings on the treaty in August 1994, I took no position on this treaty. I made it clear that the administration would have to convince me that it was in the national security interests of the United States. 
I have concerns about statements made over the past few weeks, by the President and several administration representatives, that if the United States does not ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention, that we would be aligning ourselves on the side of rogue nations, like Iraq and Libya, and against our allies. 
Mr. President, in 1985 the Congress legislated the requirement for the United States to destroy its chemical stockpile, and has reaffirmed that decision every year since that time. The Senate agreed to take actions against Iraq for attacking its neighbor, and against Libya for terrorist actions which resulted in the death of American citizens. How can the President, the Secretary of State and other administration representatives liken a decision by the Senate, in its performance of its constitutional duties to provide advice and consent to international treaties, to be aligning the United States with rogue nations? Regardless of the outcome of the CWC, the United States will continue to destroy its chemical stockpiles. 
Last Sunday, the Secretary of Defense talked about his recent visit to South Korea and the discussions he had about the threat posed to U.S. Forces by the chemical weapons in North Korea. He also mentioned General Tilelli's support for ratification of the CWC because it would reduce the chemical weapons threat faced by his troops in South Korea.  
Mr. President, North Korea has not signed the CWC. As I read the treaty, none of the provisions will apply to nations that have not signed and ratified it. Only trade sanctions will apply to countries that have not signed it. United States ratification of the CWC will not minimize the North Korean chemical weapons threat which face our United States forces. 
Mr. President, I cannot support the Chemical Weapons Convention. I appreciate the efforts made by the White House to work out conditions to the resolution of ratification that respond to concerns raised about the treaty made by Members of the Senate. However, I do not believe they go far enough. I remain concerned about the ability of the intelligence community to verify compliance with the treaty. Rogue nations which pose a military and terrorist threat to the United States have not signed the treaty, and most likely will not sign it. I am also concerned about the potential compromise of U.S. defensive capability through potential transfers of chemical defensive protective equipment, material or information under article X and article XI. 
It is for these reasons that I cannot vote for this treaty.

This year, the nonprofit organization, No Greater Love, which assists the families of Americans who died in service to their country or in terrorist acts, is launching the first annual `Proud to Remember' campaign. The goal of this campaign is to make certain that those who have died in service to our country will be appropriately honored in a patriotic and personal way on this special day of remembrance. In other words, they seek to put `memorial' back into Memorial Day. 
Pursuant to this resolution, on Memorial Day, Monday, May 26, 1997, the entire Nation will be asked to observe a moment of remembrance at 3:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, in honor of those who have sacrificed their lives for us. `Taps' will be played at this time across the country to honor our fallen heroes. 
It is our hope that this moment of remembrance will bring all Americans together in a spirit of respect, patriotism, and gratitude, and also help restore the recognition our veterans deserve for the sacrifices they have made on behalf of our great Nation.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 495, the Chemical and Biological Threat Reduction Act of 1997, offered by the Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, and others. 
There has been criticism of this legislation by Members of the Senate as well as by the administration. The criticism largely centers around charges that it falls short as an alternative to the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC]. 
I do not know what the outcome will be of the Senate vote on advice and consent to ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. This legislation could possibly be an alternative in the event two-thirds of the Members present do not vote for the treaty. On the other hand, it may also complement the treaty, if it passes. 
I want the Record to be clear, whatever the outcome of the vote on the CWC, I support efforts by the Senate to provide comprehensive criminal, civil, and other penalties for the acquisition, possession, transfer, or use of chemical or biological weapons. I also want the Record to reflect my continued support for the destruction of the U.S. unitary stockpile. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for S. 495.

Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, just across the street from the east front of the U.S. Capitol stands the Minute Man Memorial building, which houses the Reserve Officers Association of the United States, one of the most patriotic and self-sacrificing organizations in the Nation. This year marks the association's 75th anniversary, and its origins, history, and accomplishments are all well worth remembering. 
At the beginning of World War I, America found herself unprepared to enter the fight in Europe because we had an inadequate supply of trained military leaders for our Armed Forces. Confusion prevailed at the War Department while recruiters rushed to select, and the military hastened to train, an officer corps that would be large enough to lead `Doughboys' and `Devil Dogs' on the battlefields of France and Germany. Despite the lack of initial preparation, the United States' entry into World War I proved to be the decisive factor in securing victory against our enemies and bringing peace to the continent. After the armistice was signed and our troops came home, American military leaders were wisely determined to never be faced with another shortage of commissioned officers, and on October 2, 1922, 140 reserve officers, at the suggestion of General of the Army John J. Pershing, met at the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC. At that meeting, General Pershing said, `I consider this gathering perhaps one of the most important, from a military point of view, that has assembled in Washington or anywhere else within the confines of this country within my time,' and the Reserve Officers Association of the United States [ROA] was organized. 
The new found commitment to a well-trained and equipped force got off to a positive start with the passage of the National Defense Act of 1920 which created a 2 million member `Citizens Army,' to be led by a 200,000 member Officers Reserve Corps. However, it was clear that the success of this civilian army and reserve corps of officers would depend entirely upon the patriotic and voluntary spirit of Americans. With this understanding, General Pershing charged ROA with the responsibility to recruit the corps, develop public support for it, and petition Congress to appropriate adequate funds to train these citizen service members. 
As the United States grappled with recovering from the Depression and getting its 
economy back on its feet, the seeds of war were being sowed in Europe and Asia, and on December 7, 1941, a surprise attack on American Navy facilities at Pearl Harbor finally pushed our Nation back into another global conflict, World War II. Though still under-prepared for war, we thankfully had an Officer Reserve Corps that had grown to 115,000 and the chaotic rush to recruit officers that took place in the First World War was not repeated. General George C. Marshall said, `In contrast with the hectic days of 1917 * * * with no adequate reservoir of officers to draw upon * * * we now have available in the Officers Reserve Corps a great pool of trained men available for instant service.' Clearly, the R.O.A. had done their job. 
During the war, the ROA suspended its activities as its members were off serving in the branches of the various armed services; once, however, the hostilities ceased and the troops came home, the ROA resumed its activities as advocates for the Reserve forces and a strong national defense. That the founder of one of the first ROA chapters in Kansas City, Harry S. Truman, was now President of the United States signalled that the reserve structure was to grow and grow stronger in the post-World War II/cold war era. During his administration, President Truman ordered his Secretary of Defense to aggressively build a reserve military structure, and the Chief Executive took personal pride in the passage of a strong Armed Forces Reserve Act. 
It was also during this period that Congress took the unusual step of granting the ROA a charter mandating the organization `to support a military policy of the United States that will provide adequate national security, and to promote the development and execution thereof'. With this infrequently granted charter, Congress, in effect, was telling ROA that it respected its expertise and desired the association's advice on legislation affecting national security, as well as matters involving the military, both Reserve and Active. 
Over the years, the ROA has taken its charter and congressional mandate seriously. Its positions are without partisanship and are based solely on promoting a strong defense. The officers and members of the ROA have supported initiatives they thought would strengthen our Nation's military, and opposed those which would undermine America's preparedness. The ROA helped block attempts to eliminate the Coast Guard and Air Force Reserves, and to cut the Navy Reserve in half; and, they stood strong against the Panama Canal and the SALT II treaties, as well as any budget or manpower cuts to our Reserve forces. On the other hand, revitalizing the Selective Service System, lifting the embargo on arms sales to Turkey, selling AWACS to Saudi Arabia, and activating the Reserves during the early days of the gulf war all 
were supported by the ROA During the Clinton administration, the Association has been out front in seeking postwar benefits for military personnel including medical treatment for victims of gulf war illnesses, and it is most notable that since 1982, the ROA has successfully supported more than $15 billion in equipment procurement and construction for the Reserve and National Guard. 
Madam President, the ROA of today is a strong and vibrant association whose 100,000 strong membership includes active, retired, and honorably discharged officers of all the services; cadets and midshipmen from the service academies and ROTC programs; and officers of the Public Health Service, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That more than half of these individuals are life members is an indication of the amount of support the ROA has among the Reserve community, and the credibility it has as representatives of our Nation's truest `citizen-soldiers'. Obviously, such a dynamic organization requires dynamic leadership and I am proud to note that my friend and fellow South Carolinian, Maj. Gen. Herbert Koger, Jr., USAR, is serving as the president of the ROA this year, an office that is rotated annually among each of the services. Additionally, retired Maj. Gen. Roger W. Sandler, who was Chief of the Army Reserve prior to his 1994 retirement, very capably serves as the association's chief of staff. I commend both these men for the excellent jobs they do, especially for the input they give Congress on matters related to our national security. 
Madam President, as the Reserve Officers Association prepares to enter its fourth quarter of a century of service, I think it is appropriate to cite another quote by General Pershing, who said, `It would be false economy to save a few dollars by neglecting commonsense preparation in peace times, and then to spend billions to make up for the deficiency when war comes.' These are the watchwords of the men and women who makeup the ROA, and words each of us should bear in mind as we approach the 21st century and begin to consider the future needs, roles, and missions of our armed services. 
Congratulations to the Reserve Officers Association of the United States on its 75th anniversary.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to ask for passage of the Thurmond-Hollings amendment to the pending Nuclear Waste Policy Act bill. The pending bill includes a prohibition against storing commercial spent nuclear fuel at the Hanford site in Washington State. This amendment would include an exemption for the Savannah River site and an adjoining site in Barnwell County, SC. 
Mr. President, the purpose of the amendment is to level the playing field among all states, should the Department of Energy have to select an alternate interim storage site. 
There are three sites under the jurisdiction of the Department of Energy which currently have facilities that might be capable of accepting spent nuclear fuel. They are the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington, the Idaho National Environmental and Engineering Laboratory in Idaho, and the Savannah River site in South Carolina. Let me note that these facilities are near their capacity and would require many significant upgrades to take on a commercial mission. 
The pending bill explicitly exempts the Hanford site from being selected for interim storage. The State of Idaho has a legally enforceable court order prohibiting importation of new wastes into the State. This leaves South Carolina as the only other State with facilities capable of accepting spent nuclear fuel. 
Passage of the amendment is not intended to impact the overall success or failure of this legislation. It is only intended to ensure that if the Department finds that the Yucca Mountain facility is not suitable for spent fuel storage, that all States would then be placed on an equal footing for the siting and construction of a new state-of-the-art storage facility. 
Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in any state, there are certain individuals who make their mark in one or more fields, and in the process, they not only earn personal success, but they also make significant contributions to the place they call `home'. I rise today to pay tribute to one such man, Edwin Craig Wall, Jr., who was a successful businessman and civic booster, who recently passed away after being struck by a heart attack. 
During his adult life, Mr. Wall distinguished himself as a leader of business and industry in the Grand Strand area of South Carolina. This region is one of the fastest growing parts of the Palmetto State and represents a well developed and diversified economy that includes manufacturing, tourism, and shipping concerns. Tens of thousands of South Carolinians are employed in good paying, secure jobs, and the revenues that are contributed to our State's coffers from this area are certainly significant. Without question, Mr. Wall helped to create this very impressive picture of economic health that typifies the Grand Strand and Pee Dee. 
Though Mr. Wall entered the businessworld with a tremendous advantage, his father had built a very successful company called Canal Industries, he chose not to rest on the accomplishments of his namesake. Trained at the business schools of Davidson College and Harvard University, Mr. Wall was determined to find ways to streamline Canal and make it more efficient and profitable. From what I understand, he was more than successful in his objectives, as Canal is now a world leader in the timber industry, as well as becoming a prominent company in commercial development in the Myrtle Beach area. 
Perhaps one of the hallmarks of a good business person is how much they give back to the community and state which allowed them to prosper. In the case of Mr. Wall, he was very generous in what he contributed to South Carolina and he set an excellent example for other corporate executives to follow. His expertise and insight were valued by many, and he served on countless boards, including those of Davidson College and NationsBank. He was a strong advocate of education and worked hard to ensure that the Palmetto State had a school system that would guarantee that none of our citizens lack for the skills they would require to succeed in life. 
Mr. President, Craig Wall was a man who had a tremendous impact on life in South Carolina, and though he passed away at far too young an age, his star certainly shone bright. We are all grateful for the leadership and contributions he made throughout his life and career, and his wife and children have my deepest sympathies.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the nomination of Merrick B. Garland to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. I commend Senators Sessions, Kyl, and Grassley for taking this course. 
Let me state from the outset that my opposition has nothing to do with the nominee himself. I have no reservations about Mr. Garland's qualifications or character to serve in this capacity. He had an excellent academic record at both Harvard College and Harvard Law School before serving as a law clerk on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. Also, he has served in distinguished positions in private law practice and with the Department of Justice. Moreover, I have no doubt that Mr. Garland is a man of character and integrity. 
However, qualifications and character are not the only factors we must consider in deciding whether to confirm someone for a Federal judgeship. A more fundamental question is whether we should fill the position itself. Mr. Garland was nominated for the 11th seat on the D.C. circuit. I do not feel that this vacancy needs to be filled. Thus, I cannot vote in favor of this nomination. 
The caseload of the D.C. circuit is considerably lower than any other circuit court in the Nation. In 1996, the eleventh circuit had almost five times the number of cases per judge as the D.C. circuit. The fourth circuit had over three times as many cases filed. Specifically, about 378 appeals were filed per judge in the fourth circuit in 1996, compared to only about 123 in the D.C. circuit. 
Moreover, the caseload of the D.C. circuit is falling, not rising. Statistics from the Administrative Office show a decline in filings in the D.C. circuit over the past year. 
I am well aware of the argument that the cases in the D.C. circuit are more complex and take more time to handle, and therefore we should not expect the D.C. circuit to have the same caseload per judge as other circuits. However, this fact cannot justify the great disparity in the caseload that exists today between the D.C. circuit and any other circuit. This is especially true since the D.C. circuit caseload is declining. In short, it is my view that the existing membership of the D.C. circuit is capable of handling that court's caseload. 
Mr. President, one of the core duties of a Member of this great Body is to determine how to spend, and whether to spend, the hard-earned money of the taxpayers of this Nation. We must exercise our duty prudently and conservatively because it is not our money or the Government's money we are spending; it is the taxpayers' money. Today, the Republican Congress is working diligently to find 
spending cuts that will permit us to finally achieve a balanced budget. In making these hard choices, no area should be overlooked, including the judicial branch. Under the Constitution, the Congress has the power of the purse, and it has broad authority over the lower Federal courts. This body has the power to eliminate or decide not to fund vacant lower Federal judgeships, just as it had the power to create them in the first place. 
The cost of funding a Federal judgeship has been estimated at about $1 million per year. This is a substantial sum of money, and a vastly greater sum if we consider the lifetime service of a judge. We must take a close look at vacant judgeships to determine whether they are needed. 
In this regard, Senator Grassley, the chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Courts and Administrative Oversight, has been holding hearings regarding the proper allocation of Federal judgeships. I would like to take this opportunity to commend Senator Grassley for the fine leadership he is providing in this important area. Through Senator Grassley's hard work, we have learned and continue to learn much about the needs of the Federal courts. 
During one such subcommittee hearing this year, the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, J. Harvie Wilkinson III, explained that having more judges on the circuit court does not always mean fewer cases and a faster disposition of existing ones. He indicated it may mean just the opposite. More judges can mean less collegial decisionmaking and more intracircuit conflicts. As a result of such differences, more en banc hearings are necessary to resolve the disputes. More fundamentally, a large Federal judiciary is an invitation for the Congress to expand Federal jurisdiction and further interfere in areas that have been traditionally reserved for the States. 
In summary, I oppose this nomination only because I do not believe that the caseload of the D.C. circuit warrants an additional judge. Mr. Garland is a fine man, but I believe that my first obligation must be to the taxpayers of this Nation. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a truly outstanding Naval officer, Capt. Billy Lewis who has served with distinction for the past 23 months as Director of the Navy's Senate Legislative Liaison Office. It is a privilege for me to recognize his many outstanding achievements and commend him for the superb service he has provided to the U.S. Senate and to our great Nation as a whole. 
A native of Pensacola, FL, and a 1969 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, Captain Lewis began his naval career as the damage control assistant aboard U.S.S. Dehaven (DD 727). His follow-on tours of duty included Naval Headquarters, Saigon, engineer and weapons officer aboard U.S.S. Talbot (FFG 4), and he was second in command when U.S.S. Jack Williams (FFG 24) was commissioned in 1983. Capt. Billy Lewis has had three tours of duty in command at sea--U.S.S. Takelma (ATF 113) from 1977 to 1979, U.S.S. Robert G. Bradley (FFG 49) from 1986 to 1988, and U.S.S. Thomas S. Gates (CG 51) from 1993 to 1995. As Commanding Officer, U.S.S. Thomas S. Gates, Capt. Lewis served as Anti-Air Warfare Commander for Joint Task Group George Washington. 
Captain Lewis' duty ashore has included the Naval Postgraduate School where he earned a master of science degree in management in 1980, and two tours of duty on the Navy staff in Washington, DC. From 1983 to 1985, he served as a program analyst in the Office of General Planning and Programming, and from 1989 to 1991, he served as head of the Program and Budget Development Coordination Branch for the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations. Additionally, he attended National Defense University and graduated from the National War College in 1992. 
During his tenure as the Navy's Director of Legislative Liaison for the Senate which began in April 1995, Captain Lewis has provided members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, our personal staffs, as well as many of you seated here today, with timely support regarding Navy plans and programs. His valuable contributions have enabled Congress and the Department of the Navy to work closely together to preserve the modern, well-trained and well-equipped naval forces upon which our country has come to depend. 
Mr. President, Billy Lewis and his family have made many sacrifices during a 28-year Naval career and made a significant contribution to the outstanding naval forces upon which our country relies so heavily. During his illustrious career, Captain Lewis has been the recipient of many awards and commendations including the Legion of Merit with one gold star. He is a great credit to both the Navy and the country he so proudly serves. As he now departs to take command of Regional Support Group in Mayport, FL, I call upon my colleagues to wish him fair winds, and following seas.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending nomination of Mr. Federico PenAE6a, who has been nominated to serve as Secretary of Energy. 
The Armed Services Committee held a hearing on Mr. PenAE6a's nomination last February to assess his views and positions on the Department of Energy's programs that fall within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee. We felt this hearing was necessary because Mr. PenAE6a has no background in national security matters and, until very recently had no identifiable position on defense issues that Senators could use to assess his suitability to manage the Department's diverse national security activities. 
I, and other members of the Armed Services Committee, continue to have some concern about the Department's plans to certify the safety and reliability of nuclear warheads, restore tritium production in a timely manner, and maintain the capabilities of the Department's production plants. We also want to see more progress in environmental cleanup at DOE's former defense facilities. These are critical issues that the Secretary of Energy will have to address. I must say that we have not reached complete agreement with Mr. PenAE6a on all of these issues. I intend to work very closely with Mr. PenAE6a to resolve our differences once he is confirmed and I am hopeful that we can make progress on these difficult issues. 
Another area of concern that Mr. PenAE6a will be required to address is how to move forward with a permanent repository for the Nation's growing stockpile of spent nuclear fuel. Mr. PenAE6a must avoid playing politics with this issue. He should engage the Congress and work cooperatively to develop a credible solution to this mounting problem. I am hopeful that he will do so. 
There is an inconsistency in the Department's actions with regard to spent fuel. The Department has refused to accept U.S. commercial spent nuclear fuel, even after collecting billions of dollars from U.S. rate payers and being ordered to do so by the courts. However, the Department has paid to ship foreign research reactor fuel back to the United States--to the Savannah River Site in South Carolina--where it will likely be stored indefinitely at U.S. taxpayers' expense. Mr. President, this is an outrage. If the Department of Energy can pay to ship spent fuel from First World countries such as Germany and Sweden, why can't they find a way to accept spent nuclear fuel from Minnesota and California. There is no reason President Clinton should not support the legislation pending in the Senate to fix this problem. I strongly encourage the President to allow Mr. PenAE6a to work with the Congress to move forward with a solution to this problem before more taxpayer's dollars are wasted. 
Mr. President, despite my remaining concerns, Mr. PenAE6a impresses me as a highly capable manager and I intend to vote favorably on his nomination today. I also want to offer to sit down with Mr. PenAE6a in the coming months to jointly address the issues I have raised. My hope is that he will accept this offer and that we will be able solve these problems for the benefit of the American people.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today as we draw to a close the debate on this historic opportunity to adopt Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced budget amendment. This debate is about much more than an amendment to the Constitution, as significant as that is. It is about taking action once and for all that will control the size and scope of the Federal Government. 
I have been deeply concerned during my years in the Senate over the growth of the Federal bureaucracy. The first $100 billion budget in the history of the Nation occurred in 1962. This was almost 180 years after the Nation was founded. Yet, it took only 9 years, from 1962 to 1971, for the Federal budget to reach $200 billion. Then, the Federal budget continued to skyrocket; $300 billion in 1975, $500 billion in 1979, $800 billion in 1983, and the first $1 trillion budget in 1987. The budget for fiscal year 1996 was over $1.5 trillion. 
With this voracious congressional appetite for spending has come deficit spending. In the past three decades, the Federal Government has run deficits in every year except one. During the 1960's, deficits were averaging around $6 billion per year. The following decade, the 1970's, saw deficits rise an average $36 billion per year. In the last decade, the 1980's, deficits continued to rise and averaged $156 billion per year. So far, in the 1990's, deficits have averaged $259 billion per year. Compare this to 1957, my third year in the Senate, when the entire national debt was less than $275 billion and there was no deficit, but rather a $3 billion surplus. 
During my service here, there has never been a shortage of legislation creating new Federal programs or of efforts to increase spending in existing programs. It has been too easy for the Congress to pass legislation creating new Federal programs and spending more tax dollars whenever there is a call for Federal intervention. This Nation has drifted from its original foundations as a national Government of limited authority. A balanced budget amendment is the single most important addition we can propose to the Constitution to begin reducing the size and scope of the Federal Government. 
Mandating balanced Federal budgets is not a new idea. The first constitutional amendment to balance the budget was proposed in 1936. Since the beginning of the 84th Congress in 1955, constitutional amendments to require a balanced Federal budget have been proposed during each Congress. Finally, in 1982 while I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senate passed a balanced budget amendment which I authored. Our victory was short-lived, however, because the Speaker and the majority leader at that time led the movement to kill it in the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives. That was our high water mark as we fell one vote short in 1986, four votes short in 1994, and one vote short 2 years ago. Once again, we have a historic opportunity to pass the balanced budget amendment and send it to the American people for ratification. 
I would note that today the Congress is working hard to balance the Federal budget. However, this is a very recent development brought about by a change in the control of the Congress, and by this body finally listening to the will of the people. We must act to instill legislative accountability that will not waver with the membership of the majority. 
Our third president, Thomas Jefferson, stated:  
The question whether one generation has the right to bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves. 
Mr. President, it is time we make that moral obligation to pay our debts a constitutional one. Not only will we restore order to the fiscal policy of this Nation, we will be making a giant leap toward restoring the fundamental principle of limited authority to the Federal Government. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank and commend the able Senator from Utah for his outstanding leadership in this matter. 
Why do we need a constitutional amendment? We have not balanced this budget but one time in 36 years, eight times in 64 years. The Congress has failed to perform its duty. Therefore, we need a constitutional amendment that will make the Congress balance its budget. That is the only way I know to do it. A constitutional amendment will demand--demand--that the Congress balance the budget. 
Several years ago, when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I authored a similar amendment and got it through the committee and passed it through the Senate and sent it to the House. And who killed it? The Speaker of the House, Mr. O'Neill, and the Democratic leader of the House, Mr. Wright, led the movement to kill it. The Democrats don't seem to want it--certainly a majority of Democrats. 
There are some good Democrats, and I ask them to join us, pass this constitutional amendment, and protect the people of the United States. We cannot keep on going like this. We are going in debt, debt, debt. The only way to stop it is to pass a constitutional amendment to make the Congress balance the budget.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, sometimes we forget that it is the citizens of this Nation that serve as its bedrock, men and women who live in our communities and who are committed to making a difference. Today, I would like to share with you examples of two such people, Betty and the late Charles Wannamaker, who were recently honored by the Governor of South Carolina for their civic activities. 
There is no higher award that can be given a South Carolinian than the Order of the Palmetto, and late last month, Gov. David Beasley presented two of these awards to this married couple who have done much to make the Charleston area of my State a place anyone would be proud to call home. Unfortunately, Dr. Wannamaker's award was presented posthumously, but given the active role he took in local affairs, he was certainly worthy of this high tribute. An elected official in Charleston County for 32 years, Charles Wannamaker was the kind of man who epitomized the term `civic-minded.' 
His wife, Betty, was equally committed to making a difference in her community, and for two decades she served on the Charleston County Park and Recreation Commission. During her tenure, parks and open space in this Lowcountry county grew significantly, and countless families and visitors to the Charleston area have benefited from the many new and excellent parks that the commission approved and saw created. In a separate, but equally fitting tribute, I understand that a new park being built in north Charleston is going to be named in honor of the Wannamakers, a recognition of which they are deserving and one which is truly fitting. 
Mr. President, the Wannamakers made an excellent team, and through their concerted efforts and service, they made many valuable contributions to the Trident area and to the State of South Carolina. It is my hope that other citizens of the Palmetto State will be inspired by the standard for community involvement these two people set. We would all benefit if there were more people as committed to making a difference as the Wannamakers.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, for more than 150 years, the Citadel has been one of the most historic colleges in the State of South Carolina, and an institution that has produced not only a number of leading citizens, but interesting individuals as well. There is no question that the vast majority of Citadel alumni are passionately loyal to their alma mater, but every once in awhile, a particularly dynamic personality will emerge as a booster of the college. William F. `Buddy' Prioleau, Sr., was one such person, a man who was successful in life, possessed a distinctive personality, and an enthusiastic supporter of the Citadel. Sadly, he passed away late last month. 
Known throughout South Carolina as Mr. Citadel, Buddy was a regular fixture at many of the athletic events, parades, and formal and informal functions associated with that college and the Bulldogs. His unflagging devotion to the school earned him a long tenure on the Citadel's board of visitors, including a term as its chairman, which began in 1969 and only ended in 1994 when he did not submit his name for reelection. In recognition of his long and almost unparalleled service, he was awarded the distinguished title of board member emeritus. Indeed, it is difficult to immediately think of a man more associated with the Citadel than Buddy was. 
Entering the Citadel in 1939, it was a long road to the ring for young Cadet Prioleau, whose studies were interrupted by World War II. Before enlisting in the Army in 1942, Buddy was already demonstrating a distinguished amount of school spirit by managing the football team, being a member of the Block C Club, and serving as the president of the Bucanneer Club. Putting his education on hold, Buddy Prioleau traded the gray uniform of a Citadel cadet for that of a soldier and he found himself serving in the bloody Pacific theater with the 41st Division. 
At the end of hostilities, Buddy was able to return to the infamous white barracks of the Citadel and complete his undergraduate education. As was so typical of the veterans of World War II, Buddy recognized the importance of an education, and with his bachelor's degree in hand, he moved from Charleston to Columbia, where he enrolled in the school of law at the University of South Carolina, and from which he graduated in 1949. 
For almost the next 50 years, Buddy practiced law and enjoyed great success in the legal profession. He served as legal counsel to Governors Byrnes and Timmerman, as well as myself, when I held the office of Governor of South Carolina. Additionally, he served as an acting judge of the Richland County Family Court, was a partner in the firm of Prioleau & Walker, and was very active in the South Carolina and American Bar Associations. 
All the years that he was working as an attorney, building a career, raising a family, rising to the rank of colonel in the National Guard, and becoming the owner of an inn on Pawley's Island, Buddy Prioleau still made abundant time for one of his true loves, his alma mater. There is not a graduate of the Military College of South Carolina who did not know of Buddy or had some humorous anecdote about him. Without question, he was much beloved by the entire Citadel family, and they paid tribute to him in a number of ways over the years. In 1981, the Citadel yearbook, the Sphinx, was dedicated in his honor, and last year he was awarded an honorary doctor of laws and his portrait was hung in Daniel Library. Two very high honors that are accorded to only a select few individuals. 
Mr. President, I know that I speak for all of Buddy Prioleau's friends when I say that not only has the Citadel lost one of its most distinguished graduates, but that our State has lost a civic-minded and public-spirited man. My sympathies go out to Buddy's children, William, Mary, Roberta, and Elizabeth, as well as his five grandchildren. He will be missed.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, one of the most unsung professions in the United States is law enforcement. It is a dangerous and demanding career field that offers few tangible rewards, yet it is an occupation that attracts men and women of tremendous dedication and determination, individuals who are committed to making a difference in their lives and jobs. Today, I rise to pay tribute to one such person, Roy D. Nedrow, the Director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, who is about to end a distinguished career in local and Federal law enforcement after more than 30 years. 
Director Nedrow began his service in law enforcement as a street cop in Berkeley, CA, during the turbulent 1960's. As many know, that city is the home to a beautiful University of California campus, but at that time in Berkeley's history, the plazas, walkways, and streets of, and surrounding, Cal became a kind of urban battleground. No doubt, it was in this contentious and frequently violent environment that Officer Nedrow learned some very valuable lessons about law enforcement, people, and managing crises, all which would help him throughout his career. 
After 6 years in local law enforcement, Sgt. Roy Nedrow traded the seven-pointed star and khaki uniform of the Berkeley Police Department for a business suit, a set of credentials, and a job as a U.S. Secret Service special agent. For more than the next 20 years, he handled numerous cases involving fraud, counterfeiting, forgery, and protection. In the process, he steadily climbed the command ladder of that agency, holding a number of positions of great responsibility, eventually rising to the office of Deputy Assistant Director of the Office of Investigations, where he was responsible for managing 1,200 special agents in more than 100 field locations throughout the world. 
His experience with the U.S. Secret Service gave him invaluable training in managing investigations, people, and budgets, and made him an ideal candidate to head-up a law enforcement agency. When the Naval Criminal Investigative Service was looking for a new director in the early 1990's, they very quickly spotted Roy Nedrow as a desirable candidate to take charge of their agency. 
Assuming the helm at NCIS in 1992, Director Nedrow moved swiftly and surely to change the public's perception about this agency which had suffered from several public relations misfortunes, and he made turning NCIS into a more effective and streamlined organization his priority. Managing a Federal agency in this era of shrinking budgets, downsizing, and hiring freezes, is very challenging and Director Nedrow had to find a way to continue to meet the many international missions with which his special agents are tasked, particularly force protection and antiterrorism, with fewer available resources. Not deterred by the size of the task before him, the Director established many successful initiatives, a number of which were particularly effective in making NCIS an even better law enforcement agency. 
During his tenure as Director, Roy Nedrow oversaw the establishment of a Cold Case Homicide Squad which has reinvestigated murder cases previously thought unsolvable, bringing closure to 18 cases and earning 13 convictions. Realizing the importance of reigning in fraud and ensuring that the money of the American taxpayer was not wasted, the Director fought to keep the fraud investigation mission at NCIS. Over the past 5 years, his special agents assigned to pursuing such cases have recovered more than $900 million in procurement fraud, fines, and restitution, helping to cut out fiscal waste and abuse, as well as essentially compensating the Government for what it costs to operate NCIS. Another innovative solution discovered by the Director, was to better integrate Navy Reserve personnel into his agency, providing him with the ability to secure a surge of qualified and trained individuals capable of helping NCIS meet its force protection mission in times of national crisis. 
Mr. President, anyone who dedicates their life to protecting the people of this Nation from criminal elements is worthy of our thanks, and for 33 years, Roy Nedrow has done just that. He has established an impressive reputation for professionalism and leadership at every level of law enforcement he has worked, and has left the Berkeley Police Department, the U.S. Secret Service, and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service all better places for his efforts. His stewardship as the Director of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service has greatly benefited that agency, and has helped to strengthen the Federal law enforcement community. We are proud of the work he has done, are grateful for his many sacrifices, and wish he and his lovely wife Claudia, much health, happiness, and continued successes in the years to come.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would authorize a modest annuity of $165 a month for a group of surviving spouses of former service members who died before March 21, 1974, and were retired from active duty. The bill would also apply to surviving spouses of service members retired from the Reserves between September 21, 1972 and October 1, 1978. 
At the time these service members retired from the military, there was no plan to take care of these widows as we have today. The same concerns that moved the Congress to authorize the current survivor benefit plan are true for this group of forgotten widows. The beneficiaries of this plan are all seniors now. For some, this small annuity will make the difference between a life of dependency and a life of dignity and independence. Let us correct this situation and take care of the service members spouses who had the courage to serve their Nation in the troubling time periods of the Korean and Vietnam wars. 
I have tried to get this legislation passed in previous Congresses only to be frustrated by budget rules and CBO scoring. 
Mr. President, we must not allow bureaucratic rules to stand in our way because, one fact remains true. The longer we delay, the fewer of these widows there are to benefit from the legislation. I do not want to be remembered as one who forgot this group who have become known as the Forgotten Widows. I urge my colleagues to join me and support this important legislation.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, in any State, there is a core group of businessmen and women who help promote and guide development and economic success. These are the people who serve as the leaders of the private sector, individuals who work in concert with elected officials to create jobs, opportunity, and growth. Lawrence Gressette, Jr., has been one such leader in South Carolina, and I rise today to pay tribute to him and the many contributions he has made in helping South Carolina become one of the fastest growing centers for commerce and industry anywhere in the Nation. 
Though Lawrence Gressette presides over one of the biggest corporations in our State, he did not begin his professional career with ambitions to become a captain of industry. As a matter of fact, Mr. Gressette started out as a country lawyer, which is about as far away from corporate America as one can get. 
Born in rural St. Matthews, SC., Lawrence Gressette, Jr. was the son of a well-respected attorney who also served as one of the Palmetto State's most influential elected officials, State Senator L. Marion Gressette, Sr. Early on in life, Lawrence learned the importance of being a man of integrity and dedication, and he approached all his tasks with a keen sense of purpose. These characteristics have helped shape Lawrence's life and are a direct correlation to the many successes he has enjoyed. Whether it was during his days at Clemson, where he played football for the Tigers on scholarship and served as student body president; graduating first in his class at the School of Law at the University of South Carolina; building a successful practice as an attorney; or rising to the position of chairman and chief executive officer of the SCANA Corp., it was a commitment to hard work and honesty that paved the way for Lawrence Gressette to become one of the most influential and respected citizens of South Carolina. 
While he did not follow his father's footsteps into public service, Lawrence Gressette, Jr. has certainly been a public spirited person, and he has repeatedly lent his time, name, and efforts to many causes, all of which had the goal of making the Palmetto State an even better place to call home. A devoted family man, he served his Nation as an Infantry officer in the U.S. Army, he serves on several boards and committees throughout the State, and he is very active in his community. For his efforts, he has been recognized on several occasions with awards and commendations, and most significantly, he has been awarded two honorary degrees from colleges and universities in South Carolina. 
Mr. President, Lawrence Gressette, Jr., is about to step down as the head of the SCANA Corp. We are grateful for all his hard work and leadership in running not only one of our State's most important organizations, but for his commitment to helping make South Carolina one of the Nation's most economically dynamic States. We wish him great health and happiness in the years to come, as well as continued success in whatever endeavors he chooses to undertake.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, perhaps one of the best kept secrets in the American medical community can be found not far from this Chamber, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences [USUHS], located in Bethesda, MD. For more than the past 20 years, this institution has trained in excess of 2,000 doctors who have gone on to serve our Nation either in one of the branches of the military, or in the Public Health Service. Without question, this university has greatly benefited the people and military personnel of the United States, and a tremendous debt is owed to the man who is known as the founding dean of this institution, Dr. Jay Philip Sanford. Unfortunately and sadly, Dr. Sanford passed away in October of last year. 
To those who willingly risk their lives in order to ensure the security of the United States, there is probably no more comforting thought than to know that should they be wounded, they will receive excellent medical care. Indeed, advances in military medicine have helped to ensure that our service personnel will have access to the very best possible treatment and care no matter where they are located or what the conditions in which they are carrying out their duties. Whether it be the rugged and frigid mountains of Bosnia, or the harsh and hot deserts of Kuwait and Iraq, American military personnel do not want for the most advanced and competent medical care available. Without question, the corps of military medical professionals who have graduated from the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and the research conducted at that facility, have a great deal to do with that success. 
The success of USUHS is directly attributable to the guidance and hard work of Dr. Sanford, who truly molded that university into the respected institution it has become. Established in 1972 at the direction of Congress, USUHS was to become a school that would prepare men and women for medical service careers in the Armed Forces and the U.S. Public Health Service. Not only creating a reliable source for military doctors, the university was to stress the instruction of the highly specialized fields of military medicine, preventive medicine, tropical medicine, and disaster medicine. It was the responsibility of Dr. Sanford to help build the university from the ground up, establishing curriculum, securing the necessary books and equipment required of a first-rate medical school, and ensuring that the first class of doctors would graduate from that school in 1980, as required by law. Dr. Sanford rose to the daunting challenge presented him, and in the finest traditions of the military, succeeded in achieving his mission and opening the doors of USUHS on schedule. 
For his many impressive achievements, as a doctor, a researcher, and an educator, Dr. Sanford was awarded no shortage of tributes and recognitions. Regrettably, space does not permit a complete recitation of all the accolades he was granted in his life, but I think my colleagues would be interested to know that his alma mater, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School established the Jay P. Sanford Lectureship in Infectious Diseases, and the Jay P. Sanford Professorship; and, USUHS established the Sanford Chair in Tropical Medicine, as well as creating the Jay P. Sanford Distinguished Alumnus Award. Furthermore, in addition to serving as the third president of USUHS, Dr. Sanford was awarded the doctor of military medicine degree [Honoris Causa], the USUHS Distinguished Service Medal, and the Department of Defense Civilian Service Medal. 
Despite all these recognitions, one cannot help but think that the distinction of which Dr. Sanford was most proud would be the creation and success of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. In the years since the first class of doctors graduated from that school, USUHS trained physicians have supported American military operations throughout the world as well as have made many important contributions to the country through the Public Health Service. There is perhaps no greater legacy Dr. Sanford could have left than this institution which is dedicated to helping others. I do not exaggerate when I say that Dr. Sanford was a man who gave his all to our Nation and has left the United States a better place for his service. He will certainly be missed by all those who knew him, and his family has my deepest sympathies. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending nomination of Mr. Federico PenAE6a, who has been nominated to serve as Secretary of Energy. The Armed Services Committee recently held a hearing to receive testimony from Mr. PenAE6a on his views and positions relative to Department of Energy Programs that fall within the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee. 
The purpose of the hearing was to explore Mr. PenAE6a's proposals for the Department's critical national security programs and to allow him the opportunity to establish a coherent record of his views regarding these programs. The Committee felt such a record needed to be established, because Mr. PenAE6a has no background in national security matters and, prior to last week's hearing, he had no identifiable position on defense issues that Senators could use to assess his suitability to manage the Department's diverse national security activities. 
I want to state very clearly that the purpose of this hearing was to provide Mr. PenAE6a with an opportunity to discuss his views. It was never our intent to delay his nomination or to interfere with the customary reporting process for his nomination in any way. I worked very closely with Senator Murkowski to ensure that this hearing focused only on the Department's defense missions and did not infringe on the Energy Committee's jurisdiction. Senator Murkowski was exceptionally helpful in coordinating the activities of our two committees and I applaud his leadership in this matter. 
Regarding Mr. PenAE6a's qualifications, let me say that I find him to be intelligent, thoughtful, and a quick study. If confirmed, I believe he will bring much-needed management ability to the Department--something that has been lacking for the past 4 years. However, the members of the Armed Services Committee take the Department of Energy's national security and defense environmental cleanup missions very seriously. It is our responsibility to thoroughly assess the qualifications of those nominated to head this agency and make public our findings and concerns. 
Mr. President, for some time now, the Armed Services Committee has expressed its concern regarding the Department's approach to maintaining the reliability and safety of the Nation's enduring nuclear weapons stockpile. We are concerned that the Department's proposed Science-based Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan may unnecessarily put our enduring nuclear forces at risk--both in terms of safety and reliability. We are concerned that the Department's plan to restore tritium production capabilities are not realistic and won't deliver the required quantities of tritium in the timeframe needed by the Department of Defense. We are further concerned that the pace of cleanup at former nuclear defense facilities may not be aggressive enough to meet the Department's stated 10-year cleanup goal. 
We discussed these issues and others with Mr. PenAE6a and generally found his responses to be informed and reasoned. Unfortunately, on at least two critical issues, Mr. PenAE6a's testimony caused some level of concern. 
When asked what action he would take in a hypothetical situation where he was informed by all three DOE weapons laboratory directors that a significant safety problem existed in a nuclear weapon in the U.S. stockpile and that the only feasible way to fix that problem was to conduct an under-ground nuclear test, Mr. PenAE6a stated that he would present the relevant information to the President, but steadfastly refused to acknowledge his responsibility to make a test or don't test recommendation to the President. I found his response troubling. 
Mr. President, as the U.S. nuclear stockpile ages, the hypothetical situation I just described is not only plausible, but one that we could face in the very near future. Unfortunately, Mr. PenAE6a's response was less than forthright. We expect every Cabinet Secretary to present all the relevant information to the President, but in this hypothetical, the Secretary would be 
required to do more than that. This situation requires that the Secretary of Energy make a recommendation to the President. Mr. PenAE6a's refusal to commit to making such a recommendation raised considerable doubt regarding his understanding of the role that the Secretary of Energy plays in advising the President on nuclear matters and leads me to question his willingness to carry out the responsibilities of the Secretary of Energy. 
My fear is that Mr. PenAE6a does not recognize that our current confidence in the U.S. nuclear stockpile could diminish rapidly in the near future. The next Secretary of Energy must understand this reality and demonstrate a commitment to take all actions necessary to maintain the safety and reliability of our enduring nuclear deterrent. If he is confirmed, I hope to work closely with Mr. PenAE6a to ensure the Department does not back away from its obligations in this area. 
I also found Mr. PenAE6a's commitment to restore U.S. tritium production less than satisfactory. 
For my colleagues who do not know, tritium is a radioactive gas that is required in all modern nuclear weapons in the U.S. stockpile. Without tritium, our nuclear weapons cannot function. Because tritium decays at a rate of 5 and 5 1/2 percent per year, it must be replaced in weapons at regular intervals. The U.S. stopped producing tritium in 1988 and current supplies are being exhausted. 
The Department has pursued nearly a dozen different technical options for tritium production--at great cost to the taxpayers--and we are still no closer to restoring tritium production today than we were almost a decade ago. Meanwhile, our supply of tritium continues to degrade and our nuclear deterrent, which has served to protect this Nation for over 50 years, becomes incrementally less effective with each passing year. 
Congress has consistently directed the Department to move more quickly to restore tritium production. In fact, the fiscal year 1997 Defense Authorization Act required DOE to make a decision on tritium this fiscal year. However, Mr. PenAE6a endorsed the Department's current dual track strategy--which will not result in the selection of a preferred option until fiscal year 1999--but, he also stated his intent to explore a new, third option. This is a recipe for disaster that will result in further delays and even more wasted taxpayer dollars. 
The Department should stop studying this issue and move forward with a decision. I believe that such a decision can and should be made this fiscal year and I will look toward the next Secretary of Energy to provide leadership in this area. 
These are two issues of deep concern to me and other members of the Armed Services Committee. I am looking for Mr. PenAE6a to provide the Senate a clear answer on nuclear testing and demonstrate that he is willing to move more quickly on restoring tritium. It will be difficult for me to fully support Mr. PenAE6a's nomination unless these issues are addressed. 
Let me state that while I am very concerned about these issues, I remain openminded regarding Mr. PenAE6a's nomination. I have made available in room 228 of the Russell Building a copy of the hearing transcript and Mr. PenAE6a's responses to advance policy questions and posthearing questions. I encourage my colleagues to review these materials. I am certain that they will find them highly useful in making an informed determination on Mr. PenAE6a's pending nomination.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, we being consideration of a proposed constitutional amendment to require the Federal Government to achieve and maintain a balanced budget. 
Undoubtedly, it is the desire of every Member who supports the balanced budget amendment to see the Federal budget deficit eliminated so that we may begin to cut away at the Federal debt which is currently over $5.28 trillion. Without a balanced budget amendment, there has been little pressure on the President to submit a balanced budget and on the Congress to make tough legislative choices on Federal spending. I would note that the Republican-controlled Congress is working hard to balance the Federal budget. However, we need a balanced budget amendment as part of the Constitution. As the Congress authorizes Federal spending, we must understand the reality that there are a finite number of tax dollars available for public spending and various proposals would compete on merit and need, not popularity. 
The balanced budget amendment would instill legislative accountability as the Congress considers various proposals for increased Federal spending. Currently, there is no real check on runaway Federal spending, and there will never be a shortage of legislation creating new Federal programs or efforts to increase spending in existing programs. Without a balanced budget amendment, budget deficits over the long term will continue to rise and the Federal debt will continue to grow. There have been times when gestures were made to bring spending within our means but those efforts were shortlived. Statutes to reduce Federal spending have not been enough. They are too easily cast aside and the Federal Government rolls along on its path of fiscal irresponsibility. 
I am convinced that without the mandate of a balanced budget amendment, Federal spending will continue to eclipse receipts and the American people will continue to shoulder inordinate tax burdens to sustain an indefensible Federal appetite for spending. In 1950, an average American family with two children sent $1 out of every $50 it earned to the Federal Government. Today, the average American family is spending $1 out of every $4 it earns to the Federal Government. 
Mr. President, we can trace the debate on a balanced budget amendment back in our history for 200 years. A defining moment may well have been the appointment of Thomas Jefferson as Minister to France. Thomas Jefferson was abroad when the Constitution was written and he did not attend the constitutional convention. If Jefferson had been in attendance, it is quite possible that he would have been successful in having language placed in the Constitution to limit the spending authority of the Federal Government. Upon studying the Constitution, Thomas Jefferson wrote in a letter of a change he so fervently believed should become part of the Constitution. He wrote the following: 
I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an additional article taking from the government the power of borrowing. 
Further, Jefferson stated, 
To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude. 
Another former President, Andrew Jackson, stated the following, 
Once the budget is balanced and the debts paid off, our population will be relieved from a considerable portion of its present burdens and will find . . . additional means for the display of individual enterprise. 
President Harrison described unnecessary public debt as `criminal.' 
Mr. President, early American Presidents and public leaders understood the dangers of excessive public debt. For almost 150 years, balanced budgets or budget surpluses were the fiscal norm followed by the Federal Government. The unwritten rule followed by Presidents and legislators until recently in our Nation's history was to achieve balanced budgets except in wartime. Unfortunately, the role and the size of the Federal Government has grown out of control. In the past three decades, the Federal Government has run deficits in every year except one. Further, the Federal Government has run deficits in 56 of the last 64 years. 
The Federal debt has grown as deficits have continued and the debt is now over $5.28 trillion. It took this Nation over 200 years to run the first trillion dollar debt yet we have recently been adding another trillion dollars to our debt about every 5 years. 
I have been deeply concerned during my time in the Senate over the growth of the Federal Government. It has been too easy for the Congress to pass legislation creating new Federal programs and spending more tax dollars whenever there is a call for Federal intervention. Of course, the Federal Government has an appropriate role to protect the citizens of this Nation, but it is not realistic to believe that Washington should respond to every perceived problem with a new Federal approach. This Nation has drifted from its original foundations as a national government of limited authority. I believe the adoption of a balanced budget amendment will do much to return us to a more limited Federal Government and decentralized authority and the mandates of such an amendment will increase legislative accountability. A balanced budget amendment is the single most important addition we can propose to the Constitution to begin reducing the size of the Federal Government. 
Mr. President, we have seen the national debt and deficits rise in large part because the Federal Government has grown. The first $100 billion budget in the history of the Nation occurred in 1962. This was almost 180 years after the Nation was founded. Yet, it took only 9 years, from 1962 to 1971, for the Federal budget to reach $200 billion. Then, the Federal budget continued to skyrocket; $300 billion in 1975, $500 billion in 1979, $800 billion in 1983, and the first $1 trillion budget in 1987. The budget for fiscal year 1996 was over $1.5 trillion. Federal spending has gripped Congress as a narcotic but it is time to break the habit and restore order to the fiscal policy of this Nation. 
Two years ago, we were only one vote short of the votes needed to pass the balanced budget amendment. We now have another opportunity to send the balanced budget amendment to the American people for ratification. I hope we do not fail the American people on this historic opportunity and instead present to the States our proposed amendment to mandate balanced Federal budgets. It is time to act to secure the future for all Americans. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, each morning for more years than anyone can remember, millions of Americans have religiously opened their newspapers and consulted their horoscope, checking their astrological sign for an idea of what good or bad fortune their day might hold. Whether these people did this out of a true belief that the stars could predict their fate, or just out of a sense of fun, it was the work of a prominent Washingtonian, Jeane Dixon, whose column more often than not they were reading. Sadly, her fans will no longer be able to gaze into the future over a cup of coffee and an English muffin, as Mrs. Dixon passed away this past Saturday at the age of 79. 
Mrs. Dixon gained notoriety as an astrologer and psychic when she made some eerily accurate predictions concerning the tragic fate of the late President Kennedy, the election of Richard Nixon to the Presidency, that China would become Communist, and the eventual election of Ronald Reagan as Chief Executive. Whether she truly had the ability to see into the future will forever be a mystery, but she certainly made enough accurate forecasts about events that she earned a degree of credibility. From what I understand, she was often consulted by individuals inside and outside of Government, and she was certainly a favorite in Washington social circles, which is how I came to know Mrs. Dixon many years ago. 
Those who only knew the Jeane Dixon whose name graced horoscope columns were not familiar with the generous and concerned nature of this woman who worked very hard to help build a better world through philanthropy. A devout Catholic, Mrs. Dixon gave freely to the church, supporting many worthy charities and relief projects designed to help the less fortunate and those in need. Additionally, Mrs. Dixon established the Jeane Dixon's Children to Children Foundation, an organization that has undertaken many fine efforts to help some of America's most vulnerable citizens, its children. 
I am proud to have been able to count Jeane Dixon among my friends. She was the godmother to my youngest son, Paul, and the two would visit whenever possible. Unfortunately in later years, Paul's schedule as a tennis player and college student, and Jeane's busy traveling and business schedule did not permit as many get togethers as either would like. Still, they were good friends and did enjoy being able to see each other several times a year. As Jeane lived in town, I would see her frequently, and always enjoyed being able to host her and her friends for lunch in the Senate dining room. Without question, she was a kind and warm-hearted woman who was always interested in politics and the events of the day. She was a witty conversationalist and it was always amusing and intriguing to hear what she believed was in store for the Nation and prominent figures in Government and entertainment. 
Mr. President, Jeane Dixon led a full and unique life. She was known, admired, and liked by countless people and we shall all miss her. My condolences go out to her sister, Evelyn P. Brier; her brother, Dr. Warren E. Pinckert; and her nieces and nephews, all of whom survive her.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to amend the Hobbs Anti-Racketeering Act to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision in United States versus Enmons, and to address a serious, long term, festering problem under our Nation's labor laws. I am pleased to have Senator Hatch, chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, join me in introducing this bill. The United States regulates labor relations on a national basis and our labor management policies are national policies. These policies and regulations are enforced by laws such as the National Labor Relations Act that Congress designed to preempt comparable State laws. 
I believe it is time for the Government to act and respond to what the Supreme Court did when it rendered its decision in the case of United States versus Enmons in 1973. Although labor violence continues to be a widespread problem in labor management relations today, the Federal Government has not moved in a meaningful way to address this issue. It is this decision's unfortunate result which this bill is intended to rectify. 
The Enmons decision involved the Hobbs Anti-Racketeering Act which is intended to prohibit extortion by labor unions. It provides that: `Whoever in any way * * * obstructs, delays, or affects commerce in the movement of any article or commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires to do so or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property * * *' commits a criminal act. This language clearly outlaws extortion by labor unions. It outlaws violence by labor unions. 
Although this language is very clear, the Supreme Court in Enmons created an exemption to the law which says that as long as a labor union commits extortion and violence in furtherance of legitimate collective-bargaining objectives, no violation of the act will be found. Simply put, the Court held that if the ends are permissible, the means to that end, no matter how horrible or reprehensible, will not result in a violation of the act. 
The Enmons decision is wrong. This bill will make it clear that the Hobbs Act is intended to punish the actual or threatened use of force or violence, or fear thereof, to obtain property irrespective of the legitimacy of the extortionist's claim to such property and irrespective of the existence of a labor management dispute. 
Let me discuss the Enmons case. In that case, the defendants were indicted for firing high-powered rifles at property, causing extensive damage to the property owned by a utility company--all done in an effort to obtain higher wages and other benefits from the company for striking employees. The indictment was, however, dismissed by the district court on the theory that the Hobbs Act did not prohibit the use of violence in obtaining legitimate union objectives. On appeal, the Supreme Court affirmed. 
The Supreme Court held that the Hobbs Act does not proscribe violence committed during a lawful strike for the purpose of achieving legitimate collective-bargaining objectives, like higher wages. By its focus upon the motives and objectives of the property claimant who uses violence or force to achieve his or her goals, the Enmons decision has had several unfortunate results. It has deprived the Federal Government of the ability to punish significant acts of extortionate violence when they occur in a labor management context. Although other Federal statutes prohibit the use of specific devices or the use of channels of commerce in 
accomplishing the underlying act of extortionate violence, only the Hobbs Act proscribes a localized act of extortionate violence whose economic effect is to disrupt the channels of commerce. Other Federal statutes are not adequate to address the full effect of the Enmons decision. 
The Enmons decision affords parties to labor-management disputes an exemption from the statute's broad proscription against violence which is not available to any other group in society. This bill would make it clear that the Hobbs Act punishes the actual or threatened use of force and violence which is calculated to obtain property without regard to whether the extortionist has a colorable claim to such property, and without regard to his or her status as a labor representative, businessman, or private citizen. 
Mr. President, attempts to rectify the injustice of the Enmons decision have been before the Senate on several occasions. Shortly after the decision was handed down, a bill was introduced which was intended to repudiate the decision. Over the next several years, attempts were made to come up with language which was acceptable to organized labor and at the same time restored the original intent of the Hobbs Act. 
Although bills achieving the same goals as the bill I am introducing today have made progress and one even passed the Senate, none has been enacted. It is time for the Senate to re-examine this issue and to restate its opposition to violence in labor disputes. Encouraged by their special exemption from prosecution for acts of violence committed in pursuit of legitimate union objectives, union officials who are corrupt routinely use terror tactics to achieve their goals. 
From January 1975 to June 1996, the National Institute for Labor Relations Research has documented more than 8,700 reported cases of union violence. This chilling statistic gives clear testimony to the existence of a pervasive national problem. 
Mr. President, violence has no place in our society, regardless of the setting. Our national labor policy has always been directed toward the peaceful resolution of labor disputes. It is ironic that the Hobbs Act, which was enacted in large part to accomplish this worthy goal, has been virtually emasculated. The time has come to change that. I think that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle share a common concern that violence in labor disputes, whatever the source, should be eliminated. Government has been unwilling to deal with this problem for too long. It is time for this Congress to act.

Mr. THURMOND. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very important piece of legislation that would affect every American taxpayer. This measure would prohibit Federal funds from being used to encourage labor union membership. 
Mr. President, I was shocked to learn that the Department of Labor has published and distributed brochures which state, If you don't have a union, you may want to consider joining an existing union or working with others to start one. These brochures are designed to help American workers know their rights when it comes to various forms of discrimination. I recognize the importance of these brochures, but I firmly believe that it is not the responsibility of the Federal Government to encourage or discourage labor union membership in any form. Organized labor has the resources and the manpower to do their own recruiting. They certainly should not be receiving free solicitation at the expense of the American taxpayer. 
The legislation that I am introducing today specifically prohibits any Federal agency from using Federal funds for programs, seminars, staff positions, or publications which would compel, instruct, encourage, urge, or persuade individuals to join labor unions. As I stated before, it simply is not the responsibility of the Federal Government to encourage union membership. The American taxpayer should not bear the burden of promoting labor unions. 
My distinguished colleagues, Senators Faircloth, Helms, Hutchinson, Kempthorne, Shelby, and Sessions, join me as original cosponsors of this measure that I send to the desk. I invite our other colleagues to join us in support of this important legislation.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
I want to thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the minority leader, Senator Daschle, for taking up the nomination of our former Colleague Senator Bill Cohen to be Secretary of Defense. As all Senators know, Secretary Perry, who has ably led the Department of Defense for the past 3 years, has departed. It is therefore essential that we fill the position of Secretary of Defense as quickly as possible. 
The Armed Services Committee met this afternoon in an executive session and unanimously voted to recommend the confirmation of Senator Cohen as the 20th Secretary of Defense. Senator Cohen is well known by all Members of the Senate for his distinguished 18 years of service in the Senate representing the people of Maine. Each of us is aware of his character, ability, and dedication to providing unquestioned support for our men and women in uniform. Senator Cohen has repeatedly demonstrated a vision for how the United States must meet its defense needs. I believe that as the Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen will continue to demonstrate the strong independent characteristics of New England gentlemen and will lead the Clinton administration to provide adequately for the security of the Nation and those who serve in our Armed Forces. 
Mr. President, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I urge the Senate to confirm William S. Cohen, a dedicated public servant, as the next Secretary of Defense.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an act to clarify the application and effect of legislation which the Congress enacts. My act provides that unless future legislation expressly states otherwise, new enactments would be applied prospectively, would not create private rights of action, and would be presumed not to preempt existing State law. This will significantly reduce unnecessary litigation and court costs, and will benefit both the public and our judicial system. 
The purpose of this legislation is quite simple. Many congressional enactments do not indicate whether the legislation is to be applied retroactively, whether it creates private rights of action, or whether it preempts existing State law. The failure or inability of the Congress to address these issues in each piece of legislation results in unnecessary confusion and litigation. Additionally, this contributes to the high cost of litigation and the congestion of our courts. 
In the absence of action by the Congress on these critical threshold questions of retroactivity, private rights of action and preemption, the outcome is left up to the courts. The courts are frequently required to resolve these matters without any guidance from the legislation itself. Although these issues are generally raised early in a lawsuit, a decision that the lawsuit can proceed generally cannot be appealed until the end of the case. If the appellate court eventually rules that one of these issues should have prevented the trial, the litigants have been put to substantial burden and unnecessary expense which could have been avoided. 
Trial courts around the country often reach conflicting and inconsistent results on these issues, as do appellate courts when the issues are appealed. As a result, many of these cases eventually make their way to the Supreme Court. This problem was dramatically illustrated after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. District courts and courts of appeal all over this Nation were required to resolve whether the 1991 act should be applied retroactively, and the issue ultimately was considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. However, by the time the Supreme Court resolved the issue in 1994, well over 100 lower courts had ruled on this question, and their decisions were split. Countless litigants across the country expended substantial resources debating this threshold procedural issue. 
In the same way, the issues of whether new legislation creates a private right of action or preempts State law are frequently presented in courts around the country, yielding expensive litigation and conflicting results. 
The bill I am introducing today eliminates this problem by providing the rule of construction that, unless future legislation specifies otherwise, newly enacted laws are not to be applied retroactively, do not create a private right of action, and are presumed not to preempt State law. Of course, my bill does not in any way restrict the Congress on these important issues. The Congress may override this ordinary rule by simply stating when it wishes legislation to be retroactive, create new private rights of action or preempt existing State law. 
This act will eliminate uncertainty and provide rules which are applicable when the Congress fails to specify its position on these important issues in legislation it passes. One U.S. District Judge in my State informs me that he spends 10 to 15 percent of his time on these issues. It is clear that this legislation would save litigants and our judicial system millions and millions of dollars by avoiding much uncertainty and litigation which currently exists over these issues. 
Mr. President, if we are truly concerned about relieving the backlog of cases in our courts and reducing the costs of litigation, we should help our judicial system to focus its limited resources, time and effort on resolving the merits of disputes, rather than deciding these preliminary matters.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to prohibit Federal judges from ordering new taxes or ordering increases in existing tax rates as a judicial remedy. 
In 1990, the Supreme Court decided in Missouri versus Jenkins to allow Federal judges to order new taxes or increases as a judicial remedy. It is my firm belief that this narrow 5 to 4 decision permits Federal judges to exceed their proper boundaries of jurisdiction and authority under the Constitution. 
Mr. President, this ruling and congressional response raises two constitutional issues which warrant discussion. One is whether Federal courts have authority under the Constitution to inject themselves into the legislative area of taxation. The second constitutional issue arises in light of the Judicial Taxation Prohibition Act which I am now introducing to restrict the remedial jurisdiction of the Federal courts. This narrowly drafted legislation would prohibit Federal judges from ordering new taxes or ordering increases in existing tax rates. I believe it is clear under article III that the Congress has the authority to restrict the remedial jurisdiction of the Federal courts in this fashion. 
First, I want to speak on the issue of judicial taxation. Not since Great Britain's ministry of George Grenville in 1765 have the American people faced the assault of taxation without 
representation as now authorized in the Jenkins decision. 
As part of his imperial reforms to tighten British control in the colonies, Grenville pushed the Stamp Act through the Parliament in 1765. This Act required excise duties to be paid by the colonists in the forms of revenue stamps affixed to a variety of legal documents. This action came at a time when the colonies were in an uproar over the Sugar Act of 1764 which levied duties on certain imports such as sugar, indigo, coffee, linens and other items. 
The ensuing firestorm of debate in America centered on the power of Britain to tax the colonies. James Otis, a young Boston attorney, echoed the opinion of most colonists stating that the Parliament did not have power to tax the colonies because Americans had no representation in that body. Mr. Otis had been attributed in 1761 with the statement that `taxation without representation is tyranny.' 
In October, 1765, delegates from nine states were sent to New York as part of the Stamp Act Congress to protest the new law. It was during this time that John Adams wrote in opposition to the Stamp Act, `We have always understood it to be a grand and fundamental principle . . . that no freeman shall be subject to any tax to which he has not given his own consent, in person or by proxy.' A number of resolutions were adopted by the Stamp Act Congress protesting the acts of Parliament. One resolution stated, `It is inseparably essential to the freedom of a people . . . that no taxes be imposed on them, but with their own consent, given personally or by their representatives.' The resolutions concluded that the Stamp Act had a `manifest tendency to subvert the rights and liberties of the colonists.' 
Opposition to the Stamp Act was vehemently continued through the colonies in pamphlet form. These pamphlets asserted that the basic premise of a free government included taxation of the people by themselves or through their representatives. 
Other Americans reacted to the Stamp Act by rioting, intimidating tax collectors, and boycotts directed against England. While Grenville's successor was determined to repeal the law, the social, economic and political climate in the colonies brought on the American Revolution. The principles expressed during the earlier crisis against taxation without representation became firmly embedded in our Federal Constitution of 1787. 
Yet, the Supreme Court has overlooked this fundamental lesson in American history. The Jenkins decision extends the power of the judiciary into an area which has traditionally been reserved as a legislative function within the Federal, State, and local governments. In the Federalist No. 48, James Madison explained that in our democratic system, `the legislative branch alone has access to the pockets of the people.' 
This idea has remained steadfast in America for over 200 years. Elected officials with authority to tax are directly accountable to the people who give their consent to taxation through the ballot box. The shield of accountability against 
unwarranted taxes has been removed now that the Supreme Court has sanctioned judicially imposed taxes. The American citizenry lacks adequate protection when they are subject to taxation by unelected, life tenured Federal judges. 
There are many programs and projects competing for a finite number of tax dollars. The public debate surrounding taxation is always intense. Sensitive discussions are held by elected officials and their constituents concerning increases and expenditures of scarce tax dollars. To allow Federal judges to impose taxes is to discount valuable public debate concerning priorities for expenditures of a limited public resource. 
Mr. President, the dispositive issue presented by the Jenkins decision is whether the American people want, as a matter of national policy, to be exposed to taxation without their consent by an independent and insulated judiciary. I most assuredly believe they do not. 
This brings us to the second Constitutional issue which we must address in light of this Jenkins decision. That issue is Congressional authority under the Constitution to limit the remedial jurisdiction of lower Federal courts established by the Congress. Article III, Section 1, of the Constitution provides jurisdiction to the lower Federal courts as the `Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.' There is no mandate in the Constitution to confer equity jurisdiction to the inferior Federal courts. Congress has the flexibility under Article III to `ordain and establish' the lower Federal courts as it deems appropriate. This basic premise has been upheld by the Supreme Court in a number of cases including Lockerty versus Phillips, Lauf versus E.G. Skinner and Co., Kline versus Burke Construction Co., and Sheldon versus Sill. 
This legislation would preclude the lower Federal courts from issuing any order or decree requiring imposition of `any new tax or to increase any existing tax or tax rate.' I firmly believe that this language is wholly consistent with Congressional authority under Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution. 
There is nothing in this legislation which would restrict the power of the Federal courts from hearing constitutional claims. It accords due respect to all provisions of the Constitution and merely limits the availability of a particular judicial remedy which has traditionally been a legislative function. The objective of this legislation is straightforward, to prohibit Federal courts from increasing taxes. The language in this bill applies to the lower Federal courts and does not deny claimants judicial access to seek redress of any Federal constitutional right. 
Mr. President, how long will it be before a Federal judge orders tax increases to build new highways or prisons? I do not believe the Founding Fathers had this type of activism in mind when they established the judicial branch of government. The role of the judiciary is to interpret the law. The power to tax is an exclusive legislative right belonging to the Congress and governments at the state level. We are accountable to the citizens and must justify any new taxes. The American people deserve a timely response to the Jenkins decision and we must provide protection against the imposition of taxes by an independent judiciary.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which provides that a justice or judge convicted of a felony shall be suspended from office without pay pending the disposition of impeachment proceedings. 
I believe that the citizens of the United States will agree that those who have been convicted of felonies should not be allowed to continue to occupy positions of trust and responsibility in our Government. Nevertheless, under current constitutional law it is possible for judges to continue to receive a salary and to still sit on the bench and hear cases even after being convicted of a felony. If they are unwilling to resign, the only method which may be used to remove them from the Federal payroll is impeachment. 
Currently, the Congress has the power to impeach officers of the Government who have committed treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. Even when a court has already found an official guilty of a serious crime, Congress must then essentially retry the official before he or she can be removed from the Federal payroll. The impeachment process is typically very time consuming and can occupy a great deal of the resources of Congress. 
Mr. President, one way to solve this problem would be to amend the Constitution. Today, I am also introducing a Senate resolution proposing a constitutional amendment providing for forfeiture of office by Government officials and judges convicted of felonies involving moral turpitude. While I believe that a constitutional amendment may be the best solution to the problem, I am also introducing this statutory remedy to address the current situation. 
This legislation will provide that a judge convicted of a felony involving moral turpitude shall be suspended from office without pay. The legislation specifies that the suspension begins upon conviction and that no additional time accrues toward retirement from that date. However, the judge would be reinstated if the criminal conviction is reversed upon appeal or if articles of impeachment do not result in conviction by the Senate. 
Mr. President, the framers of the Constitution could not have intended convicted felons to continue to serve on the bench and to receive compensation once they have seriously violated the law and the trust of the people. I urge my colleagues to carefully consider this legislation.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Curt Flood Act of 1997, which I am cosponsoring with Senator Hatch, Senator Leahy, and others. Our legislation would repeal the antitrust exemption which shields major league baseball from the antitrust laws that apply to all other sports and unregulated businesses in our Nation. This bill is virtually identical to S. 627 in the last Congress which was the result of discussions between myself and Senators Hatch and Leahy following the February 1995 hearing I chaired on this important issue. The bill is a compromise which has been carefully drafted to ensure that it achieves its purpose without imposing any unnecessary hardship on major league baseball. 
It is fitting that this bill is named after Curt Flood, who died yesterday, for the Supreme Court denied Mr. Flood the relief he sought by upholding the antitrust exemption which we now seek to change. In his 1972 Supreme Court case, Mr. Flood challenged baseball's reserve clause which bound players to teams for their entire careers. Although unsuccessful because of the judicially-created antitrust exemption, Mr. Flood's selfless actions paved the way for the success of other players through arbitration. It is now time for us to resolve the antitrust exemption. 
The bill we are introducing today eliminates baseball's antitrust exemption, with two exceptions. The legislation maintains the status quo for franchise location, and for the relationship with the minor leagues. It is important to protect the existing minor league relationships in order to avoid disruption of the more than 170 minor league teams which exist throughout our Nation. Continuing to shield franchise relocation decisions from the antitrust laws resolves the uncertainty facing team owners in other professional sports. 
Mr. President, it is my belief that the Congress should repeal the court-imposed antitrust exemption and restore baseball to the same level playing field as other professional sports and unregulated businesses. In the last Congress, we were successful in passing S. 627 in the Antitrust, Business Rights, and Competition Subcommittee and in the Committee on the Judiciary. In this Congress we should make a concerted effort to enact the Curt Flood Act.

Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the voluntary school prayer constitutional amendment. This bill is identical to Senate Joint Resolution 73 which I introduced in the 98th Congress at the request of then President Reagan and reintroduced every Congress since. 
This proposal has received strong support from our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and is of vital importance to our Nation. It would restore the right to pray voluntarily in public schools--a right which was freely exercised under our Constitution until the 1960's, when the Supreme Court ruled to the contrary. 
Also, in 1985, the Supreme Court ruled an Alabama statute unconstitutional which authorized teachers in public schools to provide `a period of silence * * * for meditation or voluntary prayer' at the beginning of each school day. As I stated when that opinion was issued and repeat again--the Supreme Court has too broadly interpreted the establishment clause of the first amendment and, in doing so, has incorrectly infringed on the rights of those children--and their parents--who wish to observe a moment of silence for religious or other purposes. 
Until the Supreme Court ruled in the Engel and Abington School District decisions, the establishment clause of the first amendment was generally understood to prohibit the Federal Government from officially approving, or holding in special favor, any particular religious faith or denomination. In crafting that clause, our Founding Fathers sought to prevent what has originally caused many colonial Americans to emigrate to this country--an official, State religion. At the same time, they sought, through the free exercise clause, to guarantee to all Americans the freedom to worship God without government interference or restraint. In their wisdom, they recognized that true religious liberty precludes the government from both forcing and preventing worship. 
As Supreme Court Justice William Douglas once stated: `We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being.' Nearly every President since George Washington has proclaimed a day of public prayer. Moreover, we, as a nation, continue to recognize the Deity in our Pledge of Allegiance by affirming that we are a Nation `under God.' Our currency is inscribed with the motto, `In God We Trust'. In this body, we open the Senate and begin our workday with the comfort and stimulus of voluntary group prayers--such a practice has been recently upheld as constitutional by the Supreme Court. It is unreasonable that the opportunity for the same beneficial experience is denied to the boys and girls who attend public schools. This situation simply does not comport with the intentions of the Framers of the Constitution and is, in fact, antithetical to the rights of our youngest citizens to freely exercise their respective religions. It should be changed, without further delay. 
The Congress should swiftly pass this resolution and send it to the States for ratification. This amendment to the Constitution would clarify that it does not prohibit vocal, voluntary prayer in the public school and other public institutions. It emphatically states that no person may be required to participate in any prayer. The government would be precluded from drafting school prayers. This well-crafted amendment enjoys the support of an overwhelming number of Americans. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support prompt consideration and approval of this bill during this Congress.
