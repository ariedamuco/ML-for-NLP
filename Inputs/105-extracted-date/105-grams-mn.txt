Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I also rise this morning to discuss my opposition to the omnibus appropriations legislation that was before us this morning. 
While I realize many of my colleagues would have preferred not to return for this vote, there are a number of us who believed that a vote was essential on a bill that appropriates a third of our spending priorities for fiscal year 1999. 
To shirk our responsibility to the taxpayers, to hide behind an unrecorded vote, was unconceivable. 
I feel strongly that we are elected to represent the American people and to take care of the Nation's business. The people expect us to be responsible. They expect us to be accountable. They expect us to be here and do our job. In other words, when it is time to cast a vote of this magnitude, they expect us to be here, to stand up and to be counted. 
The omnibus appropriation legislation includes $500 billion in funding for many essential Government programs and functions. It represents 8 out of 13 appropriations bills, or two-thirds of this year's entire appropriations work, one-third of our entire annual Federal spending. It is by far the most important piece of legislation we have before us this year. 
This monster bill consists of more than 4,000 pages. We can hardly lift it, much less take time to review it before the vote. I venture to say that most Members of the Senate still have no idea what is in it. Even Evelyn Wood herself could not have made it through this volume in the few short hours we had to digest it. It would take days to get through it, but we are only allowed to review it in the Chamber, with no copies available for the individual review that is necessary. I don't believe they are available yet. 
Just to approve it, we were told, and everyone would be free to go home and campaign. One Democratic House Member was quoted as saying, `We would be better off not knowing what is in the bill.' He said, `Ignorance is bliss.' Even the House appropriations chairman called this an `ominous' spending bill. 
Shame on Congress. If that is truly what my colleagues really believe, and if they really do think so little of the taxpayers whose dollars fund every program, every agency, and every piece of pork tucked so carefully into this bill, I say to them, perhaps you have been in Washington too long. This is not how I look upon my own responsibilities to my Minnesota constituents and my constitutional duty to the Nation. The people of Minnesota didn't send me here to rubber stamp anything, and certainly not this bill. 
What disgusts me most is the process that produced this omnibus appropriations legislation. The entire negotiations were secretive, arbitrary, conducted behind closed doors by only a handful of congressional leaders and White House staff. The special interests were well represented at that table, but the taxpayers clearly were not. Again, the special interests were well represented at the table, but the taxpayers clearly were not. 
Is this the best deal we could get with this President? I guess it is. President Clinton was intent on spending more money, money from the surplus, money that he said, in fact, should be saved for Social Security. But President Clinton's thoughts on spending Social Security money must have been more important than evidently saving Social Security. 
As soon as the bill emerged from that protective cloak, it was thrown at us and we were told to agree to it. No process of floor consideration, no debate, no amendments, no votes. I have to wonder whether this is truly a democracy. This isn't the way we do business in this great democracy. It is true Congress has behaved this way before and the secretive goings-on are nothing new. But this does not make it right. 
As early at 1988, President Reagan stood up and asked Congress to change this practice. It is wrong because it destroys our democracy. It undermines our political institution of government through representation. It is wrong because it allows just a few to make policy without careful deliberation and to spend hundreds of billions of taxpayers' hard-earned money without the taxpayers being duly represented. We must stop this practice now. 
Early in March, I reluctantly voted for the fiscal year 1999 budget resolution in the Budget Committee. I did so to help facilitate the process and offer a chance to improve the budget plan as it moved to the Senate floor. I later again voted for the budget resolution based on a breakthrough agreement reached with the Senate leadership. 
Under this agreement, our leadership would pursue the larger tax relief number of either the Senate or House, and it would make the repeal of the marriage penalty our top priority. They committed to a tax bill this year protected by reconciliation legislation. 
Unfortunately, these commitments were never honored. What did we end up with instead? Tax increases, not tax relief. More spending, not leaner, more efficient Government. And again we faced a President who threatened to veto a Government shutdown if we even dared to send him tax relief for the American people. President Clinton called Americans `selfish' if they want some of their surplus money back, their extra tax dollars. 
Republicans have joined Democrats and the President to raise the higher spending levels added in the negotiations. It is beyond belief that, facing the first budget surplus in a quarter of a century, that this Congress could have joined with the President to produce this bill in this election year. 
I have argued repeatedly before this Chamber that the surplus is generated directly by increased individual income tax payments and it has little--little--to do with Government policy. In other words, the credit for the surplus does not go to the President, to the Senate, or to the House, but the surplus goes to the productivity of the American business and the American worker. 
Outside the money earmarked for Social Security, we owe it to the taxpayers to return at least some of that surplus to them. That would have been the moral and it would have been the fair thing to do. 
I also warned repeatedly that if we don't return at least a portion of the surplus to the taxpayers, and soon, that Washington will spend it all, leaving nothing for tax relief or the vitally important task of preserving Social Security. 
The omnibus appropriations legislation proves my point dramatically. This bill is nothing but a continuation of President Clinton's tax-and-spend policies. Again, the President's own words, `Save Social Security first,' and I guess what he really meant was, `Let me spend the Social Security surplus first,' and make sure that the taxpayer does not get their hands on the surplus. 
Despite the rhetoric about fiscal discipline, Washington has broken the spending caps by using the budget surplus. The spending bill exceeds the caps by at least $20 billion, and the only reason there is any surplus still on the table is that Washington evidently ran out of time to spend it. 
To mask its budget maneuvering, Washington has covered its tracks with budget gimmicks, including $4 billion in Social Security `forward funding' into the year 2000. How are we going to adapt this to lower spending next year? Will we keep on forward funding into the future, shrinking and shirking our budget responsibilities? 
Another dishonest accounting measure was to label this additional spending as `emergency spending' in order to justify the breaking of the spending caps. Instead of fencing off the budget surplus to save Social Security first, as it claims it is doing, Washington has spent an additional $22 billion of the budget surplus--a third of the surplus--to fund non-Social Security programs--again, nearly one-third of the 1998 budget surplus. This is Washington hypocrisy of the highest degree. 
In the past few months, I heard so much demagoguery in the Chamber about saving Social Security, and we have heard the President pledge repeatedly to the public that he wanted to use every penny of the surplus for Social Security. But to date, the administration is still denying they have, in fact, used the budget surplus. It appears this administration has a very unique way of interpreting the truth or admitting the obvious. 
Few of the `emergency spending' items in this bill are truly emergency related. Many of these dollars could have been added early on in the appropriations process. But the maneuvering allowed the President to spend more, and I know President Clinton's biggest disappointment in this budget is he wasn't able to spend even more. The Y2K problem is not new. The need for Bosnia troops funds and the readiness funds is also not new. These should have been funded earlier. They should have been funded through the normal budget and appropriations process. But that allowed them to spend more of the regular budget so they could come back and dig deeper into the surplus to spend more money. 
I only wish this Congress and the President could be as creative in finding ways to reduce taxes, cut spending and make the Government more efficient as they are in finding new and creative ways of spending money, especially the surplus, and making this Government even bigger. 
It is ironic that my Republican colleagues are scared to death of using the budget surplus for tax relief, despite the fact that it is the taxpayers' money in the first place, but don't mind at all in helping the Democrats to spend it. 
This bill is a Christmas tree that is loaded not with ornaments but with plenty of pork projects and backdoor spending. Here is one example: The bill includes $1 billion for global warming, a 26-percent increase from last year's funding level. The Senate and the House had previously rejected this level of funding--rejected it--but somehow somebody managed to just sneak it back into the bill. Yet the President hasn't even sent us the global warming treaty. So this funding basically just mocks the Hagel-Byrd resolution that we passed last year. 
There are some good provisions that I support and worked hard to have included in this bill. There are many good things in here, such as the desperately needed relief for farmers, 
IMF funding, and 100 percent healthcare cost deductions. 
Frankly, some of the provisions and funding will help my own state of Minnesota. But the reckless process and irresponsible spending overshadows these good provisions. It was against my conscience to vote for this legislation. 
Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed by the inability of our own Republican leadership to keep its promise to working Americans. I am also deeply troubled that the Republican Party seems to have lost its courage to stand up to our principles. I expect compromises have to be made, but not compromises so heavily weighted in one direction, allowing heavy handed arm twisting, black mailing tactics of this White House to succeed. 
When I first ran for Congress six years ago, I was very proud to be a Republican because we believed in our vision of a government that works for the people, and we believed government should be limited to only that amount needed for necessary services. The Democratic Party, on the other hand, has long believed that people should work for the government--or, at the very least, that the government has a right to spend every penny it can take from working Americans. Basically, Washington doesn't believe Americans are smart enough to take care of themselves. I don't know many Americans who believe they need Washington to hold their hand in spending their money or taking care of their families. 
That is exactly why the American taxpayers ushered in an era of Republican congressional leadership in 1994--a new majority that pledged to provide fiscal discipline, individual freedom, personal responsibility, and prosperity for all people. 
What changes have this new majority made four years after the 1994 Republican revolution? Well, the distinctions between the two political parties have all but disappeared; the taxes on working Americans are at an all-time high; the government is getting bigger, not smaller; federal spending has increased from $1.5 trillion in 1994 to $1.76 trillion today; and the national debt has grown from $4.9 trillion to $5.7 trillion, an $810 billion increase. 
Mr. President, these are the differences for which this Republican-led Congress can take its share of the credit, or more honestly the blame! 
Republicans failed not because our efforts have lost the support of the people, but because our party has lost its backbone. It has lost the courage to make a stand on principle and not abandon its moral compass at the first sign of resistance. 
Mr. President, each time Congress makes a promise to the taxpayers--as it did in promising significant tax relief this year--and then deserts them, Congress comforts itself by saying it will come back next year and enact an even larger tax cut. I view this as an insult that flies in the face of Reality! This is self-deceiving at best. If we do not take a stand today, what is going to happen to make us more courageous a year from now? Besides, each year we wait, the government takes an ever-greater bite of the earnings of working Americans and the government gets bigger and becomes harder to trim in the future. 
Mr. President, another big mistake we made that helped create the mess we find ourselves in today is that we failed to pass the `good government' legislation I proposed in 1997. I have repeatedly asked our leaders to honor the commitment they made during consideration of last year's disaster relief legislation to bring up legislation that provides an automatic CR at last year's funding level for remaining appropriations pending at end of the session. This would keep pressure on appropriators to complete their business and keep all of us in the process--not just a select few. It would also keep us free from political blackmail: `If you do not give me this, then I will shut down the government and blame you for being heartless and ineffective.' It happened before, and Republicans were afraid it could happen again, and the recklessness of this White House for political purposes is a reality. Had we such a process in effect this year that would not allow the government to shut down, we would have completed the business of the nation on September 30, and not been forced back here to vote on October 20. This path, not the path we are currently on, would have been the responsible path to take. 
Mr. President, I therefore was forced to cast a `no' vote on this legislation because I am deeply disappointed in this business-as-usual attitude, and deeply disgusted with the process the pork-laden, backdoor spending, and the budget gimmicks. Americans deserve better. And let us put Congress and this President on notice, we will use every Senate rule available not to let this happen again next year. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the compromise H-1B visa legislation included in the omnibus appropriations bill. I am pleased a compromise was achieved that has now passed the House by a vote of more than two to one. 
With the demand in this country rising for this category of highly skilled workers currently in short supply in the U.S., I believe there is a need to temporarily increase this visa category. The engine now driving our successful economy is being fueled in large part by growth in the information technology industry. I am told these high tech industries account for about one-third of our real economic growth. According to the Information Technology Industry Data Book, 1998-2008, the domestic revenue from the U.S. information technology industry is projected to be $703 billion for the year 2000. 
With this sudden surge in industry growth, the United States has found itself unprepared to supply the large numbers of math and engineering graduates necessary to support this growth. In fact, American schools are producing fewer math and engineering graduates than in the past. 
We have been forced to address this current imbalance by temporarily allowing needed high-tech workers to work in our country. This is necessary until we can develop the expertise we need in the country. 
This compromise bill will do just that. For the next 3 years, additional workers from foreign countries will be allowed to work here. During this time, Americans will be educated to fill these jobs through scholarships and job training financed by fees collected from employers petitioning for the current foreign workers. We must do more to ensure our work force meet the demands of a growing, more sophisticated economy--that we have the educated work force we need to continue to prosper and provide better jobs for Americans. 
There are other important issues covered by the bill including increased penalties for violations of law by employers, random investigations of employers sponsoring H-1B visas by the Department of Labor and protection of `whistleblowing' employees. I think this compromise is something that will help us now and in the future. I urge its passage.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the important issue of hunger in America. We often hear about hunger as a global problem affecting many people every day. Many in our own country warn us of a growing hunger problem in America. 
One of my Minnesota constituents, Dr. Joseph Ioffe, is a former Russian professor of economics and challenges this thinking from his first hand knowledge of hunger in Russia. He has written an editorial that suggests our real problem is one that involves the quality of diet for low-income families rather than starvation.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, about two weeks ago, a list of medical device companies was printed in the Congressional Record which indicated they were non-responsive to The Food and Drug Administration's request for Year 200 compliance status. 
As Chairman of the Senate Medical Technology Caucus, I believe it is important my colleagues have the latest on manufacturers which have been responsive to the FDA's request for information on the Year 2000 compliance status of their products Companies were asked by the FDA to indicate in their response the following: 
The medical devices marketed and have sold are not Year 2000 vulnerable; medical devices marketed and sold are all year 2000 compliant; the manufacturer is providing specific information regarding those products which are not compliant or their assessment is currently incomplete; or the manufacturer is working on an assessment and will post the results. 
Mr. President, there are many sectors of our economy which still need to address the potential for problems in the year 2000, but I am pleased that a vast majority of medical device companies in the United States have responded to the FDA on year 2000 compliance status and deserve to be recognized for having done so. 
I would like to mention specifically thirteen companies mistakenly listed in the Congressional Record as being unresponsive to the FDA's request. These manufacturers have responded to the FDA's request for Year 2000 compliance status: Apothecary Incorporated, Augustine Medical Incorporated, Braemar Corporation, Dantec Medical Incorporated, Diametrics Medical Incorporated, Keomed Incorporated, Medtronic PS Medical Medtronic Bio-medicus, Medtronic Neurological, Prime Ideas Incorporated, Puritan Bennett Corporation, Timm Research Company, and Williams Sound Corporation. 
Mr. President, while this list only represents companies based in Minnesota, the FDA has compiled a much larger listing of companies which are or have addressed year 2000 issues on their website located at www.fda.gov.

Mr. GRAMS. I rise in support of the WIPO Copyright Treaties Implementation Act Conference Report adopted by the Senate on October 8, and commend the Senator from Utah for his efforts in crafting legislation that will greatly aid American copyright owners and users in the digital world. This legislation is of great importance to the citizens of Minnesota, including many companies that produce copyrighted materials as well as the hard-working men and women employed by them. 
As the Senator form Utah is also aware, however, I have a great interest in Senate action to protect database owners, to continue the availability of quality and reliable products and services for users here and abroad. Earlier this summer, I introduced S. 2291 to provide this protection, and worked to include this language into the WIPO Implementing legislation. I greatly regret this legislation could not be included as part of this Conference Report. 
Would the Senator from Utah and his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee agree to take up this issue as a priority item early in the 106th Congress? I believe we need fair and balanced database protection legislation, similar to S.2291.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about some of the impending debate going on right now to try to close out these final days of this Congress. As you know, most of the talk is centered around the issue of education. While I was sitting here listening, I thought really that most Members of Congress that are up for election were back home campaigning. But I guess they are not, because some have been here this afternoon campaigning on the floor of the Senate. I heard today some of the outlines of what was basically their very liberal agenda, which did not pass some very radical proposals that this Congress did not accept. 
They talked about delays and about the lack of work in this session, but they didn't mention that this Congress has required more cloture motions just to try to get issues onto the floor. We have also heard, I think, some real tall tales of revision of the history of budget negotiations, et cetera, talking about how much credit should go to this President for the current economic benefits that we are reaping. But somehow they forget a lot of the work done during the 1980s, like the tax cut, deregulation of many industries, the productivity of workers and companies that have basically produced more revenue for this Government to allow us to balance the budget. It really hasn't been anything that this President has done to balance the budget. 
If you talked about this big budget plan offered in 1993--which I am proud to say not one Republican supported because the centerpiece of that plan was just like every other Democratic proposal over the last 40 years--that was to raise taxes on the American people in order to try to solve what they saw as a crisis or problem, but the real intent was to enlarge and expand the size and scope of Government, to bring more control to Washington. This plan raised $263 billion in new taxes--the largest tax increase in history in this country--which has now taken the average American family to the highest levels of taxation in history, with over 42 percent for the average American going to taxes. That means you work just about as much time to support Government as you are allowed to work to raise your family, to support your family--health care, educational needs, food, clothing, shelter, et cetera. 
I have to say that if it was such a great idea to raise taxes and that solves the problems, I don't know why we don't simply say let's raise taxes to 100 percent of what you make so the Government can be real sure that it takes care of every need that you have, and we can be on the floor here bragging next year, or the year after and the year after how great Washington has done. 
When you see some of the waste, fraud and abuse in this Government, the bureaucracy--and we can sit here and say that Washington can handle problems better than the American family. Mr. President, that kind of baffles the mind. Some people think raising taxes and sending more money to Washington is a godsend, and it has somehow taken care of all the problems in this country, when I don't think too many people out there would want Washington to be their own financial adviser when they can't even count on Social Security to be there. I wanted to express more concern and basically disappointment over what appears to be an eleventh-hour attempt now by the President to force straitjacket education policy on our Nation's schools and children. 
The President brought this up a year ago in his State of the Union Address. There has been no legislation or ideas brought to the floor on increasing the size or putting more teachers into the classroom. Everybody can agree that education is probably one of the most important things that we need in this country. Again, I don't know if people want to give that control over to Washington and have them hiring teachers, telling us who we can hire and fire in the classroom. They would go from there to what the curriculum is going to be. Then they would tell us what to teach the children and what books to read. 
When you talk about revision of history and what we have heard here on the budget issues alone, can you imagine what our textbooks are going to be like when we hear some apologizing for Christopher Columbus? Can you imagine the difference in the wealth and lifestyle of this great country? In some of our textbooks, Christopher Columbus is being viewed as somebody who did things wrong. Sure, there were problems back then, and there were new diseases brought to this continent. But to say now that we should be apologizing for what Christopher Columbus did, or maybe apologize for how this country ended World War II--nobody wanted to use the bomb, but to rewrite the stories of the Enola Gay and say America was somehow responsible for World War II, we didn't start the war. We had to find a way to end it. It was not a pleasant way to do it, but it did save lives from the day-to-day fighting. There would not have only 
been thousands more American soldiers who would have died, in addition to the thousands who died in World War II, but thousands more Japanese civilians would have been killed as well. 
Mr. President, President Clinton and others in Congress have decided to renew their one-size-fits-all argument that they know how best to spend education dollars for each and every student, in each and every school in the country, from the inner city to rural classrooms. 
Education for all is a top priority, as I mentioned. All of us have the top priority of education for our children and grandchildren. That politicians are using it today as a last-ditch political coverup, I believe, is beneath contempt. The central charge being made is that the Republican-led Congress hasn't met the demands for increases in education spending. This simply is not the case. 
According to the Senate Budget Committee, in the last three budget cycles during which Republicans have controlled Congress, this Congress has provided $79 billion, or 97 percent of the President's education requests. 
In other words, in 5 of the last 6 years, there has been less than a 3-percent difference between the President's request for education outlays and what Congress has provided. And to suggest otherwise is nothing but pure politics. 
As we have seen time and time again in Washington, it is very easy to just go out there and try to up the ante. When I say that, what they are trying to do out here is bribe the American people with your money. In other words, they just want to take a little bit more of our money to Washington, raise your taxes, erode your tax bases, take more money away from your tax base to support your own local schools so they can up the ante out here in Washington, because Washington can't give you anything. It can't enrich your school districts until it takes something from you. So it has to take money from you to bring it to Washington and promise you something that they are going to give back, but with a lot of strings--and by the way, a lot less money, because by the time you support the buildings and bureaucracy here in Washington, you are only getting pennies on the dollar back. 
Somehow, they promise you something, but they don't tell you who is going to pay for it. Sure, some might be getting more money back than they paid, but most Americans are going to pay more in taxes to get this type of help from Washington. When you give that control to Washington, you as parents lose control at home over what decisions are going to be made, whether it is over teachers, curriculum, et cetera. 
So upping the ante here, its easy for somebody to try to outbid the other, saying let's do $3 billion or $5 billion or $7 billion--it is all your money. So it is easy to up the ante so as to be able to complain that Congress isn't spending enough. We have seen this painfully played out, for example, in making emergency moneys available for our Nation's farmers. 
One tell-tale sign that the administration's proposals are for `show' only is that they cannot be met without breaking the budget. I heard here a while ago that the spending bidding wars the President is talking about right now is not going to break the budget, that it is all offset. I don't know where it is coming from. I haven't seen the offsets. The only offset I have seen is that it is going to come out of the budget surplus. 
Something in the neighborhood of $20 billion of surplus money is already being spent by this administration. He is trying to twist the arms of the Republican Congress to go along with this looming threat of a possible Government shutdown, or saying we don't care about education, or we don't care about the American farmer. But somehow Republicans wanted to give a tax break because some of the surplus money is from larger revenues due to income growth. We say, if we are overbilling the American people, maybe we should give some money back. They say, you can't do that, and they say they think about Social Security first. That tax cut would have been about $7 billion in the year 1999. 
That was too much money to give $7 billion back, which would amount to basically less than $1 a month per person in this country. 
That is a huge tax cut--less than $1 a month--$7 billion? They couldn't do that. But yet $20 billion of that surplus can be spent. And they are saying, `Well, we are not taking this out of the surplus; we are going to offset it.' I would like to know where they are offsetting it, and, if they are offsetting it in some programs, I would like to know where those programs are going to be able to get along with less money, after all of this year trying to work out budgets through our committees. The President knows this. 
The only offset proposal has been through increased tobacco taxes. That is what we heard earlier this year. That is how the President was going to pay for 100,000 new teachers. That is how the President was going to pay for rebuilding new schools. And that, by the way, is the prerogative, the responsibility, the opportunity, of the local school boards and school districts. They should be doing this--not the Federal Government, because the Federal Government then has to make money from them to give back to them. But, in the meantime, they lose a lot of control and authority. But when there was no tobacco bill this year--again, this is one of the radical liberal agendas that did not pass this Congress that we have heard complaints about. Again, I am very proud to have voted against that piece of legislation. But there is no money there. 
So, if there is no money from the tobacco legislation, now the President is saying we are going to have to dip into something else. But it is going to come out of the surplus, and that is the extra money that you have worked for, which Washington now has and won't give back. Congress has rejected that plan. The President has now proposed an alternative method of financing his proposal. 
Another giveaway as to the political nature of this last-minute demagoguing is the plain fact that simply spending more money in Washington for the sake of spending more money does nothing to solve the education problems in this country. I think the President should pay attention to the fact that it is going to take a little more time and a little more effort to solve these problems than he has been willing to devote in the past. 
If this is such an important issue, which I think it is, I think we need to have Congress to bring it before our committee. Let's sit down and debate it and lay it all out and see where the advantages are, how much it is going to cost and where the money is going to come from, rather than the President trying to again break arms and jam it into an omnibus budget bill. In fact, spending money blindly may ultimately do more harm than good. 
According to a recent article in the Washington Post,  
The nation's largest study examining the use of computers in schools has concluded that the $5 billion being spent each year on educational technology is actually hurting children in many cases because the computers aren't being put to good use. 
While I support teaching out kids to use technology, and computers are an important part of this, I do not believe high-tech classrooms are the only priority. 
And, while spending great sums of money on technology-education is feel-good politics for those who spend the money, it can come, as we've seen, at the expense of our kids. 
Last year, the American Management Association found that two-thirds of managers said new employees had strong computer skills, but that only 29 percent said the employees could write competently. 
I am always reminded of a story, because I think it suggests some very serious education problems in this country: A small school district in northern Minnesota was being given an award because their students had ranked among the top in the scores that year. In the test scores out there, their students had ranked among the top. Somebody came up, and while they were going through some of the records, they noticed that this school district had some of the lowest costs per pupil in the State. So the question was asked: `How can you account for having higher test scores when you have had some of the lowest spending per pupil year?' The principal said, `I don't know how to explain it.' He said, `All we can basically do is offer our kids the basics.' 
In other words, they were teaching them to read, to write, and to do arithmetic rather than the `feel good' diversity type programs that we see teachers now hamstrung with today. They can spend less than half of their costs on the basics, because the Government dictates today already preclude them from teaching their kids the basics. 
When they talk about money in this country, that we are not spending enough money--we spend more on education; it is only second to health care. About $450 billion a year goes to education. That is more than any country in the world spends per student per year. In fact, if you look at the numbers, the United States spends nearly twice as much per student per year as any country in the world. Yet we rank 14 out of 14 of the industrialized nations in the world in test scores when it comes to math and sciences and the ability to write. 
So, if other countries can spend less and get more, where is the problem? The problem isn't the amount of money that we are spending on education, it is how that money is being used. And now, to say if we could only come back and throw some more money at it--I will give you an example. Back in the 1950s, if we adjusted to inflation today, the States were spending an average of about $600 per student per year in education. Today, 1998, we are spending well over $6,000 per student per year--from $600 in 1950 to over $6,000 today. 
The District of Columbia spends over $10,000. In Minnesota, the city of Minneapolis spends over $10,000 per student and yet has some of the lowest test scores in the State. 
So, again, is it the money? Or is it some of the ways that we are teaching our children, or some of the programs, or the time that our kids are being given to study the basics in order to learn? 
I think the ones who really come out on the short end of this are the students. While we are up here debating all of this, saying that we need all this curriculum, that we need all this money, that we need all this stuff, our kids are graduating with some of the lowest test scores around the world, without the ability to compete in the next generation. They are the ones being shortchanged while a lot of this debate is going on here. I think those problems show that our students are not learning the basics despite our spending efforts. 
Over the last 30 years, as I have mentioned, we have increasingly spent more of the Nation's money on education. Nominal spending has risen eightfold since 1969. 
Furthermore, a recent Wall Street Journal article reports that in the past 45 years the average pupil-teacher ratio in this country has already fallen by 35 percent. In the past 45 years, the student-teacher ratio has fallen 35 percent. Yet, our test scores have fallen with it. The SAT scores have stagnated, and the international tests have put them at the bottom. 
In Math and Science General Knowledge tests, United States students ranked 16th out of 21 in science, behind Russia and Slovenia but ahead of Cyprus. 
In math, United States students ranked 19th out of 21 countries, behind Russia, Slovenia, Hungary, and Lithuania. America already outspends every other country per child on education, and ranked among the bottom of all. 
Clearly, simply spending more money is not the answer to better learning. If it were, we certainly wouldn't have these sorts of test scores to show for it. 
The answers to our education problems do not lie in `wired classrooms.' No computer can take the place of a good teacher. Instead, I believe that the answers to learning are found in each and every teacher-child relationship, in each and every classroom. 
There is no amount of money that can replace a teacher who cares and wants to reach kids, and has the freedom to do so. 
This freedom comes with the authority to make decisions based on local needs--not dictates from Washington, not more control from Washington, not more strings attached to the classrooms from Washington. I have continually supported plans which would return money and also return control from Washington to parents, to teachers, and to local school districts. After all, I think they know best how to spend their education dollars. 
Plans such as the Education Savings and School Excellence Act would have been an important step toward accomplishing this. 
This bipartisan education reform legislation would have allowed low- and middle-income families to open education savings accounts to pay for the particular education needs of their children--from textbooks to tutoring to tuition. 
Unfortunately, for families and students, President Clinton vetoed this legislation. There has been an agenda dealing with education in this Congress this year. It has gone nowhere, because the President and those Members on that side of the aisle --the Democrats--have disagreed and have stalled the efforts, or have vetoed it with the President's plan, claiming that it would divert resources from public education. This is false. The Education Savings and School Excellence Act would not have touched 1 cent of Federal spending for education--would not have touched 1 cent of the surplus either. It would have come from parents being able to set aside more of their own money so that they could decide how they wanted to spend it for their children's education--whether they needed additional tutoring, or tuition to go to a private or parochial school, or whatever the parent decided they needed. But they vetoed that plan. 
The reason the President vetoed this legislation--and I will be generous with this inference--is because he thinks he knows what is best for each and every student if America. 
But I would ask my colleagues to reflect on this for just a moment and to see if they aren't forced to come to the same conclusion: To think that the U.S. Government should impose a rigid generic formula on day-to-day decisions for all students is nothing short of frightening. 
So, Mr. President, I thank you very much for the time, and I hope we can work out these questions in the remaining days. Some of the questions now do not relate to the amount of money being spent on education but is being narrowed down to who is spending it, who controls it. I think the Republicans have made it very clear that if the money is to be spent, it should go to local school districts so that the parents and the teachers and local officials can decide how that money should be spent, not Washington. But on the other side, they would rather have the money come here to Washington so they can disperse it, so they can tell parents, teachers, local school districts and local officials how those dollars should be spent. I think Americans would rather have those local options left to themselves because this is incrementalism at its best. If you let Washington get its foot in the door, the camel's nose under the tent, it is only going to be a matter of time before they want more and more control over education in this country. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of domestic violence shelters and centers in my home state of Minnesota. As my colleagues may know, October is recognized as `National Domestic Violence Awareness Month.' This is a time to strengthen our resolve to end domestic violence and sexual assault. More importantly, it is also a time to remember those who have suffered and died as a result of these terrible crimes. 
I am very concerned about the number of domestic violence incidents in our society. Americans should not have to live in fear of being abused by anyone, let alone a family member. 
In my view, community-based domestic violence shelters and centers should be commended for their support for victims of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. Their efforts to provide shelter, counseling, and assistance to battered women and children have helped families and communities escape domestic violence.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take the remaining part of my time this morning to talk about a subject I have worked on for the 6 years I have been in Congress, and that is trying to raise the awareness of the issue of taxes in this country, that we are now taxed at an all-time high, and that Americans need and deserve some form of tax relief. 
So, Mr. President, I wanted to take time to rise today to express my disappointment over the Senate's failure to fulfill its obligations to the taxpayers to consider and to pass any kind of tax relief bill this year. 
Fiscally, socially, morally, this is a tremendous mistake, and I believe my colleagues are wrong. I am equally disappointed at President Clinton's threats to veto this important legislation had it passed. It is the same case as last year when, in the State of Virginia, when then-candidate for Governor Gilmore was pledging a tax cut of his own. The President said at that time that Virginians would be `selfish' to vote for tax relief. This year he says `to squander money on a tax cut'--again, that is how President Clinton is describing our attempt this year to let working Americans keep more of their money--`to squander money on a tax cut.' 
Unfortunately, there is a pattern here, and apparently neither President Clinton nor the rest of Washington has changed their mind. Both want as much money as they can get from the taxpayers, so they can spend it the way they think is best. 
According to Webster's Dictionary, the definition of `squander' is `to spend extravagantly or foolishly.' I say to President Clinton that I am shocked that you actually believe taxpayers squander their salaries in this way and that only Washington can spend the money wisely. With such highly placed disregard for the fiscal abilities of the American people, I believe it is no wonder that Washington has been unwilling to give the taxpayers more control over their own dollars. 
Let me focus first this morning, Mr. President, on the budget surplus. In a recent series of high-profile celebrations, folks here in Washington could hardly wait to rush to the cameras to claim credit for the $70 billion budget surplus, watching them slap their own backs with their hands. Politicians have been humming happy ditties all around this town while approving big-ticket spending items right and left. Meanwhile, those same politicians pontificate about preserving the surplus to `save Social Security first.' 
The truth is, the White House didn't generate this surplus, nor did the U.S. House or the Senate. The politicians have no rightful claim to the surplus. Washington should not be allowed to sit around and dream up ways to spend even more money because a surplus has arrived. Working Americans are responsible for propelling our economy forward and generating this budget surplus, and they deserve to get it back as tax relief. There should be no debate. Taxpayers have overpaid, and, like any other time a person overpays for anything, they ought to get it back. If you go into a store and pay too much for an item, you expect to get the change back. But somehow in Washington, if you overpay, that is just too bad, Washington wants to pocket your money. 
The surplus is the product of the recent revenue surge--a surge, I believe, generated directly by increased productivity and increased individual income tax payments, including the payment of capital gains taxes as investors took advantage of the lower capital gains rate--again, proving that reducing the tax rates can actually increase revenues, because the economy will grow. Very little of the surplus comes from policy changes, however, related to deficit reduction. 
On the other hand, there are others in this Chamber who claim there is no surplus, that if we subtract the dollars Washington has routinely raided from the Social Security trust fund, the Government is still in the red. Therefore, they oppose using the unified budget surplus for any kind of tax relief. 
Mr. President, they are right on the facts, but I believe they are dead wrong about the conclusion. Washington's big spenders are the ones who have exhausted every penny of the Social Security surplus. They have already exhausted every penny of the Social Security surplus on other Government programs. They have wish lists. The taxpayers shouldn't be denied relief from a stifling tax burden just because Washington has managed to juggle the Nation's bank accounts. 
I urge my colleagues to review the CBO's `August Economic and Budget Outlook,' which shows precisely where revenues will come from in the next 10 years. The data shows that the greatest share of the projected budget surplus comes directly from income taxes paid by the taxpayers, not the FICA taxes. In 1998, individual income, corporate, and estate taxes make up nearly 80 percent of total tax revenue growth, while the share of FICA tax is about 20 percent. General tax revenues are expected to grow by $723 billion, or 60 percent, over the next 10 years. 
What I am saying, Mr. President, is that the taxpayers generated the surplus, outside the money earmarked for Social Security, and the Government has no right to absorb it. It is only moral and fair to return at least a part of it to the taxpayers. 
If we don't return at least a portion of the surplus to the taxpayers, and do it soon, Washington is going to spend it, leaving nothing then for tax relief for the vitally important task of actually trying to preserve and save Social Security. Such spending will only enlarge the Government, and if the Government is enlarged today, it will make it even more expensive to support it in the future. 
Mr. President, the situation we find ourselves in today reflects two very fundamentally different principles of government: Are we going to embrace tax cuts for working Americans, or are we going to embrace more spending for social engineering? 
I am proud to serve here as a member of the Republican Party--a party which, since its creation, has firmly held that a person owns himself, a person owns his labor, and a person owns the fruits of his labor. We believe the pursuit of individual and States rights and a restricted role for the Federal Government create economic growth and prosperity. 
The two parties have traditionally offered a marked choice--a choice between the Democratic Party belief that people should work for the Government or our vision of a Government that works for the people. One party believes that it has a right to spend every penny that it can take from working Americans--again echoing the President's words that people are `selfish' to want to cut taxes or to `squander money on a tax cut.' 
The Republican Party, on the other hand, believes Government should be limited only to that amount needed for necessary services, and this is, indeed, a choice between two futures: a choice between small Government or big Government, a choice between fiscal discipline or irresponsibility, a choice between individual freedom or servitude to a bigger Government, responsibility or dependency, long-term economic prosperity for the Nation or some short-term benefits for the special interest groups and the politicians who feed them. 
Mr. President, that is exactly why the American taxpayers ushered in an era of Republican congressional leadership in 1994, a new majority that pledged to provide fiscal discipline, individual freedom, personal responsibility, and prosperity for all people. 
Unfortunately, Congress has so far delivered on only a small portion of that pledge, blocked by the competing forces of tax-and-spend versus tax relief and personal empowerment. The choice I spoke of a moment ago has become blurred as both parties fight in a misguided effort to purchase some measure of the people's trust. 
They think you can run out and with their own money buy the trust of the American people. But in doing so, Congress has allowed annual Federal spending to increase from $1.5 trillion in 1994 to $1.73 trillion today. In fact, Federal spending has never been higher. During the same period, the national debt has grown from $4.9 trillion to $5.7 trillion, an $810 billion increase in our national debt. 
Mr. President, take a look at the current debate over the supplemental spending to be included in the omnibus appropriations bill. A week ago, we were hearing encouraging words that much of this would be offset by cuts in other programs. Now, as we careen toward adjournment, it appears there will be as much as $20 billion in emergency spending--out of the surplus, of course--and the report this morning is that there could be even more as we work and maybe have to give in to the administration demands for more money to be spent in order to avoid a Government shutdown. 
Mr. President, despite a $70 billion budget surplus, total taxation is at an all-time high. 
The tax relief Congress enacted last year does not go nearly far enough. I am proud we had the courage to enact the $500 per-child tax credit, which I authored in 1993, but when our tax bill overall returns to the taxpayers only one cent for every dollar they send to Washington--especially now, during a time of surpluses--I believe we have failed them miserably. 
Working Americans see their earnings taxed, and then re-taxed repeatedly. Washington taxes their income when they first earn it. It is then subject to excise taxes when they spend it. And their savings and investments are also taxed. And when they die, the Government is the first to put their hands into the estate. 
Farmers and small business owners cannot easily pass their businesses on to their families because the huge estate and gift taxes still exist. The government imposes a 43 percent tax on all American couples simply because they are married. Even seniors--retired people in our country, our senior citizens--they have their earned benefits taxed. 
If the 105th Congress was supposed to be about cutting taxes and forever reforming the tax system--and I believe that was our mandate--the 105th Congress did not complete the job. 
Our progress has fizzled not because our efforts have lost the support of the people--in fact, two thirds of the American people supported tax relief during the 1996 elections, and broad tax relief still enjoys overwhelming support today--but because some in Congress have lost their backbones. They have lost the courage to make a stand on principle and not abandon their moral compass at the first sign of resistance. 
In too many instances, this Congress has become a willing collaborator of President Clinton's tax-and-spend policies. We have helped to build a bigger, more expensive government, and in doing so have abandoned our promise of tax relief for working Americans. 
Mr. President, each time Congress makes a promise to the taxpayers--and then deserts them--Congress comforts itself by saying it would come back next year and enact an even larger tax cut. This is self-deceiving at best. 
If we do not take a stand today, what is going to happen to make us more courageous a year from now? Besides, each year we wait, the Government takes an ever-greater bite of the earnings of working Americans and the Government gets bigger and becomes harder to trim in the future. 
Another point I would like to make, Mr. President, is that a tax cut is not spending. Only in convoluted bookkeeping practices of Washington would we consider a cut in tax rates to be spending. The reason is simple: first, it is the taxpayers' money that supports and keeps the Government running; second, tax relief not only ensures a healthy and strong economy, but also generates more revenues for the Government. 
In a recent study, economists at the Institute for Policy Innovation concluded that the House-passed tax relief bill of $80 billion--an unforgivably moderate tax relief measure, in my view--would add an additional $300 billion to our GDP and create more than 135,000 jobs. This economic growth would in turn generate about $80 billion in additional revenues to the Federal Government. 
Mr. President, when it comes to federal spending, Washington rarely asks how the American taxpayers can afford to give up more of their income to the government, and how such excessive spending will affect a working family's budget and finances. Equally upsetting is the fact that when it comes to tax relief, Washington is always reluctant to act. 
Oh, they say it is easy to give an election year tax cut. That is impossible around here. It is hard to get a tax cut. It is easy to spend; it is very hard to give tax relief. Congress even goes so far as to compel tax cut advocates to pay for any tax relief via Washington's PAYGO rule. That is a rule that requires increasing taxes on some or lowering entitlement benefits in order to cut tax relief to others. Nothing is more ridiculous than the requirement of the PAYGO rule. We must repeal it so we can do the job of shrinking the size of the Government and let working families keep more of the money, the money they earn in order to spend it on their priorities--not Washington priorities. 
One major reason for the failure of this year's tax relief bill is that Washington's spin doctors took full advantage of Americans' anxiety about Social Security. `Save Social Security first' is just another Washington lie. Mark my word, Mr. President, Social Security crisis or not, Washington has spent, and will continue to spend, surplus dollars whenever it can for its pet programs. 
Since 1983, Washington has raided more than $700 billion from the trust funds for non-Social Security programs, and Congress approved that spending every time. In the next 5 years, the Federal Government will raid another $600 billion from the Social Security trust funds. Those politicians who insist on using the surplus for Social Security have voted for most, if not all, of those spending bills, and so it is those politicians who in the last 15 years have stripped the trust funds of any surplus. 
Mr. President, despite the rhetoric about saving Social Security, few have come up with a concrete plan to save it. The problem is that by law, the Social Security surplus has to be put into Treasury securities. That means Washington can legally use the money to fund its favorite non-Social Security programs, rendering these `assets' little more than Treasury IOUs. Unless we change the law, Washington will continue to abuse Social Security until it goes broke. 
I agree that reforming Social Security to ensure its solvency is vitally important. Any projected budget surplus should be used partly for that purpose. In fact, I have introduced a bill to just do that. Yet, I believe strongly that the surplus alone will not save Social Security and therefore fundamental reform is needed to change it from a pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded one. 
Mr. President, the States offer us an excellent model of how we should use the budget surplus. In recent years, many Governors have cut taxes and shrunk the size of their governments, and in the process have turned budget deficits into surpluses. They are now using those surpluses to provide even further tax relief. Some States, such as Missouri and Florida, even have constitutional or statutory requirements to return to taxpayers any revenues that exceed income growth. 
The States have proved that if government performs only legitimate and necessary functions, and does so without waste, it can leave much more money in the pockets of the people. And it is the people who can best spend their money, whether it is for their children's health care, saving for a college education, giving more to their church and charities, or just helping to set something aside for their retirement. 
Now, Mr. President, back to the question of the budget surplus and who should spend this money--the Government or the workers who earned it? 
In conclusion, Washington's tax and spending policies have systematically ignored our children's future and severely undermined the basic functions of the family. We must abandon those policies and help restore the family to an economic position capable of fulfilling its vital responsibilities. In answer to my own question, we must provide American families with meaningful tax relief, allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned money. 
It is their money. Let us give it back. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, January 1999 will be celebrated throughout the United States as National Opticians Month. I am pleased to inform my colleagues that one of my constituents, Gary R. Aiken of Minnetonka, Minnesota, is president of the Opticians Association of America, which is sponsoring the observance. 
Nearly all Americans aged 65 or older require some help to see their best and sixty percent of Americans wear eyeglasses or contact lenses. Opticians, skilled in fitting and dispensing eyeglasses and contact lenses, provide the expert assistance we need to make the most of our vision. Technology has brought us literally thousands of possible combinations of eyeglass frames and lenses and an array of contact lenses. Dispensing opticians play a pivotal role in guiding eyewear customers to the combination which exactly fits their need. 
Through formal education programs, voluntary national certification and mandatory licensing in many states, and programs of continuing education, dispensing opticians acquire the skills and competence to correctly, efficiently and effectively fill eyewear prescriptions. At the same time, retail opticians are an important part of our nation's small business community and provide the competitive balance which keeps eyewear affordable for all Americans. 
It is a pleasure to acknowledge the important role of dispensing opticians as they assist us all in making the most of our precious eyesight. I commend them for their efforts and congratulate Gary Aiken and the members of the Opticians Association of America for their accomplishments.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I thank Senator Nickles also. 
Mr. President, I rise to support the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. While I continue to have serious questions about the general concept that threatening to impose sanctions on a country considered a `country of particular concern' will enable us to make progress toward ending religious persecution, I have co-sponsored this legislation, considerable progress has been made to redraft the legislation in a far more positive manner. Since it has significant support, it was important to ensure we will pass a version that had a better chance to work--not one that could have been counterproductive. 
The Nickles compromise to the Wolf-Specter version I believe is far superior, and has addressed the concerns of many religious leaders. There was a fear the original legislation could have actually harmed believers in other countries. Let me repeat--those who served as missionaries and promoters of religious freedom abroad told me this legislation could actually have been counterproductive. In fact, some of them questioned a government involvement in this debate at all, other than through normal diplomatic efforts--or, even better than the efforts of religious leaders and missionaries themselves, who have been able to make progress on their own. 
Yet, many Washington stakeholders, supported an approach, to publicly humiliate and punish countries which meet our definition of `a country of particular concern' that is engaging in `particularly severe violations' of religious persecution by publishing a list of them and imposing automatic sanctions. 
Mr. President, I didn't believe this approach would work. I didn't believe that this was the right way to address religious persecution. Fortunately, many religious leaders have stepped forward, often severely criticized, to tell us they did not believe the original approach was the right approach. 
Senator Hagel and I asked the Foreign Relations Committee to hold a hearing on the legislation, a hearing that would allow some of those who believed the legislation could have been counterproductive to testify. It is ironic that when we sought changes to the legislation, again changes suggested by those who had served abroad, I was publicly attacked by some individuals claiming to understand how best to address religious persecution. And some of these individuals, I believe, may have placed their own personal agendas ahead of the very people that we, through this bill and this legislation, want to help in these countries. 
Mr. President, I strongly commend my colleague, Senator Nickles, for his understanding, his patience and his dedication to work with us on this legislation. I know he made many revisions to the bill which were recommended by myself and others that we thought would help change the focus from an approach that was more negative to one that was very positive and had a better opportunity to work. 
There is far more emphasis now on working with countries, working with them quietly to try to end those violations of religious freedom, and to working with our allies in order to try to reach multilateral solutions rather than a far less effective unilateral approach and solution. 
The revised Nickles substitute before us, I think, gives the President more flexibility regarding how efforts to achieve religious freedom are reported and that we talk not only about the progress that must be made, but also the progress that has been made. The report that discusses the progress that needs to be made is less inflammatory and it does not link any suggested sanctions to each country of particular concern. 
The President's waiver authority has been also expanded to permit a waiver if an action, including sanctions, would be counterproductive. And just this week the waiver authority has been further expanded to a national interest waiver which is significant progress, I believe, to improve this bill. A waiver could be communicated to Congress the same day it is exercised rather than the earlier notice requirement. 
One concern of mine, however, does still remain, and it relates to the commission which provides its own report on religious freedom. While the commission should be advisory using, I believe, detailed employees from the Government, language was added late in the negotiations that awarded the commission $3 million for each of the 2 years for its own staff. That is a lot of staff when `free' staff was available. 
Now, I agree that the commission needs some autonomy, but in my judgment this could further politicize the commission, which would make it less effective. But I am pleased that Senator Nickles added my requirement that commission members must have some direct experience abroad in order to be appointed to the commission. We must have a commission with members who have direct knowledge of religious freedom issues in targeted countries, those who have been there, those who know the problems that these people could face in the form of any kind of retribution toward any US government action taken. 
I was also pleased that language was added to track some of Senator Lugar's Sanctions Reform Act in several sections of the bill. Those were the provisions that would require consultation with interested parties in order to achieve a multilateral solution as well as an analysis of whether an action would achieve the purpose of promoting religious freedom, whether it would be counterproductive, and what the cost would be of that action to the rest of the economy. 
Because so many changes were made to improve this legislation and because so many wanted to support some kind of bill, I worked very hard with Senator Nickles and others to improve the bill. I now believe that we must also exercise our oversight function over the commission as well as the overall approach of this legislation in the years ahead. We must continue to ask ourselves whether this kind of public approach really works. We must consider whether we want a commission or our Government deciding what religious persecution is, which religions are we going to help, and which ones will we ignore, and which countries we will label a `country of particular concern,' and which will escape that designation for some foreign policy reason. Where will we draw the line? Will we factor in every kind of discrimination against religion, including many we may have questions about? Will we be drawn into disputes with other countries that question why they were named and not other equally violative countries? 
Mr. President, we will need to monitor its results, and we need to do that in order to make sure that it accomplishes its purpose. There may be some fine tuning that we need to do to the bill to improve it to make it work better. 
This is a dangerous area in which we are treading. It is full of pitfalls, I believe, but I think we can overcome them if we are ready and willing to have oversight authority. My support of the revised Nickles bill is based on that willingness to see how this approach works, but we must pay attention to how it is working and to have the good sense to end it if it is not. 
As we exercise our oversight over this legislation, I ask my colleagues also to listen to the advice of The Reverend John N. Akers, of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Chairman of the East Gates Ministry International. He has been very helpful in forwarding concerns of missionaries serving abroad. Dr. Akers, who also testified before the Foreign Relations Committee, requested in a September 28 letter to my office, `Do all you can to ensure that the final version will help religious believers in other countries and not actually, if unintentionally, make their situation worse.' 
Mr. President, this is good advice, and it shall dictate how I personally analyze the success or failure of this legislation. 
But tonight I want to urge all my colleagues to strongly support this as a beginning. Again, I thank Senator Nickles for all the hard work to get us to this point on this legislation. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise tonight to express my grave disappointment of President Clinton's decision to veto the 1998 Agriculture Appropriations conference report, which includes emergency relief for farmers around the country, like those farmers in the Red River Valley area of my home state of Minnesota, who are struggling against a combination of devastating factors. 
Inclement weather, low prices, high market yields generally, and multiple years of wheat scab disease have converged to produce an atmosphere where even the best, most competitive farmers in Northwestern Minnesota are suffering. 
This, despite the fact that the Market Transition Payments in the FAIR Act have provided our nation's producers with a much greater safety net than the deficiency payments they would have received under the old program--about $7.5 billion more under the new farm bill than the old. 
Yet the President's actions will delay this important relief. This bill provides twice as much assistance as he originally requested, yet he has now joined the bidding war, changed his mind and now jeopardizes this needed assistance to our farmers. 
It is crucial for farmers in Minnesota, as well as other states, that the Agriculture Appropriations bill be signed by the President and not used as a pawn in a political debate. The bill funds all of our agriculture programs including $675 million to Plains farmers to help offset crop failures, like those caused by the wheat scab epidemic. 
It also includes $1.65 billion which is to be added to the annual market transition payments--this money will help to address depressed commodity prices. 
The conference report funds $56 billion to fund needed agriculture programs. This includes funds for many crucial tools to help our farmers promote their commodities at home and throughout the world. 
The bill funds the Farm Service Offices in our states to aid farmers in making the adjustment to Freedom to Farm. 
It also funds the Foreign Agricultural Service, which promotes U.S. agriculture products abroad. The Service coordinates CCC Export Credit Guarantee Programs; PL-480; Export Enhancement; and the Market Access Program. 
The bill will continue and expand needed assistance to farmers in the long term, as well as the short term. It is a good compromise. I voted for the conference report although there are sections that I, like many, oppose, such as language from an earlier House version which would create a backdoor extension of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. I raised some strong objections to this political maneuvering on the Senate floor last week. 
It will allow an unjustifiable, reprehensible program to continue for another six months. 
While I have deep reservations, this compromise is one we should continue to support and one the President should sign. 
Some say this compromise does not include enough to address the farm crisis. Yet, this conference report provides over $4.2 billion in farm relief money. This is money that will be available immediately to farmers. 
This is in addition to the regular AMTA payments-- that is the marketing transition support payments which have provided roughly $17.5 billion to farmers over the last two years. 
This is also in addition to approximately $4 billion that producers will receive in loan deficiency payments this year. 
Both Democrat and Republican plans were debated thoroughly in Committee, and the plan before the President is the one that the Members decided to support. The concept behind this agreement is that it continues to support farmers through the transition from the old failed system of our farm program to the new Freedom to Farm legislation, as well as to address needs created by weather and disease disasters. 
It does not attempt to throw another net of Washington programs over our farmers. 
Despite the partisan grandstanding you have heard, the plan before us will provide the transition assistance that our farmers need. And it will not undo the Freedom to Farm policy that we worked so hard to achieve. 
Farmers in Minnesota have made it clear to me that they do not want welfare. The relief plan currently in the Agriculture Appropriations report avoids going in that direction. It is a one-time support package, as opposed to returning to our failed agriculture policies of the past. It also avoids the flaw of lifting the loan caps, a move that would both exacerbate the current grain glut and also distort market signals, encouraging excess production, which would continue low prices. 
It is painfully clear by this point that the only purpose served by promoting `lifting the loan caps' is one of grandstanding, and we all know that a higher loan rate leads both to increased production, larger surpluses along with lower prices. 
This option again was rejected by the Senate, Senate twice, yet it keeps coming back, rearing its ugly head. 
There is simply no justifiable basis for a Presidential veto of the Agriculture Appropriations bill. 
As we have heard Chairman Cochran explain here on the floor, it contains a lot of money for production agriculture. So a threatened veto is certainly not about money--it is about politics. 
I remind my colleagues the President's original request for farmer relief--the original request--was $2.3 billion. The current package contains more than $4 billion. Now, however, he wants to veto legislation providing more money than his request. He has changed his mind and now wants $3 billion more. 
This is simply a half-hearted attempt by the President to back a Democrat effort to revisit the Freedom to Farm bill. This is legislation that only 2 years ago, the Congress and President Clinton himself agreed it was needed to move the business of agriculture out of the grip of Government control. 
It is disturbing to me that when the White House does not get its way, it vetoes legislation or takes it to the courts, and if rejected there, appeals to the higher courts. The bottom line is that it continues to try and go around Congress, rejecting decisions made by a majority of Congress. 
Minnesota farmers should not be used as pawns in an election-year drama. The President should help farmers by signing this significant, emergency legislation, rather than joining those here who seek to undo the progress that has been made on agriculture policy. 
The solution is here before us, and delays will be laid right at the President's feet. For the sake of our nation's farmers, let's end the bidding war. Let's end it now. I strongly urge the President to reconsider his decision as he reviews this crucial legislation again in the Omnibus Appropriations bill. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr President, I rise today to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who serve in the United States Navy. 
The origins of the Navy can be traced back to October 13, 1775, when the Continental Congress ordered the construction of ships for use in the War of Independence. It was at this time that the Continental Navy was formed, nine months before America declared itself independent. However, it wasn't until later, on April 30, 1798, that the Department of the Navy was established and Benjamin Stoddert was appointed its first Secretary. This past spring we celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Department of the Navy. 
Today, the United States Navy has grown to a force of nearly 400,000 active duty and 96,000 Reserves. During times of war, these brave individuals join with the other Armed Forces and valiantly risk their lives to defend America's freedom and national interests. During times of peace, the Navy is engaged in promoting regional economic and political stability by maintaining a global presence both above and beneath the surface of the seas. 
The Navy is organized into three main components. The first component, the Navy Department, consists of the Washington, D.C. executive offices and the Secretary of Defense. The second component, the operating forces, includes the Marine Corps, the reserve components and during times of war, the U.S. Coast Guard. The operating component trains and equips naval forces. The third component, the shore establishment, provides intelligence support, medical and dental facilities, training areas, communications centers, and facilities for the repair of machinery and electronics. Together these components form a strong force ready to defend the seas whenever freedom is threatened. 
An important division of the Navy is the Naval Reserve. Today, the Naval Reserve comprises 20 percent of the Navy's total assets. These dedicated men and women have provided assistance as medical personnel and offered fleet intelligence support in operations such as Desert Shield and Desert Storm. At other times, the Naval Reserve has helped provide humanitarian assistance and has engaged in maritime patrol. Over the years, the Naval Reserve has evolved from a reactive to a proactive force ready to meet the challenges of the next century. 
Minnesota is home to 282 active duty Navy servicepeople, of which 35 are officers and 247 are enlisted. In addition, Minnesota has 1,540 Navy reservists, of which 340 are officers and 1,200 are enlisted. 
Mr. President, since its founding over 200 years ago, the Navy has shown the utmost dedication and service while protecting our national interests. I truly appreciate its commitment to defending this nation and am honored today to pay tribute to the men and women of the United States Navy.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, our Nation's Social Security system, forged in a much simpler time and patched and plugged over the years to keep it relevant, has been a godsend for millions of Americans over the program's 63-year history. It doesn't provide a life of luxury, but Social Security offers senior citizens a little bit of certainty during what is often a very tough time. 
I have friends and family members who depend on that monthly check from Social Security, and I am grateful that it is there for them and would never do anything to take it away. But that is not to say we can't do something better, or we should not try to improve a system that will not be able to provide that certainty for retirees in the future. 
As a product of the 1930s, it is clear that the Social Security system is a system that was best suited for yesterday, not tomorrow. Social Security's pay-as-you-go structure fails to meet the challenge of a sharp demographic change that is now underway in this country. With fewer and fewer workers supporting each retiree, the program is soon to go broke, or it will be too costly for our children and grandchildren to support, thus creating financial hardship for millions of baby boomers and leaving nothing for future generations. In the meantime, Social Security is shortchanging today's workers, denying them the opportunity to expand their personal wealth and control their own financial destinies. 
The coming Social Security crisis is real, and it will shatter our economy and destroy the ability of our children to achieve the American dream. The question is, why? Because the only way to save the current system is to raise taxes by more than double, reduce benefits as much as one-third, while raising the age of eligibility to retire as high as 70 years old. These solutions are unacceptable for the workers of the future. If you offered this to somebody, why would they want to pay more, get less, and wait longer for retirement? To be honest with our families, we have no choice but to pursue real reform of Social Security. Mr. President, the sooner we act, the easier and less costly our choices will be and the more secure our children's future will be. 
With a strong sense of responsibility, I rise today to introduce legislation that I believe will offer the best solution to avoiding the crisis ahead and preserving Social Security, while providing improved retirement security for every working American as we now approach the 21st century. 
Mr. President, during the past six decades, whenever a Social Security crisis would arise, Washington's approach was to tinker with the system by either increasing the payroll tax or reducing benefits. When the tinkering was done, the politicians would slap themselves on the back and claim that Social Security will be solvent for another 50 to 75 years. That has happened more than 50 times--always at the expense of the American workers, who found themselves with higher taxes or lower benefits. But this is obviously the wrong approach. If it had worked before, we would not be where we are today. 
Social Security, as you will remember, started off taking only one-half of 1 percent of your income. It is now at 13 percent. One-eighth of everything you make goes into a system that, right now, can't promise you that you are going to get the benefits that you expect. 
Unlike any previous crisis, the magnitude of the current situation makes a traditional bailout impossible. Again, under an optimistic scenario, it would require a payroll tax increase of at least 50 percent or a one-third cut in benefits just to keep Social Security from bankruptcy. Under a more realistic `high-cost' projection, paying promised Social Security benefits would require the current 12.4 percent payroll tax to be more than doubled to 26 percent. If you include the additional tax to save Medicare, the total payroll tax would have to increase to an astonishing 46 percent, and even a tax hike that massive would be only a temporary fix. The total tax--income and payroll--could reach as high as nearly 80 percent for young Americans who enter the workforce today. 
Payroll tax hikes at this rate will heavily burden working Americans who are already struggling to make ends meet. They will rob our children of their financial future, and demolish our economy. 
Reducing benefits is not an acceptable solution. Low-income families are increasingly dependent on Social Security; in 1994, Social Security benefits accounted for 92% of the total income received by elderly Americans living alone, beneath the poverty line. A one-third benefit reduction will throw more elderly and disadvantaged Americans into poverty, and cast those already mired in poverty into further desperation. Again, those benefit cuts could be much deeper under more realistic scenarios. 
We must abandon the traditional approach to fixing the Social Security system. We must expand our thinking--explore new opportunities to fundamentally change the way we think about Social Security--resolve the problems once and for all and offer the American people nothing less than peace of mind when they retire. 
The best solution to avoiding the imminent crisis is to move from Social Security's pay-as-you-go system to a personalized retirement program that is fully funded and offers retirement security to every American. This is not a new idea. Sixty years ago, during debate in this chamber over creation of the Social Security system, Democratic Senator Bennett Clark proposed just such a plan. It passed the Congress overwhelmingly but was pulled out in conference with the promise it would be done the next year. 
Again, back in the 1930's, Democratic Senator Bennett proposed a plan for personal accounts for retirement. It passed the Congress overwhelmingly but it was pulled out in conference again with the promise that it would be done the next year. That promise was never kept by the few who advocated a government-financed and run program. During each past crisis, similar proposals of personal retirement accounts have been discussed--yet never implemented. 
Today, there are a number of plans that have been introduced by my colleagues from both aisles, favoring diverting anywhere from 1 to 4 percent of the Social Security payroll tax to set up a system of market-based personal retirement accounts. My colleagues are to be commended, Mr. President, and this is a move in the right direction. 
However, if a market-based personal retirement system works so well, and is the right things to do as proven by countries like Britain, Chile, Australia and others, we should take full advantage of it by accelerating the wealth building for retirement security and expediting the transition from a PAYGO system to a fully funded system. 
Mr. President, this is precisely the reason I am introducing my reform plan. 
My legislation, the `Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act,' is based on six fundamental principles, principles that must guide Congress in any effort we undertake to ensure retirement security. The primary principle is to protect current and future beneficiaries, including disadvantaged and disabled adults or children, who choose to stay within the traditional Social Security system. The government must guarantee their benefits. There should be no change that reduces their benefits, and no retirement age increase. 
Let me say that again: a guarantee of no change in benefits or age of retirement for those who wish to stay within the traditional Social Security system. We must do no less. 
I emphasize this principle not so much because we want to gain the support of seniors, nor to neutralize their opposition to Social Security reform, but because of the sacred covenant the federal government has entered into with the American people to provide their retirement benefits. It's our contractual duty to honor that commitment. It would be wrong to let current or future beneficiaries bear the burden of the government's failure to make the changes needed in a system that cannot handle the demographic changes that will begin to create huge cracks in our existing program. 
The second principle my plan upholds is that Social Security reform must give the American people freedom of choice in pursuing retirement security. The purpose of Social Security is to provide a basic level of benefits for everyone in case of misfortune. And so if social insurance is a safety net to catch those who fall, it does not make sense to penalize those who are quite able to stand on their own two feet. 
The third principle is to preserve a safety net for disadvantaged Americans, so no covered person is forced to live in poverty. 
My fourth principle is that reform should make every American better off, and certainly no worse off, in their retirement than they are under the current system. It should enable workers to build personal retirement savings, improve the rate of return on their savings, increase capital ownership, and pass on their savings, as part of their estate, to their children. 
The fifth principle is to replace the current pay-as-you-go financing scheme, in which today's workers support today's retirees, with a fully funded program. 
In other words, one generation will pay for its own retirement and not rely on the second and third generation to pay for it. Social Security's pay-as-you-go feature is the program's fundamental flaw because it leaves the system vulnerable to changing demographics, thus creating enormous financial burdens for our children and grandchildren. Moving to a fully funded system will not only reduce inequality among generations, it will greatly increase our nation's savings and investment rates, and therefore prosperity. 
The sixth principle is that any reform of the current system must not increase the tax burden of the American people. The taxpayers are already giving up an historic 40 percent in federal, state, and local taxes out of every paycheck they earn. Hiking taxes yet again in the name of fixing Social Security would be unfair and unjust to working Americans, and would only pave the way for additional, future tax increases. 
Mr. President, with the above-mentioned principles as its foundation, the plan I bring before the Senate today is designed to achieve the goal of providing better and improved retirement benefits for all Americans. The proposal I will outline here is carefully designed to produce a highly appealing retirement option by maximizing the freedom and prosperity of working people. I have consulted seniors, farmers, small business owners, as well as large employers. I have made a number of revisions in accordance with their views. 
Now, Mr. President, allow me to present the highlights of the plan and explain how it works. 
The first component of the `Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act' upholds our primary principle by allowing people to remain in the current Social Security program if they so choose. In fact, my plan clearly stipulates that it is the right of workers to do so, and that they will be protected. The government will guarantee the promised benefits for those who elect to stay within the traditional system. 
Many of the existing reform proposals include components to increase the retirement age to anywhere from 67 to 70, and/or mandate a reduction in promised benefits. The polls show that 75 percent of the American people oppose the age increase. That is hardly a surprise; the American people already work too hard. It is not fair to raise the retirement age and force them to extend their work careers. You cannot promise one thing and then do another. 
Nor is it right to reduce their benefits. Such an irresponsible approach would serve only to throw more elderly Americans who increasingly depend on Social Security into poverty, and increase the hardship dramatically on those who are already suffering under poverty. 
That is why my plan explicitly protects those who choose to stay within the current system against an age increase or benefit reduction of any kind--again, those who choose to stay within the current system are explicitly protected. 
The key provision of my plan is to allow workers to set up a market-based, fully personalized retirement account, or PRA. Currently, workers and their employers pay a 12.4 percent FICA tax into the Old-Age/Survivor and Disability Insurance Trust Funds. Under my plan, we will allow workers to divert 10 percent out of their 12.4 percent FICA tax, within the covered earnings, into their PRAs and use the remaining 2.4 percent to finance transition costs. The responsibility for payment of taxes will be equally divided between employers and employees. 
When the transition is complete, the 2.4 percent will be eliminated as tax relief, because under a market-based retirement system, a savings investment of 10 percent will itself provide a generous retirement. 
In fact, with the 2.4 percent tax cut, workers would be paying 20 percent less into the fully funded system and they could still expect at least twice as much in benefits as they receive under Social Security. So our plan would actually cost less and it would provide more--much different from the current system. 
Under this plan, workers would enjoy maximum freedom to control their funds and the resources for their own retirement security. Workers would have at least the freedom to design their own retirement plan, investing in stocks, equities, bonds, T-bills, or any combination of these or other approved financial instruments with approved investment firms and financial institutions. A worker could even have their funds placed in a traditional savings account, if they would choose. 
There is no doubt that a market-based retirement system will generate much better returns than the traditional Social Security system we have today. Government data show that almost all workers in two-earner families receive real returns from their Social Security of approximately only 1 percent--a 1-percent or less return on their investments, with some actually receiving even negative returns. The return reaches 2 percent only for a family with two low-income working spouses. And these returns under Social Security will only diminish further in the future with benefit reductions and the raises in retirement age. 
Compare that to the performance of the market where, over the 70-year period from 1926 to 1996, the average annual nominal return was 10.89 percent. And if you adjust that for inflation, that is still an average annual rate of return of 7.56 percent. So in over 70 years of the market there has been an average annual return of 7.56 percent. You couple that with Social Security now promising 1 percent or less in returns. It is much sounder, much better benefits for those under the new PRA system. 
PRAs will put the power of compound interest to work in providing benefits for everyone, and under my plan the average annual benefits for two average-income, full-time working spouses could reach over $200,000. Compare that to $33,000 under today's Social Security. For one spouse earning an average income, the benefit could be $140,000. Meanwhile, you provide under Social Security only about $29,000. Low-income families also do better under my plan. The current Social Security program would provide $18,000 in annual benefits, but under this legislation their benefits could reach as high as $100,000. 
Now, this isn't a fantasy; it can be achieved, and the proof can be found right here in America. Consider the employees of Galveston County, TX. They opted out of Social Security back in 1981 to set up a private retirement plan, an option on which the Federal Government long ago has shut the door. And here is what they have been able to achieve in Galveston County. Under Social Security, the death benefit is only $253, while under the Galveston plan the average death benefit is $75,000, and the maximum benefit can reach $150,000. What a difference --$253 under Social Security and up to $150,000 in Galveston County, TX. 
The disability benefit from Social Security is $1,280 per month, but in Galveston County, TX, for its employees, disability benefits are $2,749--more than double the disability benefits for their employees in Galveston County, TX, than under Social Security. 
The maximum Social Security retirement benefit is $1,280 per month, but in Galveston County the average monthly retirement benefit for its employees is $4,790 a month--four times, nearly four times greater under the personal retirement plan than under Social Security--$1,280 per month under Social Security, and Galveston County, with their personal retirement accounts, $4,790 a month. 
To their great credit, some in Washington have recognized the power of the markets. Their solution, however, has been to suggest we let the Federal Government invest the Social Security trust funds for the American people, or at least allow the Federal Government to invest a portion of it. 
While appreciating the distance that my colleagues have come in reaching this point, I strongly believe that Government investment of the Social Security funds is dangerous and that it could seriously disrupt a market that is performing so well. Even Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan agrees that this is an unworkable idea, and in a recent hearing of the Senate Banking Committee he said:  
No, I think it's very dangerous. . . I don't know of any way that you can essentially insulate Government decision makers from having access to what will amount to very large investments in American private industry. 
He also said: 
I know there are those who believe it can be insulated from the political process. They go a long way to try to do that. I have been around long enough to realize that that is just not credible and not possible. Somewhere along the line that breach will be broken. 
That was Chairman Greenspan. 
Studies reveal that the current Social Security system discriminates against divorced women. If a woman gets married, stays home to care for her children, and divorces in less than 10 years, she doesn't get any benefits from Social Security. As a result, women in general receive lower benefits than men do. Poverty rates are twice as high among elderly women as among elderly men--13.6 percent versus 6.2 percent. Imagine supporting a retirement system that puts many of our parents into poverty--not security but into poverty. 
My plan recognizes the need to have some form of protection built into the system to protect nonworking spouses as well, usually women, and especially in the event of divorce, and we propose to allow couples to treat the worker's retirement account as community property so divorced women would be able to share in the retirement benefits. Research shows that a 10-percent savings contribution rate would benefit women more than a partly personalized two-tiered system. And that is true even for poor women who move in and out of the job market. 
Critics of a personalized fully funded retirement system often cite Social Security's survivor and disability benefits as a key reason to defend the status quo, but, of course, they often omit the many restrictions that go along with these benefits as well. The fully funded retirement system I am outlining could provide better disability benefits than the current Social Security system offers, and again I will refer back to Galveston County, TX, as a great example. Under my plan, for example, when a worker dies, his family would inherit all of the funds accumulated in his PRA. The savings would not disappear into the black hole of the Social Security trust fund. 
The system would also provide, in addition to the retirement savings, a survivors benefit package. So imagine, Mr. President, right now--and I use my father as an example. When he died at the age of 61, there were no benefits at all from Social Security. So for the whole time that he paid into the system, he got $253 as a death benefit. But under our plan, all the money that he had accumulated in his personal retirement account would become a part of his estate tax free and go to his heirs--not to the Government but to the family. His heirs would benefit from his investment into his retirement account. Also, the system, as I said, would also provide, in addition to the retirement savings, a survivors benefit package. 
Let me share a personal note here to prove that point. Under my legislation, retirement dollars stay right where they belong, and that is with the family that faithfully collected them, not with the Government. The Social Security disability insurance trust fund is most imperiled. Currently, workers pay 1.7 percent of their FICA tax for disability insurance. But the DI trust fund will be exhausted in the year 2019. GAO believes the program now to be outdated and that it doesn't reflect today's realities. So my plan requires that fund that manages the PRAs to use part of their annual contribution or yield to buy both life and disability insurance, supplementing their accumulated funds to at least match the promised Social Security survivors and disability benefits. 
By requiring retirement funds to purchase life and disability insurance for workers, all workers in each individual fund would be treated as a common pool for underwriting purposes and the insurance would be purchased as a group policy; not by individual workers, but by the investment firms or financial institutions, thus avoiding insurance policy underwriting discrimination while providing the largest amount of benefits at the lowest possible costs. 
Mr. President, another special feature in this plan is to allow PRAs to be established early on in life, before a child is even out of diapers. The idea is that when a child is born and given a Social Security number, his or her parents, even grandparents, should be able to put money into that child's retirement account and to allow compound interest to work. Mr. President, $1,000 deposited for a newborn could grow to nearly $200,000 by the time that child retires. That would not be a bad start. So, if you put $1,000 into his account when the child is born, by the time he or she would retire, that would add an additional $200,000 to that account. Not a bad start, and again it shows the power of compound interest. 
In fact, when Albert Einstein was once asked what is the most powerful force on Earth, he answered without delay; he said, `compound interest.' 
To supply maximum flexibility and allow workers to tailor their insurance and retirement package according to their needs and financial ability, the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act allows workers to invest up to 20 percent of after-tax income to make additional voluntary contributions to their PRAs. So those who want to look ahead and even maybe plan for an early retirement, they can put even more money away, up to 20 percent of their income. That way, funds will be accumulated faster, making early retirement possible. And, since this would be an after-tax contribution within the current income limit, it would not provide a tax shelter for the rich. I do not know about you, but I am hard-pressed to think of a better way to encourage savings, to allow workers to better control their retirement finances. 
One of the key components and most important parts of my plan is to ensure that a safety net will be there at all times for disadvantaged and unfortunate individuals. This can be done without any Government guarantees of investments or overly strict regulation of investment options. Under this legislation, a safety net would be set up and would be involved with a guaranteed minimum level: 150 percent of the poverty level. When a worker retires, if his or her PRA fails to provide the minimum retirement benefits, and for whatever reason, the Government then would make up the difference. It would fill the glass to the top. The same applies to survivor and disability benefits. If a worker dies or becomes disabled and his or her PRA doesn't accumulate sufficient funds in order to provide the minimum survivor and disability benefits, the Government would match those shortfalls. 
The simple safety net is necessary, and the minimum benefit would guarantee that no one, no one in our society would be left impoverished in retirement while still allowing workers to enjoy the freedom and prosperity achievable under a marketed-based retirement system. 
Some of my colleagues may be concerned about the Government financing this type of subsidy. Since the likely performance of the personalized retirement system would be far better than today's, Government spending for this minimum benefit is likely to be quite modest. In fact, the reform overall would probably allow us to reduce Government income assistance spending by far more than we would spend subsidizing the minimum benefit. 
Let me say that again. If this would work out and allow the Government to help subsidize the minimum benefit, to make sure no one retires into poverty--in fact retirement benefits would be 150 percent of poverty--that would reduce Government income assistance spending by far more than we would spend to subsidize the minimum benefit. Because workers would retire with far higher benefits through the personalized retirement system, they would need less Government assistance than they need today. So, again, there would be savings in the system that would help to pay for this subsidy. 
Unlike all other existing proposals, workers under my legislation could retire at any time. So, again, unlike all the other existing plans that are out there, workers under my proposal could retire any time they choose and withdraw funds from their PRAs as long as the minimum retirement benefit could be guaranteed by the account. So what we are doing is giving control of not only the fund, but also the future plans of the retired individual. When he wants to retire, rather than the Government saying you have to retire at 65, under my plan you could retire at 55 if you had the money set aside to meet those minimum benefits. Or if you wanted to continue working, you could stop paying into the account and you could work until you are 75 and invest in other avenues or other financial instruments. 
Once workers reach the minimum retirement benefit level they can continue to contribute to the PRAs, but they would not be required to do so. They could then choose to retire, continue working and invest that portion of income in other accounts, or they could just plain choose to spend their money as they wanted to. The rationale for this is simple. When workers accumulate enough funds for their retirement, they are no longer in danger of becoming a burden on society and they should therefore be allowed to retire at any age they choose without the Government telling them when. 
Why should the Government tell you when you can retire or penalize those who choose to continue working or retire even earlier? Over time, early retirements will surely reduce the ratio of workers per beneficiaries. But because this is a fully funded system, demographic changes will have no effect--they will have no effect--on the solvency of the system. A generation would pay for its own retirement. It will not be held hostage to the next generation. And the word `independence' fits right here. 
Under this plan, workers could use the accumulated funds upon retirement to buy an annuity paying promised benefits for the rest of the worker's life. Annuities would be structured to provide benefits not just over the worker's life, but also over the life of their spouse. Unlike today, widows would not have to live in poverty. The benefits would not be reduced when one or the other would die. Or the workers could make regular, periodic withdrawals or a lump sum withdrawal of the money not needed to buy the annuity to provide the minimum benefits. 
The bottom line is that these withdrawal options would allow workers to basically sit down, to design their own retirement income so they will not be forced to buy an annuity when the market is temporarily down upon their retirement. And what is more, all the withdrawals will be tax free and smart retirement planning will help maximize the benefits. 
One of the major criticisms of a market-based personal retirement account system is that it inherently is volatile, and again subject to the whims of investors, exposing a worker's retirement income to unnecessary risks. My plan has specifically addressed this concern by requiring the approved investment firms and financial institutions that would be there to manage personal retirement accounts to have insurance against any investment loss. By approximating the role of the FDIC, we ensure that every PRA would generate a minimum rate of return of at least 2.5 percent to provide no less than the minimum retirement benefits. 
Regardless of the ups and downs of the markets, workers would still do better under this system than under the current Social Security system. So even under the minimum benefit of 2.5 percent minimum, that is still better than the current system of Social Security today paying 1 percent or even less. This is another safety net built into the plan to give the American people peace of mind when it comes to their retirement investment. Further, to reduce risks to a worker's PRA, my legislation also requires that rules, regulations and restrictions similar to those governing IRA's would apply to personal retirement accounts as well. PRA's must be properly structured and they must follow strict, sensible guidelines set forth by the independent Federal board that will be set up to oversee the system. 
To choose qualified investment firms and financial institutions that will be there to manage the PRAs, the 
oversight board would be responsible for examining the credibility and ability of the companies and approve them as PRA managers accordingly. 
As workers choose the new worker retirement system, this legislation requires the Government to issue also what we call recognition bonds. That is, to help compensate them for past taxes that they have already paid into Social Security so that you would not lose any money that you have already paid into the existing Social Security system. The bonds would be credited with real interest for workers over the age of 50. The bonds for workers below 50 and above 30 would be credited with an inflation adjustment. So since younger workers would benefit most from the reform, workers under the age of 30 would not get recognition bonds. 
Another important element of the plan is to ensure that a worker's PRA remains his or her private property, and also that the holder has the right, as I have said before, to pass it on. So it becomes part of the estate for their family or heirs, not for the Government. When he or she dies, the remaining funds would be transferred to any person or persons designated by the holder. Their heirs would not pay any estate tax on the inheritance as well. 
So, Mr. President, a major legitimate concern about PRAs is the transition cost. Obviously, this is the most difficult part of every PRA plan. Every PRA plan has had to struggle with this. Social Security, however, has accumulated to date over $20 trillion in unfunded liabilities. So, in other words, we have made promises--Congress, the Government--has made promises to Americans saying we are going to pay X amount of benefits to retirees. If you put that into dollars--we have underfunded; we have made promises but with no money to back it up yet--$20 trillion in unfunded liabilities. 
The transition from the current system to a personal and fully funded retirement system will also be costly. However, my point is we should not focus too much on this issue at the expense of resolving the coming Social Security crisis because if we do not make the tough choices, the trust fund is going to go broke. 
So we have $20 trillion in unfunded liabilities. The estimates are, to transition to a personal retirement account system would take maybe about $13 trillion. 
We believe it is going to be a less costly, more secure future and providing better benefits if we step up to the plate and make the decisions we need to make. No matter how much we pay for the transition, it is still much cheaper to finance the transition than it is to watch Social Security go broke, because once our plan is fully solvent, Social Security will still be facing some of the biggest problems or even greater problems in funding. 
Having said that, Mr. President, we should also be sensible about the transition costs. We shouldn't increase the overall tax burden or incur huge debt to finance the transition. Again, we shouldn't be out there increasing the overall tax burden. We shouldn't be out there building a huge debt to finance this transition. And since the unfunded liability is enormous, we need to find some innovative ways to help pay for them, not through tax hikes, not to burden Americans with more taxes, but to find innovative ways to help make the transition. 
As you know, when a family faces financial trouble, every member of the family pitches in. It first cuts its spending, it won't go to the movies, or it might not eat out as often as it has and will delay purchasing big household items. The Government needs to take the same type of approach. A family, when it is facing a financial crisis, needs to pitch in and make financial sacrifices to make it through. The Government has to do the same thing. 
My plan proposes to help cut Government spending to help finance the transition. We require capping mandatory Government spending by allowing only new spending for new beneficiaries who meet the same criteria for benefits under the law. This would prohibit the expansion of these programs during the transition, but it would still cover those entitled to the current benefits. 
In addition, we propose a 5-percent across-the-board budget cut for every Federal agency, plus a 15-percent reduction in Government overhead. 
Mr. President, in the long run, my plan will balance itself because as workers opt for the personalized retirement system, they will receive fewer benefits from the old Social Security system as a result. Again, remember the statement made by the President and many others, and that statement is: Save Social Security first. That takes money, not just good intentions; not slogans, but actual action. 
Since the plan is designed to spread its transition costs across generations, the system will start off relatively slowly. It will grow over time and, therefore, offer other financial mechanisms that will be needed, particularly during the start-off period. 
One of these mechanisms is to ask workers who opt out of the Social Security system to continue to pay, as I said before, the 2.4 percent of their FICA tax to help with the transition. Right now, we pay 12.4 percent of income into Social Security. Under this plan, 2.4 percent would go to transition costs. The other 10 percent would go into the individual retirement fund. 
The plan also proposes using the majority of the general revenue budget surplus, again with the notion, `Save Social Security first.' If there is a surplus, the majority of our budget surplus should go to helping reduce the transition costs of Social Security. 
To cover a portion of the transition deficit, we would sell the $700 billion in Government bonds that have accumulated in the Social Security trust fund. If we still fall short in financing the gap, my plan calls for issuing new Government bonds to the public in order to help raise money. This would be done over a period of time, and, again, this stretches the financing of the transition over generations, not one generation having to pay for the mistakes the system has made, but many generations will have to help cover the costs. 
These bonds would not involve new Government debt. This is important--no new debt. We are not talking about issuing new bonds to create new debt but to, in other words, put into focus the $20 trillion in unfunded liability. What we are doing is saying we are now going to recognize that and put into place bonds that are going to help cover this. Again, this is not new debt but only explicit recognition of the implicit debt that the Government already owes through the unfunded liabilities of Social Security. 
These are the promises that we have already made, and they need to be paid for. It is the cost of hanging on to this system too long, and it will cost even more if we wait. 
Mr. President, the advocates of the status quo are using the recent stock market adjustment in an attempt to scare the American people away from a market-based retirement system. In my view, it is highly improper to use market cycles as the reason to deny exploring a viable solution to the coming Social Security crisis. 
Historical data recognizes market cycles, and the long-term prospects for the stock market have always been bullish. William Shipman, one of the country's leading pension management experts, has studied the worst performances of the market. He finds that in the past 70 years--and this includes the period of the Great Depression--on only 10 occasions have stocks 
fallen by 18 percent in 1 quarter or 14 percent in 1 month or 8 percent in 1 day. Even if the market would drop 89 percent on the day that a worker entered retirement, that worker would still have more in their retirement account than they would have available under Social Security. 
If you look at the numbers, Mr. President, again, even if the market would happen to drop 89 percent of its value in just 1 day, and it happened to be on the day the worker retired, the worker would still have more in their retirement account than they would have available under Social Security. That would be a worst-case scenario. 
We know that better planning and looking ahead would mean the worker would lose very little, if any, no matter how the market cycle would go with good financial planning. So the scare tactics that many are using are just that, scare tactics in order to help support their current Social Security system. We need to give the American people the information they need so they can make a very educated choice. We don't need scare tactics from either side. We need just to lay out the information, show them the truth, and then allow Americans to help us make this change. 
Let me repeat, even if the market dropped 89 percent on the day a worker entered retirement, that worker would still have more in their retirement account than they would have available under Social Security. 
Mr. President, there are also many safeguards in this plan that a worker would not have to draw retirement money on that day, that there could be moneys taken out so he could wait a while or also do many things leading up to his retirement so he wouldn't have to worry what was going to happen on that last day. There are many choices and options to maximize retirement benefits, but many are going to use any fluctuations in the market to try to scare people. Again, we need to just give the American people the information they need to help them make the choice. 
As you know, our entire economy is based on a capitalistic market. If the market drops at this rate, even Social Security won't be immune from any downturn. We will have to borrow against future workers to pay any benefits. A market-based retirement plan is a long-term investment, not short-term speculation, and that is a key distinction that I urge all my colleagues to acknowledge in considering this plan. 
The market-based retirement plan is a long-term investment, not a short-term speculation. When you are in it for 40 years, you can ride out those cycles, but, again, over the last 70 years the market has paid 7.56 percent in interest, not the 1 percent or less than we now see in Social Security. 
The entire debate over how to reform Social Security boils down to a few simple questions: Do you trust the Government to provide retirement security, or would you rather rely on yourself and would you rather have more control over your own resources? Do you want the Government to be your financial adviser? Is it necessarily true that what is good for Washington is good for you? I don't think so. To me and many Americans, the choice is very clear. 
In conclusion, I turn to the words of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on June 8, 1934, and that is the day he proposed to Congress the establishment of the Federal Social Security system. He wrote this:  
This seeking for a greater measure of welfare and happiness does not indicate a change in values. It is rather a return to values lost in the course of our economic development and expansion. 
Mr. President, 63 years later, after six decades of economic development and expansion that dwarf what the world had known in 1934, we began to stray from the values that helped found this great Nation. 
We have strayed from the words of President Franklin Roosevelt as he signed Social Security into law. 
In 1998, Americans choose to turn, not to the Government to provide that `greater measure of welfare and happiness,' but to the individual, to ourselves; not to look to Washington, but to look to our families. The Government cannot be there to provide the `greater measure of welfare and happiness.' 
Mr. President, the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act acknowledges that to achieve the fullest measure of security and individual liberty, the individual must be free from the inherent constraints of Government. It restores those values from which we have drifted, and it offers every American the opportunity to achieve real personal wealth--not with the Government telling you what you are going to get in retirement, not with the Government telling you you have to retire, not with the Government telling you what benefits that you are going to get--but America will be offered the opportunity to achieve real personal wealth and the dignity and the freedom and the security that it affords in retirement. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.  
Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today as a former 4-Her to pay tribute to the participants and volunteers of 4-H, in honor of National 4-H Week, which takes place October 4-10. 
Although it is not known exactly when or where the 4-H program began, Minnesota was one of its originators. The 4-H program, initially known as the Boys and Girls Clubs, was founded sometime around the turn of the Twentieth Century by representatives of a wide range of community interests; specifically, farm families, agricultural scientists, school teachers, administrators and concerned citizens. The instrumental founder of 4-H in Minnesota was Theodore A. `Dad' Erickson, a Douglas County School Superintendent. 
During its formative years, a three-leaf clover was used as the symbol of the Boys and Girls Clubs representing three `H's': head, heart and hands. In 1924, Mr. O.H. Benson used the four-leaf clover symbol in Iowa; in his design the fourth leaf represents health. Today, 4-H emphasizes projects that improve the four `H's': head, heart, hands, and health. 
4-H evolved from an organization which first focussed on advancing agricultural technology for young men and home economics skills for young women, into a program which helped develop self-confidence and a sense of community responsibility for all youth participants. Today, 4-Hers not only continue to be involved in vegetable gardening, bread baking and sewing, which have been around since the program's inception, but have branched out into new areas to keep in tune with today's ever-changing world, such as computer, bicycle and electrical projects. Ultimately, 4-H continues to expand upon its primary goal: the development of young people. 
Nationwide, there are 6,009,997 members between the ages of five and twenty-one and 624,967 volunteers who participate in the 4-H program. As for Minnesota, 4-H is the largest youth organization in the state and consists of over 250,000 members and 14,000 volunteers. In addition, there are more than 4,000 4-H clubs in the state of Minnesota. 
There are many activities that 4-Hers and their clubs undertake, such as cleaning up trash in their communities, helping in literacy projects, and delivering food to hospice patients. 4-Hers participate in local county and state fairs, showing off months of hard work by presenting vegetables they have grown in their gardens, various shop projects they have built or refurnished, and recipes they have perfected. They also show various animals ranging from domestic pets to livestock they have trained and groomed for competition. 4-Hers have the opportunity to attend various camps, state 4-H youth gatherings, national 4-H Congress, national 4-H Conference, and International 4-H youth exchange. 
Mr. President, 4-H would not work without the commitment from America's youth and the dedication of the volunteers who continue to make 4-H an ever-expanding success on a local, state, national and global level. Again, as a former 4-H member, I believe 4-H provides our youth of today the skills necessary to survive in our evolving world. I commend all of those involved for their hard work, service, and their pledge to honor to follow the 4-H motto: `To make the best better!'

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to more than 25,000 Minnesota fire fighters in their dedicated efforts to reduce the dangers of fire and the impact it has upon our society. Fire fighters play an integral role in the communities of Minnesota each day, but their dedication will be highlighted October 4-10, as we recognize National Fire Prevention Week. 
Fire Prevention Week is the result of efforts by the Fire Marshals Association of North America, under the nonprofit organization, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA). The remembrance of the Great Chicago Fire of October 9, 1871 sparked the NFPA into action to increase public awareness of fire safety. It was not until 49 years later that President Woodrow Wilson issued an official proclamation declaring October 9 as National Fire Prevention Day. In 1922, President Warren Harding signed a proclamation pronouncing the Sunday--Saturday period in which October 9 falls a national observance. 
Today, the goal of National Fire Prevention Week is to bring an awareness to the public to take an active role in fire prevention. Minnesota's dollar loss to fire last year totaled more than $141 million. Experts tell us a commitment to prevent fires before they occur is the only way to stop the significant loss of life and property from fire. For more than 70 years the NFPA has developed a theme motivating the public to actively participate in public education and fire prevention efforts. The theme for 1998 is `Fire Drills: The Great Escape.' 
Minnesota is working in conjunction with the NFPA and fire departments throughout the United States and Canada to implement the first-ever North American fire drill--`The Great Escape' on October 7. The Great Escape theme hopes to encourage citizens throughout North America to become actively involved in fire safety, specifically home escape planning and practice. Home fire escape planning and practice ensures that everyone in the household will know how to use what is often a small window of opportunity effectively and get out alive. 
The 794 fire departments in Minnesota have been preparing for Fire Prevention Week by educating the public with guidelines and a map grid to help them design an escape plan. This awareness `Toolbox' has been distributed to schools and can be found at your local fire department. Their hope is to motivate people to think about fire safety in a positive, proactive way, and to start practicing their home escape plans regularly, at least twice a year. 
School programs to teach children fire safety have always been an integral part of fire prevention. Minnesota will debut a Juvenile Firesetter Intervention Program this month. The program will provide training to identify, educate, bring to justice, and offer avenues for referral and restitution to the juvenile firesetters in Minnesota's communities. This will be supported through regional task forces across the state. In addition to these activities, the Minnesota State Fire Marshal Division, in conjunction with Tandy Corporation (Radio Shack), has developed a `Free Smoke Detector Program.' To aid in the detection of fires, 5,000 smoke detectors have been donated for installation in homes of at-risk individuals. 
Mr. President, our fire departments have shown the highest level of dedication and service to protecting our homes and places of work from fire. I truly appreciate their unabated commitment to the safety of our communities and am honored today to pay tribute to the men and women of fire prevention.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today having learned of last night's unanimous consent request on S. 1677--The Wetlands and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1998. 
As you know, S. 1677 reauthorizes the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA) for the next five years. Mr. President, over its eight year history NAWCA has been a lynchpin in our nations efforts to preserve habitat and protect wildlife. 
NAWCA has been a very good program for wildlife, for conservation, and for American taxpayers. For every one dollar of federal money, the program obtains on average a match of another two dollars from private partners. According to Ducks Unlimited, over 550 projects nationwide have been initiated with NAWCA funding. In 1996, 76.9 million individuals took part in wildlife-associated activities, creating over $100 billion in expenditures for our economy. Additionally, in 1996, over 40 million sportsmen and women spent over $70 billion in recreational expenditures and millions more Americans spent billions in non-sport activities associated with wildlife. 
My home state of Minnesota, in particular, has benefited from NAWCA. Over its eight-year life, NAWCA funding of $18.4 million has stimulated private partners to contribute over $25 million more to habitat projects. In 1996, 1.6 million Minnesotans participated in wildlife-associated activities, creating $3.6 billion in expenditures throughout the state. 
But beyond the economic benefits NAWCA provides are the important environmental aspects to the program. The decline in duck, geese, and other waterfowl populations in the early 1980s created the catalyst for the program. By protecting nearly 3.7 million acres of habitat since its creation, NAWCA has helped restore waterfowl populations to their highest level in half a century. In fact, state and federal surveys this past year counted 42 million breeding ducks, the highest level since surveys began in 1955, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior. 
I was proud to join my colleagues this past April in cosponsoring S. 1677. I am even more proud to come to the floor today knowing the bill has passed the United States Senate and will continue to protect habitat and wildlife well into the future.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. 
I want to compliment the Senator from Oklahoma. I think yesterday's hearing was very, very important, and what the chiefs had to say regarding the defense of this country, and the money that is being spent or not being spent and how important it is. I really appreciate the Senator bringing this to the floor and helping all of us understand the problems that we are facing. 
I rise today briefly to express my continued disappointment at the political maneuvering which has resulted in an extension----

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued disappointment at the political maneuvering which has resulted in an extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact--an example of legislation driven by regional politics. 
I wish to register strong protest to the extension and ask that my colleagues join me and those in the Upper Midwest who must once again speak out against patently unfair, anti-American, anticompetitive policy. 
This is an archaic Federal dairy policy that penalizes farmers in the Upper Midwest, while giving benefits to farmers in other parts of the country in the dairy industry. 
The expected Agriculture appropriations conference report will include House language which underhandedly extends the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. 
Under the 1996 Food and Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act, commonly known as the FAIR Act, federal milk marketing order reform would go into effect in April, 1999. However, the conference committee has now adopted the House Agriculture Appropriations Committee bill language which delays the implementation date for Federal milk marketing order reform until October, 1999--6 months later. Not only does this delay long overdue marketing reforms, it also extends the Northeast Dairy Compact, which is not set to expire until the Federal milk marketing orders go into effect. 
Mr. President, USDA did not request a delay of the milk marketing order reforms. The real purpose of the House language is simply to extend the Northeast Dairy Compact. 
That this extension is even being considered leads me to believe there are some who remain unaware of the notorious history of the Northeast Dairy Compact's creation and its negative impact on consumers and all dairy farmers--with the notable exception of the largest dairy industries within the compact region. 
The 1996 FAIR Act included substantive reforms for dairy policy. It set the stage for greater market-orientation in dairy policy, including reform of the archaic Federal milk marketing orders. Yet, despite a strong vote by the Senate to strip the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact from its version of the FAIR Act, and the deliberate exclusion of any Compact language from the House version of the bill, a Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact provision was slipped into the conference report. 
This language, however, does call for the compact to be terminated upon completion of the Federal milk marketing order reform process, again, set in April of 1999. 
It is imperative that the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact sunset as was intended, and that no new compacts are created. Dairy farmers have not seen positive benefits as a result of the compact and consumers have been hurt by higher prices. 
It is estimated that consumers in the compact region of the Northeast have an increased annual cost of almost $50 million due to the compact. Not surprisingly, milk consumption in the compact area has dropped as a result. The only real winners have been the largest industrial dairies of the Upper Northeast. 
It is really no surprise. Just consider it: if the compact pays a premium per hundredweight of milk, and large industrial dairies are able to produce, let's say 15 to 20 times more than the `typical' traditional dairy farm that the compact was supposedly going to protect, who do you suppose wins? It certainly isn't the traditional dairy farm. They are still put at a competitive disadvantage, thanks to regional politics, and so are dairies outside the compact region. 
The artificial price increase stimulates overproduction and it floods the rest of the market in other parts of the country, and in other markets as well, including milk for cheese. 
Basically, all the principles of market forces, including pricing based on supply and demand and producers effectively determining profit and loss through efficiency, have now been replaced by artificial pricing. 
If any other industry tried to fix prices in this manner, I believe they would be hauled into court. Let me show this chart. The questions contained on the chart, which of these is actual Federal policy? Looking at the four questions: 
All computers should be price-adjusted according to their distance from Seattle. 
All oranges should be price-adjusted according to their distance from Florida. 
All country music should be price-adjusted according to its distance from Nashville. 
All milk should be price-adjusted according to its distance from Eau Claire. 
All of these are foolish. But this is Federal policy. The last one, `All milk should be price-adjusted according to its distance from Eau Claire,' WI, might have made sense back in the 1930s when it was instituted, because of transportation and refrigeration, in order to encourage dairy production in other parts of the country. The Midwest, really, is the heart of the dairy industry in this country. So they set up these laws, but these laws are now archaic, outdated. They no longer need to be on the books. All they do is penalize the farmers in the Midwest who get the lowest prices for their milk and reward farmers further away from Madison or Eau Claire, WI, who receive more money for dairy products, despite the new and improved transportation and refrigeration in this country. This may have served a purpose in the 1930s, but it is outdated when we come into this century. 
What it does is have the government picking winners and losers when it comes to dairy. They have their foot on the neck of dairy farmers in the Midwest while granting dairy farmers in other parts of the country more money. 
All we are asking for is fairness in this policy. Should computers be priced according to their distance from Seattle? No. Should oranges be priced according to their distance from Florida? They are not. Is all country music priced according to its distance from Nashville? No, that is ridiculous. And the same should be true for dairy--Should all milk be priced according to its distance from Eau Claire? No. 
USDA's own data show that milk production has increased substantially in the Compact region of the Northeast. In fact, the increase in production has been so great that the Compact Commission has started to withhold money from farmers, in anticipation of being required to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for increased purchases of surplus dairy products. 
But the creation of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, we have done a disservice to traditional dairy farmers in the Compact region, consumers within the Compact region, and all dairy producers nation-wide who have been forced to pay the price of this anti-competitive measure. 
The higher milk prices in the Compact region are cause for alarm, but these consequences were easily foreseeable. What is outrageous is the idea of another extension of this anti-competitive effort. 
As far as I'm concerned, this is it--the last straw. There will be no more extensions. The Northeast Dairy Compact has had its day. It has failed. It is being kept alive for another six months by a life-support system of favors and big business. 
I believe it's time to put fairness first and put the Senate on notice. The Upper Midwest has waited long enough for substantive reform--basic fairness. I will continue to make this point during the next Congress, no matter how long it takes to get the message across. 
Special protection benefits and anti-competitive measures make competitors worried, and rightly so. The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has spurred a movement in the Southeast to create a similar Compact. 
In fact, earlier this year the groundwork was laid for a national patchwork of regional compacts. Roughly half the country had either passed enabling compact legislation, was debating such legislation, or was a part of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.  
Can you imagine in the time when we are trying to knock down trade barriers with other countries around the world to have greater access to markets, to help export our products, especially in agriculture, that we, here in our own country, would put up trade barriers between portions of the country? 
Clearly, the writing is on the wall. As far as dairy policy is concerned, we're at a pivotal juncture. We must either decide to support a national system or regionalize. A national patchwork of compacts would render the Federal Milk Marketing Order reforms meaningless. It would essentially kill any hope for real federal reform. Interstate commerce in the milk industry would be a confusing maze. 
To extend the Compact ignores the mandate of the 1996 FAIR Act itself. Further, attempts to accomplish this regional protectionism through an annual appropriations bill is also particularly offensive. 
Certainly, it is difficult to have the courage to bypass a quick-fix in favor of a long-range view. But that's where real leadership comes into play. Let's be advocates for the traditional dairy farmers, not just the mega-dairies, and maintain the integrity of the legislative process by standing up to policy making behind closed doors. 
An extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact does not belong in important Agriculture Appropriations legislation. 
What is required next is a complete overhaul of this antiquated and just plain unfair dairy policy. 
Again, established back in the 1930s, it has long outlived its usefulness. It is counterproductive, anti-American and unfair. Let's give all dairy farmers in all areas of the country the ability to compete on a level playing field. 
I close with a quote from the Chicago Tribune. The quote says:  
More compacts [like the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact] will only mean higher milk prices for even more consumers and more lost market opportunities for the Midwest. . . . How could Washington approve this throw back to Depression-era economics when other farm subsidies . . . are being phased out? Back-room deals and pork barrel politics, that's how [it is done.] 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, just briefly, today, as you know, marks the end of the fiscal year for Washington, the fiscal year of 1998; tomorrow will be the first day of fiscal year 1999. This turn of the calendar, like any new year, is an appropriate time to review the accomplishments of the previous year and also to set goals for the next year. 
What a year it has been. Last year, we passed significant tax relief--including a $500 per-child tax credit that will soon take effect. In addition, for the first time since 1969, we passed and abided by a balanced budget. It has not been easy. It has not gone without temptations. There have been spirited attempts to spend taxpayer dollars and drag us into an even larger deficit, blowing one spending cap at a time. This remains a difficult task even today--Congress is pushing to complete legislative work on all 13 appropriations bills by this time. But to date, the President has signed only one into law, and only two others are on their way to him. The reason for the delay is that by habit, Washington loosely interchanges the act of deciding how much to spend with that of `spending much.' 
To my dismay, many colleagues and the President's Administration have used this end of the fiscal year and the near end of the Congressional session to push for their election-year political agendas. The result? Again is political blackmail: if you do not give me this, I will shut the government down and blame you for being heartless and ineffective. This delay has also put off important consideration of overdue tax relief for hard-working American families. In fact, the entire tax bill recently passed by the other legislative body is now in jeopardy because Washington cannot decide on how best to spend taxpayers' money for political agendas. 
Now, let me be clear on my position. A tax cut is not spending. Only in Washington's bookkeeping do we consider a cut in revenue to be spending. 
Mr. President, are we going to allow another Government shutdown--a situation where everybody loses? I certainly hope we don't. In the past few months, I have asked both the Senate majority leader and the Senate minority leader several times to honor the commitment they made during the consideration of last year's disaster relief legislation to support a bill I introduced called the `Good Government Amendment,' which would create an automatic continuing resolution to avoid a Government shutdown. But so far, it has been to no avail. 
We do have a system that allows the Government to operate through October 9. But what happens if that agreement, that continuing resolution allowing the spending to go on, is not extended and the threat of a shutdown could cost the taxpayers billions more in new spending in order to close this year? 
With the end of the fiscal year upon us and just a few days left in this session, don't you think we need a contingency plan, some mechanism to avoid the end-of-session battles that often result in more Government spending? 
There are essential functions and services of the Federal Government we must continue, regardless of our differences in budget priorities. Our constituents deserve assurances that the Federal services they expect will not be bogged down by politics. They should also expect that Washington is trying to find ways to spend their money wisely and not wastefully. The rest should be returned in the form of tax relief. 
Mr. President, despite a shrinking Federal deficit, total taxation is at an all-time high. The tax relief Congress enacted last year doesn't go nearly far enough; it returns to the taxpayers only one cent for every dollar they send to Washington. By the way, taxes on the average American family are at the highest level in history--even higher than during World War II. The average family will pay about 40 percent of everything they make in taxes to Federal, State and local governments. 
I urge my colleagues to review CBO's August Economic and Budget Outlook, which shows precisely where revenues will come from in the next ten years. The data indicates that the greatest share of the projected budget surplus comes directly from income taxes paid by the taxpayers, not through the FICA taxes, or Social Security. 
In 1998, individual income, corporate, and estate taxes consist of 80 percent of total tax revenue growth, while the share of FICA tax is about 20 percent of that growth. General tax revenues are expected to grow by $723 billion, or 60 percent, over the next 10 years. 
What I am saying is that the taxpayers generated the surplus, outside of the money earmarked for Social Security, and we ought to return at least a portion of it to them. If we don't return at least some of the surplus to the taxpayers--and soon--Washington will spend it all, leaving nothing for tax relief or the vitally important task of preserving Social Security. Such spending will only enlarge the Government, and if we enlarge the Govenment today, it will make it even more expensive to support in the future. 
The tax relief proposal now making its way through Congress will help farmers and small business owners to pass their legacies to their children. It would reduce self-employed medical costs, and it would correct the injustice of the marriage penalty tax. 
My problem with this proposal, however, is that it just doesn't go far enough. I think most Americans, if given the facts, would agree, looking at their own pocketbooks and their own tax statements, that tax cuts are needed. 
Mr. President, some in the Senate juxtapose tax relief with Social Security reform. They suggest to the American people that they are mutually exclusive choices. They say you can't have one with the other. If you have tax cuts, we are not going to save for Social Security and protect it; or if we protect Social Security, we can't have tax relief. That is not true. That is not the case. To be sure, Washington has been guilty of mishandling the Social Security system. 
Since 1983, Washington has raided more than $700 billion from the trust funds for non-Social Security programs, and Congress voted for the spending. In the next 5 years, the Federal Government will raid another $600 billion from the Social Security trust funds, as well. 
Now I hear some who come to the floor and say they won't vote to use Social Security trust funds to give tax relief. I ask, why their change of heart today? They voted for most, if not all, of the spending bills in the last 15 years which have used Social Security to make up the difference of revenues versus outlays. In other words, they are willing to take Social Security surpluses and put it into higher Federal spending, but they are not willing to take excess income revenues and put it into tax relief for average Americans. 
I just note that no one raised the issue of saving Social Security when those spending initiatives were on the table. No one juxtaposed spending with Social Security. That was because Washington was spending other people's money. But once the tables are turned and the Senate is asked to pass tax relief for America's hard-working taxpayers--meaning that Washington gets a little less--suddenly, we face gridlock and are in a quandary. 
Again, Washington says it just can't afford to let Americans have some of their money back; Washington needs it to satisfy its spending appetite. I always ask Americans, `Did Washington ever call you and ask how are you going to get by with less money if we raise your taxes? How are you going to continue to provide for your families?' And they say, `No, they never call and ask that.' They just pass it and take it. So American families have to then learn how to do more with less, or get by without. 
Mr. President, despite the rhetoric of saving Social Security, few have come up with a concrete plan to actually save it. The problem is that, by law, the Social Security surplus has to be put into Treasury securities. That means Washington can legally use the money to fund its non-Social Security pet programs. They take the money out of the trust fund, put it into the General Treasury, and then spend it. Ask anybody how are they going to take any money out of the Social Security trust funds? How are they going to redeem any of those notes or Treasury bills in the trust fund? They are going to have to go to the American people and ask for more money in taxes in order to retire the debts. 
In other words, the money Americans have already saved for their retirement future has been spent by the Government, and the Government is now going to come back to you and say you have 
to pay again in order to satisfy the needs. So these assets are essentially nothing more than Treasury IOUs, redeemable only by cutting spending, raising taxes, or borrowing from the public. Unless we change the law, Washington will continue to use Social Security until it goes broke. 
Mr. President, I am going to introduce legislation next week that will help shift retirement decisions back to those who know retirees' needs the best, and that is the retirees themselves. 
On the last day of the fiscal year, we can be proud of the Balanced Budget Act that Congress enacted and upheld over the course of the past year. But we must also be prepared for the upcoming year, as well. A Government shutdown is looming again--a testament to politics in an election year more than sound debate over budget policy. I truly hope that this political chicanery does not make tax relief, and ultimately the hard-working American taxpayers, the losers in this inside-the-beltway game of politics. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a private bill addressing an inequity faced by a now dissolved Minnesota company, Norwood Manufacturing, Incorporated. 
Norwood entered into contract with the United States Post Office to produce mail pallets according to Postal Service specifications. After producing the pallets, the Post Office canceled the contract, indicating the pallets did not meet the intended use, even though Norwood met the specifications requirement in the contract. 
Genuine issues of material fact surround the question of whether the Post Office canceled the contract for cause, convenience, or possibly in bad faith. Surprisingly, Norwood was denied its plea to be heard in court. Summary judgment was awarded to the Post Office, and an appeal of this decision was denied. 
At this point, all avenues of relief have been exhausted, including my efforts in 1995 to request a Congressional Reference from the Judiciary Committee, back to the Claims Court for review. 
In my view, an injustice has occurred since usual legal relief has been precluded in the history of this case. I believe compensation by the United States is owed to Norwood. There is precedent for reimbursing companies which abide by contracts which either include errors, or when specifications change after a contract is signed and the company is not made aware of these changes. The Postal Service made an error, and it should have reimbursed this company, as is normal practice.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which takes an important step toward improving the nation's federal crop insurance program--the `Crop Insurance Reform Act.' 
Over the last year, we have witnessed devastating circumstances come together to create a crisis atmosphere for many of our nation's farmers. I know that in my own state of Minnesota, multiple years of wet weather and crop disease--especially scab--coupled with rising production costs and plummeting commodity prices is wiping out family farms in record numbers. 
With the increased opportunities that accompany Freedom to Farm come increased risks. We've seen this first hand. 
Freedom to Farm can work, but a necessary component of it is an adequate crop insurance program. This component has been missing so far. One of the promises made during debate of the 1996 Farm Bill was that Congress would address the need for better crop insurance. 
We must not let another growing season pass without having instituted a new, effective crop insurance program. This overhaul is a major undertaking, but instituting a program of comprehensive reform must be a priority upon our return in January. 
And, we must start the debate now so that we can have the best system in place in time. The bill I'm introducing today is a first step. It is the result of months of work from my Minnesota Crop Insurance Work Group. 
The Work Group consists of various commodity groups, farm organizations, rural lenders, and agriculture economists. We have also worked closely with USDA's Farm Service and Risk Management Agencies. But it was my primary intention to assemble a committee of farmers and lenders--people who know the situation and have seen the problems first hand. 
The Crop Insurance Reform Act is designed to address the coverage decision a farmer must make at the initial stages of purchasing crop insurance. 
This bill allows more options for producers to choose from when making risk-management decisions. It essentially provides farmers with an enhanced coverage product at a more affordable price. 
Currently, producer premium subsidies range from nearly 42% at the 100% price election for 65% coverage, to only 13% at the 100% price election for 85% coverage. Producers continue to stress that, although the Risk Management Agency has recently provided better product options, the subsidy levels at the higher ends of coverage make them cost prohibitive. 
This bill will put in place a flat subsidy level of 29% across the 100% price election and at all levels of coverage. This will adjust the producer premiums to make better coverage more affordable. 
When farmers are armed with the necessary risk management tools, everybody saves. The government saves in ad hoc disaster payments, arguably the most expensive way to address any kind of financial crisis. But more importantly, the family farmer saves. 
This bill is just the beginning of reform. Over the next few months, I will continue to work with my Crop Insurance Work Group, and my colleagues, Senators Lugar and Roberts, to craft a comprehensive program which directly benefits producers and protects the taxpayers.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Muriel Humphrey Brown, who was the widow of the late Senator and Vice President Hubert Humphrey and known to many throughout my state as Minnesota's `First Lady.' 
Mrs. Humphrey Brown passed away on Sunday at the age of 86. Throughout her life, she remained steadfast in her dedication to family and her interest in politics. In her last public appearance, just 5 days before her death, she was on hand to congratulate her son, Skip Humphrey, for winning the Minnesota DFL gubernatorial primary. 
Many of my colleagues knew her, respected her, and join me in offering our heartfelt condolences to her husband, Max Brown, her sons Hubert, Doug and Bob, her daughter Nancy, and the entire Humphrey family. 
Muriel Humphrey Brown was born on February 20, 1912, in Huron, SD. After marrying Hubert Humphrey, she became a devoted mother and enthusiastically took on the role of a political wife. 
She played an active part in her husband's numerous campaigns. After Hubert's death in 1978, Muriel was appointed to his Senate seat, the same Senate seat that I am proud to hold today. By finishing out her late-husband's term, Muriel Humphrey Brown became Minnesota's first and only female U.S. Senator and just the 12th woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. In fact, she was the only woman serving in the Senate at that time. 
In carrying out her husband's Senate term, Muriel Humphrey Brown was an inspiration to women throughout Minnesota as she accepted the call to public service even in her time of great personal loss. Rather than being known simply as the wife of the most popular politician in Minnesota, Muriel left her own mark on those issues of public policy about which she felt so strongly. 
Her calm and gentle manner did not mute her passionate voice on behalf of social programs, labor issues, and the mentally disabled. She once described her term in the Senate as, `the most challenging thing I have ever done in my whole life.' In 1979, she married Max Brown and lived the rest of her life out of the political spotlight. Her devotion to family and public service is truly an inspiration to all Minnesotans, and I am proud to say that her legacy will remain. It is a special honor for me to hold the Senate seat she once held, in the Chamber where she served with such grace, dignity, and honor. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on July 6th, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), published for public comment in the Federal Register, its proposed changes to its Uniform Policy for Classification of Consumer Installment Credit Based on Delinquency Status. FFEIC is on the verge of adopting the changes in the proposals, with or without modifications based on the public input they received. I would like to ask my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Iowa whether the bankruptcy reform legislation currently before the Senate would significantly affect the agency's policy guidelines? My concern is that shortly after the FFIEC's new guidelines are adopted, it will have to rewrite them, according to the new bankruptcy reform legislation.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as a cosponsor, I rise today in strong support of the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Bill. The bill contains sorely needed provisions to help curb the dramatic rise of personal bankruptcies in this country. 
It is incredible that while most sectors of the economy are experiencing an economic boom--with the notable exception of some of the hardest-working farmers in the country--personal bankruptcy filings have reached record highs. My constituents tell me that declaring bankruptcy has become so routine as to be considered just another personal finance option. No longer is it an avenue of last resort. It has become a matter of convenience, sometimes to avoid the personal responsibilities of living within one's means and repaying one's debts. I believe this shift in attitude is due in large part to a system which readily lends itself to abuse and exploitation. 
The passage of the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform bill is critical because it directly confronts the abuses within our bankruptcy system. One of the main features of the bill would allow bankruptcy judges to dismiss or reassign cases if the system is being `abused.' Under the bill, one of the factors which shows abuse in a chapter 7 filing is if the debtor has current income sufficient to pay at least 20% of unsecured claims against him. A motion alleging abuse of the system could be filed by the judge, the trustee, or any party in interest. 
We must return to the real purpose of bankruptcy laws--to establish uniform rules in facilitating debt collection. Unfortunately today, the laws are increasingly recognized as a tool for escaping debt responsibility. They are becoming a substitute for personal responsibility. 
In addition, I am disappointed that some of my colleagues seek to offer a nongermane amendment to to the underlying bankruptcy legislation that would increase the minimum wage. 
As my colleagues may recall, it was only two years ago that Congress enacted legislation that increased the federal minimum wage in two phases, from $4.25 to $4.75 on October 1, 1996, and from $4.75 to $5.15 on September 1, 1997. Now, as part of the Small Business Regulatory Fairness Act of 1996, this provision represented a 20 percent increase in the federal minimum wage. 
Now, I voted for this legislation because it included a number of long overdue tax measures designed to help small businesses grow and create more jobs in our economy. These changes, in my judgement, would be far more helpful to wage earners than would the minimum wage increases. 
Two years after enactment of this legislation, I am not convinced that the economic effect of that federal minimum wage increase is fully understood. For this reason, I am particularly concerned that an additional increase in the federal minimum wage at this time could actually have an adverse impact upon our economy. 
Mr. President, the proponents of an additional increase in the minimum wage argue that Congress should do more to help Americans increase their take-home pay. I agree. 
However, I believe this can be done far better through tax cuts and reduced government regulation. By doing so, we will save the private sector billions of dollars which could be used for investment that brings better jobs and higher wages. 
Mr. President, basic economics tells us that raising real wages above what the market will bear will cause unemployment. The higher real wages rise above the market rate the greater the level of unemployment and overall downward pressure on all wages. The solution, therefore, is to allow wage rates to adjust to market conditions. Otherwise we will have persistent, widespread unemployment that hurts the low-income workers the hardest. 
Raising the cost of doing business by raising the minimum wage is probably going to mean even fewer of those jobs. Some statistics say as many as 600,000 of those jobs will be lost, killing work opportunities for young people and those families who depend on a needed second income. 
Besides artificially inflating salaries, hiking the minimum wage ignores the real concerns of many working Americans. Yes, they want better jobs that pay better salaries, but they have told me repeatedly that what matters most is not how much you earn but how much of your own paycheck you are allowed to keep after the greedy Federal Government has deducted its taxes. 
Families today are taxed at the highest levels since World War II, with 38 percent of a typical family's budget going to pay taxes on the federal, state, and local level. In nominal dollars, a two-income family is paying more just in taxes today than their paychecks totaled in 1977. That's nearly 50 percent more than they are spending for food, shelter, and clothing combined. 
Compared to the proposed minimum wage increase, tax relief and economic growth is a better solution for helping low-income families. It will increase incentives to work, save and invest. It will allow families to maximize their income and improve their standard of living. Tax relief will allow families who today are forced to scrimp just to cover their monthly bills and their tax bills to have more money to spend on their children's education, health care expenses, food and clothing, or insurance. 
In 1981, President Reagan initiated massive tax reduction which resulted in an economic miracle we are still benefiting from today. Over eight years, real economic growth averaged 3.2 percent and real median family income grew by $4,000, 20 million new jobs were created, unemployment sank to record lows, all classes of people did better. 
According to the National Taxpayers Union, if Congress could roll federal domestic spending back to 1969 levels, a family of four would keep $9,000 a year more of its own money than it does today. 
Recent estimates by the CBO show that the government will enjoy a nearly $1.6 trillion budget surplus over the next ten years. This potential surplus is generated by working Americans and should be returned to the taxpayers. Tax relief particularly, lower payroll income tax rates will immediately increase Americans' take-home pay and allow them to keep a little more of their own money. 
In sum, Mr. President, the real answer to increasing the take-home pay of American families is not promoting political grandstanding efforts like this which would only destroy jobs, but to support more meaningful tax relief and sustainable economic growth. I urge my colleagues to support the bankruptcy legislation and resist any effort to distort the intent of this most important bill.

Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I rise today in support of the Child Custody Protection Act. Nearly half the States have adopted laws which require some kind of parental involvement in their minor daughter's decision to have an abortion. Increasingly, these laws are being undermined by adults who take a pregnant girl across State lines for a secret abortion. 
The Child Custody Protection Act will make it a Federal offense for someone, other than the minor girl's parent, to transport her knowingly across State lines in order to usurp her home State's abortion parental notification or consent laws. It does not impose any new parental notification or consent requirements on any State. It merely prevents the undermining of parental involvement laws in States that have them. 
The Child Custody Protection Act is a parental rights bill. It prevents the circumvention of State laws, a policy all of us should support. It protects our daughters against manipulation and abuse. I urge the support of this legislation by all of my colleagues.

Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I rise today to express my deep disappointment over the Senate's failure to override the President's veto of legislation which would ban the inhumane procedure known as partial-birth abortion. 
A majority of the Congress agrees that the partial-birth abortion ban is not about the politics of pro-life and pro-choice. It is legislation that addresses a far more fundamental issue--our intolerance, as a civilized community, to allow this unparalleled cruelty to continue. 
I thank Senator Santorum for his heartfelt dedication and determination to making this issue a priority for the Senate this session. His sincere, passionate speeches delivered during floor debate spoke directly to the hearts of his colleagues and to the American people. 
This is the second time the Senate has voted on an override of a Clinton veto of a prohibition on partial-birth abortion. The will of both Houses of Congress, and of the American people is clear. I am dedicated to passing the partial-birth abortion ban, as I know are most of my colleagues in the Senate. We will continue this fight until we have succeeded, and I urge the Senate leadership to make the ban on partial-birth abortions the first piece of legislation we take up in the 106th Congress.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk a little bit about tax relief and the obligation I feel this Congress has to the American people in the remaining days of this session. 
I also compliment the Senator from Alabama, who now occupies the Chair, for talking about the need to be better stewards of the tax money we do collect from Americans today. 
Instead of beginning with the American experience, I will start overseas for just a moment, and that is in Japan. 
After years of rapid economic growth, which many called an `economic miracle,' Japan's economy is now stagnating. To a large degree, the sickening Japanese economy has dragged the world economy down with it.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to briefly make a few comments in strong support of the amendment. I do so not because it will assist my State of Minnesota, which already has an established gaming compact with Minnesota Indian tribes, but because this is an issue of fundamental fairness for States and localities. 
I find it difficult to understand how anybody can argue that the Secretary of the Interior should be given the authority to approve a class III gaming compact, absent the consent of the State in which the gaming is to occur. States must, I believe, have the authority to negotiate and object to gaming compacts. If you remove their right to object to a gaming compact, then you remove their right to negotiate a gaming compact as well. 
Similar to what now happens in trust applications, the tribal authority will have little incentive for negotiating in good faith, knowing that the Secretary of the Interior can come in and improve their compact and bypass the State anyway. 
Our States and localities are much too often becoming irrelevant in the decisionmaking process of the Department of the Interior when considering tribal-related situations. 
The amendment we are addressing here today prevents a Secretary of the Interior from ignoring the impact of gaming operations on States and localities and from circumventing their authority and making unilateral decisions. 
Mr. President, States must have the right to negotiate gaming compacts without undue interference from the Federal Government and without the heavy hand of an overactive Secretary of the Interior waiting to usurp that authority. 
Again, the Enzi-Sessions amendment has the support of the National Governors' Association, the National Organization of Attorneys General, and the Christian Coalition. 
The amendment extends the current moratorium placed on the Secretary of the Interior from using Federal funds to approve tribal-State compacts, again, without the consent of the States. It doesn't only prevent Secretary Babbitt from moving forward on new regulations but in fact gives him authority to bypass State approval. 
So I urge my colleagues to stand up for the rights of our States by supporting the Enzi-Sessions amendment. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight National Caregivers Day. 
As such, I wanted to show my appreciation to those who work so hard to meet the needs of the mentally and physically disabled, the elderly, and the terminally ill. Our nation is blessed to have individuals motivated by a caring and giving attitude toward others. 
Indeed, there are roughly 1.6 million elderly and disabled people in our nation receiving care in one of approximately 16,800 facilities throughout the country and countless others providing in-home assistance. These thousands of individuals live each day loving, nurturing, and supporting those entrusted to their care and on behalf of the United States Senate, I want to say thank you. 
Mr. President, I would also like to recognize other health-care related commemorations in the month of September: National Rehabilitation Week, Mental Health Workers Week, National Vision Rehabilitation Day, and Deaf Awareness Week. 
National Rehabilitation Week, September 13-19, gives us an opportunity to commend the nearly 43 million people with disabilities in America who daily display their courage and determination. It also calls to our attention the unmet needs of our nation's disabled citizens. 
Mental Health Workers Week is set aside for us to thank those who have dedicated their talents to improving the mental health of our nation. Nearly half of all Americans between the ages of 15 and 54 experience a psychological disorder during their lifetime. Psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, and others are there every day to help those Americans who are experiencing problems pick up the pieces and move forward with their lives--truly important work. 
September 16 is National Vision Rehabilitation Day, which recognizes the tremendous lack of understanding we have of vision loss and the lack of availability of vision rehabilitation services. National Vision Rehabilitation Day gives us the chance to promote aggressive education and treatment for people with vision problems. As the baby boom generation moves into the retirement years, we need to begin learning how to deal with serious eye diseases like macular degeneration, which currently affects thousands of people and about which--when it comes to causes and treatment--we know very little. 
Finally, Mr. President, I would like to recognize Deaf Awareness Week and the opportunity it provides to recognize the deaf culture experienced by nearly one million Americans. Most people don't know that American sign language is the third most widely used language in America, and that Washington, D.C. is home to the only deaf university in the world, Gallaudet University. Deaf Awareness Week allows us to discover the significant contributions offered by individuals who happen to be deaf.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to express my concerns about the pending McCain-Feingold amendment. 
Since the beginning of the 105th Congress, I have heard from Minnesotans on a variety of important issues such as high taxes and the future of social security. Despite the public outcry by my constituents to address these issues important to America's working families, I am very concerned that the Senate is again debating a proposal to regulate political speech. 
I commend Senators McCain and Feingold for their deeply held views that the only way to restore the public's trust in their government is to reform the system for financing our federal campaigns. As someone who has heard first-hand of the public's growing mistrust of their government, I strongly agree with their belief that the people's trust in their government should be restored and their participation in our democracy encouraged. 
However, I respectfully disagree with their approach to the passage of new campaign finance laws. 
By the way, these new laws become even more restrictive on who can be involved, what they can say, and how they can be a participant in the public policies of this country. 
The people's faith in the Government can be restored, I believe, by encouraging greater enforcement of our existing campaign finance laws, rather than going out and trying to ignore the laws that were broken, 
and passing new laws that again would only silence those Americans who wish to have their voices heard. 
Each time the Senate has considered a version of the McCain-Feingold proposal, Minnesotans have contacted me in large numbers not in support of its passage but out of great concern for its potential impact upon their first amendment right of free speech guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Moreover, they have demanded that Congress focus more on the allegations of campaign finance irregularities during the 1996 campaign cycle rather than passing new campaign finance laws. In other words, not to brush over those laws that were broken or those who broke those laws and try to camouflage this by saying all we have to do is pass new campaign finance laws and everything will be fixed. That is like trying to pass new laws every day to take care of old problems. We need to get to the source of the problem. 
In this regard, I am encouraged by Attorney General Reno's recent decision to initiate a 90-day investigation of whether President Clinton's involvement in Democratic National Committee campaign advertisements in 1996 circumvented election laws. And the Attorney General should also be commended for continuing the Justice Department's investigation of whether Vice President Gore unlawfully raised campaign contributions from the White House, and the activities of former White House Deputy Chief of Staff, Harold Ickes, during the 1996 campaign cycle. 
Current law works if we enforce it. Despite the modifications that proponents of McCain-Feingold have made to improve support for this initiative, my views on its basic premise have not changed. Similar to the previous versions of this bill, this proposal will discourage rather than promote greater participation in the democratic process. They always talk about big money and how that controls the process and how we should be encouraging and what we should be doing to encourage more people, those $10-an-hour workers who we have heard about in the Chamber today, to become a voice no matter how small, and to participate in the political process. The way they can do that is through PACs, political action committees, and that is where a lot of people with little incomes can put their money together to have a stronger voice in how their government works and how it operates, and we should encourage that, not discourage it. 
Most fundamentally, the McCain-Feingold proposal continues to be based upon the belief that there is too much money spent on American elections--too much money. About $3.50 per person per year is spent on campaigns, totally, in this country. That is less money than we spend on a Value Meal at McDonald's. 
I remember talking to somebody about the United Nations. We spend about $3.81 per person per year supporting the United Nations, and everybody thinks we get a great deal out of that. But yet we spend less money per person to support our way of government in this country, and somehow they say that is spending too much money. So the whole political process in this country is worth less to the supporters of the McCain-Feingold bill than our support perhaps, say, for the United Nations. I think we need to support this form of government and encourage more people to participate, not to close the door and say that this is how you can participate or we are going to manage what you say, how you say it, when you can say it, and who can afford to say it. 
If we accept this assumption, then Congress has decided to assert questionable authority to suppress the rights of Americans to become involved in the political process and suppress the rights of many Americans to have their voices heard. 
As my colleagues know, the belief that there is government justification for regulating the costs of political campaigns was rejected by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Buckley v. Valeo. The importance of conveying the ideas of those who seek office to the electorate is critical and was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in Buckley. And in Buckley the Court declared that `a restriction on the amount of money a person or groups can spend on political communication during a campaign necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is because virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money.' 
That is from the Buckley v. Valeo Court decision. They label this bill as an effort to protect and preserve democracy. They say that democracy is disappearing because of this. But this bill would not protect free speech. It would only limit free speech. I would like to ask those watching today that if you can restrict the speech of one American today, whose speech can you restrict tomorrow? Are you going to give the government this much control and say, well, let's do it today to protect this process, but in doing this we are going to have to take away some of your freedoms? We are going to have to impose restrictions. We are going to manage those who want to participate in the political process. And if we can do that today, who is going to come tomorrow and say, well, let's squeeze these restrictions a little more? And then who is going to come the next day and say, well, let's squeeze these restrictions a little more? And pretty soon we are going to take the ability of free speech, to participate in our political process, away from Americans. And then who is going to have a voice? Is it going to be the media, the newspapers, television? Are they going to be the ones that define my campaign or Senator McCain's campaign or maybe Senator Feingold's campaign? I think we need to have that freedom. 
For these reasons, I remain concerned about the core provision of the McCain-Feingold bill which continues to place, again, questionable new restrictions upon the ability of national parties to support State and local party activities as well. We should not pursue a suspect expansion of government control of national parties; rather, recognize that political parties enjoy the same rights as individuals to participate in the democratic process. 
For nearly two decades, political parties have been allowed to raise money for party building and similar activities without limits on the size of contributions. Additionally, the Supreme Court decision in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC, in which the Court found that Congress may not limit independent expenditures by political parties, makes it questionable whether these restrictions would be constitutional. 
We have a responsibility to the American people to help restore their faith in government. However, this cannot be accomplished by placing new and expansive restrictions on the communication of ideas or the issue of free speech. And above all else, we should not use violations of existing laws that have raised a lot of this concern and ire of Americans over campaign financing--those violations of existing laws should not be used as an argument today to suppress our right of free speech. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the men and women who serve in the United States Air Force as we celebrate the 51st anniversary of its founding. 
In 1947, Congress passed the National Security Act, creating the United States Air Force. Although military aviation units were around as early as 1907, these units were a division of the Army and the Navy. It was not until forty years later that the Air Force was established as a separate military service. Ironically, President Harry Truman signed the legislation creating the United States Air Force while aboard the presidential aircraft, which later became known as Air Force One. W. Stuart Symington became the first Secretary of the Air Force and General Carl A. Spaatz became the first Chief of Staff of the Air Force. 
The inherent strengths of air power--speed, global range, stealth, flexibility and precision--are crucial to the achievement of our military goals in the world today. Through innovation, the Air Force is evolving into an air and space force that will be able to meet the challenges of the next century. Working with the other Armed Forces, the Air Force provides the citizens of the United States with the security we enjoy as it watches over America's airspace. On the same day the Air Force was established, the Air National Guard was also born, and seven months later, on April 14, 1948, the Air Force Reserve was created. Today, these two are an integral part of the total Air Force. 
Minnesota is home to two Air National Guard units, the 148th Fighter Wing in Duluth and the 133rd Airlift Wing in the Twin Cities. The 133rd Airlift Wing was the first federally recognized Air National Guard flying unit. A division of the 133rd unit, the Security Forces Squadron, was awarded the Air National Guard's Outstanding Security Force Unit for 1994. 
In addition, Minnesota has one Air Force Reserve unit, the 934th Airlift Wing in St. Paul. The Airlift Wing provides support for the transporting of passengers and cargo around the world. In 1992, the brave men and women of the 934th Airlift Wing provided airlift of passengers and cargo as part of a humanitarian relief effort in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
Mr. President, since its birth in 1947, the Air Force has shown the utmost dedication and service to this country, while protecting our national interests. I truly appreciate its commitment to defending this nation and am honored today to pay tribute to the men and women of the Air Force.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I rise to respectively oppose the amendment by my colleague, Senator Kyl. As has been noted before, this amendment would reverse all of the progress made on the conditions package negotiated among many of us when we supported the $18 billion replenishment for the IMF on the Supplemental earlier this year. Senator Kyl's amendment includes a negotiating position that was debated, and rejected by members of this body. It would, in effect, result in the U.S. share of the replenishment being delayed or withheld at a time when IMF assistance is needed to help us shore up economies in crisis, now expanding well beyond Asia. We need to stabilize and improve these markets for our farmers and exporters, whose losses have begun to resonate, most recently in our own stock market. As was noted before, our agriculture exports are down 30 percent since the beginning of the year. This is not the time to play games with IMF funding. 
I believe few of us want to reopen these sensitive negotiations. I urge my colleagues to stick to the agreement we passed earlier. It was a good one that will result in progress toward improving the way the IMF operates. This is not the time for the Senate to reverse its leadership on IMF funding. We should stay the course--and urge our colleagues in the House and in the White House to do the same. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kyl amendment. 
I yield the remaining time.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor, thank, and remember the men and women who fought so bravely to protect our freedoms during World War II. As my colleagues know, it was 53 years ago today that Japan officially surrendered to the Allies, prompting President Truman's declaration of September 2nd as Victory-Over-Japan Day, or V-J Day. 
That monumental declaration marked the end of the most immense and devastating war the world has ever seen--a war that shaped not only the course of history but also the lives of the many brave Americans who, through their service in the U.S. military, fought to restore freedom to lands halfway around the world. 
These young Americans were thrust into a situation best described by General William Sherman when he said, quite simply, that war is hell. It is safe to say they experienced horrors and fear most of us cannot begin to comprehend. 
To gain some understanding of the realities of war and of the heroism exhibited during World War II, let me take you back to December 7, 1941. The place was Pearl Harbor. George Albert Enloe, a young Navy flyer from Anoka, Minnesota, had just two days earlier turned 26 years old. Before that day he had never really known the realities of war. Here is part of the diary entry he made on that Sunday describing the surprise Japanese attack: 
I can, and will always, remember the bullets that sprayed past me as I ducked into the hanger. Ensign Fox and Ensign Willis were right behind me. Fox was killed; Willis got through with a bullet through his head. The bullets came through the hanger as though it was made of paper . . . I understood then what it means to be `under fire.' Before, these were just words. But I found myself actually there. I was scared. I forced myself to stay. We kept shooting. 
Enloe survived that day and went on to serve for five more years in the military. In that short period, he became one of the most decorated combat pilots in the entire Navy and just last month, the City of Anoka dedicated a park in his honor. 
Unfortunately, as years pass and our nation enjoys one of its greatest periods of prosperity, too many Americans, especially young Americans, are unaware of the sacrifices made and the lessons taught to us by the likes of George Enloe. 
In Winona, Minnesota, for example, a young man was recently found guilty of vandalizing flagpoles at a veterans park. What makes this act even more disheartening is that, according to the corrections agent who handled the case, the teen `did not really know what a veteran was.' 
Thankfully, the judge understood the importance of educating this young man on the sacrifices made by those who have served our nation's military. The sentence handed down by the judge required the teen to see and then write a report on the movie `Saving Private Ryan.' 
At a time when the movies and TV are saturated with senseless violence, this film exposes Americans to a bleakly realistic portrait of war--a war in which large numbers of Americans fought heroically in the worst conditions imaginable and often died horrible deaths in a battle against oppression. `Saving Private Ryan' is a violent film, just as war is violent. It is a disturbing film, as it ought to be. 
I hope that young vandal walked out of the theater with some sense of what a veteran truly is. I hope `Saving Private Ryan' will help to raise that awareness in all Americans. During this time of relative peace, we cannot turn a blind eye to the sacrifices of the past. We must remember that our ability to speak freely, choose a place of worship, and pursue the American dream were protected by every man, every woman who served in World War II. Above all, we must never take for granted what our veterans have taught us, the lesson that is chiseled into the stone of the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC--`Freedom Is Not Free.' 
On the anniversary of the official end of World War II, I encourage Americans to take time today to thank and remember our veterans. Whether they are a neighbor, a friend, or a grandparent, ask about their experiences during that turbulent time. Through their sacrifices, freedom and prosperity have flourished. Tell them they are appreciated. 
Mr. President, I have taken a few moments to try to put into perspective the magnitude of the sacrifices made by our young soldiers during World War II. I know that my words are wholly inadequate in reflecting the experiences of those brave men and women. Perhaps understanding ultimately lies not in words, but in actions--the actions of every veteran who swore an oath to defend our sacred freedom from `all enemies, foreign and domestic.' 
We are duty-bound to pass on those experiences to future generations of Americans, to ensure they know the stories, sacrifices, pain, and ultimate triumph of World War II. For their sake and for the sake of this nation, we must never let another young American forget what a veteran is.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the Senate today passed by unanimous consent the nomination of Bill Richardson to be the next Secretary of Energy. Mr. Richardson's nomination passed the Senate unanimously because he was an honorable Member of Congress, he was an honorable representative for our country at the United Nations, and he is an honorable man. Mr. Richardson has the capability to be among the best Secretaries of Energy to serve our nation. 
But if we had voted today on Mr. Richardson's nomination, I would have voted no. I would have done so not out of doubt for Mr. Richardson's capabilities, but because of the horrible record of the Clinton Administration in responding to my concerns and the concerns of many other Members of Congress with regard to nuclear waste storage. 
On April 8, 1998, I wrote a detailed letter to the President outlining my dissatisfaction with responses to questions I have posed to nominees for positions within the Department of Energy. In that letter I quoted those nominees and showed very clearly how they all want to do something, how they all want to work with Congress, and how they all recognize the problems at the DOE. Regrettably, not one of them has ever been allowed to tackle the issues for which they express so much concern before Congress. This Administration has yet to allow a nominee or professional staffer from the DOE to come to Congress and speak openly about nuclear waste. 
As I stated earlier, I wrote to the Administration with my concerns on April 8, and just received a response this morning. They knew I was going to be looking closely at the answers of Mr. Richardson and that I expected those answers to be detailed and substantive. Instead, they ignored my letter until the last minute and sent to me responses from Mr. Richardson that displayed the same lack of candor as all previous nominees. Let me read for the Senate a couple of examples. 
I provided Mr. Richardson with a detailed description of what I learned on a recent trip to France about its nuclear industry. I explained how France uses nuclear energy to meet over 80% of its electricity needs. I explained their use of reprocessing and MOX fuel and the level to which they are able to reduce the amount of nuclear waste they retain for final disposal. I then asked Mr. Richardson if he felt we should begin to look for ways to expand our use of nuclear energy. Mr. Richardson's response was notable in its brevity. He wrote: 
I agree that nuclear energy must be a viable option to meeting future electricity demand in the United States. 
I find it hard to believe that Mr. Richardson, who used to represent the Congressional District in which Los Alamos National Laboratory rests, cannot be more specific in his views on the future of nuclear power in the United States. The answer provided above was written by a staffer at the DOE who sought to evade my question. 
I expanded on that question by asking Mr. Richardson how we expand our use of nuclear power? He wrote: 
The Department, in its FY 1999 Budget Request, recognized the need to maintain a viable nuclear option for the future. The Budget Request proposed new programs to work on the technologies required to extend the licenses nuclear plants and to undertake the research necessary to develop more efficient, more reliable, and safer nuclear plants for the future. I think these efforts are a good start at providing the Nation with the option of safe and affordable nuclear power in the future. 
Again, not a very definite statement on the future of nuclear power, but at least it was longer than the one sentence answer to the previous question. Sadly, Mr. Richardson's answer doesn't address any of the real issues in relation to the continuation and expansion of nuclear power. First, he never once mentioned nuclear waste storage in his answer. Without a storage solution, not only will we not build new plants, but our existing plants will begin to shut down prematurely. In fact, Minnesota is set to lose our Prairie Island facility in 2007 due to a lack of storage space for nuclear fuel. Minnesota will at that point lose 20% of its electricity generating capacity and will be forced to replace clean nuclear power with polluting fossil fuels at exactly the same time the Kyoto Protocol is set to take effect--and consumer costs will soar. 
That brings me to the next consideration unmentioned in Mr. Richardson's response: the role of nuclear power in our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear power is responsible for 90% of our greenhouse gas emissions reductions from the electricity industry since 1973. The countries of Europe and Japan are going to meet their requirements under the Kyoto Protocol using nuclear power. Mr. Richardson mentioned a new program to develop more reliable and safer nuclear power plants. Europe, Japan, and others are using our technology right now to build new plants--technology we continue to ignore. 
Those are but two of the important issues which must be addressed when we consider expanding or maintaining our use of nuclear power in the next century. I find it unreasonable that this Administration would send to me responses which so clearly lack the information directly asked for in the question. 
Mr. Richardson did, however, write some interesting things about nuclear power in his responses. Let me share with you a couple of those responses. They read: 
Nuclear power is a proven means of generating electricity. When managed well, it is also a safe means of generating electricity. 
It is my understanding that spent nuclear fuel has been safely transported in the United States in compliance with the regulatory requirements set forth by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Transportation. 
From the experience that France, England, and Japan have reported, it appears that they have engaged in successful shipping efforts. However, my understanding is that these countries also have experienced some degree of difficulty and criticism from the public. 
The widely publicized shipment last week of spent fuel from California to Idaho is proof that transportation can be done safely. The safety record of nuclear shipments would be among the issues I would focus on as Secretary of Energy. 
I asked Mr. Richardson to tell me who would pay the billions of dollars in damages some say the DOE will owe utilities as a result of DOE failure to remove spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. After writing about the DOE's beliefs on their level of liability he wrote: `I will give this issue priority attention once I am confirmed as Secretary of Energy.' 
I asked Mr. Richardson if he felt the taxpayers had been treated fairly. Again, after telling me about the history of the Department's actions to avoid their responsibilities, he wrote: `I share your interest in resolving these issues and I will continue to pursue this once I am confirmed.' 
Now, Mr. President, lets look at who then nominee Federico PenAE6a responded to my question regarding the responsibility of the DOE to begin removing spent nuclear fuel from my state. He said in testimony before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee:  
. . . we will work with the Committee to address these issues within the context of the President's statement last year. So we've got a very difficult issue. I am prepared to address it. I will do that as best as I can, understanding the complexities involved. But they are all very legitimate questions and I look forward to working with you and others to try to find a solution. 
Does that sound familiar? I suspect Secretary O'Leary had something equally vague to say about nuclear waste storage as well. Secretary PenAE6a, I believe, said it best when he stated, `I will do that as best as I can, understanding the complexities involved.' Those complexities, Mr. President, are not that complex at all. Quite simply, the President of the United States, despite the will of 307 Members of the House of Representatives and 65 Senators, does not want to keep the DOE's promise and does not want to address this important issue for our nation. His absence in this debate is all the complexity we need identify. 
Mr. President, I want to be very clear that I am sincere in these complaints. My concern is for the ratepayers of my state and ratepayers across the country. They have poured billions of dollars into the Nuclear Waste Fund expecting the DOE to take this waste. They have paid countless more millions paying for on-site nuclear waste storage. Effective January 31, 1998, they are paying for both of these cost simultaneously even though no waste has been moved. 
Mr. President, when the DOE is forced to pay damages to utilities across the nation, the ratepayers and taxpayers will again pay for the follies authorized by the DOE. Some estimate the costs of damages to be as high as $80 to $100 billion or more. The ratepayers will also have to pay the price of building new gas or coal fired plants when nuclear plants must shut down. And, if the Administration gets its way, my constituents will pay again when the Kyoto Protocol takes effect in 2008--exactly the same time Minnesota will be losing 20% of its electricity from clean nuclear power and replacing it with fossil fuels. 
Six years of rudderless leadership in the White House with regard to nuclear energy holds grave consequences for the citizens of my state. I cannot merely sit by now and tell my constituents I tried. I must take whatever action I can to raise this issue with this Administration and with this Congress. 
The Administration has admitted nuclear waste can be transported safely. They have admitted they neglected their responsibility. They have admitted nuclear power is a proven, safe means of generating electricity. And they have admitted there is a general consensus that centralized interim storage is scientifically and technically possible and can be done safely. If you add all of these points together and hold them up against the Administration's lack of action, you can only come to one conclusion: politics has indeed won out over policy and science. 
If the Senate would have voted on the Richardson nomination I would have voted no. I like Bill Richardson and I think he will do a fine job as Secretary of Energy--but my state and my constituents need someone to take substantive action at the DOE to begin removing nuclear fuel from my state. Regrettably, as long as Bill Clinton occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, I do not believe it will happen. I do not believe Bill Richardson will have the opportunity to do what is needed to resolve these problems. I know he will have to advocate the policies of President Clinton and Vice President Gore. And in my opinion, that is the problem. This Administration has made this a political issue at the expense of the electricity needs of the country. Until this Administration wants to deal with policy and not politics, I will not support its continued lack of action.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the sense-of-the-Senate on providing humanitarian relief to the Sudan, I believe it is important that we focus on the tragedy that is unfolding before our eyes. The people of southern Sudan are starving. Khartoum is using the denial of food as a weapon in its war against the rebels in the south--and we are letting the government of Sudan get away with this odious practice by allowing Khartoum to have a veto over aid deliveries. 
Sudan has been torn by a devastating civil war between the Muslim north and the predominantly Christian and animist south for most of history since independence. The current phase of the war started in 1983 when the then-President embarked on an Islamization program. Recurring famine is just one of the tragic outcomes of Khartoum's brutal method of warfare where women, children, and livestock are taken as prizes of war. It has also resulted in institutionalized slavery, more than 4 million internally displaced people, and more than 1.5 million casualties in the past 14 years. 
Our State Department lists Sudan as a terrorist state. We have sanctions on Sudan which prohibit American investment. But we respect the right of the National Islamic Front regime in Khartoum to veto the delivery of humanitarian relief to the south. That just doesn't make sense. 
Most of the aid flowing to southern Sudan is through non-governmental organizations (NGOs) participating in a United Nations relief program, Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS). While traveling through east Africa in December, I had the opportunity to visit the OLS Southern Sector headquarters and see firsthand the efforts of the NGOs. These NGOs are on the ground, along with UNICEF, mounting a heroic effort to distribute aid to these starving people. And I know that many of them share my frustration with the UN's political agreement with the government of Sudan which allows Khartoum to have the final say in the distribution of aid to the south. This has resulted in the starvation of citizens and soldiers alike when Khartoum decides it is advantageous to halt the delivering of aid. 
For the past few years, Khartoum has restricted flights during the planting season so that aid organizations cannot deliver the seeds and tools necessary to help the people of southern Sudan feed themselves. This year Khartoum went a step further. Khartoum didn't just restrict flights. It banned relief flights in the Bahr el Ghazal region. It should be no surprise that another poor harvest is predicted in the Fall. According to the UN World Food Program, 2.6 million people in Southern Sudan are in imminent peril of starvation. Quite frankly, until we can find a way to deliver seeds and tools to southern Sudan during planting season, I see this cycle of famine continuing indefinitely. This is a warfare tactic of cowards. 
The flight ban wasn't the only problem that OLS had in delivering aid effectively. When the flight ban was lifted and aid could once again be provided, OLS faced another barrier put in its way by Khartoum. OLS was forced to wait for Khartoum's permission to add four Ilyushin cargo planes to the handful of C-130s that deliver relief supplies to southern Sudan. Any agreement by the United Nations which permits Khartoum a veto over the number of relief planes as well as when and where they can fly is fatally flawed. The President should aggressively seek to change the terms of this agreement which restricts the ability of Operation Lifeline Sudan to distribute aid effectively to southern Sudan. 
As chairman of the International Operations subcommittee, I have to say I hold little hope that the United Nations will take any significant steps in this direction. That leaves, of course, the option of unilateral action by the United States to bypass Khartoum's veto. Currently, U.S. AID funnels aid to Sudan almost exclusively through OLS-affiliated groups. That must change if we are to have any chance to effectively combat the use of starvation as a tactic of war. The United States government shouldn't just cooperate with these non-OLS groups when Khartoum institutes restrictions on the delivery of aid--as we did during the Bahr El Ghazal flight ban. The United States should actively assist and develop relief distribution networks outside of Operation Lifeline Sudan's umbrella which are not subject to the whims of Khartoum. If we don't, yet another planting season will pass without seeds being sown, and hundreds of thousands of more people will starve.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, during the past few weeks, I have made a series of remarks on the Senate floor concerning Social Security. I discussed the history of Social Security, the program's looming crisis, the old-age insurance reform efforts taken by other nations, and the financial gender and race gaps created by the current Social Security system. 
Today, I will sum up the major points I have made so far and then move on to speak about possible solutions to Social Security's problems, and the principles of reform we must uphold as we move forward. 
The concept of `social security' originated in Europe in the 1880s. It was devised supposedly to correct the problems created by laissez faire capitalism, to avoid a Marxist-led revolution. Social Security was not an American experience. In fact, a very small group of intellectuals promoted and designed the Social Security program in this country. Congress hastily passed the Social Security Act less than seven months following its introduction in 1935. The public never got the chance to participate in the debate. 
At the time, many Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle raised serious questions about the program. Unfortunately, many of their prophecies have become reality today. Senator Bennett Clark, a Democrat from Missouri, recognized the non-competitive nature of Social Security and offered an amendment to allow companies with private pensions to opt out of the public program. Workers would be given the freedom to choose either the federal Social Security program or a private pension plan offered by their employers. 
The Clark amendment received popular support in the Senate, but was dropped from the conference report with the promise it would be reconsidered immediately the following year. It was not--that promise was broken, the first of many broken promises that plague us today. 
In the 60 years following its creation, despite continued questions and criticism, the Social Security system has grown dramatically in size and scope. As more beneficiaries and more programs are added, Congress has raised the payroll tax 51 times. 
In 1964, Ronald Reagan was among the first to suggest investing Social Security funds in the market. But no one took his advice seriously. 
Then, in 1977 and 1983, Social Security ran into major crises, and Congress had no choice but to pass Social Security rescue packages that significantly increased taxes. Washington promised that Social Security would remain solvent for another 75 years. Today, another Social Security crisis is imminent. Unlike the previous two crises, however, the coming crisis will have a profound and devastating impact on our national economy, our society, and our culture. 
The Social Security program's $20 trillion--that is a large number--$20 trillion--in unfunded liabilities have created an economic time bomb that threatens to shatter our economy. Beginning in 2008, 74 million baby-boomers will become eligible for retirement and the system will begin to collapse. 
The problem begins with the fact that the current Social Security system is a `pay-as-you-go' entitlement program. The money a worker pays in today is used to support today's retirees--there are no individual accounts waiting for future retirees to dip into. This was not a problem in 1941, when there were 100 workers to support every beneficiary. It is a tremendous problem in 1998, when only two workers support each beneficiary. 
These factors all lead to the conclusion that the Social Security Trust Fund will go broke by 2032 if we continue on our present course. If the economy takes a turn for the worse, or if the demographic assumptions are too optimistic, the Trust Fund could go bankrupt even earlier. Without real reform, the Congressional Budget Office and the General Accounting Office estimate the debt held by the public will consume up to 200 percent of our national income within the next 40-50 years. 
A national debt at this level would shatter our economy--and shatter our children's hopes of obtaining the American dream. 
Mr. President, retirement security programs worldwide, not just here in the United States, will face a serious challenge in the 21st Century due to a massive demographic shift that is now underway. The World Bank recently warned that, across the globe, `old-age systems are in serious financial trouble and are not sustainable in their present form.' 
While Congress has yet to focus on this problem, many other countries have moved far ahead of us in taking steps to reform their old-age retirement systems. Some of these international efforts are extremely successful. Chile and Great Britain are excellent examples. 
Back in the late 1970s, after Chile realized that its publicly financed, pay-as-you-go retirement system would go broke, it replaced it with a system of personalized Pension Savings Accounts. Nearly two decades later, pensions in Chile are between 50 to 100 percent higher than they were under the old government system. Real wages have increased, personal savings rates have nearly tripled, and the economy has grown at a rate nearly double what it had prior to the change. 
When facing bankruptcy in the early 1980s, the United Kingdom reformed its system to allow individuals to choose the option of a new, self-financing private pension plan. The success of the English system has been overwhelming. Today, nearly 73 percent of the workforce participates in private plans, with a total pool worth more than $1 trillion. The United Kingdom will pay off its national debt by 2030, about the same time experts estimate our Social Security Trust Fund will go bankrupt. 
Mr. President, we can learn a great deal from our global neighbors. As we pursue reform, we must also address the issue of why the current Social Security system puts women and minorities at a greater financial risk and disadvantage than other retirees face today. For women and minorities, average income remains low. This means they have less money available to save for their retirements. Therefore, a growing number of women and minorities are becoming increasingly dependent upon their Social Security checks. Today, the average female retiree earns approximately $621 per month, compared to her male counterpart at $810 per month. 
But marriage alone does not always improve a woman's situation. In fact, 64 percent of all elderly women living in poverty are widows. This is because when a spouse dies, the widow's benefits are reduced by up to one-half. 
Race also continues to be an important factor in determining the level of retirement security for some Americans. As Social Security approaches bankruptcy and the rate of return diminishes, Hispanic and African-Americans will be forced to bear a disproportionate share of the financial burden. 
In an economic model prepared by the Heritage Foundation, a hypothetical Hispanic community of 50,000 lost $12.8 billion in 1997 dollars over what it could have earned had they invested their Social Security funds in a conservative portfolio. The findings within the African-American community are similarly troubling. Like single Hispanic males, single African-American males have a lower life expectancy and are especially disadvantaged by the current Social Security system. A low-income, African-American male born after 1959 can expect to receive less than 88 cents back on every dollar he contributes to the Social Security trust fund. 
Mr. President, Congress and the public itself have begun to focus on the inequities of the current system, with an eye toward the rapidly approaching crisis. To date, a number of Social Security reform proposals have been introduced by Members of Congress of both parties, by think tanks, and by individuals in the private sector. This is very encouraging. It appears to me there are wrong and right approaches to reforming the Social Security system. The wrong approaches are to tinker with the current system by either increasing the payroll tax or reducing benefits, or letting the government invest Social Security Trust Funds for the American people. Mr. President, let me take a few moments to discuss why. 
There are two points to consider in whether the federal government itself should invest the Social Security Trust Funds in the equity markets. The positive aspect of this approach, in my view, is that the authors of this proposal have admitted the insolvency of Social Security and have recognized the power of the markets to generate a better rate of return, and therefore improved benefits for retirees. The negative side is that direct federal involvement in the markets has the potential to do great harm. 
In the last week's Humphrey-Hawkins hearing, I asked Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan whether we should allow the government to invest the Social Security Trust Funds in the markets, and if this is right direction to go. Here are his exact words:  
No, I think it is very dangerous. . . I do not know of any way that you can essentially insulate government decision-makers from having access to what will amount to very large investments in American private industry. . . I am fearful that we are taking on a position here, at least in conjecture, that has very far-reaching, potential dangers for a free American economy and a free American society. It is a wholly different phenomenon of having private investment in the market, where individuals own the stock and vote the claims on management, (from) having government (doing so). 
I know there are those who believe it can be insulated from the political process, they go a long way to try to do that. I have been around long enough to realize that that is just not credible and not possible. Somewhere along the line, that breach will be broken. 
Perhaps no one in the country is more knowledgeable about the American economy than Chairman Greenspan. He was among the first to raise the issue of Social Security's unfunded liabilities and warned Congress a few years ago about the consequences if we fail to fix Social Security. Chairman Greenspan has been consistent in his position. But last week was the first time he spoke so clearly, forcefully, and persuasively against the idea of letting the government invest the Social Security Trust Funds. Mr. President, we should never venture out onto what Chairman Greenspan called `a slippery slope of extraordinary magnitude. 
We hear some argue that Social Security is not in crisis, it is not broken, and all we need to do is make a few `minor adjustments,' such as raising the payroll tax by 2.2 percent. History has already proved that this approach will not work. 
If we were to adopt this plan, the tax hike would cost roughly $75 billion in fiscal year 1998, which is the equivalent of a 10 percent increase in everyone's personal income taxes. Such an increase would not only represent an impossible hardship for America's already overtaxed, hard-working families, but it would not fix Social Security either. 
This 2.2 percent figure is based only on what is called actuarial balance, not operating balance. This calculation itself is problematic because actuarial balance counts accumulated surpluses, which are nothing but IOUs that can only be redeemed by raising taxes or borrowing from the public. Even if Congress adopted the 2.2 percent solution, Social Security would still face large and steadily growing deficits starting in 2020. 
When I asked Chairman Greenspan about this proposal, he told me that increasing taxes will not create the savings, the investment, nor the production of real assets required for retirees, because: First, it is the same failed remedy we have turned to repeatedly, and second, it does not change a pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded one. The right approach, according to Chairman Greenspan, is to allow private retirement accounts which he believes will `far more readily move toward full funding' of the system. He believes a fully funded system will provide the savings and investment, and thus increased productivity, needed for retirement security. I fully agree with him. 
You don't have to go far to find empirical evidence supporting this approach. Employees of Galveston County, Texas opted out of Social Security in 1981 to set up a private retirement plan. Let me offer some comparisons. Under Social Security, the death benefit is only $253 while under the Galveston plan, the average death benefit is $75,000 and the maximum benefit can reach $150,000. Disability benefits under Social Security are $1,280 per month, compared with $2,749 for Galveston employees. The maximum Social Security retirement benefit is $1,280 per month, while the average retirement benefit for Galveston employees is $4,790 per month. 
Mr. President, it is obvious which plan is superior. 
Those who argue passionately for preserving Social Security's status quo insist that personal retirement accounts are too risky and too expensive to operate. This is not true. Any investment involves risk, but in my view, Social Security is even riskier than other long-term market investments. Social Security has already had two crises in the last two decades. The coming crisis will wipe out a worker's entire lifetime of Social Security investments. 
With today's well regulated and matured markets, risk can be managed to the minimum for long-term investment. In addition, workers do not necessarily have to invest in stocks. In fact, they can invest in low-risk bonds, and even Treasury bills, and still do better than Social Security. 
Actual fees and administrative costs for existing investments in the markets are generally well below 1 percent. With much higher yields, a market-based system still results in much better benefits than are realized under Social Security. 
Supporters of the status quo also argue that a personalized retirement security system will hurt lower-income workers. Again, this is untrue. Under the Galveston plan, a 25-year-old worker, making $20,000 a year and retiring at age 65, will receive $2,740 in retirement benefits per month. That's more than three times greater than Social Security's $800 per month benefit. 
A personalized retirement system is the best retirement system for today's and tomorrow's American workers because, not only will it make Social Security solvent, it will produce maximum retirement benefits and a sustainable economy. In fact, I believe this is the only solution to the Social Security crisis. We should move in this direction as soon as possible, and we should allow workers to use as much of their payroll tax as possible to set up their personal retirement accounts. There are existing proposals to allow workers to set aside two, three, or four percent of the payroll tax for their personal retirement accounts. These are all well-analyzed proposals, and each has its own merits. We should take a close look at them. 
However, if a personalized retirement system will generate the best outcome, why do not we allow workers to put all their payroll taxes into the new system? That would allow workers to accumulate more savings, enjoy higher returns, generate additional benefits for their retirement in a shorter time, and pass the savings on to their children. By so doing, we can shift to a fully funded retirement system much more quickly. This will have an enormous, positive impact on our savings and investment, and our economy--while providing the retirement security we have pledged to deliver. I soon will offer legislation to achieve this goal. 
Clearly we have no choice but to pursue real reform of Social Security. What remain are the difficult questions of how we should proceed, which principles should guide us, and which options offer Americans the best opportunities for retirement security. 
In my view, the primary principle in reforming Social Security is to protect current and future beneficiaries who choose to stay within the traditional Social Security system. The government must guarantee their benefits. Any change that reduces their benefits, or adversely affects those Americans, is not acceptable. Let me repeat: it is not acceptable if any reform results in a reduction of benefits, or harms in any way those Americans who are depending--or who want to depend--upon Social Security. 
I emphasize this principle not so much because we want to gain the support of seniors--although their support is essential to the success of our efforts--nor to neutralize their opposition to Social Security reform, but because of the sacred covenant the federal government has entered into with the American people to provide their retirement benefits. It is our contractual duty to honor that commitment. It would be wrong to let current or future beneficiaries bear the burden of the government's mistakes in creating a poorly-designed program and failing to foresee demographic changes. 
The second principle we must uphold is to give the American people freedom of choice in pursuing retirement security. The purpose of Social Security is to provide a basic level of benefits for everyone in case of misfortune. So if social insurance is a safety net to catch those who fall, it does not make sense to penalize those who are quite able to stand on their own two feet. Freedom is the cornerstone on which this nation is built--taking away freedom will lower the standard of living we enjoy today. Allowing workers to control their own funds and resources for retirement will strengthen our constitutional democracy and put individuals in charge of their own savings. 
The third principle is to preserve a safety net for unlucky or disadvantaged Americans, so that no covered person is forced to live in poverty. Today's Social Security program has 44 million beneficiaries: we must ensure that the safety net will continue to be there for them. But we must also separate the retirement function from the welfare function and make them transparent, so that we can better manage and improve old-age retirement programs and welfare programs. 
The fourth principle is that reform should provide better or improved retirement security for American workers than is currently available. We can do that by enabling them to build personal retirement savings, improve the rate of return on their savings, increase capital ownership, and pass their savings on to their children. 
More and more people are relying on Social Security as their only source of retirement income. As that number grows, however, the rate of return for Social Security contributions is diminishing. 
And so it is becoming ever more difficult to juggle the increased dependency on Social Security with the expectations for a decent retirement. Any reform of the current system must meet this challenge and provide better benefits for every American, regardless of their income, than are available under the current system. 
The fifth principle should be to replace the current pay-as-you-go system with a fully funded program. The fundamental flaw of the Social Security system is the PAYGO finance mechanism, which has been very vulnerable to changing demographics, and hardly remains actuarially balanced. 
It has created enormous financial burdens for our children and grandchildren. Moving to a fully funded system will not only reduce inequality among generations, it will also greatly increase our nation's savings and investment rates, and therefore prosperity. 
The sixth principle is that any reform of the current system should not increase the tax burden of the American people. The taxpayers are already paying an historic 40 percent in federal, state and local taxes out of every paycheck they earn. 
Although Congress has increased payroll taxes more than 51 times in the past 63 years, Social Security still faces a crisis. Hiking taxes yet again to fix Social Security would be unfair and unjust to working Americans, and would only pave the way for additional, future tax increases. 
We must neither increase taxes to tinker with the current system, nor to finance a transition from a PAYGO system to one that is prefunded. Instead, we should look for a more innovative and more appropriate way to finance reform, such as reducing government spending and selling government assets, to achieve the goal. 
Although the degree to which the various reform proposals being discussed meet the core principles I have outlined varies greatly, the fact that we are openly debating this subject at all is heartening. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, the looming Social Security crisis is real. The threat to our economy is devastating. The best solution to avoiding this imminent crisis is to move from Social Security's PAYGO-based system to a personalized retirement program that is fully funded and offers each American the security they seek--and deserve--in their retirement years. 
Congress has the power to create this brighter future for all. Congress has the responsibility to act before the coming danger is irreversible. All Congress needs now is courage.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the men and women of the U.S. Customs Service as it celebrates its 209th anniversary today. 
As our young nation was on the verge of economic despair and in search of revenue, the First Congress passed and President George Washington signed into law the Tariff Act of July 4, 1789, which authorized the collection of duties on imported goods. This, the fifth act of the 1st Congress, established Customs and its ports of entry as the collector and protector of the revenue on July 31, 1789, essentially creating what we now know as the U.S. Customs Service. 
For approximately 125 years, until the passage of the Federal Income Tax Act in 1913, Customs provided our federal government with its only source of revenue. During this time, the incoming revenue from Customs funded the purchases of Alaska and Florida, and the territories of Louisiana and Oregon. In addition, Customs collections built Washington, D.C., the U.S. military and naval academies, and many of the nation's lighthouses from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. Most impressively, by 1835, Customs revenues alone reduced the national debt to zero. 
Customs offices first appeared in Minnesota around 1851, seven years before Minnesota achieved statehood. Minnesota's geographical layout as head of three great navigation systems--the Red River to the North, the Mississippi to the south, the Great Lakes-Saint Lawrence River to the east, and 395 miles along the Canadian border to the north--was a key to handling the traffic of people and goods that passed through these ports. 
In its first year of existence, Customs collected $2 million in revenue in 59 ports of entry. Today, the U.S. Customs Service has a total of 301 ports of entry which collect over $20 billion annually in revenue. In addition, Customs processes over 450 million persons entering the United States each year. As for Minnesota, there are 14 ports of entry throughout the entire state. These ports of entry collected nearly $2 billion in revenue for the U.S. Customs Service during FY 1997. Besides all the products that are processed, many people enter the United States through Minnesota. An estimated 1.1 million people have entered through Minnesota's ports of entry since last October alone. This number continues to grow at an increasing rate over previous years.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the United States Coast Guard as it celebrates the 208th Anniversary of its founding on August 4, 1998. 
On August 4, 1790, Congress passed a law creating within the Department of Treasury a service to enforce customs laws. The passage of this law was the foundation for the modern day Coast Guard. The following year, Hopley Yeaton was commissioned as `Master of a Cutter in the service of the United States for the protection of revenue.' Yeaton's commission, which was signed by President George Washington, marks the first commission of a seagoing officer, thus giving the Coast Guard the distinction of being the oldest continuous seagoing service of the United States Armed Forces. 
Today, the Coast Guard has grown into a force of over 35,000 men and women on active-duty and 8,000 reservist. On a daily basis, the dedicated members of the Coast Guard carry out a number of task which ensure the safety of our waters. These tasks include Search and Rescue, Maritime Law Enforcement, Aids to Navigation, Ice Breaking, Environmental Protection, Port Security and Military Readiness. 
In times of war, the Coast Guard has performed valiantly to protect our national interests. From the War of 1812 to the Persian Gulf War, members of the Coast Guard have served and given their lives during our Nation's most trying times. The Coast Guard's wartime service was especially noteworthy during the Second World War when 241,093 Americans answered the call to service as members of the Coast Guard, 1,917 of whom were either killed or wounded in the service of their country. 
Equally impressive are the often unsung acts of heroism performed by the Coast Guard on a daily basis. Whether the action is a preventative measure such as ensuring our waterways are clear of hazardous ice, or saving the lives of boaters in danger in the high seas, the work of the Coast Guard affects us all and is a contributing factor to the security we enjoy as Americans. 
Mr. President, the Coast Guard motto of `Semper Paratus', meaning `Always Ready', indeed speaks to the dedication and efficiency of the Coast Guard as it stands watch over America's waters. For more than two centuries the Coast Guard has responded with the utmost dedication to service, and for this, Mr. President, all Americans have reason to be grateful.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I also would like to rise and join Senators Brownback and Ashcroft in offering an amendment to correct the injustices of the marriage penalty. I want to take a few minutes to speak on behalf of that. It is vitally important, I believe, that Congress pass this amendment, and as quickly as possible. 
I also would like to note that Senator Helms of North Carolina would like to be added as a cosponsor of this amendment. 
Mr. President, we have debated this issue now for quite some time. It is clear to me that this is noncontroversial and should have support from all Members of this body. 
Everyone in this debate agree that the family has been and will continue to be the bedrock of American society. We all agree strong families make strong communities; strong communities make for a strong America. We all agree that this marriage penalty tax treats married couples unfairly. Even President Clinton agrees that the marriage penalty is unfair. 
But still Washington refuses to get rid of this bad tax policy that discourages marriage--the most basic institution of our society. 
As a result, millions of married couples will be forced to pay more taxes simply for choosing to commit to a family through marriage. 
A 1997 study by the Congressional Budget Office, entitled `For Better or Worse: Marriage and the Federal Income Tax,' estimated 21 million couples, or 42 percent of couples incurred marriage penalties in 1996. This means 42 million individuals pay $1,400 more in taxes than if they are divorced, or living together. 
But marriage penalties can run much higher than that. Under the current tax law, a married couple could face a Federal tax bill that is more than $20,000 higher than the amount they would pay if they were not married. 
Again this is extremely unfair. This was not the intention of Congress when it created the marriage penalty tax in the 1960s by separating tax schedules for married and unmarried people. 
The marriage penalty is most unfair to married couples who are both working. It discriminates against low-income families and is biased against working women. 
The trends show that more couples under age 55 are working, and the earnings between husbands and wives are more evenly divided since 1969. As a result, more and more couples have received, and will continue to receive, marriage penalties and while fewer couples receive bonuses. 
The marriage penalty creates a second-earner bias against married women under the federal tax system. The bias occurs because the income of the secondary earner is stacked on top of the primary earner's income. 
As a result, the secondary earner's income may be taxed at a relatively higher marginal tax rate. Married women are often the victims of the second earner bias. 
During the 1970's and 1980's, as more and more women went to work, their added incomes drove their households into higher tax brackets. Today, women who return to the work force after raising their kids face a tax rate as high as 50 percent. 
The CBO study also found `small but statistically significant effects of marriage penalties in reducing the likelihood of marriage for women.' 
Mr. President, what this finding means is that the marriage penalty tax has discouraged women from marriage. 
This is shameful. This is a direct insult to our most basic and most stable institutions. We must put an end to it. 
American families today are taxed at the highest levels since World War II, with nearly 40 percent of a typical family's budget going to pay taxes on the Federal, State, and local level. They deserve a tax break. Last year's tax relief was too little and too late. More meaningful tax relief must be provided. 
In the next 5 years, the Federal Government will take $9.6 trillion from the pockets of working Americans. The revenue windfall will generate a huge budget surplus. This surplus comes directly from taxes paid by the American people. It is only fair to return it to the taxpayers. 
Repealing the marriage penalty will allow American Families to keep $1,400 more each year of their own money to pay for health insurance, groceries, child care, or other family necessities. 
Mr. President, some argue that repealing the marriage penalty will only benefit the affluent. This is completely false. The fact is, the elimination of the injustice of the marriage penalty will primarily benefit minority, low- and middle-class families. Data suggests the marriage penalty hits African-Americans and lower income working families hardest. 
According to the CBO, couples at the bottom end of the income scale who incur penalties paid an average of nearly $800 in additional taxes, which represented 8 percent of their income. Eight percent, Mr. President. Repeal the penalty, and those low-income families will immediately have an 8 percent increase in their income or an 8 percent cut in their taxes. 
Some also argue that repealing the marriage penalty would affect families receiving marriage bonuses. This is not true either. Although there are couples who receive marriage bonuses, this doesn't justify the Federal Government penalizing another 21 million couples just for being married. 
We should give more bonuses to all American families in the form of tax relief, whether both spouses or only one of them are working. 
In closing, I must point out that this amendment takes the approach of income splitting to repeal the marriage penalty. Married couples would be allowed to split their income down the middle, regardless of who earned it, and be taxed at the lower rate. This would protect working couples without punishing women who remain at home. 
In his book `The Decline (And Fall?) of the Income Tax,' Michael Graetz, former Treasury Department tax whiz, writes `A tax system can't survive when it departs from the fundamental values of the people it taxes'. I couldn't agree with him more. 
Mr. President, it is unfair and immoral to continue the marriage penalty tax. Today, let us just get rid of it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I rise to strongly support Senator Hutchinson's amendment to terminate the tax code. I commend his leadership and his persistence in advocating what is real tax reform. 
Mr. President, more than 200 years ago, our ancestors staged a tea party and revolted against their mother country to protest the imposition of unfair taxes. Today, taxes imposed by our own government are unfair by any standard. Had our ancestors faced a tax system as punitive as ours has become, they might very well have jumped into the harbor along with the tea. 
Americans today are working harder but taking home less of their pay. Why? In excess of $1.7 trillion of their income is siphoned off to Uncle Sam each year. In 1997, total taxes--federal, state, and local--claiming a record 38.2 percent of a typical family's income. 
Nearly 40 percent of everything the average family made went to support government. 
Nearly 4 hours of every 8-hour working day are dedicated just to paying taxes. The total tax burden borne by the American taxpayer in 1998 is the highest in U.S. history. 
We are being taxed at a higher level today than at any time in history, including World War II and other conflicts. 
The tax code must be terminated because the earnings, spending, and savings of the American people are taxed over and over to squeeze more money out of their pockets to line the pockets of government. Income is taxed when it's first earned. The after-tax income is then subject to certain excise taxes when spent. 
If this after-tax income is saved in a savings account or invested in a business, the interest and profits will be taxed again. If the corporation pays out its after-tax earnings as a dividend to the saver, or if the saver sells his investment, the savings is taxed a third time through a capital gains tax. 
If the saver dies with some accumulated savings, these savings will be taxed a fourth time through estate and gift taxes. Even after death, one's tax liability lives on. 
The tax code must be terminated because it has long been used as a tool for social engineering and income redistribution rather than sound economic policy. 
Clearly, a system of graduated marginal rates violates the principle of fairness. In addition, special interest groups are often unfairly rewarded by politicians with special tax privileges.  
We need to have a date certain when this Tax Code is going to end and that we can begin with something new. No matter what we have done recently to try to improve the IRS and the Tax Code, it is like putting lipstick on a pig. We can't make it pretty. We have to pull this code out by the roots, and we have to change it and replace it with something that is friendly and that is fair and taxpayer friendly. 
We need something like this legislation to act as a stick of dynamite under the chairs of Congress to make them act, rather than procrastinating and saying, `We will do it next year, or maybe the year after, or the year after.' The American taxpayers aren't going to wait that long. 
The Tax Code must be terminated because it has become simply complicated. It is difficult for anyone to understand, as Senator Brownback showed us with this huge stack of just the forms that we are having every year. The Tax Code has grown, as he showed us, from 14 pages when it was first enacted to more than 10,000 pages of Tax Code today, plus another 20 volumes of tax regulations, and then thousands of pages and instructions that go along with it. Even the IRS and tax professionals repeatedly make mistakes. IRS agents reportedly gave wrong answers to taxpayers at least half of the time. And the question is, How can anyone master all of the code? I don't blame the IRS or any of the good workers at the IRS. But it is Congress that has developed a Tax Code that is so complicated that even the experts in the field of the IRS can't guarantee that they are going to give the average taxpayer an answer that is right when they call and ask. 
So, again, the tax code must be terminated because it's too expensive for the American people. The IRS employs over 102,000 agents to collect taxes, more agents than the FBI and the CIA combined. The taxpayers must pay more than $8 billion each year to operate the IRS. 
Worse still, American families, small business owners, and corporations will spend at least another $225 billion just trying to comply with the Tax Code, money that could be better spent elsewhere. If they fail to comply due to innocent mistakes, the IRS penalties could actually ruin some lives. 
The tax code must be terminated because the IRS has evolved into an arrogant, inefficient, intrusive, and abusive bureaucracy. IRS agents routinely use their enormous, coercive power to squeeze more money out of the taxpayers' pockets to meet the demands of ever-increasing government spending. 
Rooted deeply within the system rests the core flaw of the tax system: policymakers care little about spending other people's money because the money isn't their own. Now is the time to reverse that thinking. 
If you are going out tonight for supper and spend your own money, you might spend $50. But if you are going to go out for supper and you take my credit card, you might spend $500 on a night out. In Washington, much of that is what is happening. 
With millions of our citizens demanding real tax reform, Congress must grasp this historic opportunity to deliver change--change that will forever repair the system, honor our great American heritage of individual choice and responsibility, and reflect true American values. 
In sum, Mr. President, the current tax code is an unmerciful mess--but it doesn't need to be. We can and must replace it with a new system that is simpler, fairer, flatter, and friendlier--a better system that will lead this great country into the 21st century. 
We will not have a better incentive to reform than an actual date to terminate the code. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Hutchinson's in this very, very important amendment. 
Thank you, very much. I yield the floor.  
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMS. I heard you say if this code were eliminated and replaced with a possible national sales tax, it could take up to 30 percent of a sales tax to replace what the Government has taken. 
Now, does that mean hidden behind all the hidden taxes, that somehow the Government now is taking from the average taxpayer, the average worker in this country, 30 percent of their income just to support the Federal Government?

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to make three separate statements, one dealing with Social Security, looking at the background and the history of the program as we move toward possible debate on change and reforms. Also, a statement supporting Senator Shelby on his amendment dealing with CRA and small banks. And also a brief statement on the Government Shutdown Prevention Act, which is aimed at trying to pass legislation that will prevent the Government from shutting down in the future even if Congress cannot reach an agreement on budget or appropriation matters.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, in my continuing series of statements on the troubled Social Security program, I have discussed the history of Social Security, the program's looming crisis, and the old-age insurance reform efforts undertaken by other nations. 
Today, I want to discuss an aspect of Social Security that often gets distorted in the reform debates going on throughout this great nation. 
It is the issue of how the current Social Security system puts women and minorities at a greater financial risk and disadvantage than other retirees face today. 
We must address the questions of how these Americans will fare under any reform of the current system, so we can empower them with the ability to have a more secure retirement future than that which Social Security promises today. 
First, it is essential to understand why these Americans were put at a disadvantage in a system supposedly established to help them. To do that, we must go back to the beginnings of the Social Security program. 
When Social Security was first enacted in the 1930s, the discriminative elements were inherently built into the system. Professor Edward Berkowitz of George Washington University has done excellent research on this subject. 
According to his studies, policy makers taking part in the first Social Security advisory council freely indulged in racial and sexual stereotypes. They made a widow's benefit equal to only three-quarters of the value of a single man's benefit. 
Their rationale for the decision was, according to one member, that a `widow could look out for herself better than the man could.' 
Douglas Brown, the chairman of the advisory council, even suggested that a single woman could adjust to a lower budget `on account of the fact that she is used to doing her own housework whereas the single man has to go to a restaurant.' 
Another example of Social Security's inherently discriminative nature is that domestic workers were not covered by Social Security when the program was set up. 
One early policy maker explained that it was difficult to collect contributions from the `colored woman . . . who goes from house to house for a day's work here and a day's work there.' 
Clearly, things were different then. 
At that time, most women stayed home, and only 6 people out of 10 reached age 65. 
Despite the fact that the Social Security program provided an opportunity to redistribute income from wealthier individuals to low-income retirees--an effort to help provide assistance to those less fortunate--the inequality of women and minorities was never adequately addressed. 
In fact, the disparity has grown under the current Social Security system. 
The profile of today's retiree is quite different than it was in the 1930s and continues to change. 
More women today are working outside the home, less than half of America's working women receive pensions today, life expectancy is increasing, while minority populations continue to grow in number. 
But our Social Security system has failed to make the needed adjustments. As a result, financial gender and racial gaps are growing larger for those retired or nearing retirement. Women and minorities are suffering under the current Social Security system. 
For women and minorities, average income continues to remain low. This means there is less money available to personally save for one's own retirement. 
Furthermore, payroll taxes have increased 36 times over the last 27 years, forcing families to squeeze more out of less take-home pay. 
According to the Heritage Foundation, today's payroll taxes consume as much of the family budget as do costs for housing, and nearly three times more than annual health care. 
So it is not surprising that growing numbers of women and minorities are becoming increasingly dependent upon their Social Security checks. If we are going to successfully raise their quality of life once they reach retirement age, we must begin to look outside the proverbial box today. 
Mr. President, I would like to begin by focusing on women, since they are disproportionately dependent upon Social Security. There are a number of factors that create this reliance. 
While we can rally around the idea that our Social Security system is supposedly `gender neutral,' issues such as income levels, years out of the workforce, and marital status all impact a woman's retirement security. 
At the forefront of the issue is the fact that women tend to outlive men, just as they have been doing for the past 500 years. With today's retirees beginning to collect benefits at age 65, it is not unlikely for a woman to spend nearly one-fourth of her life on Social Security. 
And because women statistically receive lower benefits than men, typically have fewer saving, and are less likely to have a pension, it means they are forced to live longer on less. 
We are finding that a retirement security system that was termed a success in the past threatens future female retirees the most. 
Over the past few decades, women have made great progress in the workplace. 
Today, there are more women working at higher-paying jobs. But according to the General Accounting Office, the labor force participation rate for women aged 25 to 34 remains at 75 percent, and only four-fifths that of men. 
Further complicating the issue is that when women do work, 25 percent work part-time. There are a variety of reasons for this, including the fact that women are more likely to take time off for family reasons. 
However, it leads to fewer opportunities for benefit coverage--including pensions--and lower earnings, and ultimately, less reserve money to save for themselves and their future. 
Today, the average female retiree earns approximately $621 per month, compared to her male counterpart at $810 per month. 
The formula used to calculate benefits for women, as well as men, assumes the highest 35 years of earnings. Today, nearly 75 percent of women earn $25,000 or less. For those years an individual is out of work--for instance, taking time off to raise a family or care for an ailing loved one--the salary is counted as `zero.' 
In addition, any length of time less than 35 years of working count as `zero' earnings. As a result, the median number of years with `zero' earnings for workers turning 62 in 1993 was 15 years for women, compared to only 4 years for men. 
This means nearly half the years being considered in the benefit formula for women are counted as `zero' earnings years and the average salary for earning years is $25,000 or less. 
Currently, there are some advocating the benefits formula be raised to 38 years. 
While the number of working women continues to grow, the Social Security Administration's own projections reveal that only 30 percent of female retirees in 2020 will have 38 years of earnings--compared to about 60 percent of their male counterparts. 
This is extremely detrimental to unmarried women who either divorced before 10 years of marriage or never married, because their benefit calculations are exclusively dependent upon their own earnings calculations. 
And currently, the poverty rate for elderly divorced, separated, or never-married women is the highest of any group--nearly 30 percent. 
But marriage in and of itself doesn't always improve a woman's situation. 
In fact, 64 percent of all elderly women living in poverty are widows. This is because when a spouse dies, the widow's benefits are reduced by up to one-half. Meanwhile, statistics show that to live alone, a widow requires at least 75 percent of what it costs as a couple. 
Furthermore, if a widow has yet to reach age 65 when a spouse dies, and has no dependent children, she is not entitled to any survivor benefits. Thus, without private savings, the benefit reduction leaves most widows financially unprepared for retirement. 
Let me share with you the real story of two women. Susan of Colorado made an annual income of $20,000, and she paid the 12.4 percent payroll tax into the Social Security system from each of her paychecks while raising kids, sending them to schools, and seeing them married. 
But when Susan died at age 64, she left nothing from Social Security for her children. 
Joan of New York, a 46-year-old homemaker, never worked outside the home after being married, and instead chose to raise her children. 
Her husband was self-employed, and paid a 15.3 percent payroll tax into the Social Security and Medicare programs. When Joan's husband died of a heart attack at age 49, all she received from Social Security was $200 for his funeral. 
Since she has no skills to help her find a job, no savings, and gets no help from Social Security despite the thousands and thousands of dollars her family poured into the system, Joan is now helpless and suffering from depression. 
I then ask if the system is so harmful to women, why are there so many out there arguing against change? How can we sit back and hold women hostage to a program for nostalgia's sake? 
I would argue we cannot, and it is our job to ensure that every woman has an opportunity to live out her golden years in financial security. And I agree we must dispel the `myths' that threaten efforts to improve women's retirement security. 
One fact-based `myth' is that because women may feel less confident about their retirement security, we will be unable to change it for the better. 
First and foremost, it is critical to ensure that current and future beneficiaries remain unaffected by any change to the Social Security program if they choose to stay with the traditional system. 
We made a covenant with our older Americans and have a responsibility to protect them from any uncertainty during the transition from a pay-as-you-go system to a future funded one. 
But we also have a responsibility to future beneficiaries to clearly notify them that without dramatic change to the system, they will not receive adequate benefits from Social Security. 
They are more likely to see reductions in alternative means of savings as a result of the economic impact of the system going bankrupt. Because women are living longer than men, they are most likely to experience the hardship longer. 
As Members of Congress, we owe it to women to preserve and improve their retirement security. 
The next fact-based `myth' is that because women are less likely to take financial risks, their earnings may be less than their male counterparts under a market-based system. 
It is true, statistically, that women have historically invested more conservatively than men. Furthermore, women may have less invested in outside accounts than men. 
But it is interesting to note that according to the National Association of Investors Corporation, all-women investment clubs earn higher returns than all-men clubs do. Who says women cannot make financial decisions? 
Even under the most conservative investment strategies, such as super-safe U.S. Treasury Bonds, women fare better than they would under the current system. 
According to a recent Cato Institute study, if women retiring in 1981 were provided the opportunity to invest their savings in personal retirement accounts with earnings sharing, the average single woman could expect to receive 57.9 percent more in retirement benefits and the average female divorcee could expect 67.2 percent more. 
The average widow could expect 96.5 percent more, nearly double the benefits than under Social Security. The average wife could expect to receive 207.5 percent more than under the existing Social Security program. 
While the National Center for Women and Retirement Research has found women may feel less confident about making financial decisions, there is no reason to believe women lack the skills to understand the challenges and long-term benefits of investments. Pension experts agree that education is a critical factor in helping individuals make better investment choices, and the GAO has found evidence that investor education can help to alleviate the problem. 
So even though some advocates of the status quo argue men may fare `better' than women under a market-based system, I believe they are missing the point that both would fare better than they do under the current system. It appears as though some would prefer `equality' in misery than the potential for some `inequality' at a much higher standard of living for all. Furthermore, there is nothing to show that women retirees could not fare better than men, even though, statistically, they are not doing so now under the current system. 
One of the most troubling fact-based myths is that the current system protects women from running out of benefits before they die more than a personal retirement account would. The premise is that since women live longer than men do, they will need benefits longer. Under the current system, retirees are promised benefits until death, even though on average, they exhaust their contributions within the first five years of retirement. In a system of personal retirement accounts, benefits would be based upon one's own contributions, the age at which one retires, and the performance of their account. 
It is true that women, again, tend to outlive men. And yes, it is true that an independent study found women are more likely than men to spend a lump sum distribution from a defined contribution plan. However, that should not imply that women could not be trusted with a private savings account. In fact, that same study showed women are equally as likely as men to rollover lump sums from a defined benefit plan into an IRA, or to save and invest the money. We must also remember these studies are based upon the current situation, where these men and women anticipate uninterrupted benefits from Social Security. 
In the future, however, if the current system remains unchanged, a maximum of 75 percent of the current benefit level will be available to retirees. In other words, future retirees could expect to lose 25 percent of retirement benefits. Once the IOU's that now make up the Social Security trust fund begin being cashed in, the economy will suffer, employment rates may suffer, taxes may need to be raised, and the ability for an individual to prepare for the reduction in Social Security benefits will be significantly reduced. 
Mr. President, I would say to those arguing for the status quo that urging women to hold out for some future promise of benefits that are not likely to be there is folly. And in fact, holding out will likely leave women increasingly dependent upon their benefits at the same time those benefits are being reduced. 
But as I mentioned earlier, women are not the only individuals being misled by some in the debate. Race continues to be an important factor in determining the retirement security for some Americans. Retirement studies similar to those that focus on women have looked at minority workers, and I would like to briefly touch on the Hispanic and African-American populations. 
By all accounts, the Hispanic population is relatively youthful. However, as the Social Security system approaches insolvency and the rate of return on these workers' investments declines, Hispanics will be forced to bear a disproportionate share of that growing financial burden. The Census Bureau estimates that by the year 2050, Hispanics will make up nearly 25 percent of the work force, compared with only 11 percent last year. This will come at the same time tax rates, if the system stays the same, will need to be increased to cover the bankrupt trust fund. 
Some have estimated that the tax rate increase would have to be nearly 40 percent by then to cover benefit expenses--40 percent first for Social Security expenses. Such a tax burden promises to severely hamper the ability of young Hispanics to save for themselves. 
But what do all those numbers mean? The Heritage Foundation did a model of a Hispanic community. They assumed 50,000 people lived there--all families of four made up of dual- income 30-year olds with two kids. By forcing these families to throw their payroll taxes into the Social Security system, the analysts estimated the community, as a whole, lost $12.8 billion in 1997 dollars over what it could have earned had they invested in a conservative portfolio. This small minority community, in effect, lost nearly half--this is just this small community--lost nearly half what the federal government spends on food stamps or education for this entire Nation! 
But if an Hispanic couple from that community were able to take the dollars they would be required to pay into the current Social Security system and instead invest them in a portfolio, the outcome would have been remarkably different. Under the current system, the couple could expect about $420,000 in exchange for a lifetime of contributions. But with a conservative portfolio comprised of 50 percent U.S. Treasury Bonds and 50 percent blue chip equities, that same couple could nearly double their benefit to $767,000 in today's dollars. Treasury Bonds alone would yield over $100,000 more in benefits. That means this family would have enough to convert their benefit to an annuity paying out exactly what Social Security promised and still have more than $200,000 left over for any expenses --long-term health care or even just passing along to their children--something impossible under today's Social Security system. 
The findings within the African-American community are similarly stunning. Like single Hispanic males, single African-American males have a lower life expectancy and are especially disadvantaged by the current Social Security system. Although the system aims to transfer funds to low-income individuals, these minorities are particularly hard hit. 
According to the Heritage Foundation, a low-income, African-American male born after 1959 can expect to receive less than 88 cents back on every dollar he contributes to the Social Security trust fund. This translates into a lifetime cash loss of some $13,377--a loss these individuals can hardly afford Not a gain on their investment, but an actual loss on their investment. If we allowed that same male to invest his Social Security taxes in T-bonds, he would receive a post-tax increase in his lifetime income of nearly $80,000. 
African-American women are similarly disadvantaged by the current system. Enabling a 21-year-old single mother to invest her payroll taxes into low-risk/low-yield government bonds, rather than the Social Security system, would more than double her rate of return. That means this woman could expect to get back $93,000 more, after taxes, than she would under the current system. And with a little risk, the numbers could even more than double. 
Mr. President, many solutions have been proposed to stave off the impending Social Security trust fund crisis: raising retirement ages, increasing payroll taxes, decreasing benefits--the list goes on. But we cannot forget that those choices will only exacerbate a problem that is already becoming progressively worse. Such proposals put at greatest risk those the system was aimed to help the most. 
When our Founding Fathers created this great Nation, they declared each American had the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. If we continue on our present track with the current Social Security system, we are truly undermining those principles. Sentencing women and minorities to a retirement life of poverty is unfair. The threat of raising payroll taxes by nearly 40 percent to fund a bankrupt retirement system threatens to steal away our children's liberty. And turning our backs on the reforms we have the power to undertake--reforms that will truly revive our ailing system--steals away every American's right to pursue happiness. Mr. President, rather than scaring women and minorities away from the options we have before us, let us give them the freedom that comes with personal retirement choices, the peace of mind that retirement security provides, and the ability to lead a better life in retirement than the one they are being promised today.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit, as I mentioned earlier, on an amendment offered by Senator Shelby dealing with the CRA. 
I take a few moments today to rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Alabama and urge my colleagues to support it as well. 
Senator Shelby's leadership on this issue is well-established and he should be commended for his perseverance, even in the face of fierce opposition by some of his colleagues and the Clinton administration. 
Mr. President, this amendment is a simple and appropriate step to removing an inappropriate and unnecessary burden from our Nation's small banks and thrifts. The amendment exempts small banks and thrifts, under $250 million in assets, from the grasp of the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA. 
I am sure that some of my colleagues may come to the floor and argue that the Federal banking regulators have taken steps to remove the burdens from banks, and thus, this amendment is unnecessary. Although I commend the regulators for easing the burden of CRA, this contention does justify the appropriateness of the underlying arguement that government-mandated credit allocation is inappropriate. As we have seen most recently in Asia, when the government mandates that the private markets allocate their resources in set ways--capital in this case--the results can be disasterous. 
I think there are three arguments which must be considered regarding Senator Shelby's amendment. 
The first is, What was the justification for enactment of CRA in the first place? The Community Reinvestment Act was enacted in 1977 in response to rumors of redlining in the banking industry. The debate at that time shows that supporters felt there were three factors justifying enactment, and they are: first, that banks enjoy a semi-exclusive franchise--due in part to interstate banking restrictions and activity restrictions on competitors such as thrifts and credit unions; two, that the government limits competition within the banking sector by limiting interstate banking and limiting the acitivities of competitors such as credit unions and thrifts; and, third, that the Government restricts the cost of money to banks through interest rate caps on savings accounts and a prohibition on paying interest on demand deposits. If these three points, as the record shows, truly were the justification for imposing CRA on banks, the authors would certainly have to reconsider their action in light of the current environment facing banks. 
Banks no longer enjoy the limited competition they did in 1977. The Reigel-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 opened the doors to interstate banking, thus providing competition not only among banks within a state but with banks across the country as well. Also, the bill we are considering today will throw open the doors of competition to another set of competitors--credit unions--which will be able to add any group of individuals they choose, limited only by its size. Also, these two examples I have just explained do not take into account all of the non-bank financial services which have evolved and expanded since 1977--including money market accounts, mutual funds, and deposit-like insurance products. 
Banks also no longer enjoy protection against set costs which had been imposed through interest rate controls. The 1980 Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 appropriately removed these price controls which inhibited competition. 
The second argument which must be considered when we discuss the Shelby amendment is the claim that the amendment will exempt 88% of the banks from coverage under the CRA. Although this percentage seems staggering--and may sway someone who feels that CRA is okay in some instances--a closer look reveals that opponents of the amendment are using sleight of hand to give the impression that this amendment will have a deeper impact than it truly will. Although it may be true that 88% of banks are exempted, in terms of the number that really counts--that is, assets--the impact that this exemption will have is overstated. That is because less than 12% of bank assets are exempted. 
The approximately 8,100 banks exempted have $593 billion in assets, but that accounts for only 11.7% of bank assets in this country. These assets are only one-half-of-one percent, or $3 billion, more than the combined assets of the soon-to-be-completed Bank of America--NationsBank merger. In other words, one bank in the country will soon have close to the same number of assets as the 8,100 banks which would be exempted under this amendment. When you realize that the overall impact of this amendment on the CRA is so small, you must question why it is being contested with such vigor. 
The third contention which must be contemplated in considering this amendment is whether it will have a negative impact on preventing discrimination. To listen to the critics of the amendment, one would believe that the amendment gives banks a `get out of jail free' card when it comes to discrimination. 
However, you must understand that this amendment in no way restricts the enforcement of the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, or the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. These acts, designed to prevent discrimination, will remain unfettered in detering inappropriate practices of financial institutions. The amendment in no way weakens laws designed to protect individuals; instead, it removes the inappropriate policy of dictating where banks must operate. 
Mr. President, I realize that some in the credit union movement are concerned that adoption of the Shelby amendment may endanger swift enactment of this legislation. However, after contemplating the points raised, I do not understand how the President could consider vetoing a bill based on this appropriate and narrow relief and I do not understand how any of my colleagues can argue the doom and gloom scenarios they are painting about this amendment. 
So, again, Senator Shelby should be commended for his leadership and his amendment should be adopted, insisted on in conference, and signed into law by the President.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep disappointment and frustration about the Senate's inaction to consider and pass the Government Shutdown Act. 
Mr. President, this week I sought to offer S. 547, the Government Shutdown Prevention Act, as an amendment to the Legislative Branch Appropriations. This amendment, originally sponsored by Senator McCain, would create an automatic procedure for a CR at the end of each fiscal year. The essence of the amendment is that we cannot and will not allow a Government shutdown, we will not allow disruption of the services we rely on from the Government, and we will simplify and facilitate the process of passing a continuing resolution. 
What issue is more relevant to the legislative branch than acting responsibly to keep the Government in business? This amendment would have ended the annual battle we have each year on what is included in a CR and at what level of spending. It would end the last-minute mischief of adding new pork and new spending into a CR because everybody wants to avoid a shutdown. So you are blackmailed into doing something you do not want to do. 
Unfortunately, I was unable to offer this amendment due to germaneness concerns and lack of leadership support. 
In May of 1997, during the debate on the Supplemental Appropriation bill--this was covering the flood disasters that occurred in Minnesota and the Dakotas of that year, and others around the country--Senators McCain and Hutchison offered this amendment, but later withdrew it based on a commitment made by both Senate majority and minority leaders that the Government Shutdown Prevention Act would be allowed to be considered as a separate measure in the near future. The leaders specifically promised a full debate on the legislation with one relevant amendment for each leader. 
Mr. President, I would remind my colleagues of the word of the Minority Leader at a news conference he held back on June 11, 1997. I am quoting here from a transcript of the news conference: 
Senator Rod Grams sent a letter to all leadership yesterday which offers a very simple, yet I think extraordinarily acceptable solution: strip out the legislation that is the source of the controversy. 
So back again to why the President vetoed the emergency supplemental, it was because of this very part. 
The minority leader went on to say: 
Have an up or down vote on the census, have an up or down vote on the CR, have an up or down vote on the disaster bill. I cannot think of anything more simple than that. I think it is the right thing to do. I have indicated to Senator Lott this morning that I think it is the right thing to do. 
In a news conference the following day, the Minority Leader repeated his support again: 
We would be willing to set a time certain for each of the pieces of legislation, very short time limits for debate ended. I think it is an excellent proposal, and I am hopeful that that is ultimately what we agree to. 
Mr. President, that was indeed what we ultimately agreed to. 
It has been over a year now since that debate ended. The Senate never had an opportunity to consider this as a separate measure, so I have chosen to again raise this as a non-controversial measure that will force the Congress to act responsibly to avoid a government shutdown, and also for those who made those promises to live up to their word. 
During last year's debate, some of my colleagues argued that since a budget agreement was reached between the White House and Congress, there was no need for this amendment anymore. I argued at the time that the budget agreement made the amendment even more crucial for a responsible government. And here we are again, with just a few weeks left in this session to consider 10 appropriations bills and all 13 conference reports. 
My major concerns were, and still are, that the many economic assumptions and spending priorities within the budget agreement make our budget and appropriation process uncertain. The current budget disagreements have again clearly proved my point. 
Mr. President, as you know, during this year's budget debate, some members are calling for more spending for their favorite programs. Others, like myself, prefer larger tax cuts and larger spending reductions. As a result, the House and the Senate have approved a budget resolution with significantly different tax and spending priorities. Those differences have prevented us from completing the budget resolution conference report, which is long overdue in accordance with our budgetary rules. It is possible that Congress may not be able to produce a budget this year at all, or finish the regular appropriations legislation before the fiscal year ends on September 30 of 1998. 
What would this mean, Mr. President? This means the American people will have once again been held hostage to a government shutdown simply because Congress and the White House, or the House and the Senate, do not agree on tax cuts and spending priorities, or seek to slow down the appropriations process by offering controversial or non-germane amendments. 
In 1995, we witnessed the longest federal government shutdown in history, which caused financial damages and inconvenience to millions of Americans simply because of disagreements between the Congress and the President in our budget process. 
That was a very costly shutdown. The shutdown disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. Some retirees and veterans could not promptly receive their social services, such as Medicare benefits. Families could not obtain passports, or visit national parks and museums. Millions of dollars were lost to small business owners and local communities. Federal employees were furloughed with a fear of not getting paid, although they were--at again, a loss to the taxpayer. Even our troops stationed overseas were affected by the shutdown. The interruption caused immeasurable financial damage to the American people and to this country, bottom line. 
The most serious damage done by the 27-day shutdown was that it shook the American people's confidence in their government and in their elected officials. Even today, we have not yet undone this damage. We need to restore the public's faith in its leaders by showing that we have learned from our mistakes. Passage of this good-government contingency plan will send a clear message to the American people that we will no longer allow them to be held hostage in budget disputes between Congress and the White House or among ourselves. 
We all have different philosophies and policies on budget priorities, and of course we will not always agree. But there are essential functions and services of the federal government we must continue regardless of our differences in budget priorities. 
More often, without a good-government contingency plan, the continuing resolution has become impossible as we argue over funding levels and whether pork project `A' or pork project `B' deserves our support. Debate on program funding is not based on merits but on political leverage. As a result, billions of the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars are wasted in this process. 
The virtue of this amendment is that it would allow us to debate issues about our spending policy and the merits of budget priorities while we continue to keep essential government functions operating. The American people will no longer be held hostage to a government shutdown. So, as I said earlier, there are still plenty of uncertainties involved in our budget and appropriations process, particularly this year. If we continue on our current course and the government again shuts down as it did three years ago, it will be another devastating blow to the American people, from senior citizens to disaster victims. 
We must ensure that a good-government contingency plan is in place to keep the government up and running in the event that a budget agreement is not reached. 
Mr. President, this good-government contingency plan is sound policy, I believe it is wise policy, and it is responsible policy. With a dwindling number of legislative days left in this Congress, I strongly believe that it is vitally important to immediately consider and pass this overdue measure to end the annual shutdown battle we face every year. This should be non-controversial legislation we can all support. I therefore strongly urge the Senate leadership to bring this legislation up for a full debate and vote as earlier agreed. 
Is there any time remaining?

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to support, in a small way, the efforts of my colleagues from Kansas and from Missouri, talking about how to abolish the marriage penalty and help instill American values into the U.S. Tax Code. I applaud them for their continual efforts to bring this issue to the floor, to continue to talk about the need for us to take a very hard look at this and hopefully create the means of eliminating this very unfair tax on American families. 
Since the founding days of this Nation, the family has always been considered to be the bedrock of American society, the first unit of Government. Strong families make strong communities, and strong communities are what has made a strong America. For generations, our ancestors built this country on that very foundation, and the Government respected that tradition by ensuring that its laws did not usurp the family role. 
Then how do we explain the existence of the marriage penalty, a piece of Government tax trickery that actually penalizes couples who choose to commit to a family through marriage? Let me read to you, this morning, from a study of the marriage penalty prepared by the National Center for Policy Analysis. 
Prior to 1948, the Tax Code made no distinction between married couples and individuals. In that year, Congress changed the law to allow income splitting. In effect, couples were taxed like two single taxpayers even if only one had earned income. The result was to sharply lower taxes for married couples. In short, a de facto subsidy for marriage was created. 
By 1969, the magnitude of this subsidy had grown to such an extent that it was possible for a single person to pay 40 percent more in taxes than a married couple with the same income. 
This led Congress to create, for married and unmarried people, separate tax schedules [that were] designed to reduce the subsidy to no more than 20 percent. 
An unintended consequence of the 1969 law change was to create a marriage penalty for the first time.

Mr. GRAMS. I am not sure, but when you look at couples across the country who are unfairly paying $29 billion or 21 
million couples across the country who are unfairly paying about $29 billion a year in taxes--if there are some discrepancies, we should look at all of it. But what we should not do is penalize those families who are paying an average of $1,400 a year more, just because of the way the codes are set up.

Mr. GRAMS. When my colleague says he hasn't run into those folks, I have, and I concur with what the other Senators said, that they have. I have had a number of couples come up to me, whether at airports or at meetings or at other times, and tell me exactly the same thing the other Senators have said. They have actually planned around this, whether they have delayed the marriage for a year--I even had one elderly gentleman tell me he called his wife from the accountant, he was 79 years old, and he said to his wife, `I think we need to get a divorce.' She was kind of shocked by it and she said, `Why?' And he said, `Because we would be much better off if we were filing single.' And then he went through the explanation. 
So this is not something that has gone by Americans, and especially families, and especially dual-income families. So I think there are many out there who are aware of this. When it comes to a difference of $3,500 a year, for those first years I think a lot of families are thinking very strongly about it. 
But just briefly, I want to wrap this up and give a couple of minutes to my other colleagues here. But I just think, when we look at the numbers, Washington created this `unintended consequence' within the Tax Code, that, as I mentioned, penalized some 21 million American couples to a tune of about $29 billion a year. I remember President Clinton saying at a news conference not too long ago that he agreed this was an unfair tax, but he also had to put in a qualifier, `But Washington cannot do without money. This $29 billion is too important for Washington to give up.' In other words, we are willing, bottom line, to impose an unfair tax on many of our American families just so Washington can have a few additional dollars--if you count $29 billion as a few additional dollars--to have that at the end of the year. 
According to the CBO, couples at the bottom end of the income scale who incur penalties paid in, on an average, nearly $800. When we talk about low income and we want go give them a tax break--they paid an additional $800 in taxes. That represented about 8 percent of their income. Repeal the penalty and those low-income families will immediately receive an 8-percent increase in their income. 
So my constituents have been very clear on this issue. As I mentioned, many have come and talked to me. Many have written letters. One wrote:  
This tax clearly penalizes those who marry and are trying to possibly raise a family by working two jobs just to make ends meet. Our tax laws need to give the proper incentives encouraging marriage and upholding its sacred institutions. 
Mr. President, I couldn't agree more. 
Also, we began to add some real reform last year with the passage of a $500-per-child tax credit. It is a small step, but in the right direction. This Congress should do everything in its power to promote family life, to return the family to its rightful place as the center of American society. Whether lawmakers intended it or not, Congress created the marriage penalty and it rests on Congress to take it back. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, in my most recent statements before this Chamber about the Social Security system, I have taken time to discuss its history and the looming crisis, that it will shatter the retirement dreams of our hard-working Americans. 
Mr. President, in my most recent statements before this chamber about the Social Security system, I discussed its history and the looming crisis that will shatter the retirement dreams of hard-working Americans. Tonight, I would like to discuss Social Security from a different perspective, by turning our focus away from the coming crisis to look at the steps other nations have taken to improve their own retirement systems. I realize that it may be hard to look outside ourselves for possible solutions to the problems our Social Security system is facing--after all, we are a nation that is typically at the forefront of innovation. But if we set aside our pride, we can learn volumes about the viable international options before us. 
Retirement security programs throughout the world will face a serious challenge in the 21st century due to a massive demographic change that is now taking place. The World Bank recently warned that, across the globe, `old-age systems are in serious financial trouble and are not sustainable in their present form.' Europe, Japan, and the U.S. share the identical problem of postwar demographic shifts that cannot sustain massively expensive social welfare programs. How to meet this challenge is critical to providing retirement security while maintaining sustainable, global, economic growth. 
The crisis awaiting our Social Security system is nearly as serious as that faced by the European Union and Japan. What is equally serious is that, while many other countries have moved far ahead of us in taking steps to reform their old-age retirement systems, Congress has yet to focus on this problem. Some of the international efforts are extremely successful; those reforms may offer useful models as we explore solutions to our Social Security system. 
Currently, there are three basic models being implemented abroad that deserve our attention. The `Latin American' model primarily follows Chile's experience. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development model, or `OECD,' is underway in the United Kingdom, Australia, Switzerland, and Denmark. There is even a third model--the `Notional Account" model--that has been adopted in countries such as Sweden, Italy, Latvia, China, and is on the verge of adoption in Poland. 
These models have differences, and the nations implementing them have differences as well--economic, political, and demographic. But they all share a common theme and were born out of the same fiscal crisis that is facing the United States within the next decade. Like the U.S., each of these countries has an aging population, and--before the reforms--had an inability to meet the future retirement needs of their workforce. So in an effort to avoid economic devastation for their people and their nation as a whole, they undertook various reforms that are proving to be a win-win for both current and future retirees. 
How did they do it? And what lessons can we--as policy leaders--take from their experiences and apply here at home as we grapple with the shortcomings of our own retirement system? These are some of the questions I will address today in my remarks. The bottom line is that each nation faced the key challenges of taking care of those already retired or about to reach retirement age, ensuring that future retirees benefitted from the changes, and finding an affordable means of funding the transition from a pay-as-you-go government retirement system to a future financing mechanism. 
Mr. President, I'll begin with the Latin American model and in particular, focus on Chile's experiences. Back in the late 1970s, Chile realized that its publicly financed pay-as-you-go retirement system would soon be unable to meet its retirement promises. After a national debate and extensive outreach, the Chilean government approved a law to fully replace its system with a system of personalized Pension Savings Accounts by 1980. Nearly two decades later, pensions in Chile are between 50 to 100 percent higher than they were under the old government system. Real wages have increased, personal savings rates have nearly tripled, and the economy has grown at a rate nearly double what it had prior to the change. 
Under the Chilean plan, Pension Savings Accounts, or PSAs, were created to replace the old system and operate much like a mutual fund. Like the old government plan, PSAs were to provide workers with approximately 70 percent of their lifetime working income. That is where the similarities between Chile's old and improved retirement programs ends. 
When Chile created the PSA system, the existing system of having workers and employers pay social security taxes to the government was completely eliminated. Instead, workers began to make a mandatory contribution in the amount of 10 percent of their income to their own PSA. The old employer taxes were then available to workers in the form of higher wages. Through this evolution from the old, hidden labor tax on workers to the new PSA system, workers saw real gross wages increase by five percent. Furthermore, it reduced the cost of labor--and the economy prospered. 
Under the PSA system, a worker has great control over his or her retirement savings account. First, the worker has the ability to choose who will manage their fund from a pool of government-regulated companies known as `AFPs.' This provides the worker with the ability to move between managers, while maintaining protections from serious losses resulting from undiversified risk portfolios, theft, or fraud. The resulting competition between AFPs results in lower fees for workers, higher returns averaging 12 percent annually, and better service --something that rarely occurs with government plans. 
Second, each worker is empowered to ensure the level of retirement income they desire. Armed with a passbook and account statements, these workers have the information necessary to follow their earnings growth and decide how to adjust their tax-free voluntary contributions in order to yield a specific annual income upon their retirement. For example, the Chilean system was established to provide an annual income equivalent to 70 percent of lifetime income. However, under the PSA system, income is averaging 78 percent. 
Third, workers can choose from two payout options upon retirement. A worker can leave his or her funds in the PSA and take programmed withdrawals from the account with the only limitation based upon projected lifetime expectancy. Should the retiree die prior to exhausting the PSA fund, any excess amount is transferred to his or her estate. The other scenario allows a worker to use the PSA funds to purchase an annuity from a private insurance company. These annuities guarantee a monthly income as well, and is indexed for inflation. In the event of death, survivor benefits are provided to the workers' dependents. They build an estate for their heirs. 
And finally, PSA accounts are not automatically forfeited to the government in the case of premature death or disability of a worker. Under the Chilean system, the fund managers provide an insurance protection through private insurance companies. The fee is in addition to the 10 percent mandatory savings contribution, and ensures the PSA funds are not lost should a worker not reach full retirement age. 
Personal accounts have brought personal freedom to Chile's retirement system. Today, more than 93 percent of the workforce participates in the PSAs, which boast an accumulated investment fund of $30 billion. This is remarkable when you consider Chile is a developing nation of 14 million people with a GDP of $70 billion. Chile's success has paved the way for other Latin American countries such as Argentina, Peru, and Columbia and has sparked the momentum for reform in Mexico, Bolivia, and El Salvador. 
While individual accounts are proving successful in Latin America, the OECD model utilizes a `group' choice approach as a key element. Rather than allowing an individual to choose his or her own fund manager, the employer or union trustee chooses for the company or occupational group as a whole. This approach most likely developed from the fact that these reforms were politically easier to `add-on' to the existing government pay-as-you-go pension tier. Furthermore, reform leaders worked closely with union leaders when they began to implement the next tier of private plans, and then moved the reform sector by sector. 
The movement began during the 1980s in the United Kingdom. Since the end of World War II, the British had a basic, flat rate, non-means tested government pension for all who paid into the national insurance plan. By the 1970s, a new tier was added to bridge a gap between those covered by private pensions and those without them. This State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, or SERPS, promised--in exchange for a payroll tax--an earnings-based pension of 25 percent of the best 20 years of earnings, in addition to the Basic State Pension. 
However, like other nations, the government pension plan was facing bankruptcy and reform was critical to the future security of its workers and of the nation as a whole. 
Under the leadership of Social Security Secretary Peter Lilley, the British system evolved and began to enable individuals to choose the option of a new, self-financing private pension plan. 
Under the British plan, current retirees were protected, but current workers were given a choice of pension plans. Those workers had the option of either staying in the SERPS program or contracting out to a private fund. If a worker chose to remain within SERPS, they would receive a reduced pension amounting to 20 percent of their best 20 years of earnings. However, if a worker contracted out of the SERPS, they were given the opportunity to participate in an occupational pension plan, and were eventually allowed to take part in a new private, portable pension plan much like a 401(k). 
To pay for the plan, a worker who chooses to contract out receives a rebate equivalent to a portion of their payroll taxes. This rebate amounts to about 4.6 percent of earnings and must be invested in an approved plan. Additional contributions can be made--tax free--by employers and employees up to a combined total limit of 17.5 percent of the individual's income. As a safety net, companies are required to guarantee that workers who contract out will receive a pension at least equivalent to what they would have under SERPS, and are limited as to the amount that can be invested in the employer's own company. 
To address changing workforce trends and not hold workers captive to employer plans, the British government created the `appropriate personal pension,' or APP, plan which would be available to workers, as well as to the self-employed or unemployed. These fully portable plans are much like the employer plans, funded by the 4.6 percent rebate in payroll taxes, and are an alternative to the occupational plan or the SERPS. As an incentive, the British government offered an additional `payroll tax rebate' above the standard rebate during the APPs infancy. This made these fully portable APPs attractive options for younger workers. 
While there are many safeguards--including the ability for former SERPS workers to opt back into the government-run program--the success of the English system has been overwhelming. When the transformation began, analysts expected a participation rate of a half million workers, growing to 1.75 million over time. Today, nearly 73 percent of the workforce participates in private plans, boasting a total pool worth more than $1 trillion. 
The resulting economic growth and ability to control entitlement spending has analysts predicting the United Kingdom will pay off its national debt by 2030. In case any of my colleagues have forgotten, that is about the same time our Social Security trust fund is anticipated to go bankrupt. 
Similarly, Australia has found much success in transforming its government pay-as-you-go pension plan to a more self-directed plan. By the 1980s, its existing retirement plan offered a full pension for all Australians over age 69, although most qualified to begin drawing benefits by age 60 for women and 65 for men. Like its international neighbors, Australia was facing a future financial situation that threatened worker retirement security and Australia's standing in the global economy. 
As Australia began to review its options, three goals emerged. Whatever changes were made, the new system had to provide more benefits for future retirees than they would receive under the current plan; it had to increase national savings, and any new plan had to reduce budgetary pressures facing the system. By the mid-1980s, the Australian government instituted a mandatory savings plan called `superannuation funds.' In 1992, the program matured into a new Superannuation Guarantee that is still a work in progress. 
During the transformation process, the Australian government took key steps to change its course. First, it strengthened the income means-testing for the old age pension. In doing so, the government also added an asset test in the calculations process. This was critical since the dependence on Social Security had contributed to the decline in national savings. Second, the government made the new superannuation savings portable, and instituted a penalty for withdrawals before age 55. 
This provided new incentives for savings since workers could take their funds with them, and disincentives for spending one's nest egg prior to retirement. Third, the government took steps to build union investment into the savings program. Rather than giving workers wage increases, negotiators reached an agreement to provide a 3-percent contribution into a superannuation fund for all employees and called for such guarantees to be built into all future labor contracts. Fourth, the government expanded coverage of the superannuation fund to virtually all workers, and every employer is required to contribute a set amount to the fund on the employees' behalf. The required amount is currently 3 percent and will grow to 9 percent by 2002. 
Since the beginning of the Australian reform, additional changes have occurred. Today, workers have more choices between which superannuation fund their mandatory savings can be invested in. Additional tax relief has been provided for voluntary savings, but savings are not tax-free when invested. As Australia reviews its overall tax structure, however, there have been discussions about making contributions tax-free and deferring taxation until the funds are withdrawn. Another key issue was the total elimination of early withdrawal. Because a retirement safety net remains in place, the goal here was to eliminate a worker from `double dipping'--collecting from the savings fund, then coming back to the government for a pension at age 65. 
The Australian reforms are considered a successful example of the OECD model. And as more initiatives are implemented, it will likely continue to prove profitable for future retirees `down under.' 
The final example I would like to touch upon is the `notional account' model--like the system in Sweden. Under this plan, workers receive a passbook that reflects their defined contributions and the interest being accumulated over time, but there are no real assets in the account. The fund is just a `notion' of what it would be if it were funded. In some respects, it might be compared to the Personal Earnings Benefit Statements U.S. workers receive from the Social Security Administration. The up-side is there is no transition cost for a nation to move from a government-run, pay-as-you-go system to a notional pay-as-you-go system. The downside is that the funds remain at risk, as do future retirees. The bottom line here is that reforms have to be real if we are going to see any long-term benefit for workers. 
Mr. President, it is clear that whatever the specifics, reforms are being implemented abroad that are proving to be a great success for both today's retirees and tomorrow's. I hope we have learned that we are not operating in a vacuum here--that there are real models out there for us to review and consider. 
For the United States to be successful in the reforms it undertakes to ensure retirement security, there are four key principles we must uphold. 
First, we must protect all current and near-term retirees. Our government made a promise to them, and we must ensure any transformation we pursue does not impact the decisions they have made for their golden years. 
Second, we must ensure that any proposal holds the promise of improved benefits--and greater retirement security--for future retirees. 
Today's younger generations have every right to be skeptical about government promises to revamp a system they expect to go bankrupt. They need to know there is a solution that provides retirement security for them. 
Third, any proposal should encourage personal choice by allowing individuals to establish personal retirement accounts. 
Fourth, the government must not turn to tax increases to fund our pursuit of retirement security. 
Finally, we must recognize that any change will require courage. We must admit to ourselves we have a system that is fine today but is a time bomb waiting to explode. The decisions ahead will not be easy; if they were, they would have been made already. But the debate must begin somewhere. 
On August 14, this nation will recognize the 63rd anniversary of Congress' approval of the Social Security system. It is my hope that we will mark the occasion by engaging in a national debate over how we can transform our ailing system into a vibrant retirement program for generations to come. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate `Space Week' and recognize the accomplishments of our nation's space programs over the course of forty years of NASA space exploration. 
As my colleagues may know, this month marks the 29th anniversary of the Apollo 11 launch on July 16, 1969 which began one of man's greatest voyages of exploration: the first flight to land a man on the moon. Like most Americans, I can recall my wonderment on July 20, 1969 when the lunar module Eagle landed on the moon. Soon thereafter, Commander Neil Armstrong descended from Eagle to the moon's surface and declared those memorable words, `That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.' 
Since that historic moment, NASA and its private sector partners have guided this nation to the forefront of aeronautical excellence. Today, this nation's commitment to expanding the development of technology and learning more about our vast universe remains as strong as ever.

Mr. GRAMS. Minnesotans were there at the dawn of the Space Age, and I look forward to the role our state will play as the next chapter of America's space history, the era of the International Space Station, is written. 
I believe the nation's space programs, such as the International Space Station, represent important investments in America's future. The scientific and technological benefits of this ambitious initiative are impressive and will produce a high rate of return on the American taxpayers' investment in aeronautical and space programs. Among these benefits, the space station will provide new insight into industrial research for air and water purification, waste management and recycling, computer technology, and environmental engineering. Most notable is the progress being made in the biomedical field. 
The promise of a long-term, zero gravity environment has scientists poised to conduct research into the development of cures for diabetes, cancer, emphysema, and immune system disorders. Moreover, the study and eventual findings of why astronauts who spend extended periods of time in space often experience weakening of their hearts and blood vessels may lead to the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. It should also be noted that the International Space Station is supported by many of this nation's most prominent medical and research organizations, including the American Medical Association, the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America, the American Medical Woman's Association, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Mount Sinai Medical Center. Clearly, the space station promises to make significant contributions to the study of medicine. 
Mr. President, the International Space Station will help to maintain U.S. leadership in space while promoting international cooperation. This international laboratory in orbit will bring American, Russian, European, Japanese, and Canadian astronauts together in search of a common goal: to develop further advances in science and technology that will benefit future generations. 
More importantly for the young people of America, the space station will inspire greater interest in our nation's space programs. With this in mind, I would like to commend some of the colleges and universities in my home state of Minnesota for their commitment to encouraging the involvement of our country's future leaders in our aeronautical and space industry. 
Mr. President, since 1989, NASA has administered the `Space Grant' program to enhance aerospace research and education in the United States. This program is an effective partnership among universities, the aerospace industry, and federal, state, and local governments that assists in the recruitment and training of professionals in aerospace science, engineering, and technology. 
In my home state, the Minnesota Space Grant Consortium is comprised of nine academic institutions along with the Minnesota Department of Transportation. Those nine institutions are: Augsburg College, Bemidji State University, Bethel College, College of St. Catherine, Fond du Lac Tribal and Community College, Macalester College, Normandale Community College, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, and the University of St. Thomas. 
For the last several years, these institutions have worked effectively together to promote aerospace science through fellowships and scholarships, the development of new courses in Physics and Geology, the establishment of a new Space Studies minor among the consortia members, and public lectures relating to space science and engineering. 
I met recently with Emily Eelkema, a native of Minneapolis and a senior at the University of Minnesota studying Aerospace Engineering. Emily is a participant in the NASA Academy on Aeronautics at the Dryden Flight Research Center in California, and was initially selected for this honor through the Minnesota Space Grant Consortium. 
Those selected for the NASA Academy are among the brightest students in the country and have expressed a deep interest in NASA aeronautical space research. I was extremely impressed by Emily's grasp of Dryden's flight research program and her life-long interest in aeronautics and space activities. I am encouraged to learn of her goals of becoming an astronaut and playing an important role in the design of a manned Mars mission. Her commitment to a career in this exciting field makes me optimistic about the future of our space program. 
Mr. President, the commemoration of `Space Week' would not be complete without paying tribute to a true American hero, our colleague Senator John Glenn. On October 29, Senator Glenn will embark on a second journey into space, this time aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery, as a Payload Specialist responsible for conducting space-based research on aging. His work may lead to further understanding by scientists about the process of aging, and help reduce the number of individuals requiring long-term medical care in their later years. 
Many deserving accolades have been placed upon Senator Glenn for his accomplishments throughout his career as a marine, the first American to orbit the Earth, and a United States Senator. I believe no commendation has captured the essence of John Glenn's commitment to public service than that bestowed upon him more than 35 years ago by President Kennedy during a visit to Cape Canaveral, Florida. 
Upon presentation of NASA's Distinguished Service Medal to Lt. Colonel Glenn, President Kennedy spoke of Glenn's historic orbital flight when he said, `His performance was marked by his great professional knowledge, his skill as a test pilot, his unflinching courage, and his extraordinary ability to perform the most difficult tasks under conditions of great physical stress and personal danger. His performance in fulfillment of this most dangerous assignment reflects the highest credit upon himself and the United States.' 
Mr. President, I encourage all Americans to reflect upon the benefits of our nation's space programs during this Space Week. As we approach the 21st century, Americans can share a sense of national pride as we move forward in our epic journey--a journey filled with uncertainty, yet with great promise--into the space frontier.

Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I wish to thank the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Hutchinson and the Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine for their efforts to address the issue of FDA action on Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) metered-dose inhalers (MDIs). I share their commitment to protecting the health and safety of the millions of Americans who rely daily on MDIs to treat asthma and other pulmonary conditions. 
Most of today's products rely on CFCs, which the nations of the world under the terms of the Montreal Protocol, have agreed to phase out. This phase out is due to the reported damage CFCs cause to the stratospheric ozone layer which protects us from excessive amounts of ultraviolet radiation. However, patients with asthma and other pulmonary conditions understandably are concerned about the possibility that one day they may no longer have access to their medications and whether it will come before adequate replacement medicines are available. 
I believe the resolution included in the appropriations legislation appropriately balances the need to establish a framework for the transition from CFC to non-CFC products promptly, so patients and physicians will understand the process and deal with it. Immediate action is needed so patients and care givers have the opportunity to consider and appropriately manage the impact of a transition from one safe and effective medication to another. With sufficient time to make such preparations, the important transition from CFC to non-CFC MDIs will work for the people who matter most--the patients. 
The resolution states the FDA shall issue a proposed rule no later than May 1, 1999. Although I would like to see the process move more quickly, I believe this is ample time for the FDA to take into account patient concerns and needs. The FDA has already been working on this issue for more than 15 months and has heard from thousand of interested individuals and groups. In March 1997, the FDA issued an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking which most parties agree was flawed, particularly in its tentative suggestion of a so-called `therapeutic class' transition from existing drugs to new products. The resolution clearly instructs FDA not to take this approach, but to consider alternatives. For example, one preferable approach would be to require an alternative be available for a particular active moiety before the agency could take a CFC-containing product off the market. 
The resolution recognizes the pharmaceutical industry has made a great deal of progress toward fulfilling the expectation of the Montreal Protocol--that there will be excellent non-CFC MDIs available to patients. Clearly, this is not a situation where we will be taking good medications from the market and leaving a void. Nothing could be further from the truth, but it's important for us not to send a signal to manufacturers who are doing the right thing in developing alternatives that we do not see the urgency of beginning this transition. The resolution my good friends from Arkansas and Ohio propose corrects that mis-impression and I thank them for clarifying it. 
The resolution expresses the expectation that the FDA, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, will assess the impacts on the environment and patient health of a transition to CFC-free products. In doing this, the FDA must consult in the process with the many parties interested in this issue, which is as it should be. The information the FDA receives and develops from these discussions should be reflected in its proposed rule, along with information the agency has already received in the form of comments on its ANPR. I believe the intention of this resolution is clear--the FDA should continue this important dialogue after the proposed rule is issued. In this way, we can be assured a fair and balanced rule will emerge and move us away from the use of CFCs in a way which protects patients health and safety. 
In short, this resolution urges the FDA to get on with the business at hand--namely, publish a proposed rule which lays out a framework for the transition from CFC to non-CFC MDIs by no later than May 1, 1999. This framework should be developed in consultation with patients, care givers and others to ensure continued patient health and safety. The urgency of this action is dictated by the need to allow patients and care givers time to consider the ramifications of the transition and prepare for it. 
I want to thank the gentlemen from Arkansas and Ohio again for their leadership on this issue and their willingness to accommodate our concerns.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, first, I want to take a couple of minutes, Mr. President, to compliment my colleague from Kansas on what he is doing in talking about this marriage penalty and advocating more tax relief for American families. He has done a great job. I agree with him wholeheartedly, because when you look at the marriage penalty, bottom line, this is an unfair tax that has been imposed on something like 21 million couples in this country. It penalizes them for actually being married rather than encouraging and supporting the institution of marriage. We have a Tax Code that actually penalizes couples if they get married. 
A couple of months back, President Clinton was asked a question about the marriage penalty. I believe he admitted that it was unfair. Then he was asked, `Why don't we get rid of it?' The bottom line is that Government somehow cannot get along without this money. It is $29.1 billion a year, I believe. The Government can't get along without that money. Somehow families can get along without it, but the Government can't. Nobody calls up the families and says: If we have this unfair tax, are you able to get along without the money? Nobody calls the families. They just have to do more with less, or get along without it. The bottom line is that, in our Tax Code, somehow our Government is willing to collect taxes unfairly. I agree with the Senator from Kansas that families can make much better use of this money, as we have been advocating for so long, in reducing the taxes. I strongly support his efforts today in talking about the elimination of the marriage tax penalty. I just wanted to support him on that.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as the Senate continues its work on the spending bills for the next fiscal year, I rise today to speak about an issue that threatens the financial future of this nation: a disaster-in-the-making that jeopardizes our ability to fund any of the important discretionary spending programs we now debate, such as education or medical research. I rise to speak about the coming crisis of the Social Security program. 
In my last remarks on this subject before this Chamber, I discussed the history of the Social Security program. Specifically, I talked about how hastily Congress passed the Social Security Act, how poorly the program was designed, and how fallacious its finance mechanism was. A Social Security crisis was inevitable--and arrived in the late 1970's, when the program began running a deficit and Congress raised taxes to shore it up. President Carter claimed Social Security would remain solvent for another 50 years. Just five years later, Social Security was facing another near-term insolvency. That time, after again raising taxes, Congress claimed the system would remain viable for 75 years. 
Yet, here we are again. 
Mr. President, as with the previous two crises, the coming retirement crisis is real. All the socioeconomic data suggest it is approaching. Both the government and private sectors are projecting the future insolvency of the Social Security program. 
However, unlike the last two crises, the coming crisis will have a profound and devastating impact on our national economy, our society, and our culture unmatched by any we have faced since the founding of this Nation. 
Despite all the evidence to the contrary, some Washington politicians continue to sing the `don't worry, be happy' refrain. Social Security is not in crisis, they say--it is not broken and will not go bankrupt. All it needs are a `few minor adjustments' to fix its problems. 
Therefore, many of our constituents have only heard the good news and the happy talk: that Congress has balanced the budget for the first time in nearly 30 years and that the Congressional Budget Office projects surpluses growing to $140 billion within a decade. All of this good news is complemented by the fact that the Social Security Trust Fund boasts an asset balance that tops $600 billion and is expected to run surpluses for the next 13 years. And so the Social Security Administration passionately contends that Social Security benefits will always be there for everyone. 
Insisting that the Social Security crisis is not real--that we are in better financial shape today than ever before--is like telling the captain of the Titanic the waters are clear, with no threat of icebergs, and the ship should proceed full speed ahead. 
That is `The Big Lie,' Mr. President, and if we fall for that rhetoric, there is nothing but icebergs ahead for Social Security. For starters, the Social Security program's $20 trillion in unfunded liabilities have created an economic time bomb that threatens to shatter our economy. In addition, the declining rate of return of Social Security contributions means the system will be unable to meet the expectations of future retirees, who seek in retirement the same financial security they enjoyed in the workplace. 
Beginning in 2008, 74 million baby-boomers will become eligible for retirement and the system will begin to collapse. From that point on, we will have more retirees than ever before, and fewer workers paying into the system. And as medical advances continue to extend life expectancy, future retirees will be receiving benefits longer than was ever anticipated when the program was created. 
The problem begins with the fact that the current Social Security system is a `pay-as-you-go' entitlement program. The money a worker pays in today is used to support today's retirees--the government does not hold it for an individual worker until he or she retires--meaning there is no reserve waiting for future retirees. 
To put it real simply, there is no account in Washington, DC with anybody's name on it that has one dollar for your retirement. Not one dollar in Washington has been set aside. They rely on the workers today to collect the money from them to pay those on retirement today. When the program was originally conceived in 1935, this did not pose a threat. Back then, the average life expectancy for Americans had not yet reached age 65 and there were many more workers paying into the system than were taking out. 
To put this into perspective, before the `baby boom' generation was born, there were 100 workers for every retiree. But as these same baby boomers begin to retire, the funding support is projected to eventually drop to merely two workers per retiree--100 for every retiree 50 years ago and 2 workers for every retiree at the beginning of the next century. Furthermore, these future retirees are expected to live to more than 75 years of age. We have gone from a program where the average worker died before ever receiving their benefits, to a situation where retirees are living years after they have received all their contributions back from the program. In fact, the Congressional Research Service estimates today's average Social Security recipient receives back his or her lifetime contributions within the first three to five years of retirement. 
By the way, Mr. President, if we ran our households the way the government operates Social Security, we would never be allowed to finance a house, we could never send our kids to college with the help of a student loan, we could not even get a car loan; in fact, we could not function in the real world at all. If we ran our companies on a pay-as-you-go basis, there is a good possibility we would have been tossed in jail long ago. 
When there are fewer workers to support each retiree, it is obvious something has to give. When Congress attempted to address projected shortfalls in the past, the government's response meant either reduced benefits for retirees, higher payroll taxes on workers, or some combination of the two. 
For workers, that has amounted to 51 tax increases on income or income adjustments in just the last 25 to 30 years; 51 times the government has raised Social Security taxes, or adjusted the income on which those taxes were levied. So it comes as no surprise that similar proposals are finding their way into our debate again today. 
Unfortunately, this comes at a time when retirees are growing increasingly dependent upon Social Security benefits as their main source of income. This is in spite of the fact that Congress never intended Social Security to become a replacement for personal savings. Social Security was to be a supplement, not the major source of an individual's retirement dollars. According to a report by the Congressional Budget Office, though, workers have come to expect that, upon retirement, Social Security will provide them with income to replace a significant portion of their previous earnings. As proof of that, in 1996, Social Security made up approximately 40 percent of the cash income of the elderly. And as the number of workers covered by pensions continues to decrease and tax rates continue to complicate the ability of workers to save for their future and ensure their retirement security, dependency will surely grow. 
The Social Security Trust Fund's unfunded liability makes the long-term budgetary impact of America's changing demographics even more significant. 
The government's own data shows that the Trust Funds will begin to have cash shortfalls in less than 12 years. Beginning in 2010, Social Security will have to pay about $1 billion more than it will collect in taxes. 
There will be no surpluses in the Social Security fund. In the year 2015, that number will climb to $90 billion of deficits. 
In 2035, it will reach $1 trillion and in 2075, the annual shortfall will explode to a staggering $7.5 trillion per year. Even after being adjusted for inflation, the total unfunded liability is still staggering--at $20 trillion. 
On paper, the Trust Fund boasts more than $600 billion in assets. `On paper' is the key, however. For years, Congress has regularly raided the Trust Fund to pay for additional federal programs--a practice that continues unabated today. Unfortunately, as the baby-boomers begin to retire, the government IOUs will become due. 
Washington will either have to cut government spending, raise taxes, or borrow from the public to redeem those IOUs. Obviously, being unwilling--or unable--to control its own spending, Washington routinely chooses the latter two options. And so beginning by 2013, or maybe even earlier, taxpayers will be asked, yet again, to pay up as the IOUs are cashed in to fund retiree benefits. I agree with the majority of my Minnesota constituents that the government has no business raiding the Social Security Trust Fund to pay for its pet spending projects. The taxpayers have every right to be outraged that such a blatant abuse of the system is allowed to continue. 
All these factors lead to the conclusion that the Social Security Trust Fund will go broke by 2032 if we continue on our present course. If the economy takes a turn for the worse, or if the demographic assumptions are too optimistic, the Trust Fund could go bankrupt much sooner. And once the cash shortfalls begin, they quickly climb to staggering levels. 
Washington's fiscal mismanagement means it not only raises taxes, it also must borrow more from the public to cover the shortfall. Without a policy change, the CBO estimates the debt held by the public will balloon to nearly $80 trillion in 2050--from under $6 trillion today to $80 trillion in 2050. According to the General Accounting Office, the estimates are much worse. They say, it could top $158 trillion in debt and consuming nearly 200 percent of our national income. A national debt at this level would shatter our economy, and shatter our children's hopes of obtaining the American dream. 
Mr. President, we often hear those individuals who want to maintain the status quo argue that by increasing the payroll tax by `just' 2.2 percent--going from 12.4 to 14.6 percent--we can somehow fix the problem for another 75 years, but that is absolutely false. 
Based upon the Trustee's Report, the present value of the unfunded promise of future benefits totals more than $5 trillion--this is how much money we would have to collect and invest today to pay for the future retirees. To collect this much money, the federal government would be forced to impose a tax rate in excess of 100 percent on every American. This, of course, is assuming such funds would not be spent elsewhere in the interim and replaced with more IOUs, as we have done in the past. 
The Concord Coalition projects that, from now to 2040, the cost of Social Security will rise from 11 to 18 percent of workers' taxable income. Add in Medicare and Medicaid and the taxes on these three programs take 40 percent off our paychecks--not even counting our Federal or State or local taxes; just those three programs: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, would be a 40 percent tax on your income. 
With federal, state, and local income taxes and other taxes, the tax burden will become too high for anyone to bear. These high tax rates will erase all growth in real after-tax worker earnings over the next half-century. When this occurs, the economy will be destroyed and a tax revolt from younger workers will certainly follow. 
Mr. President, the only good news is that these problems are down the road and not already upon us. Of course, it would be easier to put off these difficult decisions by waiting until the crisis has actually arrived before we begin repairing the damage. As members of Congress, however, it is our responsibility to address the situation now, before we pass this financial nightmare onto our children and grandchildren. That is why I am speaking on this issue today. 
Experts tell us that delaying action would require we take even more drastic measures in the future. Not only would such delays be costly, they would leave Americans with less time to prepare themselves for any adjustments to the program. When we consider that Social Security taxes consume approximately one-eighth of an average worker's lifetime income, there is a significant amount of money at stake for every individual. And that could grow, as we said, to one-fifth of all the money that an individual makes. 
While Congress cannot change future demographics or merely replace the IOUs it has left sitting in the Social Security Trust Fund, it does hold the power to offer retirement security to all Americans by improving the way the Social Security System will operate in the future. I firmly believe it can be done without breaking the government's covenant with current retirees or leaving those about to enter the program in fiscal limbo. But it will take an innovative approach that breaks from Social Security's `government-knows-best' roots. 
We must look to the ingenuity and competitive spirit of the private sector to improve and rejuvenate the program if we are to give future retirees any promise of retirement benefits. 
I have often heard today's workers lament they do not think Social Security will be there for them. Forty-six percent of all young people believe in UFOs, says a study by Third Millennium, while just 28 percent think they will ever see a Social Security check. So more kids believe in UFO's than Social Security. Still, it is not too late to change that course and prevent the coming Social Security crisis. 
As the national debate goes forward, Congress has the ability to empower workers with the tools to control their own future. If we can learn from our past mistakes and own up to the financial nightmare waiting down the road, we can transform Social Security from a program that threatens financial ruin to one that holds the promise of improved retirement security for generations to come. 
We have much work to do and no time to waste, so I urge my colleagues to join me as we begin the transformation.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, yesterday, as we were debating the best way to help our farmers overcome low prices in the Upper Midwest, the Minority Leader appropriately called the IMF `the single best tool available to provide economic stability in Asia, Russia and around the world.' Unfortunately, he then went on to blame Republicans for opposition to IMF replenishment. 
As one who joined many of my Republican colleagues here in the Senate to actively promote the IMF replenishment and pass the full $18 billion here as part of the Supplemental, I would take issue with that statement. It was the Republican leadership in the Senate who worked with the Administration to pass the $18 billion along with a balanced reform package designed to make the IMF work more effectively. 
Yes, I have been disappointed that the House has still not acted on this matter. However, just yesterday, $3.4 billion was reported out of the Appropriations Committee's Foreign Operations Subcommittee, and there are positive statements that the full $18 billion may be included in the final Foreign Ops bill reported out of the full Committee next week. That was welcome news to those of us who strongly believe the IMF can play a positive role in addressing financial crises all over the world and restore important markets for US products. Now that new loans have been negotiated for Russia, the IMF's reserves are close to depletion. For the first time in many years, it has had to tap into its emergency fund. While I would have preferred the replenishment had been dealt with months ago, the logjam appears to have been broken. 
Of course, there is one complicating factor. The funds are attached to the Foreign Operations bill--the appropriations bill that has been stymied by an inability of the House and the White House to work out the Mexico City abortion language which is annually attached to this appropriations bill. 
While some may prefer not to have to fight controversial battles on appropriations bills, this is an issue that will not just go away. The sponsor is committed to bringing it up until it can be resolved to his satisfaction. Last year, a revised version, a substantial compromise, was attached to the State Department Reauthorization Conference Report and held up that report because of the veto threat of the President. That effort included a reorganization plan supported by the Administration that had been pursued for several years. 
That is still being held up, and the IMF funding will likely be held up as well until the Mexico City issue is settled. The latest Mexico City compromise was a good attempt at solving this dispute. If the President really wants the IMF replenishment, he should exercise the needed leadership to work out the Mexico City language with the House as soon as possible. My colleagues in the minority can do more to help us achieve the replenishment by urging the President to pursue a resolution of Mexico City before any other alternative. I ask the Minority Leader for this assistance. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I will also keep my statement very short. 
Mr. President, I also strongly support Senator Lugar's amendment to include the Enhancement of Trade, Security and Human Rights through Sanctions Reform Act to the agriculture appropriations. Consistent with our commitment yesterday to help American farmers, I believe this is the appropriate time to consider this important amendment that will help us think about the consequences of unilateral sanctions before they are imposed, either by the Congress or by the President. 
As you have heard, this amendment does not prohibit the Congress or the administration from imposing Unilateral sanctions, but it forces us to think before we act. It is easy to look like we are combatting various problems such as human rights abuses, religious persecution, nuclear proliferation, child labor, etcetera, by imposing unilateral sanctions. But it is not so easy to determine the negative effect they will have. It is my opinion that unilateral sanctions do not work. They do not force countries to adopt our policies, or our standards. Therefore, they wind up doing nothing but hurting our American farmers and workers who lose export opportunities to the affected nations. 
Senator Lugar's amendment, which I have also cosponsored in its bill form, establishes procedures by which we can analyze the impact of the sanctions--first, whether they----

Mr. GRAMS. Just to briefly finish my statement today, I believe the Lugar amendment will help to establish procedures by which we can analyze the impact of these sanctions. That is first by whether they 
will accomplish the intended purpose, and second, the impact they have on U.S. international competitiveness and other foreign policy goals. 
This amendment is also flexible. The President can waive the provisions of this amendment in an emergency, and the amendment does not affect existing sanctions. It also does not apply to multilateral sanctions. 
I urge my colleagues to take a look at this, to support this amendment which will help us determine whether a particular unilateral sanction will work or whether we should pursue the problem in another way. If unilateral sanctions are imposed, we need to ensure they will work and they are initiated only as a last resort, and only after multilateral sanctions are pursued. 
Again, I thank Senator Lugar for his leadership on this important issue. For those of us concerned about the growing trend toward unilateral sanctions without analyzing whether they will work or how they will affect our farmers and workers, I think this is a no-brainer. This is an amendment that should have no opposition from this body. 
I yield the floor.

I rise this evening to strongly support the amendment by Senators Dodd, Warner, Roberts, Hagel, and myself, which would exclude food and medicine sales from existing trade sanctions. 
As one who has growing concern about the use of unilateral sanctions to accomplish various foreign policy and other goals, I am very pleased tonight that we are considering this very important measure. Food and medicine should not be used as a weapon in our disputes with leaders of other countries. As we have seen repeatedly, and as we have heard repeatedly on the floor of the Senate here tonight, withholding food and medicine does nothing but hurt the people whom we are trying to help in these countries. 
The leaders, such as Fidel Castro, are always going to have access to these necessities. They are going to get the food, the shelter, the medicine, the care that they need. But inclusion of food and medicine in embargoes or in sanctions only makes the choices fewer for the residents of those countries and the prices higher for the average citizen. 
I simply do not believe that anyone in this body can tell me this is a prudent policy in any country of the world. As just referred to here a few moments ago, somehow we are blaming the U.S. Senate or the United States for the problems in countries such as Cuba. We do not blame the United States for the bad economy. We know that that is Cuba's problem. That is Fidel Castro's making and his problem. But we are here tonight trying only to address the needs of the peoples of those countries and do it in a very humanitarian way, and not to use food and medicine as a weapon in our foreign policy arsenal. 
It was also said by the Senator from Florida just a few moments ago--he said that we should have held hearings on a bill like this, that we should not be writing this kind of an amendment on the floor of the U.S. Senate tonight. 
But I think he knows very well that Senator Dodd and I, for many weeks, tried to schedule hearings. I am the subcommittee chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction in the Banking Committee over this bill. We requested numerous times--we held meetings with opponents of this legislation trying to get a time when we could hold the hearing to bring out the concerns and to help write legislation and bring it out to the floor of the Senate. 
Those who are opponents of this bill are not only opposed to it tonight, but they have been opposed to it and would not allow us--now, I do not know how often that happens, but the opportunity to even hold a hearing was blocked. There have been many, many, many other attempts and meetings to try to hold a hearing on this very bill, this very amendment, and to try to work out the differences that we might have. 
But for those who will say that food and medicine can still be donated as well under these embargoes, I respond by stating that the licensing process that donators have to go through is so time-consuming and it is so cumbersome that it simply is a process that does not work. What has resulted is fewer donations. Improving the distribution system is not going to work as well. We need the certainty of free market sales, unencumbered by Government regulations or dictation and direction. 
Certainly, we do not need the Congress to be involved in implementing food and medicine distribution in any countries, as has been suggested here in the past. We need to help our farmers and medical supply companies preserve their excellent reputations globally. Why earn them the reputation again of being an unreliable supplier by continuing to include them in our sanctions? American farmers are still suffering from the effects of the Russian grain embargo from the late 1970s. As we heard, they got the reputation of being unreliable suppliers. And it hurt the farm economy for many, many years following that. 
You have heard the statistic often in the past few days--over 60 sanctions have been imposed by this Congress and by this administration. They are based on the laws that we have passed. They target some 70 countries, and the numbers affect from one-third to two-thirds of the world's population. It is no wonder that our agricultural producers and most of the business community have united to oppose these unilateral sanctions. Why would other countries consider us reliable suppliers in the future if we continue to have this kind of a record, to hurt ourselves, to hurt our economy, to hurt our jobs, and not to accomplish the goals we have? 
If these sanctions, or these unilateral sanctions, could produce the very type of reforms that we were asking or that we thought should be made, I think everybody in this Senate would line up behind it and vote for it tonight. But over 30 years we have seen that these types of sanctions and embargoes just do not work. All they do is have the exact opposite effect of hurting our farmers, our businesses, our jobs, our economy, and they also do not provide the type of health and humanitarian relief to the people of these countries suffering under these types of regimes. 
Why would other countries consider us reliable suppliers in the future if we continue this kind of record? Right now we have pending, just pending, 26 unilateral sanctions--unilateral, just the United States, nobody else coming into this. When we talk about the Iraq sanctions and how we have lifted and allowed them to sell oil to meet some of their needs with food and medicine, that was a world community effort that put pressure to allow this to happen. We cannot get our allies to support this type of sanctions or embargo. The world community doesn't support it. Many in the Senate do not support it. 
There are 11 other bills that could target an unlimited number of countries, as well. One is the pending religious persecution sanctions bill which alone targets over another 100 countries. 
Now, in my judgment, sanctions will only accomplish their intended goal if they are applied, again, multilaterally. Anything short of that is bound to fail. The only result, then, again, is that our farmers, our workers, are going to suffer, not the leaders. Fidel Castro is not going to suffer. Fidel Castro is not going to move out of that office one day sooner because of these sanctions. In fact, he has probably stayed in office much too long because of this type of action. 
This is an important amendment which follows the commitment that we made yesterday, and that is to try to help our farmers and other businesses expand markets abroad. I urge my colleagues to strongly support it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Agriculture Appropriations bill, which includes essential funding to support our American farmers, the most competitive farmers in the world. 
It is imperative that the Agriculture Appropriations be passed out of the Senate quickly, as our farmers will be forced to pay dearly for any delays. The bill includes vital funding for scab research. This is an essential project to counter what has become a major threat to wheat and barley farmers. The bill includes many other important bio-genetic projects as well. Long-term basic research is fundamental and must remain a priority. 
This bill also continues the crucial tools to help our farmers promote their commodities at home and throughout the world. The bill funds the Foreign Agricultural Service, which is a necessary component in successfully identifying and reaching foreign markets. The Service coordinates the formulation of trade policies and programs with the goal of enhancing world markets for U.S. agricultural products. 
Included are the CCC Export Credit Guarantee Program; the PL-480; the Export Enhancement Program; the Market Access Program, and others. The bill also includes full funding of the Federal Crop Insurance program, the major risk management tool to come out of Freedom to Farm. 
Today we will debate several amendments that are being touted as a remedy to the current farm crisis that some states in the Upper Midwest, including Minnesota, are currently facing. 
I do not want to downplay the problems faced by Northern Minnesota farmers. Farmers are hurting, but we must look for the best ways to help them promote long-term solutions rather than take a costly political approach. 
There are multiple factors which have contributed to and exacerbated the current circumstances facing many of our Upper Midwest farmers. They include the Asian financial crisis, plant diseases, and surpluses accompanied by low commodity prices. The combined effect has been enough to put some farmers out of business, despite the fact that the Market Transition Payments in the FAIR Act have provided our producers with a much greater safety net than the deficiency payments they would have received under the old program. 
The current crisis cries out for an immediate answer--a quick-fix. Scrap the intent of the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act, some of my colleagues are suggesting, and go back to the old-style, government-directed farm policy we fought so hard to change. 
Surely it is heart-wrenching to watch our neighbors lose their livelihoods, but is the approach of the Minority amendments the right one? Will it help farmers in the long run? I do not think so. These proposals will not alleviate the problems. That much should be obvious. These are serious problems and require serious legislative proposals What the situation demands is more deliberate, long-range attention. 
Furthermore, these proposals like a serious misdiagnosis exacerbate the problem, not only for farming generations to come but for the very farmers they would supposedly serve. 
One amendment would be to extend the loan rates in order to allow farmers the discretion of waiting for higher prices. Sadly, this looks like a sure-fire method to lower commodity prices even further. Extending the loan for an additional six months would give a farmer incentive to hold onto the remainder of last year's crop, while at the same time pulling in a new harvest--most likely a very large harvest. The effects are obvious--an increased amount of grain on the market, which pushes prices down. 
There are other costs to this approach. Grain storage and transportation issues continue to play a role in the overall problem. Extending the loan rate will only make matters worse in that farmers who hold onto their grain longer must have a place to store it, taking up more space in the elevators. There must also be enough rail cars to ship it. This also drives prices down. 
Another ill-fated proposal would raise the cap on government market loan rates. Again, we must beware of proposals--like extending the loan rates--that would influence the market in such a way as to create market distortions. That is just what this proposal would do. It would create more commodity than the market could stand without devaluing it. If loan caps are lifted, it tends to encourage a rational farmer to withhold grain from the market, leading to more government-owned grain. This also drives prices down. 
Yet another proposal would authorize $500 million in payments to farmers who have suffered repeated crop failures. But we decided to avoid these types of measures in favor of the Federal Crop Insurance Program, and similar risk management measures included in the Freedom to Farm Act. And certainly $500 million spread over a number of hard-hit states is not going to be enough to make a real difference for farmers, even over the short-term. The better alternative is to continue to improve the FCIP. 
It is not difficult to put these band-aid proposals into perspective. What is hard is the fact that they are being billed as steps that would immediately help individuals who have supposedly been hurt by Freedom to Farm, giving them false hope for relief--a magic elixir for suffering farmers that won't work. With the benefits of Freedom to Farm we agreed to accept the kind of market cycles other industries suffer. When the cycle turns down, we must look at the best way to reverse the downward cycle through sound government policies. We must continue our efforts to seek new markets for our agriculture products, and to seek alternative uses for them as well. We can replenish the IMF, pass Fast Track negotiating authority, pursue unfair trade practices, and continue MFN for China. We can oppose unilateral sanctions. 
As Chairman of the International Finance Subcommittee of the Banking Committee, I worked with Senator Hagel to pass the replenishment of the IMF in the Senate. I regret it is still held up on the House side. Without this kind of multilateral assistance, we cannot provide the assistance needed to address the kind of crises we face in Asia, Russia and many other areas. I urge the Administration to work out the differences we have surrounding this issue in the House so we can continue this kind of crucial assistance. 
Fast Track negotiating authority is necessary to pursue new trade agreements with other nations that will improve access for agriculture and other products. While the Administration indicated it would pursue this authority this year, that appears to no longer be a priority this year. Yet, this authority would open markets to relieve some of the commodity pricing pressure in the Upper Midwest. I have joined Senator Hagel and others today in requesting Senator Lott to bring up Fast Track this year as one of our top priorities. 
Continuing MFN for China is another top priority of mine as well as the agricultural community. China is a major market for the United States, now, and even more in the future. Those who want to hold agriculture hostage to solving many unrelated problems in China are very shortsighted. Not only do we risk United States exports in the short term, but the long term as well as the United States earns the reputation of an unreliable supplier. Engagement through trade and contact with the Chinese leaders and people is what gains us progress on human rights, religious persecution and other issues--not cutting off those relations. 
Mr. President, I was pleased we passed the Farmer Relief Act last week to exclude agriculture products from India-Pakistan sanctions. We should have gone further to provide waiver authority and exclude all the economic sanctions, but that battle will be fought another day. It is clear to me that agriculture sales should not be included in any sanction, and I will continue to support efforts to eliminate agriculture from current sanctions as well as to prevent our farmers from being targeted in these largely political battles. Farmers still painfully recall the Russian grain embargo and other unilateral sanctions that continue to shut off important markets. Cutting off agriculture sales only hurts the people of the targeted country--not the government we aim to punish. 
I am a co-sponsor of the Dodd bill to remove agriculture sales from current Cuba unilateral sanctions. The same arguments we make against other agriculture sanctions apply here as well. It is time to make this humanitarian, important change in the embargo. 
I also am a co-sponsor of the Africa trade bill which I believe will help our farmers in the long term as we work to expand trade opportunities in that continent. 
All of these current and pending sanctions--61 current and many pending--cry out for passage of the Lugar Sanctions Reform Bill, which I have co-sponsored. This will ensure that not only will we have a sound basis to ensure that sanctions will have their desired effect before we pass them, but also that they do not impose a higher cost to our economy than we can bear. This legislation should be noncontroversial, and it should be passed immediately. 
Mr. President, I am convinced that pursuing trade policies that open markets, not close them, will go a very long way in bringing higher prices to farmers in my state and others. I challenge my colleagues who have supported legislation to close markets abroad to take a closer look at what they are doing and support American agriculture on these important issues. 
Mr. President, in passing Freedom to Farm, Congress recognized that agriculture policy in this country must emphasize business acumen and individual freedom--the principles that have made our economy sound today. And we must provide the means necessary to realize the potential of such a plan. The Agriculture Appropriations bill continues to provide the means. I urge my colleagues to stay the course and resist the short-sighted, politically motivated, market-distortion mechanisms that the Minority amendments would offer. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2271--the Property Rights Implementation Act of 1998. 
As a landowner, businessman, and Senator, I have long been concerned that the imposition of too many regulations adversely impact individuals and businesses. For too long, bureaucrats have exercised broad authority over local citizens and oftentimes trampled on their constitutional rights. It is time to bring even more comprehensive protections of property rights to the Senate floor for debate and a vote, and S. 2271 provides those missing or abused protections. 
I am proud to say that I joined many of my colleagues last year in co-sponsoring S. 1204, Senator Coverdell's Property Owners Access to Justice Act of 1997. That bipartisan legislation--very similar to that which we are debating today--simplified access to the federal courts for private property owners whose rights may have been deprived by government actions. 
As we all know, the fifth amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides our nation's citizens with certain protections against the taking of their property. In cases where a taking is required, the Constitution ensures that the property owner is provided just compensation. Unfortunately, that is almost never the case and I doubt anyone in this chamber would claim the contrary. In the name of the `public good,' governments often either take property or deem it unusable for virtually any productive purposes. Too often, property owners are then left with a worthless piece of land for which there is no use or little resale value. 
Property owners are then forced to navigate their way through a maze of bureaucratic red tape and unending local and state roadblocks in fighting any unjust action. They are forced to exhaust any and all state or local remedies prior to having their claim heard in federal court. Because most property owners do not have the resources or the time to fight a taxpayer-subsidized army of lawyers and hurdles, they merely give up--unafforded their constitutional rights. 
I am aware that the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and a whole host of State Attorneys General are opposed to S. 2271--but why? Because S. 2271 may actually force them to consider the rights of property owners before taking action. If the property in question is truly needed for the public good, then they should use eminent domain and acquire the property rather than leaving the owner holding the bag. 
It is important to remember several points regarding S. 2271. First, S. 2271 does not circumvent local governments. Property owners must attempt to work through local procedures and be denied at least twice prior to seeking federal court action. S. 2271 does not preempt local zoning. Any use of the land by the property owner must be consistent with local zoning requirements--if not, S. 2271 does not apply. Additionally, S. 2271 does not require compensation or remove the burden to proof from the property owner in proving harm or the justification for compensation. 
Similar legislation--authorzied by Congressman Gallegly--was introduced in the House last year. It quickly gathered the support of 237 co-sponsors and passed the House last October by a vote of 248 to 178. Likewise, S. 1204 was introduced in the Senate last September with Senators Landrieu and Dorgan as cosponsors. Both bills received significant bi-partisan support upon introduction and throughout the legislative process. 
Mr. President, it is time we provide property owners with certainty. It is time we provide property owners with avenues for action. And it is time we provide property owners with the rights guaranteed them under our Constitution. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the cloture petition for S. 2271.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to say `thank you' to a most diverse collection of government employees, unified by many factors but most of all, a commitment to service. Thank you for the professionalism that you display which has allowed us to come to expect value, reliability, and uniformity from one of the world's largest businesses. 
Who are these employees? They're truck drivers, engineers, janitors, accountants, detectives, customer service personnel, and letter carriers. They're United States Postal Employees. 
The United States Postal Service is a business with an unusual pedigree, even though we commonly recognize the `post office' as a traditional government entity. Yet while its origins can be traced to the origins of our country, the Postal Service as we know it today is only 27 years old. USPS went through an extensive revamping in the late 1960s and early 70s. The Post Office Department was removed from the President's Cabinet and converted into a non-profit government corporation. The result was an effective elimination of politicians from the management of postal affairs. 
Congress passed the Postal Reorganization Act which created the new United States Postal Service on July 1, 1971. This month, we recognize an organization able to modernize, while maintaining the fundamental unifying factors required of such a massive global organization. 
USPS has a unique set of privileges and responsibilities which serve to ensure uniform service and stable prices for mail delivery throughout the United States. The Chair of the USPS Board of Governors announced in late June that there would be no postal rate increase for 1998. The next rate increase will take effect January 10, 1999. At that time the price of a First-Class letter will increase by one penny, to 33 cents. 
USPS last increased rates on January 1, 1995. When the new rates take effect next year, it will be the second straight rate adjustment below inflation, in effect cutting the real cost of a First-Class stamp by seven percent since 1995. That makes the cost of a First-Class letter among the lowest in the industrialized world--a feat managed without taxpayer subsidies. In Japan, the cost of a First-Class letter is $.57, in Great Britain it is $.42 and in Germany it is $.62. 
Yet the success of USPS in its ability to reorganize, modernize, and compete in a global marketplace is due to each individual postal employee, because that's what comprises successful business operations--great employees.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the `Collections of Information Antipiracy Act.' This legislation is similar to H.R. 2652, legislation already passed unanimously by our colleagues in the House of Representatives on May 19 of this year that is currently pending before the Judiciary Committee. 
My legislation presents a much-needed Federal, legislative protection for databases. It is a fair and balanced bill that recognizes the need for database owners to receive adequate legal protection that provides them the incentives necessary to continue investing in database production. 
The bill also acknowledges that users must continue to have access to timely and innovative database products and services. 
America produces and uses some 65 percent of the world's databases. 
Our database industry spans an enormous range of products and services--from collection of information about antidotes to poisons, to valuable collections of business and financial data, to databases of medical procedures and practice guidelines used to assure reliable and effective patient care. 
These companies have been pioneers in offering innovative and easily accessible databases in any number of formats that meet consumer needs. 
The myriad of databases produced in the United States are used by the business community, researchers, educators, government officials, and citizens to gain knowledge and make decisions that affect every aspect of our lives. 
Yet, despite technological innovations, creating and offering databases in the marketplace is neither cheap nor easy. 
Not only must database owners expend substantial resources on the collection of data, they must also maintain and distribute these information products, while continually updating them and responding to the demands of their customers. 
Many American jobs depend on a healthy, vibrant U.S. database industry. These companies employ thousands of editors, researchers, and others. They invest millions of dollars in hardware and software to manage these large masses of information. 
Despite the enormous value of these databases to our economy and society, American database owners are under a dual threat. 
On the one hand, after a 1991 Supreme Court decision, it is increasingly unclear whether most databases are adequately protected from piracy by U.S. copyright law. 
Lower courts since 1991 have handed down several decisions that have diminished the number and types of databases that are protected under the compilation copyright provisions in the 1976 Copyright Act. 
In addition, these decisions have stated that even if databases as a whole may qualify for this limited copyright protection, the facts contained in them are freely available for the taking and re-use by others--including competing database producers --without authorization or compensation. 
Although database producers do have means other than a new Federal law to seek protection, none has proven adequate, as is evidenced in the study completed by the U.S. Copyright Office last August. 
Contract law, for example, binds only the parties to the contract and in any case varies from State to State and it also varies from country to country. 
Technological protections are beginning to appear and are slowly being implemented in the online world, but they offer no protection to databases that are produced in other formats. 
Some States have adopted doctrines of misappropriation; however, these legal protections are far from being uniform and offer no solace to database producers in States where such legal safeguards are not in place. 
The European Union has begun implementing a new directive protecting databases in their own countries, but only those produced in the European Union or in countries that offer comparable protections. This law clearly is designed to disadvantage database owners not located in an EU country. 
Great Britain, Germany, Spain, and most Scandinavian nations have already made changes in their own laws to implement the EU directive, and also a European official recently predicted that within a few years, as many as 35 of our trading partners in Europe and the Russian Federation will have similar laws in place. 
Unless the United States passes a law that is comparable to that now governing Europe, more and more American database owners may feel the need to move some or all of their operations overseas in an effort, to thwart potential piracy of their products and services by unscrupulous competitors or vendors. 
As I mentioned previously, Mr. President, American database producers are anxious to continue producing valuable databases for worldwide use. However, the technologies present in today's world that allow for easy copying and redistribution of information threaten a producer's ability to continue receiving a fair return on the tremendous investments required to produce quality databases. 
Coupled with the inadequacy of U.S. law to protect investment in databases and the threat posed by the EU directive, it is clear to me that Congress--and more importantly, the Senate--must act quickly if we are to preserve the American lead in database production and use. 
The `Collections of Information Antipiracy Act' offers a solution to the threats faced by American database owners by helping to provide the right to stop harmful practices that affect the marketplace for that database. 
This legislation uses Congress' powers under the Commerce clause of the Constitution to protect only those databases used in commerce. 
Protection is limited to those databases whose owners have invested substantial monetary or other resources in gathering, organizing, or maintaining a collection of information. 
It contains a definition of what constitutes a protected collection that is broad enough to offer effective protection to the wide range of products and services that would benefit from a new Federal law. 
This legislation also contains numerous and important exceptions to the protections granted. For example, it makes clear that databases may be used for legitimate purposes of verification and news reporting. It offers special exceptions to nonprofit users, such as researchers, scientists, and educators. 
The bill also states clearly that no one is precluded from gathering the same facts contained on one database owner's product and creating another database--but again, as long as those facts are not stolen from the original database owner. Finally, the bill recognizes the importance of unfettered public access to Government databases by specifically denying protection to any database created by a governmental entity--whether Federal, State, or local--or any database that a Government agency seeks to have created and distributed under an exclusive licensing arrangement. Mr. President, the concepts that lie behind the Collections of Information Antipiracy Act, and many of its specific provisions, have been debated for more than 2 years now. The House-passed bill now before the Senate Judiciary Committee was the subject of two hearings that included witnesses from nearly every affected community--both producers and users of databases. Indeed, the bill I introduce today is a much-improved version of the legislation first introduced in the House, and many provisions have been added that strike a fair balance between the needs of database producers for adequate protection and the also requirements that users have fair access to these private-sector products and services. There should be no fear that database producers will exert extraordinary control over their products and services. But, this legislation contains not only a special savings clause preserving our antitrust laws, but it also specifies low penalties against any nonprofit user who may run afoul of this new law. In closing, Mr. President, I am convinced it is time for this body to act to protect the interests of database owners and users in the United States. The bill I am introducing today represents a reasonable and fair means of doing so, and I urge my colleagues to join with me in working during these few remaining days of the 105th Congress to consider and pass this very important piece of legislation.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the City of Anoka Police Department on its selection as a semifinalist in the 1998 Innovations in American Government Awards competition. 
As my colleagues may know, Innovations in American Government is considered one of the most prestigious public-service awards granted each year in the United States. This awards program is sponsored by the Ford Foundation, and administered by Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in partnership with the Council for Excellence in Government. 
Since 1986, Innovation awards have been given to those programs and policies that represent effective and innovative government initiatives. This year, the City of Anoka Police Department Juvenile Justice Alternative Police Accountability Conferencing Program has been selected as a semifinalist from among 1,400 applications submitted by federal, state, county, and city and town organizations. Later this year, the number of semifinalists will be narrowed to 25 finalists, ten of which will receive awards for $100,000 from the Ford Foundation. The remaining 15 finalists will each receive $20,000. 
At a time when juvenile crime is on the rise in my home state of Minnesota and across the country, I am pleased that the Anoka Police Department has been recognized for its unique and effective efforts to address this important public safety issue in our communities. Initiatives such as those implemented by the Anoka Police Department will help to ensure that the young first-time offenders of today do not become the career criminals of tomorrow. 
Through the leadership of Police Chief Andrew Revering, the Anoka Police Department developed a program in 1994 to address the challenge of rising juvenile crime and the increasing rate of repeat juvenile offenders. The Juvenile Justice Alternative Police Accountability Conferencing Program allows for specially trained police officers to facilitate and supervise meetings between first time offenders, so the offender can be held accountable for his or her actions such as minor theft, vandalism, assault or disorderly conduct. 
Under this program, the offender is required to admit guilt to the police, and with parental consent, he or she takes part in a police accountability conference. The Police Accountability Conferencing Program ensures victims of crime, offenders, and communities a right to participate in the process of determining how to address the consequences which result from criminal behavior. 
Through interaction with police and victims, offenders develop a greater understanding of the effect their actions have on a victim and his or her family. More importantly, this program has demonstrated a proven record of success since only a small number of those who have entered the Anoka Police Accountability Conferencing Program have become repeat offenders. 
The Anoka Police Department's success with this program has led many agencies in Minnesota and throughout the country to begin implementing similar programs. To its credit, Anoka Police have also educated and trained officers from Arizona, Colorado, California, Iowa, Indiana, Minnesota and North Carolina about the police conferencing program. Clearly, the City of Anoka and its Police Department have demonstrated exceptional leadership in fulfilling a local government's primary responsibility: to protect citizens from crime and its debilitating effect on communities. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to have shared the success of this innovative program with my colleagues in the Senate. I look forward to visiting this program in the future, and learning more about similar initiatives in Minnesota that will help to prevent crime and keep our citizens safe.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on July 1st, concerned Americans will gather in Cranston, Rhode Island, for the second in what will be a series of public meetings called the `Great Social Security Debate.' 
I want to thank the Concord Coalition, the American Association of Retired Persons, and Americans Discuss Social Security for sponsoring this event. 
The first forum, which took place last April 7th in Kansas City, Missouri, was a great success. The discussions in Rhode Island will no doubt be equally compelling, especially given the focus of the debate: `Retirement in the 21st Century.' 
It is with one eye to the 21st Century that I rise today to speak about Social Security's past--to offer some perspective on its history and what we can learn from our attempts at social policy making. 
In recent years, as more and more Americans become aware of its looming financial and demographic crisis, Social Security is no longer the `third rail' of American politics. 
Both Democrats and Republicans have offered reform plans, including ones that would set up individual retirement accounts--a suddenly mainstream idea that would have been considered heresy just a couple of years ago. 
Long before President Clinton's `Save Social Security' State of the Union address, a national dialogue was already underway. 
Summits, conferences, forums, and town hall meetings were organized to allow all Americans, old and young, to discuss Social Security and how to reform it to benefit our nation and make retirement more secure for current and future generations. 
This democratic process will help us build a national consensus and eventually find workable solutions to preserve and strengthen Social Security while providing freedom of choice for all Americans. 
As we move forward, it is important to remember that history is a mirror--by looking through it we gain perspective and the wisdom it provides, giving us the opportunity to avoid repeating mistakes. Nobel Laureate Friedrich Hayek says:  
Political opinion and views about historical events ever have been and always must be closely connected. Past experience is the foundation on which our beliefs about the desirability of different policies and institutions are mainly based. . . 
Yet we can hardly profit from past experience unless the facts from which we draw our conclusions are correct. 
A review of its history will provide a better understanding of the origin and evolution of our Social Security system. It will facilitate the national debate on its reform and point us in the right direction. 
For a time I would like to travel back in time. For hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, human society relied on families, relatives, or friends to care for their elders. 
For the unfortunate individuals who could not support themselves, or did not have families to support them, the community provided assistance, in many cases through what were called the `poor laws.' 
The first compulsory social insurance programs on a national scale, including the programs that we call `Social Security" today, were established in Germany under Bismarck during the 1880s. Soon after, Austria and Hungary followed Germany by passing similar legislation. 
England adopted national compulsory social insurance in 1911 and greatly expanded it in 1948. After 1920, social insurance on a compulsory basis was rapidly adopted throughout Europe and into the American hemisphere. 
The United States did not have a national social insurance program until 1935. 
Today, more than 140 countries in the world have one form or another of a social security program. 
Unfortunately, a recent World Bank study shows that most of these programs are not sustainable in their present form. I will discuss this issue on another occasion. 
It has been said that the industrial and agricultural revolution that began in the late 18th Century triggered social reform that shifted elderly-care from individuals and families to the state. 
But empirical evidence is insufficient to support this statement, particularly in the case of the United States. 
Prior to 1929, the economic condition of the elderly in America was fairly secure: most owned their own homes and lived off labor income, which was supplemented by emerging private pension plans as well as life insurance, savings, and family support. 
The intellectual origin of social insurance, or as we call it, Social Security, comes in effect from an obscure group of scholars known as the German historical school of economics. 
Driven by their dislike of laissez-faire capitalism and fear for a Marxist-led revolution, a group of German-government employed professors desperately sought a middle ground to make peace with Marxists. 
They pushed for large-scale welfare legislation that could, in their view, ease the social tension, keep social order and justice, and avoid proletariat revolutions. 
One of the leading figures was Gustav Schmoller. Schmoller was sympathetic to the industrial proletariat, and hated what he called the `unethical' striving for wealth by the property-owning classes. 
He believed that the lower classes had a right to derive benefits from increased production through welfare legislation. He argued that unequal distribution of income was evil, and that government, not the individual or the community, had the moral duty to help the proletariat maintain equity and social harmony. 
In the early 1870s, Schmoller set up the Congress for Social Reform. The purpose was to draft, propose, and promote social legislation. Later, he and others created the Association of Socialpolitics as a forum to advocate social reform. 
As a result of his effort, the Bismarck government passed the first welfare laws in 1883 and old age insurance laws in 1889 in Germany. 
Very few in this country have ever heard about the German Historical School of Economics, but it was this small group of intellectual elite had a tremendous impact on American economic thought as well as public policy making. 
As thousands of young Americans went to Germany to study in the late 19th century and early this century, many became disciples of the German Historical School of Economics and were indoctrinated by German welfare capitalism. 
The American students were urged by their German teachers to influence the course of politics in the U.S. and change American attitudes towards social legislation. 
Now, these German-trained and educated economists--Adams, Clark, Patten, Seligman, and Ely--founded the American Economic Association in 1885. That is the American counterpart of the German Association of Socialpolitics. 
Edwin Gay, one of Schmoller's students, was a founder of the National Bureau of Economic Research and created the journal, Foreign Affairs. 
Recford Tugwell, a well-known American disciple of the German Historical School of Economics, favored social legislation along the lines of the German welfare economists. Tugwell become influential under President Roosevelt in the 1930s and exerted considerable legislative influence under the New Deal. 
Richard Ely, another important disciple of the German Historical School, established the American Association for Labor Legislation, later named the American Association for Old-age Security. That launched the first American social insurance movement. He was even put on trial by Wisconsin's superintendent of public instruction for propagating socialism in Wisconsin schools in 1894. Ely and John Commons succeeded in passing the old-age insurance legislation in Wisconsin in 1925. That was among the first in this country. 
Later, the Wisconsin model was used in drafting the federal Social Security legislation. 
Now, despite their enthusiasm for social legislation, these German-trained intellectuals were initially not successful in achieving their goals in America. 
Before 1929, there were no significant, broad-based demands for compulsory, federal old-age insurance. In most states, elderly assistance was locally provided and administered through poor laws. 
Private charity and town/county-controlled almshouses were the primary sources for elderly assistance. In 1929, the New York Commission on Old-Age Security found that 90 percent of the elderly population were either self-supporting or were being supported by their families and relatives. 
Less than four percent depended on private charity or public assistance. Private pensions existed although they were not widespread in America before the era of the Great Depression. 
During the Great Depression, when the stock market plunged 80 percent, 15 percent of the population began receiving some form of public relief. This event gave tremendous momentum to social legislation. 
On June 8, 1934, President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced his intention to provide a program for Social Security. 
Subsequently, FDR created the Committee on Economic Security, which was chaired by Frances Perkins, Secretary of Labor, with four other members of the cabinet. 
The committee was instructed to study the entire problem of economic insecurity and to make recommendations that would serve as the basis for legislation consideration by the Congress. 
A number of university professors were called to staff the CES. According to the recollections of Professor Douglas Brown, a staff member in the small, old-age security section of the CES, the major attention of the CES and its staff was focused on unemployment insurance, not old age insurance. 
FDR, Perkins, and the CES director clearly had doubts about a national old-age system. On a number of occasions it appeared unlikely that the Committee would approve the old-age insurance system. 
Because it was on the back burner, the old-age security section had a very small staff and was left alone to work out a plan at its will. 
Basically, two individuals, Barbara Armstrong of the University of California and Douglas Brown of Princeton, who pushed old-age insurance in the CES. The two actually drafted the U.S. Social Security plan in only a month. 
Their compulsory old-age insurance plan raised serious concerns about its constitutionality within the CES. 
Even President Roosevelt, Labor Secretary Perkins, who was also the chairman of the CES, and Edwin Witte, the Executive Director of the CES, did not think this was the right time for a Social Security system. 
But the intellectual elite within the CES pushed on. In November, 1934, Armstrong asked her friend, Max Stern, who was in the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain to launch a sharply written editorial criticizing Roosevelt's failure to give his wholehearted support to old-age insurance. 
Roosevelt finally caved. From then on, old-age insurance moved to the front burner at the CES. 
The original proposals for the old-age insurance program drafted by the CES staff allowed the states or private insurance companies to administer the program. 
But this was removed in later drafts. Douglas Brown later admitted that the CES staff deliberately exaggerated the difficulties of establishing separate state old-age insurance systems as an alternative to a federal system. 
It is generally believed that the Great Depression made Social Security necessary for the American people. 
The CES argued that the Great Depression had greatly exacerbated the plight of the elderly, that the elderly were among the first to lose their jobs, and that the effects of the Depression would be felt for a long time to come since many families had seen their lifetime savings wiped out. 
However, the Social Security proposal submitted to Congress fell far short of dealing with this. The Social Security system started to collect payroll taxes in 1937 but no benefits were distributed until 1942. It took more than seven years for this elderly relief measure to be effective--long after the Great Depression ended. 
More recent studies have suggested the Depressions may not have dictated the establishment of a Social Security system. 
For example, economists now believe that by examining the welfare of the elderly outside the family context, reformers such as those staffing the CES drew an exaggerated picture of the elderly's plight. 
The 1935-36 data shows that per-capita household income peaked at $627 for persons aged 60 to 64, while for people aged 65 and over, average per-capita income was only slightly lower, at $601. 
In any event, the CES made its report to the President in early January 1935, and on January 17, the President introduced the report in both Houses of Congress for simultaneous consideration. 
In less than seven months following its introduction, Congress passed and the President signed the Social Security Act into law. 
The history of Congress' debates and consideration of this legislation is of particular interest. 
When drafting the compulsory old-age legislation, the CES felt that the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, which had jurisdiction over the issue, might not be sympathetic toward FDR's plan, so they created a special committee that would be headed by the labor committees' chairmen. 
Without showing much interest in the substance of social security, the tax committees were concerned nonetheless with who should have jurisdiction over it. 
When it appeared he might be bypassed, Ways and Means Chairman Robert Doughton of North Carolina went to see FDR, whereupon the President told Frances Perkins that bypassing the Ways and Means Committee would never do. 
He did not want to alienate Doughton and his Senate counterpart, Pat Harrison. Without especially liking the old-age insurance program, both committee chairmen stood loyally by it, perhaps in return for having been left in charge. 
Instead of being put into a new committee, the chairmen of these committees, the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means, did not want to feel that they were being bypassed, so they pledged their loyalty in order to keep jurisdiction in their committees over these plans. 
Once the Economic Security bill was introduced, both chambers began hearings immediately, and it took less than a month for the committees to complete its work on the bill. Nearly 100 people testified--but most of them were either government officials or friends of the CES. The general public and opponents of the bill, particularly employer groups, were not well represented. Again, according to CES Director Edwin Witte, the employer groups `simply knew too little to take any active role.' So did the public. 
In other words, the employers and the public knew too little, so they only invited certain people to testify before their committees in support of the new Social Security program. 
The Economic Security Legislation contained many titles. In an `all-or-none' strategy, FDR smartly tied old-age insurance with the old-age assistance program. 
If not for the needed program to aid the elderly poor, the old-age insurance would have never gone through the Congress, according Edwin Witte. 
Nevertheless, there was no shortage of opposition to the bill in the House. 
In fact, the old-age insurance title was nearly stricken from the bill in the House Ways and Means Committee and again on the House floor, where an amendment to strike the program mustered a third of the votes cast. 
Congressman Allen Treadway, the ranking Republican member of the House Ways and Means Committee, called old-age insurance the `worst title in the bill. . . a burdensome tax on industry.' 
Congressman Daniel Reed pointed out that neither old-age insurance nor unemployment compensation were `relief provisions and they are not going to bring any relief to the destitute or needy now nor for many years to come.' 
When the Senate began debate on the legislation, the old-age insurance program became even more controversial. Many senators from both sides of the aisle seriously questioned how un-Americaness this compulsory old-age insurance plan was. So there were a lot of questions and concerns at that time in Congress over these proposals. 
Some worried about the extremely high cost of the program and the heavy tax burden it would impose on the American people. 
Some doubted the finance mechanism, and predicted the funding could not be sustained. 
Some pointed out how unwise it was to have the federal government, instead of states and private companies, run the plan. 
Some were concerned that, as an emergency measure to respond to the difficult days of the Great Depression, the plan would turn into a permanent program over which the Congress had no control. 
Some criticized the discriminative nature of the legislation against the young and higher-wage earners. Some questioned the morality of the current generation passing the burden to future generations. 
Unfortunately, many of their prophecies have become reality today. 
The major battle on the Economic Security Legislation was fought over the Clark amendment. 
Senator Bennett Clark, a Democrat from Missouri, recognized the income-redistribution and non-competitive nature of the old-age insurance program and decided to amend it by allowing companies with private pensions to opt out of the public program. 
Any employer could stay out of the Social Security program if they had a pension plan that offered benefits comparable to the federal program. Workers would be given the freedom to choose either the federal Social Security program or a private pension plan offered by their companies. 
Clark argued that if the purpose of the old-age insurance program was to provide pensions based on earnings and contributions, not to redistribute income, the private sector was perfectly capable of performing this function. Unearned benefits, not competition, were the source of the problem. 
The proponents of the Economic Security Bill feared that if the Clark amendment passed, it would encourage private competition and put the federal-run program at a disadvantage. 
That is the market at work. Again, those who were proponents of the Social Security plan did not like the Clark amendment because they thought it would encourage private competition and it would put the Federal run program at a disadvantage. 
Competition would eventually undermine and destroy the Social Security program, they argued. 
The Clark amendment was narrowly defeated in the Senate Finance Committee by a tied vote, but was adopted on the Senate floor by a wide margin of 51 to 35. Considering FDR's veto threat and the two-to-one ratio of Democrats/Republicans in the Senate, this was indeed a very significant vote. 
Subsequently, the Senate passed the Economic Security bill, including the Clark amendment, by a vote of 77-6. However, the amendment became a sticking point once the bill reached conference. 
House conferees strongly opposed the amendment on the grounds that it would ruin the federal program, but Senate conferees refused to concede on this matter. 
The conference dragged on for weeks. At the end, FDR ordered the Senate Democrat conferees to agree to the House position, and because many conferees feared that the much-needed old-age assistance might be delayed by the Clark amendment, they agreed to drop the amendment. 
The concession was that the Administration promised to further study the idea of contracting out of Social Security. 
There would be a special joint legislative committee to work on legislation based on the Clark amendment and submit it to Congress for consideration during the next session. With that understanding, the Congress approved the conference report. 
FDR signed it into law on August 14, 1935. The promised special committee and the Clark legislation, of course, never happened. 
In her book, `The Roosevelt I Knew', Frances Perkins recorded an interesting conversation she had with Senator Al Gore, Sr., of Tennessee: 
`I remember that when I appeared before the Senate Committee old Senator Gore raised a sarcastic objection. `Isn't this Socialism?'  
`My reply was, `Oh, no.' 
Then, smiling, leaning forward and talking to me as though I were a child, he said, `Isn't this a teeny-weeny bit of Socialism?' 
Despite her denial, Senator Gore may have made a point. Professor Theresa McMahon, a member of the Social Security Council, put it more bluntly by saying at that time: ` I don't mind taxing the bachelors. . .I think they ought to take on the responsibility of sharing their income with somebody else.' 
On January 31, 1940, the Social Security system started to distribute the payroll taxes the government had collected in the past three years to those who never paid any tax into the system. The first monthly retirement check was issued to Ida May Fuller of Ludlow, Vermont, in the amount of $22.54. Miss Fuller died in January of 1975 at the age of 100. During her 35 years as a beneficiary, she received over $20,000 in benefits and paid in nothing. 
In the 60 years following its creation, and despite continued criticism, the Social Security program has grown dramatically in size and scope. As more beneficiaries and programs are added, the payroll tax has been raised 51 times. 
Congress 51 different times has gone back either to raise the tax on Social Security, or to expand the income on which that was to be taxed. 
As an example, in 1940, an American worker earning the maximum taxable wage paid $70 in payroll tax. That is $675 in inflation-adjusted dollars. Today, that same worker would pay a Social Security payroll tax of $8,481. 
So the maximum in 1940 in today's dollars would have been $675. The maximum today is nearly $8,500. 
Meanwhile, the number of workers per retiree has dropped from 100 in 1942 to two today, and the unfunded liabilities of the program have become unbearable for future generations. 
Since the enactment of the 1935 Social Security Act, many changes have taken place to expand the program. 
Major changes include the 1939 amendment, which was initiated by Social Security officials and greatly expanded the program. It required the payment of benefits to the spouse and minor children of a retired worker, and survivor benefits to the family in the event of the premature death of a covered worker. 
It also increased benefit amounts and accelerated the start of monthly benefit payments from 1942 to 1940. The 1939 amendment officially set up the pay-as-you-go scheme which uses today's tax to pay today's benefits, leaving unfunded liabilities to future generations. 
A 1950 amendment accelerated the benefits schedules and extended Social Security coverage to the self-employed. In 1952, all Social Security beneficiaries received a general `cost-of-living' increase. 
The Social Security Amendments of 1954 expanded the old-age insurance to a disability insurance program. 
Another major change was made in 1956. 
The 1956 amendment expanded Social Security coverage to more classes of workers, increased the wage base substantially, and increased benefits by 77 percent. 
In 1965, Medicare, a new social insurance program that extended health coverage to retirees, was added to the Social Security system. In the 1970s, another new program, Supplemental Security Income, was added. 
The 1950s and 1960s were the golden age for Social Security because the fund revenue was greatly increased by growing employment and rising wage rates. Social Security officials repeatedly assured the Congress that Social Security would maintain long-term actuarial balances. 
Ronald Reagan saw the defects of the system and was the first to suggest investing Social Security funds in the market. As early as 1964, Reagan asked: `Can we introduce voluntary features that would permit a citizen to do better on his own, to be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made provisions for the non-earning years?' 
Reagan's advice was cast aside. But in 1975, Social Security first began running larger long-term deficits. Its expenditures exceeded income by $1.5 billion. The pay-as-you-go finance mechanism started cracking and was unable to produce large windfall gains to retirees. 
In 1977 and 1983, Congress had no choice but to pass Social Security rescue packages by significantly increasing taxes. Again Washington claimed the fix would make Social Security solvent for at least 75 years. Again, that was a lie. 
Today, Social Security faces the severest crisis yet. When 74 million baby boomers begin retiring in 2008, Social Security will run a cash shortage in 2013 and go broke in 2031, according to official projections. Knowing the `reliability' of these official forecasts, the shortage could arrive much earlier. 
Without a policy change, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the debt held by the public will balloon to nearly $80 trillion, 
from today about $5.6 trillion in debt. But without a policy change, beginning with Social Security, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the debt held by the public could balloon to as much as $80 trillion. And General Accounting Office estimates that it could be even worse. The General Accounting Office says it could be a $158 trillion debt. This is very, very serious. 
Mr. President, that covers the history of Social Security. Now, what can we learn from our past policy making experiences? 
First, the Social Security system was put together in just a few weeks without thorough debate and time to consider such a major policy change. 
It was imposed on the American people following a time of economic crisis and despair by a few individuals who had a personal agenda of redistributing private income. 
At the time it passed, few people understood the long-term impact of the program on the citizens. It was hardly a democratic process. 
Second, a retirement program that mixes insurance with welfare does not work, because these two functions are fundamentally incompatible. 
As a result, we have a bad welfare plan and a bad old-age insurance plan which make the system much more inefficient for those who need welfare assistance as well as those who need retirement security. 
It does not work because it is based on the false assumption that people no longer have to work to achieve the American dream--the government will take care of them. 
Third, when we consider Social Security, policy--not politics--should be our guide. Changes made for short term gain will come back to haunt us. 
Fourth, the federal government does not have a good record of running social insurance programs. We should look for ways to improve and streamline the program. 
Fifth, we should begin to look to the ingenuity and competitive spirit of the private sector to improve and rejuvenate the program. 
The American people should have some freedom of choice. Each individual has different abilities and different needs at different times; they should be free to choose either the current compulsory insurance plan or their own individual retirement accounts. 
The individual retirement account is not a new idea. A majority in Congress supported this idea 60 years ago. Sixty years ago the Clark amendment, the individual retirement account, was supported by the vast majority in Congress--60 years ago. Had we adopted the Clark amendment then, our Social Security system would be in much better shape today. 
And it is not too late, because Congress should take Senator Clark's advice by allowing people to opt out of the Social Security system and giving individual workers the right to fund and control the investment of their own retirement accounts. 
With today's mature and well-regulated financial markets, every American, rich or poor, can greatly improve their retirement security. We must provide the options to ensure that Americans can provide for their retirement, not just pass an increasing liability on to their children and grandchildren. If we don't make this change, we are going to pass to our children a national debt somewhere between $80- and $160 trillion. We need to pass on the ability for our children and grandchildren to make those decisions for themselves. 
Finally, we need to educate and inform the public about Social Security. We should encourage more people to participate in the policymaking process. We need to encourage them to understand how options can actually help them enjoy their retirement. A well-informed general public will not be deceived by political rhetoric and will be able to decide what is the best option for them. They can make that decision best for themselves. 
So, Mr. President, with the perspective offered by the past, I urge my colleagues to join me in the months to come in my efforts to improve retirement security for all Americans. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Mortgage Litigation Reform Act of 1998. This legislation is a narrowly crafted, bipartisan bill. Its goal is to provide relief from frivolous class action lawsuits resulting from the regulatory ambiguity over the payment of certain fees by mortgage bankers to mortgage brokers. 
A spate of recent class action lawsuits have called into question the legality of yield spread premiums, although there is no statute or regulation ruling that such fees are per se illegal. This legislation simply places a moratorium, from the date of enactment through July 1, 1999, on class action lawsuits regarding these fees. It is important to note that the bill is narrowly crafted and does not prohibit personal rights of action or criminal prosecution related to these payments. 
During the moratorium period, I am hopeful that either the Department of Housing and Urban Development will publish a clear ruling governing the payment of yield spread premiums or, better yet, Congress will achieve the long sought after overhaul of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and Truth In Lending Act (TILA).

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, my amendment will accomplish two important goals. It will provide the Naval Air Reserve with new facilities to better meet its training needs and will facilitate the development of the Minneapolis/St. Paul International Airport to serve all Minnesotans. 
This amendment authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to convey or lease a parcel of property which includes the current Naval Air Reserve Center to the Minnesota Airports Commission. In return, the Minnesota Airports Commission will assume the costs of designing and constructing facilities that the Secretary of the Navy considers appropriate for the Naval Air Reserve as well as any reasonable relocation expenses. 
Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Navy, the Minnesota Airports Commission, and the Federal Aviation Administration support this amendment. This is a win-win proposition for the Navy and the traveling public.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill. Having just celebrated Flag Day, June 14, the symbol of our great country is vividly in mind. In close conjunction with that symbol of freedom, is our freedom guarded by those who serve in our Military Services who have been willing to give their lives for our country. 
It seems fitting to show our honor and respect to those who have valiantly and fearlessly carried the banner of our flag into battle. Each one of these battle-ready patriots should carry a memento of their military service home with them--to remind them of our gratitude and their great achievement in keeping the country free. My amendment would present a U.S. flag to each active duty person who has served our country. I know that former Senator Robert Dole has supported this effort as well. 
All components of the Military Services, the active duty, the National Guard and the Reserves of the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines, who have completed honorable tours of duty will be eligible for this gift from a grateful nation. 
It seems appropriate that an American flag be presented to those honorably discharged while they are still with us, not just to spread over their caskets as they depart this world. This living symbol will do much to re-invigorate and re-dedicated the whole nation to our reason for being--freedom and liberty for all.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this amendment will extend the authorization of the authorities under the Defense Production Act for one year through September 30, 1999. 
This matter is under the jurisdiction of the Senate Banking Committee, on which I serve as the Subcommittee on International Finance Chairman which handles this issue. Chairman D'Amato and Ranking Member Sarbanes of the Banking Committee, as well as Ranking Member of the International Finance Subcommittee, Senator Moseley-Braun, all have agreed to support this one-year extension as an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill to facilitate this matter in a year when floor time is becoming scarce. 
The Defense Production Act (DPA) is the primary authority for executive branch activities to ensure the timely availability of resources for national defense and civil emergency preparedness and response. It was first enacted in 1950 to mobilize the nation's productive capacity during the Korean War and ensures the availability of critical materials needed both for national defense and for catastrophic civil disasters. It allows criminal sanctions to prevent hoarding of critical materials. The DPA also authorizes the President to use financial incentives to encourage contractors to establish or expand industrial capacity for defense needs. 
The `Exon-Florio' language which authorizes the President to prohibit foreign investment if such investment threatens national security is also included in this Act. 
While DPA's primary function is to ensure resources are available in times of war, the DPA, as administered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also provides assistance during natural disasters. For instance, FEMA used the DPA to procure resources needed during the 1997 flood disaster in my own State of Minnesota. 
The Administration had requested some minor changes in the DPA. However, because committee and floor time is scarce this year, they agreed to a one-year extension. It is the goal of the Banking Committee to consider these changes, and a longer term reauthorization, next year. 
Mr. President, I thank the floor leaders for agreeing to facilitate this amendment as part of the DOD bill.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few brief remarks about tax cuts and the budget, and the promises that have so tightly entwined the two. 
The House passed its budget resolution last Friday by a vote of 216 to 204. The House budget plan would cut $101 billion in government spending over the next 5 years. It would also repeal the marriage penalty tax, which has unjustly punished 21 million couples just for getting married. 
However, the House-passed budget plan failed to provide reconciliation instructions for achieving this tax relief, and failed to provide clear guidance on how to use any budget surpluses. 
While the efforts by our colleagues in the House represent a move in the right direction, Congress must do better by the taxpayers. It now falls to the conference committee to ensure we keep our promise to offer meaningful tax relief to working Americans. 
That promise must provide the framework for the budget resolution produced by this Congress. 
Thanks to the exceptionally healthy economy, our short-term fiscal condition has greatly improved in the past few years, not because of what Congress did--in spite of what Congress did. But it is the economy. 
In fact, we will soon see a unified budget surplus for the first time since 1969. 
On May 26, President Clinton announced that this year's budget surplus would be $39 billion. 
His figure is significantly less than the $43-to-$63 billion surplus forecast by the CBO and contradicts the President's own Treasury report, which revealed that through April, revenues were surging into the Treasury even faster than CBO thought. 
Treasury officials forecast that the surplus could be as large as $100 billion if the revenue flow follows last year's pattern. According to some estimates, the budget surplus could reach $1.34 trillion over the next 5 years. 
The question is, what do we do with the surplus? Basically, what Washington has done is overcharged our American workers and industry. 
I would just like to show in the Washington Post, yesterday's edition, June 9, it says: Virginia Power Agrees To Rebates. 
Why is this similar? I would like to read this. It says: 
Virginia's largest power company agreed today to $920 million in refunds and rate cuts for 2 million residential and business customers who have been overcharged for electricity, the biggest rate adjustment in State history [and that is under a] deal with utility regulators. 
If a company overcharges its consumers, the Government steps in and says: You have to pay it back. You took a surplus. You have to pay it back to the customers. Also, you have to drop the rates so we do not have surpluses in the future. 
But what does Washington do when it has a surplus? It starts to make plans on how to spend it. There is nobody that tells Washington you have to give it back, and they should. 
Comparing these numbers with the $100 billion tax cut, when we talk about a projected budget surplus, there could be as much as $1.3 trillion or more; or if we even look at just this surplus, it would be less than 10 percent of that projected surplus. I can assure you, there are plans already being made around this Congress of what to do and how to spend the other 90 percent. 
Americans, I believe, should be outraged, and a growing number are. They do not want Washington to grow even bigger--they want their money back. 
Mr. President, regardless of all these different surplus estimates, one thing is clear: it is not any action by the Federal Government that is producing this budget surplus. We must credit that turnaround to the working men and women who are fueling the robust American economy. These unexpected dollars have come directly from working Americans through taxes paid by corporations, individuals, and investors. This money belongs to the people. Washington should not stand first in line to take this money. It is only moral and fair to return it to them. Washington again, has no right to spend it on their behalf. 
With total taxation at an all-time high, it is critical that Congress cut taxes for working Americans. Taxes consumed about 19 percent of GDP when President Clinton took office. It now stands at 21.5 percent, the highest rate since World War II. This means every American, not just the rich, are paying more in taxes today than they did just 5 years ago. 
As proof of just how heavy the tax burden has become, taxpayers did not mark the arrival of Tax Freedom Day this year until May 10. 
That is the day on which working folks stop punching the clock just to pay Uncle Sam and begin working for themselves, and that is a full week later than when President Clinton took office. We all gave the Government another week of our time and money in the last 5 years to pay those higher taxes. This year, the taxpayers had to work 129 days before they could count a single penny of their salary as their own. In fact, it marks the latest-ever arrival of Tax Freedom Day. 
And that is not the whole picture, because if the cost of complying with the tax system itself were included in the calculations, Tax Freedom Day would be pushed forward another 13 days. 
As proof of just how far we have traveled--in the wrong direction--Tax Freedom Day in 1925 arrived on February 6. This year it was May 10. 
After 16 major tax increases over the past 30 years, the need for tax relief has never been more pressing. 
Do I need to remind my colleagues that Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994 and retained control in 1996 because we were the champions of the taxpayers, the champions of the American workers? 
Did not the taxpayers elect us with the expectation that the new Congress would seize every opportunity to lessen the tax burden on America's families and shrink the size of Government? 
They did not elect a new majority expecting that Congress would be a collaborator in the President's tax-and-spend policies, that Congress would build a bigger, more expensive Government at the first chance it got and completely give up on its promise of significant tax relief. 
Unfortunately, that is exactly what Congress did. And if we do not slow it down now by providing some larger tax cuts, the Federal Government is going to explode in both size and cost. Again, that is not what I believe working Americans are asking for. 
Last year, after spending by the way, the $225 billion unexpected revenue windfall and busting the 1993 spending caps, Congress cut a deal with President Clinton and delivered tax cuts only one-third as large as what we had promised and worked for in 1994. 
The tax relief amounted to less than one cent of every dollar the Federal Government took from the taxpayers. 
With its measly $30 billion in tax cuts over five years, this year's Senate-passed budget resolution is no better. 
It spends more taxpayer dollars while continuing the path of the flawed budget deal struck between the Congressional leadership and President Clinton last year. 
Tax relief I believe is the right solution because it takes power out of the hands of Washington's big spenders and puts it back where it can do the most good and that is with America's families and job providers. 
When the much-bragged about Clinton tax increase of 1993 was passed by the Democrats, again, no Republican votes, but with this much-bragged about tax increase no one was out there asking working Americans how they were going to survive with less money in their paychecks. They were evidently going to have to try to do more with less, or go without. Congress did not go out and ask working Americans, if we raise your taxes, how are you going to do with less money? Americans were expected to do more with less or go without. 
But now, when we talk of even taking one penny for every $10, Congress says `We cannot go without.' To borrow a phrase from Ohio Congressman Traficant, `Beam me up, Scotty!' 
I am proud that during this year's budget debate, five Senators, myself included, reached agreement with the Senate leadership to include more tax relief in the budget for hardworking Americans. 
We agreed to take the higher tax relief number in either the House or Senate-passed resolution. We also agreed there should be reconciliation legislation to achieve those tax cuts. 
Carrying out these principles will improve the FY 1999 budget resolution, and it will help to forge a compromise between those who want massive tax relief and those who want massive spending. 
This will eventually help us not only to balance our budget and keep it balanced, but to reduce the size of the government and also let the American taxpayers keep a little more of their own money. With our improved fiscal condition and a large budget surplus, it should not be hard to achieve these goals. 
Then why is tax relief such a battle? 
Mr. President, there is a special interest group to represent every disgruntled, oppressed, and persecuted group of Americans to plead their case in the media and in the Halls of Congress. 
But where is the special interest group that represents the taxpayers? Where is the chorus of voices speaking up for the discontented multitude? Who will come to the Senate floor and plead the case of the taxpayers? 
I submit, Mr. President, that the American taxpayers are poorly represented by their Congress. Not only are the taxpayers heavily burdened, but their burden has been imposed by their own Government. 
Congress takes the taxpayers' precious dollars and spends them lavishly, at times recklessly. Congress demands more and more with little consideration for the sacrifices of those it taxes. Congress never seems to be satisfied. 
So is it any wonder that when the opportunity arises to give something back to the taxpayers, Congress balks? The taxpayers fuel the fire of government spending, and Congress demands that the furnace remain fully stoked. 
These are real people we are talking about, not faceless Social Security numbers. Yet Congress chooses not to see the faces of the families it taxes. 
By a single vote, this Congress can tell working Americans that it is going to take even more, and you can either work more--both spouses, overtime, two jobs--or go without, without money for your children's education, without health care insurance or child care, without a family vacation, without a night out. 
`But wait,' you can just hear Congress say, `maybe we can create a new government program to help you. By the way, we will have to raise your taxes a little to pay for it.' 
Mr. President, my colleagues and I who demanded that tax relief be an integral part of the Senate budget must not and will not back off from our commitments. 
We made those commitments in good faith, not only to each other, but most importantly, to America's taxpayers. Senators Ashcroft, Brownback, Inhofe, Smith, and myself are prepared to vote against any budget that fails to provide the full $101 or more billion in tax relief called for in the House budget resolution. 
We have made our intentions known to the Senate leadership. It is time that this Congress delivers on its promises to the taxpayers. We must not forget the lessons we learned in the past. 
In the 1950s, the Republican Party leadership deviated from the basic principles that distinguish us from the Democrats by adopting a fiscal policy of `Republican austerity.' 
This slowed the economy and therefore, the voters tossed out the Republican Congress and declined to elect a Republican president. The American people instead chose John F. Kennedy, a Democrat who promised tax cuts--and kept that promise. 
President Ronald Reagan also promised tax relief, and he delivered by proposing tax cuts totaling $747 billion. That equals $1.6 trillion in today's dollars. These massive tax cuts propelled the economy forward. President Reagan stood with Republican principles, and today we are still benefiting from his sound economic policy. This was done while the Congress faced deficits, not surpluses that we are enjoying today. 
In 1990, President Bush, unfortunately, reached a budget compromise with the Democrats to spend more and tax more. As a result, the American voters tossed him out for abandoning his promise not to raise taxes. 
Finally, history is a mirror. If we cannot keep our promise to the American people, we will lose a Republican Congress, and more importantly, a unique opportunity to create a sustainable economy, increase real income, and improve the living standard for working Americans. 
Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed and frustrated by the reluctance of the Congress and the congressional leadership to provide substantial tax relief, despite projections of huge surpluses. Nothing I believe, can justify this. 
This Senator intends to stand firm on his promise to work for lower taxes that allow the working men and women of Minnesota and the 49 other states to keep more of their own money. I urge our leadership to follow. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I take a moment today to express my gratitude and offer my congratulations to Susan Carlson, the First Lady of the State of Minnesota. 
Susan Carlson will be honored tonight with a Leadership Award from the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome for her work as the Co-Chair of the Governor's Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Through the efforts of Mrs. Carlson, Minnesota is one of the first states to put in place a comprehensive plan to prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and improve the quality of life for those already affected by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. 
As we all know, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is perhaps the most preventable contributor to our nation's ever-increasing health care costs. Low-birth weights, which lead to health complications for infants, developmental disabilities, and learning disabilities represent the tragic results of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Clearly, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is preventable and we spare a great deal of future pain by educating expectant mothers and their families about the risks associated with alcohol during pregnancy. In its campaign to eliminate Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome combines national and community-based awareness and educational programs with resource and referral clearinghouses. 
Mr. President, again, I congratulate and thank Mrs. Carlson for her efforts. Minnesotans are fortunate to have her leadership on the important issue of preventing Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the National Summit on Retirement Savings which is taking place here in Washington today and tomorrow. I also want to use this occasion to introduce legislation that will empower a greater number of working Americans to save for their retirement through employer-sponsored retirement plans. 
In the course of the next 2 days, the 239 delegates to the National Summit on Retirement Savings will address an issue of great importance as the baby boom generation draws closer to retirement age and the future of Social Security remains uncertain. 
With savings rates at a 59-year low, and the revelation in the 1998 Social Security Trustees Report that Social Security is actuarially bankrupt, it is evident that we face what amounts to a retirement crisis. 
The less individuals save for their retirement, the greater the strain on an ailing Social Security system that is incapable of sustaining the fast-growing retired population. 
Yet studies show that an increasing number of Americans are depending on Social Security for their retirement income. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, Social Security is the primary source of income for 80% of retired Americans, and practically the only source for 40% of retirees. 
Those who depend on Social Security for their retirement can expect a standard of living far lower than the one they enjoyed while in the work force. 
For instance, an individual who has an annual income of $15,000 per year who retires in 1998 at age 65 can expect Social Security to provide only one-half their previous income, and the replacement rate drops steadily when moving up the income bracket. 
Indeed, Social Security was never intended to be the major source of retirement savings that it seems to have become--its purpose was to serve as a single leg in a three-legged stool that would sustain Americans in their retirement years. 
Social Security's original purpose was to provide Americans with the minimal level of income in retirement that when combined with personal savings and employment-based pensions would give retirees the living standard they enjoyed before retirement. 
Mr. President, given these facts about Social Security and the decline in savings among Americans, it is crucial that steps be taken to ensure that the three-legged stool does not collapse under the weight of the growing retired population. 
It is true that recent steps taken by Congress, particularly the 1996 enactment of the SIMPLE retirement plan, have succeed in increasing employee participation in employer-sponsored retirement plans. 
However, the complexity of qualification requirements under current law and the administrative expenses associated with setting up retirement plans, including the SIMPLE plan, remain significant impediments to widespread implementation of these types of employer-based retirement systems. 
This is particularly true for small employers with less than 100 employees, for whom the resulting benefits do not outweigh the administrative costs. Consequently, only 42% of all individuals employed by small businesses now participate in an employer-sponsored plan, as opposed to 78% of those who work for larger businesses. 
To address this problem, I am introducing the Small Employer Nest Egg Act of 1998. 
This legislation will create a new retirement option for small business owners with 100 or fewer employees and it would be similar to the SIMPLE plan and the SMART plan President Clinton proposed in his fiscal year 1999 budget. 
However, my proposal differs somewhat from these two plans in that it would allow the same level of benefits--both to employers and employees--as larger employers who maintain traditional qualified plans. 
Furthermore, upon retirement or separation of service, employees would receive 100% account value. 
To offset the high costs associated with starting a pension plan, at the centerpiece of this proposal is a tax cut equal to 50% of the administrative and retirement education expenses incurred for the first five years of a plan's operation. 
In addition, participating businesses would be exempt from some of the more burdensome administrative requirements associated with qualified plans. 
That exemption would be in exchange for the employers' agreement to provide a minimum benefit of 3% to all employees who satisfy a minimum age requirement of 21 years old and the minimum service requirement of 1,000 hours during the preceding calendar year. 
Mr. President, small businesses are the lifeblood of our communities, providing millions of jobs nationwide. 
This bill I am introducing has been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It has also been endorsed by the National Association of Women Small Business Owners and also of 220 small businesses in Minnesota alone. So it has very strong endorsement from the small business community. 
Small business owners want to help their employees to save for their retirement, yet many are unable to do so as a result of rigid Government policies that seemingly have little regard for the plight of the small employer. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to give small employers the ability they have long sought to help their employees save for their retirement.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Thomas as co-sponsor of S. Res. 240, a resolution which hopefully will focus more Congressional attention on the situation in Laos. With 50,000 Hmong and 7,000 other ethnic Lao living in Minnesota, I am well aware that the atrocities being committed in that country and the lack of progress toward a democratic government are far more serious than press reports would lead us to believe. It is rare indeed that any of us, even those of us who serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ever hear anything about Laos. Yet many Lao and Hmong fought with us in the Vietnam War. In fact, they are still being `punished' for their loyalty to the United States through continued violence against them by the Lao government. But, the State Department recently responded to an inquiry I made by saying they do not see evidence of abuses. 
We owe the Hmong and other Lao a great debt of gratitude for their service during the Vietnam War. We owe them our renewed efforts to end the violence in Laos and to enforce the agreements signed by Communists in Laos in 1962 and 1973 which committed them to a coalition government including the Lao Royal Family. As you may know, this government was overthrown in 1975, and now the country is under sole control of the Lao People's Democratic Party. 
Since there has been so little focus on Laos, Mr. President, there has been little progress there. While the Lao government approved a Constitution in 1990 claiming human rights protection, and while Laos has signed international agreements on civil and political rights and is a member of ASEAN, the record shows these promises are being ignored. 
Several months ago, the United Lao Movement for Democracy of Minnesota hosted a staff briefing. The briefing included a videotape which showed death, violence, and evidence that `yellow rain' has been used against Lao citizens recently--despite comments by the State Department these atrocities do not exist. We were told during the briefing that the `killing fields' are still going on in the countryside, mostly against the Hmong. The leaders of the Minnesota group, Shoua Cha, Xiong Pao Moua, and Cha Vang have been instrumental in calling these atrocities to our attention and maintaining valuable contact with the people of Laos. There were many cries on the tape that war hero General Vang Pao should return to Laos to help stop the violence. 
Mr. President, the Thomas-Grams resolution expresses Senate opposition to human rights abuses in Laos, including religious persecution. It calls for free and fair elections and a process toward democracy.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express some of my concerns dealing with the tobacco tax increase legislation that we are close to considering, including how we deal with this country's tobacco farmers. 
I believe we should do what we can to assist tobacco farmers and their communities' transition for a supposed decrease in demand for tobacco products that will result from this bill's passage. 
However, I would like to share this cartoon by Mr. Ed Fischer which illustrates a very important point: Do we value tobacco farming and tobacco-dependent communities more than other producers and their communities? `Guess which farmers in trouble will get a huge government bailout?' 
I have serious doubts this legislation will actually reduce tobacco growth and consumption in this country as much as proponents claim. As such, I question whether the type of support we are willing to rush in and throw at tobacco producers and tobacco-dependent communities is warranted. 
My understanding is, under both proposals, there is no requirement that tobacco farmers actually stop producing tobacco; they will just have to assume all the risk, like other farmers under the freedom to farm bill which was signed into law in April of 1996. The freedom to farm bill contained transition payments, but those payments pale in comparison to what we are talking about here. All crops combined under the transition to Freedom to Farm--corn, wheat, soybeans, et cetera--amounted to less than $1,500 per acre over 7 years. This bill would amount to about $18,000 per acre over 3 years. Yes, it is a phase-out of the tobacco program, but let us be fair to the farmers, but also let us be fair to the taxpayers. 
Mr. President, I am very sympathetic to the plight of tobacco farmers, their families and their communities, who suffer as a direct result of Federal policy. The tobacco farmers are certainly not alone in facing unfavorable--even crushing--circumstances at the hands of the Congress. 
The point I now propose is that we cannot hope to maintain any semblance of consistency if we favor one agriculture product over all others. Let us not get caught up in the hype of this tobacco legislation today to forge a plan that will cost taxpayers more than necessary. Let us be fair, but let us be reasonable. How can we explain why we favor one product over another? 
My colleagues and I from the Upper Midwest have been fighting a constant battle against Federal dairy policy for years. 
And again just look at this cartoon: `Guess which farmers in trouble will get a huge government bailout * * *' 
The dairy producers of the Upper Midwest have long been disadvantaged by having to bear the burden of unjustifiable dairy policy which does not reflect the realities of modern dairy economics. This current Federal policy--specifically, Class I milk price differentials--is widely recognized as antiquated, unjustifiable, and patently unfair. 
In fact, USDA's current Federal marketing order system was deemed `arbitrary and capricious' by a Federal district court judge late last year. The case brought against USDA has been in the courts for 7 years, and the judge's ruling was no less than the fourth such proceeding in the history of the case. 
The courts have ruled four separate times the Federal dairy program is arbitrary and capricious. Bottom line, it is unfair. And what has been the response of the USDA? Not to accept the decision but to appeal. The Government should not be in the business of picking winners and losers in agriculture, but it is doing so in this case. 
I hate to be arguing the dairy issue during the debate on a tobacco bill today, but I believe it supports my argument that: if we are to go about bailouts in a reasonable manner, we should address the Upper Midwest dairy farmers as well. Would anyone in this Senate vote to pay our dairy farmers $18,000 an acre? I doubt it. 
Dairy farmers have endured inequities for decades. We in Minnesota in fact are losing an average of three dairy farms every single day. The irony is that milk is a health product. It is a product we encourage our children to consume. How can we possibly suggest that Minnesota's dairy industry does not deserve equal protection from this Congress? 
Mr. President, I would also like to express my opposition to S. 1415 in its entirety. 
I have listened to a number of my colleagues come to the floor and claim many things and cite many statistics. One of those statistics was that 75 percent of regular smokers could not quit if they wanted to. While I will not take issue with this figure, I do have a problem with the fact that proponents of this bill are so willing to take advantage of these smokers' inability to quit. 
Let us forget about the figures and rhetoric for a moment and ask the more important question: Why are we persecuting these people because of their addiction? 
If someone is addicted to alcohol, are we going to increase taxes on them? If someone is addicted to drugs, are we going to increase taxes on them? Of course not, because we give them all sorts of Government benefits amounting to thousands of dollars a year. 
So if you are addicted to one type of drug, the Government is going to give you thousands of dollars a year in assistance, but if you are addicted to another type of drug--in this case nicotine--we are going to tax you more money every year. 
Congress wants to tax you, in fact, at a rate of about $1,400 a year. And it simply does not make sense. It does not make sense for us to be discussing this legislation as if it were a tobacco settlement.

Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator for allowing me to finish this statement. 
Just to finish, Mr. President, we are talking about the tobacco bill and addiction. And I just say, let us forget about the figures and rhetoric for a moment that is surrounding this bill and ask the more important question: Why are we 
persecuting these people because of an addiction? 
Now again, if someone is addicted to alcohol, are we going to increase taxes on them? If someone is addicted to drugs, are we going to go out and increases taxes on them? Of course not, because we give them all sorts of Government benefits amounting to thousands of dollars a year if they are addicted to alcohol or other illegal drugs. But if you are addicted to nicotine, Congress wants to tax you as much as $1,400 a year. And I believe it simply does not make sense. 
It also does not make sense for us to be discussing this legislation as if it were a tobacco settlement. This is not a tobacco settlement. It is a tax increase to pay for increased Government spending programs. Supporters of this tax increase assert that if you vote against this bill, you are for big tobacco--if you vote against this bill, you are for big tobacco--if you vote for it, you are compassionate and you are taking a stand for the health of our children. But this isn't really about our children, is it? It is about lining Washington's coffers with more taxpayer dollars. 
Let us talk about the statistic that 3,000 kids start smoking every day. That statistic has been thrown around the floor of the Senate and the White House with complete disregard for the facts. In his editorial, entitled `Child's Ploy,' Jacob Sullum points out--and I quote-- 
This estimate comes from an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in January of 1989. Based on data from a National Health Interview Survey, the authors estimated that one million `young persons' became regular smokers each year during the 1980s [again, that one million `young persons' became regular smokers each year during the 1980s], which amounts to about three thousand a day. 
That figure refers to 20-year-olds. And since the study did not include data for anyone younger than that, somehow these now `young persons' have metamorphosed into kids. At least one commentator on CNBC referred to them as `babies.' 
It started out as people 20 years old, `young persons,' and somehow it got transformed into `kids.' And even one commentator referred to them as `babies.' I think this demonstrates how far the crusaders are willing to go to punish and tax adult smokers in order to fund Washington's wish list for more Government spending. 
There was another point Mr. Sullum made which I think deserves to be voiced on the floor. He wrote: 
While it may be true that the young are especially attracted to smoking, it is probably also true that people who are especially attracted to smoking tend to start young. 
Mr. President, I agree, we should be doing more to reduce and discourage our children from smoking. I do not believe the legislation before us is truly about reducing teen smoking or recovering the Government's cost of providing health care to smokers. It is about money. 
When I ran for the Senate 4 years ago, I made a very simple promise during my campaign. I said I would never vote to increase taxes. The bill before us does just that--increases taxes on those who use tobacco products, who largely are the ones who can least afford a $1,400-a-year tax increase. 
The lion's share of the hundreds of billions of dollars collected under this bill will come from families and individuals who earn $30,000 a year or less. That is simply wrong. 
During debate on this bill, there have been some who have questioned the sincerity of our concern for the well-being of America's working people. They go on and on to say, if we are so concerned about their well-being, we should vote for an increase in the minimum wage later this year. I guess that will be great for the teenagers who, by the way, hold most of the minimum wage jobs in America, because they then will be able to afford the cigarettes on which we are just about to hike the taxes. 
It has been said by proponents that everyone and anyone who votes against this legislation has been bought off by big tobacco and we don't care about our children. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. Frankly, I resent that type of accusation. 
During the Budget Committee's consideration of the budget resolution, I voted for what I thought was the most appropriate use of any tobacco settlement funds--dedicate them to Medicare. After all, isn't that where most of the smoking-related illness costs are? 
There was another important provision from the budget resolution as well. We increased funding for youth smoking cessation programs. The budget assumed $825 million would be spent on trying to prevent teens from smoking and helping those who are trying to quit. The States are increasing their efforts in this regard as well. This is a positive approach and addresses the underlying problems that we face. 
It should be noted that our budget this year more than doubled the amount of money spent on preventing teen smoking than President Clinton had even requested in his budget, and he assumed at that time that there would be a tobacco tax. So we included twice as much in our budget, not assuming that. 
This legislation before the Senate today is not about protecting kids from tobacco. It is not about punishing big tobacco. It is not about health care either. This is just one more way for Washington to take and spend more of the taxpayers' money. 
Mr. President, if and when this legislation is fully phased in, Federal and State Governments will be profiting more by the sale of tobacco products than the manufacturer. Again, Mr. President, if this bill is phased in, State and Federal Governments will be profiting more by the sale of tobacco products than the manufacturer. Something is horribly wrong when tax rates reach that proportion. 
Mr. President, in 1997, a man in Kentucky pleaded guilty to one of the largest cigarette smuggling cases in our Nation's history. Over the period of just 1 year, this individual made nearly $30 million--$30 million transporting contraband cigarettes. 
I learned of this story from the National Association of Police Organizations, which sent me a letter also opposing S. 1415, again, because of the threat of increased black market activity, which is clearly already occurring. Those of us with border States know how prevalent and easy smuggling already is. Will we just shut down our borders, or will we search every person crossing them? 
Other law enforcement organizations have weighed in, 
sharing basically the same concerns about a potential black market: The Fraternal Order of Police, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the International Union of the Police Associations, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. All of these organizations, whose primary duty is to enforce the law of our Nation, recognize this legislation will be the catalyst for a huge black market in cigarettes. As a result, teen smoking will probably increase, not decrease. 
Supporters of this legislation claim we need to increase taxes to get a shock value from it. I want to remind my colleagues of what four very bright teenagers had to say at a House Commerce Committee hearing on youth smoking when asked if price were really a factor in whether teens buy cigarettes. One of the teens said if money were a huge issue, then kids wouldn't be buying marijuana as much. 
I believe this teen has it right and also brings up another important issue. When asked what they believed to be the most pressing problem for our Nation's high schools, all agreed that alcohol and marijuana were much more serious. If the same commitment this administration and this Congress have shown to fighting tobacco had been applied to the drug problem, I think we would be hearing a very different answer. Under this legislation, we will fund massive new Government programs for tobacco but we will remain silent about the drug problem in our Nation. I question whether this is the wisest course for us to take. 
In closing, I cannot in good conscience support the Washington money grab, masquerading here as the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Act. If we were being honest with the American people, the bill would be entitled `the National Tobacco Tax and Spend Act.' It is not about public health or protecting our kids or cutting big tobacco down to size; it is all about taxes, taxes, taxes. This Senator is not going to be bullied into raising taxes on America's hard-working men and women. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this morning on behalf of all those who serve their fellow citizens through their active participation in the Nation's emergency care system to introduce the Emergency Medical Services Act. 
Mr. President, as a Senator who is deeply concerned about the ever-expanding size and scope of the Federal Government, I have long believed Washington is too big, too clumsy and too removed to deal effectively with many of the issues in which it already meddles. 
However, I also believe there's an overriding public health interest in ensuring a viable, seamless, nationwide EMS system. By designating this week as National EMS Week, the Nation recognizes those individual who make the EMS system work. 
There is no more appropriate time to reaffirm our commitment to EMS by addressing some of the problems the system is presented with daily. 
I have been privileged to get to know the men and women who dedicate their talents to serving others in an emergency. We have together discussed problems within the EMS system and concluded there are areas in which the Federal Government can help. 
The original result of our discussions concerning the Federal role in EMS was S. 238, the Emergency Medical Services Act [EMSEA]. When I introduced S. 238 on January 30, 1997, I acknowledged that it wasn't intended to solve all the problems EMS faces; it was merely a first step toward a meaningful national dialog on EMs. Indeed, this first step was a productive one. 
Last summer, I assembled EMS and health care leaders in Minnesota, asked them to take another look at the EMSEA, and report back to me with their thoughts. In January, I received a copy of their report. 
I was extremely pleased with their efforts and have used those suggestions as the basis for the legislative language comprising the new Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act I am introducing today. 
I have often said that Congress has a tendency to wait until there's a crisis before it acts, but Congress cannot wait until there's a crisis in the EMS system before we take steps to improve it. There is simply too much at stake. 
Whether we realize it or not, we depend on and expect the constant readiness of emergency medical services. To ensure that readiness, we need to make efficient and effective efforts to secure the stability of the system. 
This has been my focus in redrafting this legislation. 
There are many similarities between S. 238 and the new bill I am introducing today. 
For instance, we continue to assert that the most important thing we can do to maintain the vitality of the EMS system is to compel the government to reimburse for the services it says it will pay for under Medicare. 
In the meetings I have had with ambulance providers, emergency medical technicians emergency physicians, nurses, and other EMS-related personnel, their most common request is to base reimbursement on a `prudent layperson' standard, rather than the ultimate diagnosis reached in the emergency room. 
While the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 [BBA] contained a provision basing reimbursement for emergency services on the prudent layperson standard, we have yet to see HCFA's interpretation of the provision and whether it will include ambulance services. 
I have written letters to HCFA and Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth indicating my understanding that ambulance services would be considered part of `emergency services' as defined in the BBA. 
I have been given no assurances from HCFA that they intend to include ambulance services as part of the `emergency services' definition in the balanced budget agreement. 
To illustrate how prevalent this problem is, I want to share with you a case my staff worked on relating to Medicare reimbursement for ambulance services. Please keep in mind that this is the fee-for-service Medicare program. 
It was back in 1994 that Andrew Bernecker of Braham, MN, was mowing with a power scythe and tractor when he fell. The rotating blades of the scythe severely cut his upper arm. Mr. Bernecker tried to walk toward his home but was too faint from the blood loss, so he crawled the rest of the way. 
Afraid that his wife, who was 86 years old at the time, would panic--or worse, have a heart attack--he crawled to the pump and washed as much blood and dirt off as he could. His wife saw him and immediately called 911 for an ambulance. 
He was rushed to the hospital where Mr. Bernecker ultimately had orthopedic surgery and spent some time in the intensive care unit. 
In response to the bills submitted to Medicare, the Government sent this reply with respect to the ambulance billing:  
Medicare Regulations Provide that certain conditions must be met in order for ambulance services to be covered. 
Medicare pays for ambulance services only when the use of any other method of transportation would endanger your health. 
The Government denied payment, claiming the ambulance wasn't medically necessary. 
Apparently, Medicare believed the man's wife--who was, remember, 86 years old--should have been able to drive him to the hospital for treatment. Mr. and Mrs. Bernecker appealed, but were denied, and they began paying what they could afford each month on the ambulance bill. 
After several years of paying $20 a month, they finally paid off the ambulance bill. Medicare however, later reopened the case and reimbursed the Berneckers. 
I believe the experience this family had with Medicare's denial of payment for ambulance services happens far too often, and Congress needs to make sure it doesn't happen again. 
Another similarity between the two versions of this bill is the creation of a Federal commission on emergency medical services to make recommendations and to help provide input on how Federal regulatory actions affect all types of EMS providers. 
EMS needs a seat at the table when health care and other regulatory policy is made. 
Few things are more frustrating for ambulance services than trying to navigate and comply with the tangled mess of laws and regulations from the Federal level on down, only to receive either a reimbursement that doesn't cover the costs of providing the service or otherwise a flat denial of the payment. 
Mr. President, I came across this chart last year, the chart I have with me on the floor this morning, that demonstrates how a Medicare claim moves from submittal to payment, denial, or write-off by the ambulance provider. 
If you look at this chart, I ask you, tell me how a rural ambulance provider who depends on volunteers has the manpower or the expertise to navigate through this entire mess. And, in the event that it is navigated successfully, ambulance services are regularly reimbursed at a level that doesn't even cover their costs. 
Now let us talk about how much it costs to run just one ambulance. There is the cost of the dispatcher who remains on the line to give prearrival assistance, the ambulance itself, which costs from $85,000 to $100,000 to put on the road, the radios, beepers, and the cellular telephones used to communicate between the dispatcher, the ambulance, and the hospital, the supplies and equipment in the ambulance, including defibrillators, stretchers, EKG monitors, and bandages, and the two emergency medical technicians or paramedics who both drive the ambulance and provide care to the patient, the vehicle repair, maintenance, and insurance costs, and the liability insurance for the paramedics. As you can see, the list goes on and on. 
Yes, the costs can be high, but it is clear to me that, with the uncertainty ambulance providers face out in the field each day, they need to be prepared for every type of injury or condition. Mr. President, that is expensive, but we as consumers expect that in the case of an emergency. 
I am convinced those who complain about the high costs of emergency care would be aghast if the ambulance that arrived to care for them in an emergency didn't have the lifesaving equipment needed for their treatment. 
Let us be honest with ourselves: We want the quickest and best service when we face an emergency--and the bottom line is that costs money. 
Mr. President, many of our political debates in Washington center around how to better prepare for the 21st century. 
I have always supported research and efforts to expand the limits of technology and continue to believe technological innovations and advances in biomedical and basic scientific research hold tremendous promise. 
Under the new bill I am introducing today, Federal grant programs will be clarified to ensure that EMS agencies are eligible for programs that relate to highway safety, rural development, and tele-health technology. 
Emergency medical services have come a long way since the first ambulance services began in Cleveland and New York City way back during the 1860's. 
Indeed, the scientific and technological advances have created a new practice of medicine in just 2 short decades, and have dramatically improved the prospects of surviving any serious trauma. 
There is reason to believe further advances will have equally meaningful results. 
Innovations like tele-health technology may soon allow EMT's, nurses, and paramedics to perform more sophisticated procedures under a physician's supervision via real-time, ambulance-mounted monitors and cameras networked to emergency departments in specific service areas. 
By not considering EMS agencies for Federal grant dollars, we may cause significant delays in the application of current technologies. That would be a mistake. 
Perhaps the most dramatic departure the reintroduced bill takes from S. 238 related to the designation of a lead Federal agency for EMS. 
In August of 1996, the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau issued their report, `Emergency Medical Services: Agenda for the Future.' 
The report outlined specific ways EMS can be improved, and one of the stated goals was the authorization of a `lead Federal agency.' 
My original legislation instructed the Secretaries of Health and Transportation to confer on and facilitate the transfer of all EMS-related functions to the Department of Transportation. 
While we recognized that there would be some who would applaud the notion and others who would berate it, the suggestion compelled people to consider the issue and offer alternative approaches. 
The recommendations of the advisory committee and the comments I have received from national groups indicate we have yet to reach a solution to the problematic designation of a lead Federal agency. 
As such, under the new legislation, we call for an independent study to determine which existing agency or new board would best serve as the lead Federal entity for EMS. 
The concerns expressed to me about designating the Department of Transportation as the lead Federal agency were virtually identical to the concerns about granting lead-agency designation to the Department of Health and Human Services. It just didn't seem to fit. 
Therefore, I believe the most appropriate action is to take our time and get it right by conducting this study. 
Mr. President, in 1995, there were approximately 100 million visits to emergency departments across the country. 
Roughly 20 to 25 percent of those visits started with a call for an ambulance. Each one of those calls is important, especially to those seeking assistance and the responding EMS personnel. 
The Nation owes a great deal to the EMS personnel who have dedicated themselves to their profession because they care about people and they want to help those who are suffering. 
Nobody gets rich as a professional paramedic, and there is even less compensation as a volunteer. The field of emergency medical services presents many challenges--but offers the reward of knowing you helped someone in need of assistance. 
Every year, the American Ambulance Association recognizes EMS personnel across the country for their contributions to the profession, and bestows upon them the Stars of Life Award. 
This year, 124 individuals have been chosen by their peers to be honored for demonstrating exceptional kindness and selflessness in performing their duties. 
I ask unanimous consent to have printed the 1998 American Ambulance Association Stars of Life honorees in the Record.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, in closing I have talked with many EMT's, paramedics, and emergency nurses, and most tell me that they wouldn't think of doing anything else for their chosen career. 
So, in honoring them during this National EMS Week, I can think of no better way to recognize their service than through the introduction of legislation that will help them to help others. 
I ask my colleagues to support them by supporting the Emergency Medical Services Act.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of S. 1723, the American Competitiveness Act introduced by Senator Spencer Abraham  to increase the cap on H-1B visas to allow our companies to continue to compete. 
We find ourselves in the midst of a booming American economy, now in its 87th month of the longest peacetime economic expansion experienced, and with the lowest inflation and unemployment (4.9%) in 25 years. However, we find that 350,000 information technology (IT) jobs nationwide are unfilled. As we speak, the ability to bring foreign nationals temporarily into the country on H-1B visas to fill those jobs has been halted as of Monday, May 11. As of last Friday, the 65,000 H-1B visa cap has been reached in this temporary immigrant category. New applications will be turned away and the information technology industry, as well as our universities and colleges will be harmed. 
Minnesota companies affected by this cap have aggressively supported this legislation. 3M estimates its projected research effort will lack 80 technical employees for slots paying between $60,00 to $100,000. 3M had $15 billion in 1997 worldwide sales. Through the efforts of foreign nationals working in their research and development departments, 3M has been awarded 578 patents. We should continue to encourage this progress. 
Cargill, another Minnesota-based company, has 10 to 15% of their technology department unstaffed--about 99 to 110 people with a starting salary of $44,000. They have not been able to meet their needs through local labor pools and universities. They have been forced to turn to temporary foreign nationals. Furthermore, they tell me they have a 15% turn-over because of competition from other U.S. companies. 
Honeywell has 7,500 Minnesota employees and does not hire a large number of H-1B nationals--only those of needed technical skills. However, these shortages affect the productivity of the whole company. 
Even labor has agreed that there is a temporary need for this adjustment; that it may be warranted due to current market conditions and global demands. Education and training of the U.S. labor pool is being outstripped by racing technological advances and industry competition. The Department of Labor has projected the high tech industry will create 130,000 jobs each year for the foreseeable future. 
This is at a time when the U.S. Chamber of Commerce tells us our domestic labor pool is shrinking. Baby boomers are leaving a 23 
million people labor short fall, and often it is difficult to replace them with employees who have the training and expertise to meet the needs of many highly technical areas. 
Reports show fewer Americans seeking higher education are choosing the high tech fields of electrical engineering, computer science and mathematics. The number of Americans graduating with engineering degrees has declined 16% since 1985. Ironically, on the other hand, Mr. President, the United States is educating a higher percentage of foreign nationals in these subjects--48% of PHDs are foreign, 22% of undergrads are foreign nationals, and 42% of Master of Sciences candidates are foreign nationals. 
There is great global competition for all of these graduates. Japan, Germany, India and China are trying to lure them away with better deals and more benefits. However, the American life style and standard of living are a strong incentive in keeping them here. 
Another sector affected by the H-1B cap is the university/college community. A great deal of research and development is carried on at U.S. schools of higher learning. Temporary visiting scholars and research fellows from abroad have extended our base and expanded our scope of understanding in many fields. 
The University of Minnesota has written me asking for my strong support of this issue. Their ability to bring foreign scholars and high level faculty to their campus has raised their standards and strengthened their international stature. Their need has become even more critical since the cap has been reached, because they process 40% of their applications for these positions between May and September. They need help now. 
However, I would like to point out, Mr. President, we do need to look for a more permanent solution to this problem. We cannot rely on foreign expertise forever. We need to educate our young people to fill these vacancies. I applaud the inclusion in S. 1723 of the training and scholarship incentives for educating our own information technology workers. 20,000 college scholarships a year will be made available to low-income students in math, engineering and computer science through the State Student Incentive Grant program. It will increase training for the unemployed and help people cross-train into these fields. After the bill expires in 5 years, I am hopeful the supply of permanent, skilled American workers will be sufficient to meet industry's needs. 
This bill enhances the current H-1B visas by increasing the penalties five times and improving enforcement against willful offenders, although there have been few enforcement actions in the past.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator Grassley's bill, S. 1244, which exempts individual tithes to churches from bankruptcy proceedings. The exemption is up to 15 percent of income to prevent abuse. 
This problem was brought to my attention by the Crystal Evangelical Free Church in Minnesota, which prompted my cosponsor of this important legislation. The Church was sued and required to repay tithes given to it by individuals who had declared bankruptcy. Churches depend on tithes for their income to operate effectively. They should not be liable for debt repayment of their parishioners. 
This legislation is needed to protect churches from this kind of abuse. It is the right thing to do. I commend the Senator from Iowa for his effective leadership on this issue.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of S. 1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, which is necessary to preserve the intent of the Public Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This bipartisan legislation is narrowly drafted to correct an unexpected consequence of the Public Securities Litigation Reform Act and is supported by the White House and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
Following enactment of the 1995 Act, it became apparent that trial lawyers were up to their old tricks by circumventing the intent of the law by bringing frivolous class action law suits in state courts, rather than in Federal court. Although brought in a different forum, this action yields the same result--namely raising the cost to investors, workers, and customers. As a member of the conference committee on the 1995 Act, I can assure you that this is not the intent of Congress. 
As its name implies, S. 1260 preserves the 1995 Act by establishing uniform standards governing private class actions involving nationally traded securities. This bill does not interfere with the ability to bring criminal suits in state courts or for individuals to seek relief in state courts. Rather, this Act simply requires that class action lawsuits against nationally traded securities be filed in Federal court. 
I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and hope that it will be approved expeditiously so as to preserve the intent of the 1995 Act.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Conference Report to accompany S. 1150, the Agricultural, Research, Extension, and Education Act of 1998. For the purposes of this debate, I will focus on only the research and federal crop insurance provisions contained in this conference report. These are two of the primary issues important to farmers and those involved in agriculture. 
Among the important research provisions provided for in this conference report is funding for Fusarium Head Blight, or Scab, research. This disease has had a devastating impact on producers in Minnesota and North Dakota and has caused severe economic losses over the past five years. The conference report now before us is an important step in continuing the public/private partnership that has evolved as we attempt to find a scab-resistant variety of wheat. 
Also contained within this report is funding for genome research. This is important in mapping specific traits of corn and other commodities. Isolating those traits which are resistant to drought and other natural enemies could maximize yields and enhance producer efficiency. The flexibility it provides to research is reason enough to pass this legislation in a timely manner. 
However, some of my colleagues have expressed concern over the federal crop insurance provisions contained in this conference agreement. While I certainly understand their point, it is important that we look at the `big picture.' Currently, there is a budget shortfall in the program which jeopardizes the ability of farmers and agriculture lenders to make management decisions for the upcoming year. I have spoken with hundreds of individuals involved in agriculture who have urged me to support this funding fix, and I am confident they will be just as forthcoming as we explore options to provide producers with greater risk-management tools. It is important to remember that the conference report does not contain any major program reforms. It allows for five years of mandatory funding while market-orientated reforms are phased-in. Once the crop insurance budget issue is resolved, we can begin the process of achieving substantive reform of the federal crop insurance program. 
Mr. President, we must design alternatives that encourage innovation and competition among insurers with an eye towards moving crop insurance in the direction of privately developed policies. I have already begun this process with agriculture leaders in Minnesota. I look forward to working with Senator Lugar and my colleagues in crafting a program which benefits all taxpayers, while providing farmers the opportunity to craft a risk-management policy that fits their operation. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation and I look forward to its immediate passage.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and to help celebrate the 140th anniversary of Minnesota's admission into the United States of America. Let me begin, Mr. President, by quoting James Hill, founder of the Great Northern Railroad and one of Minnesota's true pioneers. It is said that Mr. Hill proclaimed his reasons for living and working in Minnesota by saying, `You can't interest me in any proposition in any place where it doesn't snow.' 
Well, Minnesota has never had a shortage of snow, which--depending on who you ask and just how many months the winter has lingered--is considered either a blessing or a curse. But even Mr. Hill recognized that snow is just one of Minnesota's many riches. Ever since word began to spread last century about a northern land of promise and prosperity, a land with abundant natural resources and indescribable beauty, people have traveled to Minnesota to live, work, and prosper. And during its 140 years of statehood, Minnesota has produced some of the country's best and brightest, making it a world leader in agriculture, technology, medicine, and business. 
Along the way, Minnesotans have endured cold winters, hot summers, floods, tornadoes, and any other natural disaster Mother Nature has thrown their way. 
At no time has the resolve of our people been more tested than with the natural disasters that have plagued our state during the last year. Last spring, the people of northwestern Minnesota were hit with the worst flooding in our state's history. Earlier this spring, the residents of south-central Minnesota lived through one of the largest tornadoes ever to hit our state. Yet, in both cases, Minnesotans worked together to rebuild and recover, and Minnesota is stronger for their efforts. Strangers have labeled that willingness to step forward and help one another as `Minnesota Nice.' We think that is just the way things ought to be. 
Throughout our history, Minnesotans have understood the importance of family, hard work, and personal responsibility. It is not just talk--they live it. Growing up on a Minnesota dairy farm in a small farming community, I saw those strengths firsthand. I saw how these qualities help make Minnesota one of the world's premiere food producers. 
Farming and farm-related businesses play a critical role in our state; one of every four Minnesota jobs is tied in some way to agriculture, and 25% of our economy is dependent upon farmers and agri-business. In 1996, Minnesota was ranked 15th in the country in agriculture exports to Asia. 
Minnesota's world leadership is not limited only to agriculture. Our state is home to some of the world's leading job providers--including 3M, Pillsbury, Honeywell, Cargill, and a list far too long to mention here. Minnesota is also known for its achievements in the area of health care. It is a leader in the medical device industry and home to one of the world's premiere health care facilities, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. 
The commitment of Minnesotans to hard work and to producing some of the best products in the world has made Minnesota an active participant not only in the nation's economy, but in the world economy as well. 
Minnesotans have long understood the importance of America's role within the international community. Our residents have had the insight to understand that we do not live in a vacuum . . . that our economic prosperity depends on our ability to trade freely with the rest of the world. This point was highlighted during a meeting I had last month with farmers in Crookston, Minnesota. Although they asked questions about issues here at home, many of their questions were about IMF, free trade, and the Asian financial crisis. Our farmers and other business people know that what happens in Asia or Europe today can affect business in America and Minnesota tomorrow. 
One Minnesotan who has helped to shape our leadership role on international issues is former Governor Harold Stassen. Governor Stassen helped to write the charter for the United Nations and at age 91 continues to be an outspoken proponent of free and open relations with the rest of the world. 
This coming weekend, Minnesota's international tradition will continue when Secretary General of the United Nations Kofi Annan comes to Minnesota to tour the Center for Victims of Torture. Many may be surprised to hear that the Secretary General attended college in Minnesota, at Macalester College in Saint Paul. 
For the last few minutes, I have been speaking here on the floor, with great pride, about my home state. To some, I am sure it sounds a bit like bragging. But on this day, 140 years after Minnesota became the 32nd State admitted to the Union, I want to express the honor I feel in representing the people of Minnesota in the U.S. Senate--for Minnesota is one of the premier states in the greatest country on Earth. 
I want to end today with the sentence used by Minnesota author and radio personality Garrison Keillor to describe the fictitious town of Lake Woebegone, Minnesota . . . . because I think it can be applied to all of Minnesota. I am proud to hail from a state `where all the women are strong, the men are good looking, and the children are above average.'

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Goodwill Industries on the occasion of Goodwill Industries Week, which began May 3 and continues through May 9. Goodwill Industries Week is a national celebration to honor those who have overcome barriers to employment and become independent members of their communities and to honor the organization that helps make those achievements possible. 
Goodwill Industries is much more than a business based upon the reselling of used merchandise at a discount price; it is an organization that is based upon volunteers providing leadership, advice, and assistance to those in need everywhere. 
Goodwill Industries was founded by Reverend Edgar Helms around the turn of the 20th Century under the philosophy of `a hand up, not a hand out.' Goodwill Industries was officially incorporated in 1910 and was originally envisioned by Rev. Helms as both an `industrial program as well as a social service enterprise . . . a provider of employment, training, and rehabilitation for people of limited employability, and a source of temporary assistance for individuals whose resources were depleted.' Today, Goodwill Industries has expanded upon Rev. Helms' original mission to include people with physical, mental and emotional disabilities, as well as those trapped by socio-economic barriers such as illiteracy, homelessness, advanced age, past substance abuse, lack of work experience or criminal history. 
Goodwill Industries has grown from its original location in Boston, Massachusetts' Morgan Memorial Chapel into a $1.2 billion nonprofit organization with 187 autonomous members in the U.S. and Canada and 54 associate members in 37 countries outside of North America. In 1997, Goodwill served over 200,000 people nationwide who needed assistance in learning job skills and gaining employment. 
As for Minnesota, Goodwill first appeared in Duluth, in 1916, and three years later in St. Paul. During its first years in Minnesota, Goodwill provided jobs, low-cost merchandise, and training for young people with disabilities during the Depression era. During World War II, Goodwill Industries aided in the rehabilitation of disabled servicemen. 
Goodwill has continued to serve Minnesotans throughout the State and has found ways to remain a successful and a profitable industry. The Duluth Goodwill merged with the Duluth Sheltered Workshop in 1979 and continues to serve Minnesota's northland. The St. Paul Goodwill merged with the Easter Seal Society in 1984 and provides services for the rest of the State. With these changes, in 1997 alone, both of Minnesota's Goodwill Industries offices combined to process over 40 million pounds of donated clothing and household goods for salvage and sale. In addition, Goodwill served over 10,000 Minnesotans in need of assistance. 
Mr. President, I commend Goodwill Industries for its continued service to the American people and especially for its commitment to Minnesota. But most of all, I want to pay tribute to both the countless volunteers who provide a `hand up, not a hand out' and all of the participants who use these resources to better themselves.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from Idaho for allowing me to break in here to give a 5-minute speech dealing also with what Senator Brownback is talking about, which is really the unfairness of the current Tax Code that we have. 
Mr. President, I am usually not one to quote poetry here on the Senate floor, but I rise today and ask my colleagues' indulgence as I broach a serious subject with a not-so-serious bit of rhyme. 
Abracadabra, thus we learn 
The more you create, the less you earn. 
The less you earn, the more you're given, 
The less you lead, the more you're driven, 
The more destroyed, the more they feed, 
The more you pay, the more they need, 
The more you earn, the less you keep, 
And now I lay me down to sleep. 
I pray the Lord my soul to take 
If the tax-collector hasn't got it before I wake. 
Mr. President, it was 1935 when poet Ogden Nash took up his pen to warn of the dangers of a tax system run amuck. Then, the federal tax rate topped out at less than 4 percent. 
Sixty-three years later, Washington now demands 28 percent of every paycheck; the additional burden of state and local taxes boosts the total tax load to nearly 40 percent of every worker's paycheck. 
I cannot say with certainty what sort of poem Mr. Nash might produce on the subject were he alive today, but it would not surprise me if it could not be repeated here on the Senate floor. 
There exists no other date the American people await with such dread as April 15, tax filing day. Rightfully so. Oppressive taxes, coupled with abuses the Internal Revenue Service routinely carries out upon taxpayers--abuses exposed during the recent hearings of the Senate Finance Committee--certainly highlight the reasons why. 
Yet, taxpayers face another annual event they should look upon with equal disdain, an event that reveals a great deal about the federal, state, and local tax burden working families are expected to bear: Tax Freedom Day. 
As it does every year, the nonpartisan Tax Foundation has calculated the date average American stops working just to pay their share of the tax burden and begin working for themselves and their families. 
In 1998, Tax Freedom Day falls on Sunday, May 10. That means taxpayers must work 129 days before they can count a single penny of their salary as their own--that is a full day later than 1997, and marks the latest-ever arrival of Tax Freedom Day. 
By the time Tax Freedom Day arrives, the American people will have spent the last 129 days imprisoned by their own tax system. And that is not the whole picture, because if the cost of complying with the tax system itself were included in the calculations, Tax Freedom Day would be pushed forward another 13 days. As proof of just how far we have traveled--in the wrong direction--Tax Freedom Day in 1925 arrived on February 6. 
Taxpayers are now working more than an entire week longer to pay off their taxes than they were when President Clinton first took office in 1993. Calculate the tax load in hours and minutes, instead of days, and Americans spend fully two hours and 50 minutes of each eight-hour workday laboring to pay their taxes. 
While May 10th marks the arrival of Tax Freedom Day for taxpayers in an average state, many Americans are forced to wait longer. My home state of Minnesota, for example, is the third highest-taxed state, and our taxpayers will not mark Tax Freedom Day until May 16, nearly a week later. If you live in Wisconsin or Connecticut, you will wait even longer. 
After 16 major tax increases over the past 30 years, the need for tax relief has never been more pressing. 
Congress and the President moved toward the taxpayers in 1997 by enacting the `Taxpayer Relief Act' with its $500 per-child tax credit. In 1998, Congress and the President can and must do more, beginning with fundamental reform of the entire tax system. Merely tinkering around the edges of the Internal Revenue Service won't reduce the burden on overtaxed Americans, though. Real reform means creating a more sensible way to pay for the services of government through a system that is flatter, simpler, fairer, and treats the taxpayers with respect. Meaningful tax relief--relief that leaves more dollars in the hands of working Americans to spend on child care, health insurance, clothing, and groceries--will quickly follow. 
Instead of serving as yet another occasion for tabulating the high cost of government, Tax Freedom Day must become a national call to action. How far will it go if the taxpayers do not step forward? To paraphrase Mr. Nash: Abracadabra, thus we say Just where is the `freedom' in Tax Freedom Day? I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to say a couple words about the amendment and then also be joined by my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, on this amendment. 
It is very simple. It applies to residents or individuals, or I should say victims who live in disaster areas, those areas that have been declared disaster areas by a Presidential decree, either through flooding or tornadoes or whatever mishap it might be. 
The basics of this amendment say that those people who have been granted an extension to file their income taxes, but under current law the IRS must still assess an interest payment on those taxes. This is adding insult to injury. These people who have no opportunity due to no fault of their own to file their taxes on time have been granted an extension period to get their taxes filed in good faith, and yet under current law we come back and say, well, that's fine and dandy, but we now have to assess you an interest on this. These individuals who are trying to rebuild and repair their lives need every dollar. Every dollar counts. 
So the basic part of this amendment is very simple. It is that also we would, along with granting them an extension in order to file their income taxes, make an exemption for interest on those tax payments as well. So I hope that the Senate will consider this and give it its full support. 
I would like now to defer to my colleague from Minnesota.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about IRS reform and overall reform of the tax system. 
Paramilitary-style raids, attempted frame-ups, retaliation against whistle blowers, harassment of innocent individuals, all carried out by a Government agency oftentimes operating outside the bounds of the law and with seemingly limitless authority. A premise played out within the pages of the latest popular novel? Not exactly. These examples, unearthed during recent hearings here in the Senate, are taken directly from the playbook of the Internal Revenue Service. 
The hearings, and the abuses they highlighted, have focused the nation's attention on the `IRS Restructuring and Reform Act' that is now before the Senate. Included within the legislation are many good provisions that would protect taxpayer rights and restrict the power of the agency. Key provisions would limit interest and penalties on delinquent taxes and shift the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS in tax disputes. 
Before I continue, Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to commend Senator Roth, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, for his tremendous efforts to reform the IRS and his leadership on tax relief. 
I also commend the Chairman for holding the series of oversight hearings that exposed the abuses upon taxpayers carried out by the IRS. All of us are greatly indebted to Senator Roth for that. He has done an outstanding job to formulate a sound and responsible IRS restructuring plan. 
If enacted, these reform provisions before us today would improve IRS service, make the agency more accountable, and provide better protections for the taxpayers. I fully agree with Senator Roth that the goal of IRS reform should be to make the IRS `a service-oriented agency instead of a law-enforcement agency.' 
Still, Mr. President, a fundamental question remains: can the IRS really be fixed by reform without scrapping the Tax Code? To answer this, we need to take a closer look into the problems with the IRS. 
The passage in 1913 of the 16th amendment to the Constitution granted Congress the power to impose an income tax. A tiny division of the Bureau of Internal Revenue Service was created to collect the taxes. Eighty-five years later, this division, now known as the IRS, has grown to become the most powerful agency in the entire Federal Government. 
The IRS today employs more investigative agents than the FBI and the CIA combined, and boasts a total workforce of more than 100,000. It is hard to believe, but more employees work at the IRS than in all but the 36 largest corporations in this country. The decisions its bureaucrats make daily affect every American who takes home a paycheck. 
The agency's job is to administer and enforce the Nation's tax laws and collect tax revenue for the Government. To ensure that all Americans pay their taxes, Congress has given the agency almost unlimited power--power that goes beyond the authority granted to any other agency in the Federal Government. 
By law, the IRS can audit individuals or businesses. It can impose penalties and impose a lien on a taxpayer's property or bank accounts, or seize them altogether. Average taxpayers and small business owners have few little administrative or legal remedies against such a powerful agency. 
Its unlimited power has made the IRS a wasteful, arrogant, incompetent, intrusive, and abusive agency. The IRS is driven by illegal quotas and collection goals. It has targeted the underprivileged for audits. It has mistreated hundreds of thousands of innocent taxpayers. 
Clearly, this is an agency out of control, an agency in need of a complete overhaul. 
But let us not forget how the IRS reached this troubled point. Congress deserves much of the blame for the present state of our hostile tax system, for it is Congress that created the IRS in the first place. 
Congress grants the IRS its unlimited power. Congress writes the complicated Tax Code that taxes Americans' income over and over and provides loopholes to thousands of special groups, making the Tax Code too complicated for even most attorneys and tax accountants to fully understand. Congress requires the IRS to squeeze more tax money out of the taxpayers so that Congress has more to spend. On top of that, Congress does not have time to fully exercise its IRS oversight responsibilities. Even while it talks reform, Congress is making the Tax Code ever more burdensome--since last year, Congress has added 185 new sections and 824 changes to the Tax Code. 
Most IRS employees are decent, hardworking people who face an impossible task: interpreting and applying the hundreds of thousands of pages of the Tax Code and its related regulations. A recent study shows that more than 8 million Americans each year receive incorrect bills or refunds due to IRS errors. 
Each year, Money magazine hires 50 professional tax preparers to calculate a return for a sample family. No two preparers have ever had the same result; answers can vary by thousands of dollars. It just shows that the Tax Code is confusing and arbitrary, and this in turn encourages waste, harassment, corruption and abuse. 
Tinkering with the system by merely restructuring the IRS will not solve its fundamental flaws. It is clear that the real problem with the IRS is not management, or administration, but the Tax Code on which all IRS decisions are based. This is such an ugly agency it is hard to make it pretty by reforms. 
We can replace the IRS management, we can improve its service, crack down on abuses, increase its efficiency, and reduce its waste, but the fundamental problems will not go away. Reorganizing the IRS without real reform of the Tax Code will send a false signal to the American people that once we restructure the IRS, all its problem will be solved and there will be no need to reform our tax system. Unfortunately, as the history books reveal, it is not that easy. 
We have tried to overhaul the IRS in the past, and somehow the agency always comes back more powerful and more abusive than ever before. At least two versions of a `taxpayer bill of rights' previously enacted into law have had little effect in taming the IRS. Even after last year's IRS abuse hearings, which resulted in promised reforms, the abuses continue. 
Mr. President, let me make this clear: it is vitally important that we continue our efforts to reform the IRS, and I strongly support Chairman Roth's work and his legislation. My point is that we should not let this debate delay or derail real tax reform--to delay us from carrying out the demands of the taxpayers to scrap the Tax Code and replace it with one that is simpler, flatter, fairer, and friendlier. 
This Chamber already passed a resolution to sunset the Tax Code. Now we should set a date to establish a new tax system. Once we have eliminated the Tax Code, there will be little, if any, need for the IRS and its playbook or its abuses. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I just wanted to inform the Senate of my intentions today--later on, after this time for debate--to offer an amendment that would permanently exempt interest payments owed by disaster victims to the Internal Revenue Service. 
This is a very simple and straightforward amendment. The amendment is actually derived from the `Disaster Victim Tax Extension Act,' legislation I introduced on April 29, 1998 with Senators Coverdell, Frist, McCain, Hutchinson, Smith of Oregon, Graham of Florida, and D'Amato. 
As I stated in a Dear Colleague letter circulated on April 22, this amendment permanently exempts interest payments for disaster victims who reside in presidentially declared disaster areas and have been granted an extension for their tax filing. 
The reason for this amendment is very clear: 
Each year, our country is hit by natural disasters of all kinds--such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, and ice storms--causing extreme hardship for hundreds of thousands of Americans. 
This year, 15 states have already been hit by deadly disasters: 
Starting March 7, severe storms and flooding struck the state of Alabama, damaging nearly 1,200 homes, and the city of Elba in Coffee County was evacuated as a result of a levee failure. Three deaths were attributed to the floods and one person was reported missing. 
On February 9, twenty-seven California counties were wracked by severe storms. 
During the period of January 28 through February 6, a series of severe winter storms hit communities in Sussex County in Delaware. 
Also in February, three southern Florida counties were victimized by tornadoes and other violent weather. 
In February, six counties in Georgia were struck by tornadoes. On March 20, amid flood recovery efforts, tornadoes and windstorms tore through northeast Georgia, adding to the overall devastation. Tornadoes again touched down in west Georgia, metro Atlanta, and southeast Georgia on April 9. 
In February, Atlantic and Cape May counties in southern New Jersey were hit by the coastal storm that lashed the area. 
On April 16, six Tennessee counties were ravaged by deadly tornadoes and other violent weather. 
And, Mr. President, on March 29, seven counties in my own state of Minnesota were hit by deadly tornadoes, damaging thousands of homes and businesses along an 86-mile path carved through the communities of St. Peter, Comfrey, and Le Center. 
Just days after the March storm, I traveled to the disaster site in south-central Minnesota to witness the destruction and meet with the Minnesotans--families, farmers, and other business owners--forced to cope with this tragedy. Mr. President, I've never witnessed devastation on such a scale. I have heard of tornado-damaged areas being compared to `war zones,' but had no idea how close that was to the truth. This was indeed a war zone, and the Minnesotans I met with that Friday and Saturday were very much its innocent victims. 
Two of those victims tragically lost their lives. 
The property damage was widespread. Grain storage bins were leveled, the fronts of homes were sheared off, farm fields were choked with debris, making it impossible to plant, rows of telephone poles snapped, brick houses leveled, countless trees were downed at Gustavus Adolphus College, and the spire of its church was torn off, vehicles were scattered by the winds, some landing in farm fields, the historic Bell Tower of the courthouse in downtown Saint Peter was destroyed. 
I am told the March tornadoes were some of the largest and longest in Minnesota's history. It's hard to imagine, but the Comfrey and Saint Peter tornadoes were a mile and a quarter wide--2,200 yards. That is nearly twice as wide as any previous tornado to hit my state, and far larger than the average tornado, which is only 100 yards wide. The tornado that destroyed Comfrey created a damage zone of 77 square miles. Just how large is that? Larger than the entire city of San Francisco, which is contained within 75.2 square miles. 
The estimated total dollar value of insured losses caused by the south-central Minnesota tornadoes has reached $175 million, exceeding insured losses incurred in my state during the floods one year ago. Minnesotans have come together to clean up and begin the rebuilding, as we always do when our neighbors need help, and I'm impressed with their spirit in facing this disaster. Still, it's going to take many months, perhaps years, before life returns to normal in those towns caught in the tornadoes' paths. 
Minnesota's experience is, unfortunately, not unique. Deadly natural disasters occur every year. Lives are lost, homes are demolished, property is destroyed, businesses are ruined, and crops are wiped out. The survivors of these disasters need our help to get their feet back on the ground. 
Federal disaster assistance has been effective. In fact, almost all of the major disaster sites have been subsequently designated as presidentially declared disaster areas and are eligible to receive federal disaster assistance. 
However, there is one hurdle Congress must remove. Residents in presidentially declared disaster areas can often get an extension to file their tax returns. However, interest owed cannot be exempted by the IRS. The IRS charges an 8 percent interest rate for taxes owed, even if disaster victims get an extension for tax filing. So this is adding insult to injury. 
Exempting interest payments owed to the IRS requires congressional action. Many states, like Minnesota, immediately grant exemptions for interest payments on state taxes when disaster areas are declared. Although Congress has granted such federal waivers in the past, they must be done legislatively each time a disaster occurs, and appropriate vehicles are not always available. This creates one more uncertainty for disaster victims. 
My amendment would once and for all remove this barrier and give residents of presidentially declared disaster areas an interest payment exemption on any federal taxes owed. Under my amendment, the exemption is effective retroactively to tax year 1997, so that all of this year's disaster victims will be covered for their late filing. 
Mr. President, this may seem like a small matter, but for disaster survivors in Minnesota, Georgia, Alabama, California, Delaware, Florida, New Jersey, Tennessee, and every state devastated by events entirely and utterly out of their control, every dollar counts 
in their efforts to begin to repair and to rebuild their lives. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to make sure that we put in place permanently an exemption so the IRS will not charge interest on taxes that are due and that are not paid on time because of extensions due to disasters. 
Again, it may seem like a small matter, but to those people who have experienced these disasters, it is a lot. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I will be sending this to the desk as soon as the chairman's time on his debate has been concluded. 
I thank you very much. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a group of young Minnesotans whose hard work and dedication earned them the privilege of representing Minnesota at the 1998 `We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution National Finals.' 
Under the guidance of American Government teacher Barbara Hakala, this group of 30 students from Duluth Central High School tirelessly studied the history of our Constitution and the application of its principles in our time. The disciplined study demonstrated by these students helped them prevail in the Minnesota constitution competition, and for the second year in a row, Minnesota was represented in the `We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution National Finals' by a team from Duluth Central High School.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to remember the American workers who have suffered injuries or died while at the work places in my home state of Minnesota and across the country. 
As my colleagues may know, since 1989 the unions of the AFL-CIO have recognized April 28 as `Worker Memorial Day' to commemorate the millions of workplace injuries, illnesses and deaths that occur each year. In addition, many unions throughout the world now mark April 28 as an `International Day of Mourning.' 
In Minnesota, AFL-CIO affiliates commemorated Worker Memorial Day with a wide variety of events around the state. This past Tuesday at noon, members of Minneapolis and St. Paul building trades met near the State Capitol in St. Paul to remember workers who have been killed or injured in the job. A bell tolled once for each local construction worker who died in the past year of job-related causes. 
In Grand Forks, the Northern Valley Labor Council and the Grand Forks Building and Construction Trades Council placed Workers Memorial Day stickers on their clothing at work. Statewide, a `Minnesota's Workforce Minute' Message about Workers' Memorial Day aired several times over the 29 stations of Minnesota News Network's Lifestyle Network. 
Lastly, the Minnesota Department of Transportation and local unions in the Twin Cities and St. Cloud participated in a number of Worker Memorial Day activities including the broadcast of a Workers Memorial Day message from the Metro Division Engineer over the MnDOT Public address and radio communication systems. This message preceded the observance of a moment of silence at 2 p.m. 
Mr. President, this year also marks the 28th anniversary of the enactment of the Occupational Safety and Health Act. In 1970, President Nixon signed legislation which created the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to establish and enforce labor standards and the National Institute for Occupational Safety Health (NIOSH) to conduct research investigations. 
At the Department of Labor bill signing, President Nixon underscored the goal of this historic legislation. President Nixon noted how the bill's enactment, `. . . Represents in its culmination the American system at its best: Democrats, Republicans, the House, the Senate, the White House, business, labor, all cooperating in a common goal--the saving of lives, the avoiding of injuries, making the places of work for 55 million Americans safer and more pleasant places.' 
Mr. President, the goal of the Occupational Safety and Health Act is to prevent injuries, illnesses, and fatalities in the workplace. Through statistics provided by the Department of Labor it appears as though the intent of this Act has achieved some level of success. Unfortunately, these numbers are still too high. 
According to Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were over 6,000 workplace fatalities in 1996, the lowest level in five years. There were 6.2 million workplace injuries or illnesses among private sector firms with more than 11 or more employees, about 400,000 fewer than in 1995. In my home state alone, 92 Minnesotans lost their lives, and 138,000 suffered injuries or illnesses on the job in 1996. 
I have always supported employers and employees in their effort to create safe and healthy work places without cumbersome federal regulations. Workers are a business' most valuable asset and they deserve safe and healthy work places that will enable them to better perform their jobs. Safe working environments, achieved by restoring common sense and cooperation among workers, job providers and the federal government, result in smart business. 
I strongly believe we need to continue to promote better safety and public health standards. One way this can be accomplished is through comprehensive reform of the Federal regulatory process. For this reason, I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. 981, the `Regulatory Improvement Act of 1997' sponsored by Senator Carl Levin, one of the leading health, safety and environmental experts in the Senate. 
In my view, legislation such as the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1997 will ensure a more open and accountable regulatory process which will improve our health, safety and environmental protections while reducing the regulatory burden on those subject to those laws. It will not compromise health or safety protections. I recently wrote the Majority Leader urging that this legislation receive consideration on the Senate floor, and I am hopeful that we will have a debate on how to best ensure safe and healthy work places in the coming weeks. 
On each Workers Memorial Day, I urge my colleagues to remember those American workers who have lost their lives or were injured on the job. Congress, the Administration, labor and business, must work together as they did nearly 30 years ago, to ensure that there are adequate protections to prevent unnecessary injuries and fatalities in the future and improve the lives of all of our nation's workers.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would permanently exempt the interest payments owed by disaster victims to the Internal Revenue Service. 
Each year, our country is hit by a variety of natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, and ice storms, all causing extreme hardship for hundreds of thousands of Americans. 
This year, 15 States have already been hit by deadly disasters. 
Starting on March 7, severe storms and flooding struck the State of Alabama, damaging nearly 1,200 homes, and the city of Elba in Coffee County was evacuated as a result of a levee failure. Three deaths were attributed to the floods and one person was reported missing. 
On February 9, 27 California counties were wracked by severe storms. 
During the period of January 28 through February 6, a series of severe winter storms hit communities in Sussex County of Delaware. 
Also in February, three southern Florida counties were victimized by tornadoes and other violent weather. 
In February, six counties in Georgia were struck by tornadoes. On March 20, amid flood recovery efforts, tornadoes and windstorms tore through northeast Georgia, adding to the overall devastation. Tornadoes again touched down in west Georgia, metro Atlanta, and southeast Georgia on April 9. 
In February, Atlantic and Cape May counties in southern New Jersey were hit by the coastal storm that lashed the area. 
On April 16, six Tennessee counties were ravaged by deadly tornadoes and other violent weather. 
And, Mr. President, on March 29, seven counties in my own State of Minnesota were hit by the deadly tornadoes, damaging thousands of homes and businesses along a 62-mile path carved through the communities of St. Peter, Comfrey, and Le Center. The storms claimed two lives. 
The estimated total dollar value of insured losses caused by the south-central Minnesota tornadoes has reached $175 million, exceeding insured losses incurred in my state during the floods of one year ago. 
The list goes on and on. But my point is: deadly natural disasters occur every year. Lives are lost, homes are demolished, property is destroyed, businesses are ruined, and crops are wiped out. The survivors of these disasters need our help to get their feet back on the ground. 
Federal disaster assistance has been effective. In fact, almost all of the major disaster sites have been subsequently designated as Presidentially declared disaster areas and are eligible to receive federal disaster assistance. 
However, there is one hurdle Congress still must remove. Residents in Presidentially declared disaster areas can often get an extension to file their income tax returns. 
However, interest owed cannot be exempted by the IRS. That requires Congressional action. 
In other words, we give them time, an extension to file their taxes, but at the same time we are saying, because you cannot because of circumstances beyond your control file, we are going to charge you interest on it. That is adding insult to injury. 
So many States, like Minnesota, immediately have granted exemptions for interest payments on State taxes when disaster areas are declared. 
Although Congress has granted such Federal waivers in the past, they must be done legislatively each time a disaster occurs, and appropriate vehicles are not always available. This creates one more uncertainty for victims of disaster. 
The legislation I am here to introduce today along with Senators Coverdell, Frist, McCain, Hutchinson, and Smith of Oregon, the bill called the Disaster Victim Tax Extension Act, would once and for all remove this barrier and it would give residents of Presidentially declared disaster areas an interest payment exemption on any Federal taxes owed. 
By the way, Mr. President, our legislation would be effective retroactively to tax year 1997. 
Mr. President, this may seem like a small matter, but for disaster survivors, every dollar counts. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, last week, a Washington-based trade association, the Emergency Committee for American Trade (ECAT), released an important new study on how American companies with global operations increase the U.S. standard of living and strengthen the domestic economy. The study is entitled `Global Investments, American Returns' and I highly recommend it to every Member of the Senate 
I am proud that two of my state's most successful companies have contributed case studies to this compelling report. Cargill, Incorporated and 3M Company are examples of why America's economic future and an improved standard of living for all Americans depend upon our ability to operate, sell, invest and compete in the global marketplace. 
Cargill, Incorporated operates in some 72 countries as a marketer, processor and distributor of agricultural goods and services. The company has been so successful in selling to foreign markets that some of Cargill's fertilizer facilities operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This allows the plants to achieve lower unit operating costs and thereby allows Cargill to deliver a more competitively priced product. If these plants served only the U.S. market, they would sit idle most of the year because fertilizers are required only during very short periods of growing seasons. Cargill's global presence helps generate demand for its fertilizers all year round by serving different parts of the world during different growing seasons. 
3M Company produces a large and continually evolving range of technologies and products. For example, the company currently offers more than 900 varieties of tapes alone. More than 53 percent of the company's total sales are from outside the United States. 3M Company's success in operating abroad has meant growth here at home. Efficient foreign distribution, sales, and technical support, and research and development generate increased U.S. production and research and development here at home. For example, 3M's $2.6 billion in Asian-Pacific sales contributes more than $182 million to the company's annual research and development budget of $1 billion--much of which is spent in Minnesota. In addition, finished and semifinished goods that are manufactured in the United States and then exported help support overseas sales. 
Cargill and 3M Company are just two of the American companies profiled in Global Investments, American Returns. The study uses data and business cases to illustrate the importance of operating globally. For example, the study shows that: 
Global activities by American companies actually increase investments here at home rather than substitute for them. 
The global presence of U.S. firms helps to increase export sales and create additional purchases from U.S. suppliers. 
American companies with global operations account for most of the nation's research and development capital investments, and export sales. 
American companies with global operations also rely heavily upon U.S. suppliers. These companies purchase more than 90 percent of their supplies--amounting to $2.4 trillion annually--from American companies. 
American manufacturers with global operations pay higher wages than do purely domestically-focused firms. For production or blue-collar workers, the difference is 15 percent higher earnings. 
I urge all of my colleagues to review carefully `Global Investments, American Returns.' It is an important study that should guide America's tax and trade policies. I am especially pleased to learn that ECAT--and companies like Cargill and 3M that contributed to the report--will launch a trade education campaign to help spread the facts and dispel the misconceptions about trade and investment. I am proud that these Minnesota companies are a part of this effort.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, Ronald Reagan once remarked that: 
They say the world has become too complex for simple answers. They are wrong. There are no easy answers, but there are simple answers. 
Mr. President, with the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet empire, we must face the challenge of maintaining a zone of stability in Central Europe while preserving the freedom and independence of these democratic states. Enlarging NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic is not an easy answer, but it is a simple answer. Most importantly, it is a simple answer that is in the best interest of the United States. 
This is not the first time that the Senate has considered the merits of NATO enlargement. NATO added new members on three other occasions, bringing Germany, Greece, Turkey, and Spain into the fold. With each addition, the military capability of NATO increased, and the stability of Europe was enhanced. I am confident that the inclusion of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in NATO will have the same effect. 
This round of NATO expansion, however, is significant in that these are the first candidates for NATO membership to be considered that were part of the Soviet bloc. Nearly a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we have a chance to right the historical wrong of Yalta, and firmly anchor Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in the West. While the accession of these three nations to full NATO membership should not be supported for moral reasons alone, our moral obligation to these countries should not be ignored. We must look at NATO expansion not just as a way to make up for past mistakes, but as a chance to secure the gains of freedom and democracy and ensure that they will never again be encroached. 
NATO expansion offers the United States a remarkable opportunity to be proactive in shaping the strategic landscape of Europe. That this opportunity is a result of peace, and not the spoils of war, is a tribute to the effectiveness of NATO over nearly 50 years. It is not a responsibility that we should take lightly; it is not a responsibility that we can shirk. 
NATO'S MISSION 
The Senate does not have merely the obligation to determine whether Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic should be admitted to NATO, but to safeguard the integrity of the organization they would be joining. NATO has been a successful military alliance with a clearly defined mission: protecting the territorial integrity of its members, defending them from external aggression and preventing the domination of Europe by any single power. NATO's mission remains just as valid today as it was at its inception. I am convinced that a NATO which includes Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will be a stronger, more viable institution as long as NATO retains its essential character throughout this transition. 
I share the concerns of some of my colleagues that unless we are vigilant, NATO may evolve into a UN-style peacekeeping force. However, it is important to underscore that the expansion of NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic will inhibit--not promote--this objectionable outcome. The prospective members are eager to join NATO to receive the same strong security guarantee that NATO members have traditionally enjoyed. They understand what it means to be invaded and occupied, and do not want NATO's ability to carry out its mission to be diluted or compromised. They will be on our side in the internal debate in the North Atlantic Council over NATO's strategic concept in the 21st century. 
RUSSIA 
Mr. President, others have argued that the inclusion of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in NATO will destabilize Russia and endanger our efforts to build a constructive relationship with that important nation. I do not believe this is the case. The Russian legislature is refusing to ratify START II. Russia is forging closer ties to Iraq and Iran and undermining US policy in the Middle East whenever possible. Moscow is trying to disrupt US-backed plans to move Caspian Sea oil through an Azerbaijani-Georgian pipeline to the Black Sea. But there is no evidence that any of these actions is linked to NATO expansion. Indeed, Russia was pursing these policies long before the expansion of NATO was seriously contemplated. NATO expansion may be a convenient excuse for Russia's stance on foreign policy issues that run counter to US interests, but it is not the cause. 
I have no doubt that Russia, if given the choice, would like to maintain a `sphere of influence' in Central Europe, or barring that, a buffer zone. But this is 1998, not 1948, and Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have the right and the ability to reject the former, and the United States has a vital interest in denying the latter. As former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger noted. 
Basing European and Atlantic security on a no man's land between Germany and Russia runs counter to historical experience. A greater security dilemma would be created by ceding to our own fears about antagonizing Russia than proceeding with enlargement. 
Furthermore, appeasing the Russian extremists who object to NATO expansion would only serve to undermine the very democratic forces that we're trying to protect. I see no evidence of a brewing nationalist backlash that critics keep warning us about. The Russian people are concerned about securing jobs, protecting their pensions, and preserving their personal security. Opinion polls show that Russian voters don't care one way or another about NATO expansion. As one expert witness, Mr. Dimitri Simes, before the Foreign Relations Committee remarked, the Russian leadership: engaged in terrible atrocities in Chechnya against [. . .] many Russian civilians. They are not paying wages and pensions at a time when people can easily observe the huge mansions of the new elite [. . .]. None of this moves Russian politics in a nationalist or reactionary direction. But somehow an obstruction like NATO enlargement is supposed to have a mystical, destructive impact on Russian politics. It is very difficult for me to believe.

Mr. GRAMS. In conclusion, Mr. President, this Resolution of Ratification provides the Senate with a historic opportunity to shape the strategic landscape of Europe. 
At the end of the Cold War, there was a lot of discussion about the `peace dividend'--the financial savings which would accrue from the end of the superpower rivalry between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Well, the expansion of NATO reflects the true `peace dividend'--the extension of a zone of security to codify the gains of freedom and democracy for three more nations and ensure that they will never again be encroached. 
Mr. President, the United States has a national security interest in assuring the stability of Central Europe. I am convinced that the best way to do that is to enlarge NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. 
As Czech President Vaclav Havel, a man who I respect and admire, has warned, `If the West does not stabilize the East the East will destabilize the West.' Mr. President, we have an obligation to our troops stationed in Europe and to future generations of Americans to do everything in our power to make sure it is the West which stabilizes the East and war will never again be precipitated by a power vacuum in Central Europe. 
Mr. President, I will cast my vote in favor of expanding NATO to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, recognizing that this is one of the most important votes that I will take in the Senate. I urge my colleagues to do the same. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that seeks to restore fairness to the nation's dairy system--fairness that has long been missing, particularly in the Upper Midwest and especially in my home state of Minnesota. 
When Minnesotans are asked to name my state's leading industries, agriculture will certainly be at or near the top of most every list. Farming and farm-related business plays a critical role in Minnesota's economy. One out of every four Minnesota jobs is tied in some way to agriculture, and 25% of the state's economy is dependent upon farmers and agri-business, most of it focused in the dairy industry. 
What many people do not realize is that, despite those statistics, our state's dairy industry is in real trouble. 
Since dropping to number five in milk production--behind Wisconsin, California, Pennsylvania, and New York--Minnesota has been slowly but steadily losing its clout among the top dairy states in the nation. We have lost over 10,000 dairy farms in just the last decade, and today, dairy farms are drying up at a rate of about three every single day. Milk production has dropped significantly as a result--nearly 20% in the last decade. 
What makes this especially troubling is that much of the decline in Minnesota's dairy industry can be traced directly to farm policies mandated outside of Minnesota's control, in Washington. And the outdated federal milk marketing orders program is a serious part of our dairy problems. 
The Midwest is one of the best places in the country for dairy. It should be growing and expanding in the Midwest, but because of the Government's outdated policies and programs, it is hurting and killing the dairy industry in the Midwest. 
The milk marketing orders is yet another example of a well-intentioned scheme dreamed up by Washington bureaucrats that has gone seriously awry. Instead of helping Minnesotans, the milk orders actually hurt the state's economy and penalizing its taxpayers, while benefiting dairy farmers outside the Midwest. 
The problem can be traced back to 1937, when Congress enacted the `Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act.' The legislation was created to encourage the milk production near the nation's major population centers and set a minimum price paid to dairy farmers for Class I milk. That federal `nudge' was necessary in some instances, because without refrigerated trucks, fluid milk could not be transported over long distances. 
In 1985, as part of that year's farm bill, Congress expanded the milk orders program to aid the dairy industry outside the Midwest by increasing the minimum price for Class I milk based on a ridiculous formula. 
This basically helps producers outside the Upper Midwest, while making dairy production less profitable for producers inside the Upper Midwest region. 
That is not because of anything that the farmers are doing, their productivity, the land, the climate, whatever. The only reason for the decline, again, is because of an outdated Federal dairy policy. 
This process is unfair and archaic. Above all, it is opposite in every way to the free market. 
The Upper Midwest dairy industry, one of the most efficient in the world, is only asking for a fair shake in this process. And so, Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today will amend one of the most inequitable components of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1937--the Class I milk price differentials. 
USDA is currently in the process of reforming its system of Federal Milk Marketing Orders. Unfortunately, the Class I differentials proposal released earlier this year was disappointing. Two options have been offered under the proposal. Option `1A'--the status quo option--is plainly unacceptable. Option `1B' does take a small step in the right direction, but it does not go far enough. However, a small step for reform is most certainly preferable to a step backward as `1A' would do. 
As short-term progress, I support Option `1B' because, as I have said, it is the only option USDA is currently considering that makes a move toward fairness in federal dairy policy. My bill would continue the reform beyond the small gains for equity that `1B' establishes. We cannot allow ourselves to become satisfied until we secure substantive federal dairy reform. 
Common sense would tell us that USDA's proposal of a small step toward market-policy is the compromise position for dairy reform. However, as you can imagine, there has been the typical, standard-fare outcry against any sort of reform--even the minimal reform that was offered in the form of Option `1B.' And surely that is little more than an acknowledgment on the part of USDA that equity and fairness really do matter in national dairy policy. 
USDA has explicitly expressed its preference for `1B.' However, my optimism is guarded, given the fact that `the status quo option' is being seriously considered as a measure of reform. 
It is all too likely that they may move us a step backward and call it reform. There is every reason to believe that USDA will succumb to the pressure of maintaining the unjustifiable status quo. 
So many constituencies have been built up around this antiquated dairy pricing policy, and now to try to put any fairness into the system we are going to have these outcries from across the country. 
So, in addition to the objective of shaping the policy debate beyond short-term fixes, I believe that we in the Upper Midwest must now proceed with progressive dairy reform in the event we once again, find ourselves standing alone in the name of justifiable, equitable, dairy policy. 
The Dairy Reform Act of 1998 establishes a uniform Class I price differential of $1.80 for each marketing area subject to an order. The newly proposed 11 Federal Milk Marketing Orders will remain in place to provide necessary over order premiums that would raise the $1.80 in some areas. This legislation directs us toward market-oriented reform because it removes the arbitrary, artificial price structure and its resulting interference with the market itself. 
As far as dairy policy is concerned, we're at a pivotal juncture. The groundwork is being laid for a national patchwork of regional compacts. Roughly half the country has either passed enabling compact legislation, is debating such legislation, or is involved in the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. We must either decide to support a national system, or regionalize. As I've said, USDA's Option `1B' is a small step in the right direction for dairy policy. The Dairy Reform Act brings us closer yet to substantive reform. The compact alternative, on the other hand, is not reform--it is retreat. It is anti-market and anti-consumer, by definition. 
There is no substantive, equity-based justification to support random Class I differentials. In fact, USDA's current federal marketing order system was deemed `arbitrary and capricious' by a Federal district court judge late last year. 
That is the fourth time that the courts have come out and said that the current dairy policies in this country are, again, arbitrary and capricious. So, bottom line, it means they are unfair, they are antimarket, they are anticonsumer. 
So, the case brought against USDA has been in the courts for 7 years, and the judge's ruling was no less than the fourth such proceeding in the history of the case. Given the outrageously drawn-out history of the case, the judge decided not to grant USDA's request to justify the pricing scheme. 
However, the ruling has been stayed now pending the appeal of the decision of the eighth circuit. After the courts have been cleared on the marketing order system, why is the USDA appealing? Why are they appealing to keep in place a system that the courts have ruled four times is basically unfair? Why don't they focus their efforts on changing the system, as the court has required, but, most important, changing the system to make sure that it is fair, that it does not discriminate against one part of the country over another, that it does not pick winners and losers, and it does not step on the necks of farmers in the Midwest? 
Under the current Federal order marketing system, the Government is picking winners and picking losers. This system of nonuniform differentials is inherently unfair, and I welcome debate of other dairy policy proposals for reform as well. 
Mr. President, finally, I just want to say the Dairy Reform Act of 1998 is simply a call to fairness, just fairness, in dairy policy. It is a statement in no uncertain terms that we who represent upper Midwest dairy farmers are going to fight for equitable reform, for market-driven policy. I urge my colleagues to take a look at it, to say what is fair. Why not have everybody on a level playing field? Why not give farmers all over the country the same opportunity for success or failure? Why not get consumers market-driven prices, rather than unfair Federal policies aimed at the Midwest? 
So, I urge my colleagues to give their support.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the pending business before the Senate is the Conference Report on H.R. 1757, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act. I take the other side of this issue. I strongly encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support passage of this important foreign policy initiative. 
As Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the Foreign Relations Committee, I spent many hours along with my colleagues on the Committee and with the Clinton Administration crafting legislation which will strengthen America's leadership role in the international arena. 
This Conference Report is a true `reform' bill. H.R.1757 abolishes two federal agencies and reorganizes their essential functions into the Department of State. It brings long overdue reform to the United Nations. It prioritizes our international affairs expenditures and authorizes important foreign policy initiatives. In fact, the core reforms contained in this legislation were originally approved by the Senate by a vote of 90-5 on June 17, 1997. 
I think it is fair to say that this is one of the most far-reaching and comprehensive foreign affairs bills undertaken by the Congress. This reflects Congressional acknowledgment of the need to create a more effective foreign affairs apparatus, both at home and at the UN, in order to confront the post-Cold War challenges to U.S. peace and security. 
The pending legislation is the result of a good-faith effort to accommodate conflicting perspectives on how we, as a nation, should allocate our resources. There were tough, lengthy negotiations on this package. We had to reconcile competing interests, and as a result, no one can claim that the 
final product contains everything that they would wish. I will be the first to say that this bill does not contain all of the reforms I originally sought. I would have preferred much more in the way of reforms and budget discipline. But this is a good agreement; and in this case, we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. 
Now, let me say that I understand some on the other side of the aisle may vote against this bill, and the President has indicated his intention to veto it, because of a provision that contains a part of the so-called `Mexico City' language. Specifically, section 1816 of this bill would prohibit organizations that receive U.S. taxpayer dollars from lobbying to change abortion laws--either for or against--overseas. 
Now, let me make clear some of the important initiatives that would not be enacted if this Conference Report is defeated. 
The President and the Secretary of State have indicated that payment of U.S. arrears to the United Nations is a top priority. This bill would authorize a three-year payment plan of $819 million, and an additional $107 million in debt reduction, to the United Nations and other international organizations in return for comprehensive management and fiscal reform of the United Nations. Rejection of this conference report would eliminate this funding and kill the management and fiscal reform measures. 
The President and the Secretary of State have agreed that a fundamental restructuring of U.S. foreign affairs agencies is long overdue. This bill eliminates the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and the U.S. Information Agency and folds their functions into the State Department, while still maintaining firewalls between the State Department and the essential broadcasting activities and public diplomacy of USIA. It also consolidates certain functions of the Agency for International Development into the State Department and 
grants the Secretary of State greater authority over foreign aid spending. Without the pending legislation, this reorganization cannot go forward. 
The Drug Czar, General McCaffrey, has agreed that keeping our children free from drugs is a top priority. This bill requires the State Department to develop and implement a comprehensive counternarcotics strategy. Without this bill, this important initiative will not go forward. 
The Secretary has been a tireless advocate for investment in the U.S. diplomatic infrastructure, citing examples of deplorable conditions of U.S. missions overseas, including ambassadors washing dishes in bathtubs, and outdated computer systems. This bill fully funds the capital investment fund and provides urgently needed resources for embassy construction in Berlin and Beijing. 
Containment of Saddam Hussein and support for a democratic movement in Iraq are essential to advancing democracy in the Gulf. This bill authorizes programs to assist a democratic Iraqi resistance, to create a Radio Free Iraq broadcast, and to reconstruct communities not under the control of Saddam Hussein. None of these programs will be authorized if this legislation is not enacted. 
Mr. President, this Conference Report lays out comprehensive and achievable reforms, both here at home in the nation's foreign affairs bureaucracy and in the United Nations. My visits to the U.N. as the U.S. Congressional Delegate to the U.N. General Assembly served to reinforce my commitment to salvage this organization. In this age, any organization burdened with a bloated bureaucracy and no mechanisms to control spending, will collapse under the weight of its own inefficiency. 
If we do not take a leadership role in reforming the U.N. now, a powerful, entrenched U.N. bureaucracy looking after its own short-term interests may condemn the U.N. to irrelevance as we move into the 21st Century. 
When Secretary of State Albright was serving as Ambassador to the U.N., she warned that `poor management' could be the U.N.'s `Achilles' heel' saying, ` I cannot justify to the taxpayers of my country some of the personnel arrangements, the sweetheart pension deals, the lack of accountability, the waste of resources, the duplication of effort and the lack of attention to the bottom line we often see around here.' 
Well, Congress cannot justify these excesses to the American taxpayers either. That is why we have stepped forward with a bipartisan reform plan that will compel the United Nations to address these concerns. As I stated previously, the pending legislation provides a three-year payment of $819 million in arrears to the United Nations and $107 million in debt reduction that the U.N. owes that U.S. in conjunction with the achievement of specific benchmarks that will help enhance the vitality of the U.N. 
Mr. President, this bill also takes steps to address another concern of mine, and that is the move to ensure that survivors of torture will be treated with the compassion which they deserve. One provision that I authored prohibits the involuntary return of any person to a country in which there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be in danger of being subjected to torture. Another provision authorizes the U.S. to contribute $3 million in fiscal 1998 and another $3 million in fiscal year 1999 to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, ensuring that treatment centers in more than 50 countries will continue to receive support. 
The United States should take a 
leading role in encouraging the establishment of additional programs, both at home and abroad, for the treatment of torture survivors. My home state of Minnesota is fortunate to have the first comprehensive treatment center in the United States for survivors of torture. The Center for Victims of Torture has treated over 500 patients since it was established in 1985, and has enabled them to become productive members of our communities by overcoming the atrocities suffered in their countries of origin. We must continue to support treatment centers, like the one in Minnesota, which help those who cannot help themselves--survivors of torture. Dedicating more of our U.N. voluntary funds for this purpose will help provide this important service to more needy survivors. 
I strongly believe the U.N. is an important forum for debate between member states and a vehicle for joint action when warranted. It is not a world government. However, the U.N. must endorse reforms that provide transparency and accountability so it is embraced as an important world forum for discussion and for coordinating action to promote international peace and security, not as a 
world government. I firmly believe that this package will improve the U.N. and assist it in winning back public support in the United States. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I commend the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for his diligence and perseverance in achieving this comprehensive reform plan. 
Little has changed since the Senate approved this legislation last November by voice vote, and last July by a vote of 90-5. It certainly would be disappointing, and I believe short-sighted, now to reject reorganization, payment of U.N. arrears, and other key foreign policy initiatives because the President has decided that single-issue politics is more important than U.S. foreign policy interests. My colleagues should heed the warning of the Secretary of State that failure to pay the U.N. arrears would result in a `shutdown for our national security policy.' If this is the case, then it would be irresponsible to reject these funds because of opposition to the prohibition on U.S. aid recipients against lobbying foreign governments to change their abortion laws. Mr. President, this legislation advances key American foreign policy interests, and I hope that all of my colleagues will support its passage.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the work of the 3,072 county governments nationwide, and in particular, the work of the 87 counties in my home state of Minnesota. Counties are often an invisible, but extremely important part of our intergovernmental system. County officials in my home state have also taken leadership roles in their national organization, namely Commissioner Randy Johnson, who chairs the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners and serves as the President of the National Association of Counties (NACo), and his colleague, Hennepin County Commissioner Peter McLaughlin, who chairs NACo's Large Urban County Caucus which represents the interests of the nation's 100 largest counties. 
Counties can trace their roots to the English shire of a thousand years ago. Serving a dual function, the shire acted as the administrative arm of the national government as well as the citizen's local government. The structural form of the shire was adopted along the eastern seaboard of North America by the colonists and adapted to suit the diverse economic and geographic needs of each of the colonists. 
Traditionally, counties performed state-mandated duties which included assessment of property, record keeping such as property and vital statistics, maintenance of rural roads, and administration of election and judicial functions. Today, counties are moving rapidly into other areas, undertaking programs relating to consumer protection, economic development, employment training, planning and zoning, and water quality, to name just a few. 
This week, counties across the country are celebrating National County Government Week. This celebration is an annual event for counties. First held in 1991, the goal of National County Government Week is to raise public awareness and understanding about the roles and responsibilities of the nation's counties. 
There have been activities at the national, state and local levels this week. More than 1,000 counties annually participate in National County Government Week by holding a variety of programs and events. These include tours of county facilities, presentations in schools, meetings with business and community leaders, recognition programs for volunteers, briefings on environmental projects, and adoption of proclamations. 
There is a theme each year for National County Government Week. This year, the theme has been `Creating Sustainable Communities.' Counties are being encouraged during National County Government Week to make their communities more livable by engaging their citizens in a process that promotes job growth and environmental stewardship. 
I know that NACo has encouraged counties this week to hold a town meeting or launch a series of community-wide dialogues to solicit citizen participation to identify the community's most pressing issues and to establish a comprehensive vision for the future. 
NACo has also suggested that counties develop a public participation strategy to identify and solve local problems that bring local government officials, business leaders, and community representatives together. 
Counties have brought their citizens closer to their government by getting them to come to county facilities to learn about county services--or by going where the people are. Some counties this week held an open house at the county courthouse and administration building. They created displays by county departments showing what each department does. Employees were on hand to describe the services they provide and their responsibilities. 
Some counties focused on their county's history as well. Local historical societies and libraries put together presentations or displays to inform citizens about the county's history. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to support the efforts of our county governments throughout the country, and in particular, my home state of Minnesota. National County Government Week has been successful in attempting to raise public awareness of the good work of our nation's county governments and how they help improve the lives of their residents.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today, across our country, Americans are commemorating Earth Day, a day that is vitally important to all who serve in this chamber. 
As my colleagues know, Earth Day was first observed on April 22, 1970. Its purpose was--and remains--to make people across the country and internationally reflect on the splendor of our world, an opportunity to get people to think about the earth's many gifts we often take for granted. Earth Day is a day for us to sit in the grass, take a walk, listen to the birds, and observe wildlife. Earth Day is a day for all of us to reflect on our dependence on our natural resources and recognize the care with which we must respect and use our natural resources, recycling and replenishing them where possible. 
The New York Times, on the original Earth Day, ran a story which in part read, 
Conservatives were for it. Liberals were for it. Democrats, Republicans and independents were for it. So were the ins, the outs, the Executives and Legislative branches of government. 
The goals of Earth Day 1970 were goals upon which all of us agree. They're goals still shared across our country, regardless of age, gender, race, economic status, or religious background. 
They're shared by this Senator, as well. I consider myself a conservationist and an environmentalist. I think everyone who serves in the Senate does. No one among us is willing to accept the proposition that our children or grandchildren will ever have to endure dirty water or filthy skies. Our children deserve to live in a world that affords them the same, or better, environmental opportunities their parents enjoy today. 
Mr. President, I believe today, on Earth Day 1998, we must speak of our responsibilities--our responsibilities to the Earth, to one another, and to our nation. It is clearly our responsibility to protect our earth and ensure its health. Congress has a duty to see to it that we are cautious and conscientious stewards of our natural resources. Since the late 1960s, Congress has met this challenge by enacting what has amounted to a `war on pollution.' By engaging in this battle, Congress and an increasingly large federal bureaucracy have been successful in centralizing power, expanding regulations, saddling taxpayers with more debt, and leaving states and localities without the power to meet local environmental challenges with local environmental solutions. Local governments have the best ability to improve the environment--and the most incentive to protect their people as well. 
To be sure, this war on pollution has had its successes. The Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act have improved our environment in countless ways. This Congress, and many before it, have spent billions upon billions of dollars in environmental protection plans, conservation plans, superfund clean-ups, endangered species act protections, wetlands protections, and wildlife refuges just to name a few. Our urban landscapes are no longer polluted by the thick, black smoke of industrial smokestacks. Our lakes and rivers are no longer the dumping ground for toxic sludge. We're recycling newspapers, glass, and plastics in record numbers--this, in fact, is a priority in many Senate offices, including my own. Through efforts such as the Conservation Reserve Program, Congress is working in partnership with the American people to ensure our generation leaves behind a cleaner Earth than the one we inherited. 
Over the past few years, however, issues of environmental concern have moved away from the consensus required of prudent public policy making and increasingly toward the margins. Americans have enabled this shift because even though we've become more environmentally aware, in many cases we've failed to become more environmentally educated, resulting in extremes on both sides of many issues. This past year, a 14-year old student in Idaho used a simple experiment to prove this observation. 
In a story reported across the country, young Nathan Zohner entered a project in a local science fair warning people of the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide, or DHMO. He described DHMO as a substance potent enough to prompt sweating and vomiting, cause severe burns in its gaseous state, or even kill if accidentally inhaled. Further, he claimed, DHMO contributes to erosion, decreases the effectiveness of automobile brakes, and can be found in acid rain and cancerous tumors. 
Nathan then asked roughly 50 people to sign a petition demanding strict control or a complete banning of the chemical. Not surprisingly, 43 said yes, while five would not sign and two were neutral. What's surprising to many who hear of this story is that dihydrogen monoxide is merely water--a substance, Mr. President, we all know is completely safe when handled and consumed properly. 
Sadly, it took the efforts of a 14-year-old boy to point out the drastic lengths to which our society has taken the rhetoric of environmental protection. Americans today fear everything from drinking water to beef--and are spurred on by leaders who are often masters of fiction, whipping up doomsday scenarios prompted by our supposedly careless treatment of Mother Earth. 
Mr. President, Nathan Zohner's experiment only scratched the surface of the insanity of over-zealous regulation. Regulations today cost Americans over $700 billion each year. That amounts to almost $7,000 per household. Let me repeat that--regulations in our country cost every American household nearly $7,000 per year. 
That is outrageous and it ultimately has nothing to do with protecting the earth or being good stewards. It is the result of a centralized federal bureaucracy which must not only justify its existence, but expand its purpose and scope in order to feed its insatiable appetite for power. 
Let's review the process. Congress enacts legislation and the President signs it into law. Simple enough, but what happens next? 
Well, Executive Agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency interpret what Congress meant and go on a rampage of issuing and enforcing regulations that often fly in the face of Congressional intent. In Congress, we protest that we didn't mean for that to happen, but rarely, if ever, are we able to reverse the process or rescind the regulation. We fail in our most basic role of oversight. And far too many times Congressional intent is thrown aside by these growing federal bureauracies and their own desires are then enforced. 
American businesses, workers, farmers, states, and localities are then forced to comply with the goals of the EPA's regulations and ordered to achieve those goals at the direction of the EPA as well. Too often, those being regulated aren't allowed to find unique and innovative means of compliance. 
They aren't allowed to tap into the same American ingenuity which, for the span of our nation's history, has provided workable solutions to achievable goals. 
They are approached by the federal government as adversaries, not as partners--and are therefore given a one-size-fits-all dictate by a government that most often either doesn't care or doesn't know any better. And millions of dollars are spent to do $10 worth of good. 
We all come to the floor and regularly recite polls and studies and intricate, numerical details. We often forget that real people and real jobs and real families mean a whole lot more than just the numbers behind the latest study. But one thing is certain: Americans do not expect that they should have to chose between environmental protections and their jobs or standard of living. When we do both, we can ensure a healthy environment and a strong economy and strong economic growth. 
According to a Wirthlin Worldwide Study conducted last August, only 11% of Americans consider themselves active environmentalists while 57% are sympathetic to environmental concerns. The same study found that 70% of Americans believe they should not have to choose between environmental quality and economic growth. 
Clearly, Americans want their leaders to work pro-actively towards a clean and healthy environment, but not to the extreme and certainly not at the cost of their safety, their jobs, or their individual freedoms. 
Mr. President, I suggest that on Earth Day we pledge to come together to improve our environment and strengthen our natural resources. I also suggest that we recognize both our failures and successes of the past. 
We must recognize that today, compliance with regulations is the rule--and that blatant attempts to pollute and circumvent regulations are the exception. With this in mind, I believe we must renew our nation's commitment to pragmatism. 
Government, on all levels, must do its part as watchdog while empowering those being regulated to develop unique and innovative means of compliance. 
At the same time, we must promote ideas that create public/private partnerships and encourage companies and individuals to take voluntary steps to protect our natural resources. Through education and awareness, we'll be able to approach environmental issues in a way that fosters compromises and ensures public policy is pursued in the best interests of all. 
It is time, Mr. President, that we commit ourselves to achieving real results through environmental initiatives. We must make sure that Superfund dollars go to clean-up, not to lawyers. We must actually restore endangered species and remove them from protections, rather than cordon off large areas of our Nation with little or no results. We must base our decisions on clear science with stated goals and flexible solutions. We must give our job creators more flexibility in meeting national standards as a means of eliminating the pervasive `command and control' approach that has infected so many Federal programs. And finally, the Federal Government needs to promote a better partnership between all levels of government, job-providers, environmental interest groups, and the taxpayers. 
With this in mind I believe that on this Earth Day we must collect the extremist rhetoric found on both sides of the environmental debate and flush it down the toilet--remember to flush twice, though, if it's a new, EPA-mandated low-flow toilet, or it might not be gone for good.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to take a few minutes this afternoon to rise and speak in support of Senator Coverdell's education bill, S. 1133. 
Mr. President, today the Senate continues its debate on this very important bill, a bill that is really out to promote education alternatives. It is a far-reaching bill which advances educational options, one which promotes quality education where it can best be achieved and that, Mr. President, is at the local level and by family involvement. It is sound policy, and I believe it is long overdue.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment expressing the sense of the Senate that projected budget surpluses should be dedicated to preserving and strengthening Social Security. This is a very simple and straightforward amendment. It asks Congress and the President to commit any budget surplus to reducing the Social Security payroll tax and use the tax reduction to set up personal retirement accounts for America's working men and women. 
Mr. President, the latest report from the Treasury Department shows that we may have a budget surplus as large as $60 to $80 billion this year, if revenues continue to grow at the current rate. As I have argued repeatedly, this surplus comes directly from taxes paid by hard-working Americans, and it is only fair to return it to them in the form of tax relief, national debt reduction, or Social Security reform. 
We all agree it is vitally important to save and strengthen Social Security. Many of my colleagues believe we should use the entire budget surplus to save the system, but the real question is how to do it. 
Finally, this amendment is complementary to Senator Roth's amendment. I believe the Roth amendment is an excellent one. I support it. The only difference is mine has the payroll tax reduction.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I thank the Senator from Texas for all her fine work on this amendment. 
I rise today to offer my strong support to Senator Hutchison's sense of the Senate calling on Congress to look at and to reserve any future budget surplus for tax relief and natural debt reduction or Social Security reform. But this amendment represents, I believe, some very sound, responsible fiscal policy, and again I commend Senator Hutchison for her leadership and her efforts on this very important issue. 
The question of how to use the potential budget surplus has been debated extensively before this Chamber. In my view, tax relief and debt reduction and Social Security reform are all equally important. Tax relief will reduce the growing tax burden on our American families. As Senator Hutchison pointed out, from 38 percent to more than 50 percent of the incomes of our average families in this country are going to support government rather than supporting their families. But if we give tax relief, it will increase incentives to work, save and invest. It will help keep our economy strong. Debt reduction and Social Security reform will address our long-term fiscal imbalances. These are two closely related issues, and I believe they go hand in hand. We can and we should be addressing both of these at the same time. 
There are compelling reasons for supporting this amendment. When we talk about how to use the budget surplus, let us not forget those who generated this surplus in the first place. If, as the administration is predicting, we do achieve a budget 
surplus, that surplus will have come directly from working Americans, from taxes paid by corporations, from individuals and investors. Clearly, this money belongs to the American people. It has been an overcharge. It is only fair to return it to the taxpayers who earned that money in the first place. 
Families today, again, are taxed at the highest level since World War II, with 38 percent to 50 percent of a typical family budget going to pay taxes on the Federal, State and local level. Last year's tax cuts, I believe, moved us in the right direction, but in reality those tax cuts were too little, too late, too small. After spending the unexpected $225 billion revenue windfall last year, busting the 1993 spending caps, Washington delivered tax cuts only one-third as large as lawmakers had promised back in 1994. 
Recent polls show that 89 percent of the American people believe that taxes on all levels of government should not consume more than 25 percent of their income. Again, 89 percent of Americans believe that all levels of taxes should not consume more than 25 percent of their income, and 77 percent also believe that estate taxes should be eliminated. 
Lower tax rates, again, increase incentives to work, save and invest. They help families to maximize their income and improve their standard of living. They allow families to allocate their precious dollars to meet their own needs, not to go out and meet the needs of disconnected spenders located in Washington. 
So, again, cut taxes and families today, who are forced to scrimp just to cover their monthly bills and their taxes, would find that they have more money to spend on their children's education, on their health care expenses, on food, clothing and insurance, et cetera. If we are truly interested in giving our families the tools that they need to help raise their children, isn't it about time that Washington cut their taxes instead of limiting their choices? 
Beyond the direct benefits to families, tax cuts can also have a substantial and very positive impact on the economy as a whole. John F. Kennedy proved it. Ronald Reagan proved it. So we should not spend a budget surplus that does not yet exist. If a surplus, however, does develop, the Government has no claim on it because the Government did not generate it. So I do not believe Washington should be first in line to reap the benefits of any surplus. 
A surplus, again, will be the direct result of the hard work of the American people, and, therefore, it should be returned to the American people, either in the form of additional tax relief or beginning to pay down this tremendous $5.6 trillion national debt. 
So, Mr. President, a vote for the Hutchison-Grams amendment is a vote for families. I believe it is a vote for fiscal sensibility in Washington, and I urge my colleagues very strongly to give it their support. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak for a few minutes about the violent storms of this past weekend in south-central Minnesota and to express my concern for the many, many victims of this tragedy. Tornados and severe thunderstorms ripped through Minnesota Sunday evening, tearing through St. Peter, Hanska, and Lonsdale and forcing the evacuation of the small town of Comfrey. 
In the wake of the devastation, my thoughts and prayers go out to the people of south-central Minnesota. I would especially like to express my condolences to the families of Dustin Schneider, the young boy whose life was taken by the storm near St. Peter, and Louis Mosenden of Hanska, who died Monday as a result of injuries he suffered when a tornado hit his home. Our thoughts and prayers are with their loves ones. 
Mr. President, along a 60-mile path, hundreds of houses, factories, barns, silos, churches, and schools have been reduced to rubble. Most of the buildings in St. Peter were either destroyed or severely damaged. The smaller community of Comfrey was almost completely destroyed. Power is still out in both towns. 
In all, more than 700 houses and apartments were destroyed or damaged to the point that they are now uninhabitable. Another 1,800 have sustained severe damage. Thousands of residents have been forced to go seek public shelters or the homes of friends or relatives. More than 100 businesses have been damaged in the area. 
Even with the massive damage, the initial response to this disaster by the State of Minnesota, the Minnesota National Guard, Minnesota relief agencies, and local law enforcement has been swift and efficient. Because of this quick response, and the cooperation we are seeing between state, local, and federal officials, I am confident south-central Minnesota will recover from this natural disaster. I intend to survey the area this weekend, after state and local officials have completed their damage assessments. My staff is already on the scene, and is meeting today with representatives of the Federal Emergency Management Agency in St. Peter as they inspect the damage. 
Since first receiving word of the storms, I have been working closely with state and local officials to bring federal assistance to the region and begin the recovery efforts. I want to assure my constituents that the federal government will do whatever is needed to help the people of our state cope with the devastation. Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson today forwarded to President Clinton his formal request for a disaster declaration, and I have written to the President as well to reiterate the urgency of Governor Carlson's request. 
Mr. President, the people of Minnesota have faced disaster before. It was almost one year ago when the terrible spring floods swept through western Minnesota and devastated so many lives. We learned a lot about each other during the difficult months that followed, when it seemed the clean-up would never end and life would never be the same again. We were reminded what it means to be a community, and how communities come together during troubled times. 
With that experience fresh in mind, I know that Minnesotans will once step forward and help one another rebuild from this weekend's tornados. And I want the victims of this latest disaster to know that they will not be forgotten.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Knights of Columbus and join them in the celebration of 116 years of carrying out their mission of `Unity, Service, and Patriotism.' In the fall of 1881, a group of men, under the direction of Father Michael J. McGivney, met at St. Mary's Church in New Haven, Connecticut, for the purpose of establishing a fraternal benefit society within the Catholic Church. That small meeting was the genesis for a movement which now claims nearly 1.6 million members (4.5 million including family members) in countries throughout the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific. 
After being granted legal corporation on March 29, 1882, the Knights of Columbus began spreading their message of pride in faith and nation. Indeed, the very name Knights of Columbus was chosen to reflect this premise, as it signifies the importance of Christopher Columbus' discovery of America to the Catholic Church. 
In times of national crisis, the Knights of Columbus have consistently heeded the call for service and sacrifice. This was perhaps best exemplified during two of the most pivotal events in our Nation's history which occurred this century: World War I and World War II. During these trying times, the Knights of Columbus offered an array of support programs for the men and women of our armed forces, including bond drives and blood donor programs. 
In addition, at the conclusion of World War II and the onset of the Cold War, the Knights of Columbus aided in the crusade against Communist expansion by sponsoring 1,300 educational discussion groups, as well as speakers' bureaus, advertisements and radio addresses. The Knights of Columbus' efforts during the Cold War were acknowledged by President Harry S. Truman. 
While those accomplishments are indeed admirable, equally impressive are the often unsung works undertaken by individual Knights of Columbus Councils each day. In 1996, Knights of Columbus members reported 48,966,132 hours of volunteer service and donated $105,976,102 to charity. 
Currently, 229 Knights of Columbus Councils serve parishes and communities throughout my home state of Minnesota. The services undertaken by each Council cover many areas and aid a number of different charities and causes, ranging from providing loans for college students to assisting the sick and the elderly in getting to Sunday Mass. 
Other examples of service activities in Minnesota include: a fund drive in support of the construction of Catholic schools conducted by Council 7604 in Eagan, Minnesota; the bowling team from Council 961 in St. Cloud, Minnesota, which raised over $6,000 for Big Brothers-Big Sisters; and the sponsoring of youth hockey by Council 3166 in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to report that the `World's Largest Catholic Family Fraternal Organization' has a commanding presence in Minnesota and will continue to provide communities with an excellent example of how to live a fulfilling life of maximum service to God and country. I am honored to have this opportunity to acknowledge and thank the Knights of Columbus for all their work, and offer my sincerest congratulations on the 116th anniversary of their founding.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I just rise for a few moments this afternoon to pay tribute to the University of Minnesota basketball team--the Golden Gophers of Minnesota. 
Just a little over a year ago I stood here on the Senate floor saluting the Minnesota Gophers basketball team for their accomplishment of winning the Big Ten championship. That was the team that eventually went on to the NCAA Final Four. 
Mr. President, I want to take time to salute an equally deserving team--and that is the 1998 NIT champions, the Minnesota Golden Gophers, who defeated the Penn State Nittany Lions last night by a score of 79-72. 
Now, this team overcame the loss of many key players from last year's Final Four squad, but the leadership from seniors Sam Jacobson and Eric Harris, and the excellent play from Kevin Clark and Quincy Lewis helped the Gophers improve from their slow start this season to finish the year by winning eight of their last nine games. 
Every member on the team contributed to the success of this Gopher team, leading to the Gophers' sixth consecutive 20-win season. 
Mr. President, Coach Clem Haskins received many coach-of-the-year awards last year. But I must say, the job he did this year is equally impressive and truly deserves recognition today. 
So, again, Mr. President, I rise to salute the 1997-1998 NIT champions, the Golden Gophers of the University of Minnesota. 
Thank you very much. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I also rise today to support this amendment. The United States has been called a `deadbeat'; it has been called a `bully' at the United Nations. The United States 
has been accused of being `heavy-handed' and not doing its `fair share' for the international community. The United States has been berated and belittled at every turn by many of the countries that have been benefiting most from U.S. generosity--both in terms of security guarantees and also in terms of economic assistance. 
Mr. President, America bashing is a popular pastime at the United Nations, and this administration is doing nothing to stop it. In fact, this administration has been contributing to the feeding frenzy by trying to undercut the terms of the U.N. reform plan instead of standing by the deal that it helped negotiate. If this administration is encouraging anti-American sentiment at the United Nations in order to gain leverage with Congress to water down the reforms, well, it is unconscionable and it is not going to work. 
Mr. President, this administration has been so weak in defending the honor and the reputation of the United States at the United Nations, and so negligent in highlighting the great contributions that America is making to promote international security, that we feel compelled to direct the administration to do so with this amendment. 
Now, while the United States is being called a `deadbeat' regarding its international obligations, well, the facts say something quite different. The United States may owe arrears to the United Nations, but that is only because the United States received no credit at the United Nations for the $2.97 billion that U.S. taxpayers spent in fiscal year 1997 implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions--again, nearly $3 billion of U.S. taxpayer money to help implement U.N. Security Council resolutions last year alone. 
We received no credit for the more than $6.4 billion that the U.S. taxpayers have spent to date in and around Bosnia. We will receive no credit for the emergency funding of an additional $487 million for the Bosnia mission and the $1.4 billion for U.S. deployments in the Persian Gulf that the President is asking for in this bill. 
As we all know, our troops are in the gulf to enforce U.N. Security Council Resolution 687 on Iraq. But that does not mean that we will get credit for our contribution at the United Nations. And while we do need to settle our disputed arrears to the United Nations, Mr. President, we should not be myopic. The U.S. taxpayers are doing far more than just pulling their weight in the international community. 
Mr. President, this amendment is necessary to ensure that all U.N. member states are aware of the great sacrifices that the American taxpayers are making to support U.N. Security Council resolutions since U.N. bookkeeping obscures the facts. 
First, the amendment states that U.S. taxpayers should be commended for their generous support in maintaining international peace and security; the United Nations should publicly acknowledge this support and immediately reduce the U.S. peacekeeping assessment to 25 percent that is in accordance with U.S. law. 
Second, it calls on the President to direct the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations to introduce a Security Council resolution requiring the Security Council to report to all member states on the amount that the United States has spent supporting U.N. Security Council resolutions just since January 1, 1990, as determined by the Department of Defense. 
Third, it requests the Secretary of State to notify all 
members of the Security Council on the amounts--both credited and uncredited--that DOD has spent supporting U.N. Security Council resolutions, again, just since January 1, 1990. 
And, fourth, Mr. President, it requires the President to report back to the appropriate committees in the House and the Senate within 45 days on the efforts to carry out these steps in this amendment. 
Now, I do not know how far this amendment will go toward getting the U.S. taxpayers the recognition that they deserve for U.S. support of the United Nations, but I do hope it will put the U.S. arrears in perspective. Both the administration and the Congress agree that the U.S. owes only $54 million to the U.N. regular budget and $658 million for peacekeeping expenses. Now, that is $712 million. You compare that to the nearly $3 billion the Department of Defense spent in fiscal year 1997 alone--we spent more than four times that amount last year alone--implementing U.N. Security Council resolutions. 
Mr. President, throughout the history of the United Nations, the United States has always been its most generous donor. American taxpayers currently are billed for 25 percent of the entire U.N. operating budget and 30.4 percent of the peacekeeping budget, although the United States now pays 25 percent, as I mentioned, in accordance with a law passed by, again, a Democratic-controlled Congress and signed into law by President Clinton. 
Currently, those bills total more than $600 million annually. In contrast, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and China--which has a veto in the Security Council--only pay about 1 percent of the entire U.N. regular budget. The floor of assessment levels was just lowered from .01 percent of the U.N. operating budget, from about $106,000 a year, to .001 percent, or under $11,000. So each contribution from those nations will not be enough to even cover one-tenth of the salary of one of their highly priced bureaucrats. It will only pay about one-tenth of the salary of one of their bureaucrats at the United Nations. That is all they pay. 
Despite this fact, each member of the United Nations has one vote on budget issues. In addition to the assessed payments I just mentioned, the United States voluntarily and generously contributes hundreds of millions of dollars to programs like UNICEF, UNHCR, and the U.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. So, Mr. President, the United States pays more than its fair share for world peace, stability, and humanitarian efforts. 
That being said, we do need to settle our disputed arrears to the United Nations. We did engage in good-faith negotiations with the administration, and we made a deal on the U.N. reform package. The Senate, with the full support of the administration, passed this bipartisan legislation twice--by a 90-5 rollcall vote and again by unanimous consent. The only thing that prevented this agreement from becoming law was a dispute over an unrelated issue. 
This administration then decided to forgo nearly $1 billion for the United Nations and $3.5 billion for the IMF so it could preserve the ability for U.S. grant recipients to lobby foreign governments to liberalize their abortion laws. 
Mr. President, Secretary Albright recently said that failure to pay the U.N. arrears would result in a `shutdown of our national security policy.' I must admit, I was somewhat taken aback by that statement, as I was not aware that 
this administration had officially subcontracted our national security policy to the United Nations. 
Indeed, I will fight to make sure that it will never happen. But if the United States truly is suffering a loss of prestige and effectiveness in the global arena because of our U.N. arrears, as the administration contends, then it is irresponsible for this administration to jeopardize our security interests and influence for domestic political considerations. 
I hope that in the near future Congress will pass the U.N. reform package and the President will sign it into law so we can put this small matter of the disputed arrears behind us. Regardless of the fate of that legislation, I also believe it is important that we pass this amendment so that the rest of the world will be aware of what we all know, and that is the huge sacrifice that the United States taxpayers make to support U.N. Security Council activities. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Kentucky. 
I rise to briefly state my strong support for the $3.5 billion in NAB, the new arrangements to borrow, and also the additional $14.5 billion in replenishment. The conditions attached to this amendment, I believe, are a good compromise based on the Hagel-Gramm-Roberts bill that was introduced last week, which will make the IMF, I believe, work better in the future than it has worked up to now. It is my hope there can be further improvements also in conference. 
I thank the majority leader Senator Lott for his strong leadership and support and also the hard work that Senator Hagel and Senator Roberts, also Senator McConnell and Senator Phil Gramm, Senator Mack of Florida and also Senator Craig, among others, who have worked very hard to reach this compromise over the last few days. I really believe the IMF is too important at this time not to replenish, not to continue to show strong American leadership in this area. 
The financial crisis of other nations can no longer exist in a vacuum. They affect every other nation as we move closer to a global economy. I encourage the support of my colleagues for this very important amendment. 
I thank you very much, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished Senator from Arizona today to offer this amendment striking some add-on, non-emergency items from the supplemental appropriations. 
This amendment represents sound and responsible fiscal policy. 
I want to take this opportunity to commend Senator McCain for his consistent leadership and persistent efforts to ensure Congress exercises fiscal responsibility. 
Supplemental appropriations legislation has routinely become a Christmas tree. Every year it is loaded with all kinds of unauthorized, non-emergency projects, stuck here and there, until it reaches the point where it has grown out of control. 
Supplemental appropriations, by definition, are supposed to be enacted when the need for additional funds is too urgent to be postponed until the next regular appropriation is considered. 
Today, this legislation has become a major vehicle for lawmakers to bring home the bacon. In fact, not one of the items listed in this amendment is too urgent to wait for consideration under the proper procedures. 
Many of us come down to the floor each year demanding this irresponsible practice come to an end. Unfortunately, it has been a fight to persuade Congress that this is the only sensible course lately. 
Taxpayer dollars are too often considered `free money' here in Washington, and the thought of more `free money' is creating a feeding frenzy on Capitol Hill, particularly when there might be `budget surplus' in sight. 
As I've said before in this Chamber, the rush to spend reminds me of the free-for-all that results when you toss a piece of raw meat to a pack of hungry dogs. 
Washington will pounce on a stack of tax dollars and spend, spend, spend until it's all gone--until the bones have been stripped of every last morsel of meat. 
This is nothing new, of course. But just because it has become habit on Capital Hill doesn't mean it's right. 
The greatest concern I have about these add-on, non-emergency items and the supplemental appropriations bill is that this spending will consume a possible budget surplus that should rightfully be returned to the taxpayers in the form of tax relief, national debt reduction, or Social Security reform. 
The President is maintaining that not one penny of a potential surplus would be used for spending increases or tax cuts, and every penny should go to save Social Security. But in his fiscal year 1999 budget, he has already proposed to spend some $43 billion of the surplus. 
Now the President has proposed a supplemental appropriation that will spend another $2.5 billion of this surplus. 
I believe strongly that Congress owes it to the taxpayers not to spend any surplus for government programs. 
After all, the Government has no claim on any surplus, because the Government didn't generate it--the sweat and hard work of the American people created it, and it therefore should be returned to the people first. 
Washington should not be first in line for this surplus. If we are serious about saving Social Security, we should first stop looting the Social Security surplus by cutting government spending, returning the borrowed surplus to the trust funds, and beginning real reform now. 
Congress has done very little to shrink the size of the Government by eliminating wasteful and unnecessary Federal programs. It instead continues to increase the size of the Government. 
As I've said before, it this is a race to prove who can be the most `compassionate' with taxpayers' dollars, it's a race nobody will win, and one the taxpayers most certainly will lose. The truth is simple: You can't buy compassion. 
A big, expensive Federal Government is a bad deal for Americans. If Congress could roll back government domestic spending back to 1969 levels, a family of four would keep $9,000 a year more of its earnings than it does today. Millions of families would pay no income tax at all. 
Unfortunately, tax-and-spend--not tax relief and streamlining--is the policy Washington is now pursuing. 
Since the 1970's, Congress has passed a number of bills to make it difficult to use supplementals to bypass spending controls. But they don't appear to be working. In fact, Congress has provided $5 billion each year in emergency spending since the establishment of spending caps. All of the supplementals are offset. 
Breaching the spending caps would be fiscally irresponsible at a time in which domestic discretionary spending continues to grow and large numbers of wasteful programs are allowed to continue. 
Although our short-term fiscal condition has improved in recent years, we still have a long way to go to address our long-term fiscal imbalances which pose a serious threat to our future. 
We must exercise fiscal discipline to ensure the Federal budget will be balanced--and stay balanced--without new taxes and without new spending. 
In conclusion, there might be merits for some of these add-on, non-emergency programs. But they should undergo the normal authorizing process. Non-emergency add-ons destroy the purpose of supplemental appropriations and weaken our fiscal discipline. 
Again, supplemental appropriations, by definition, are supposed to be enacted when the need for additional funds is too urgent to be postponed until the next regular appropriation is considered. Again, today, this legislation has become a major vehicle for lawmakers to bring home the bacon, and, in fact, not one of the items listed in this amendment is too urgent to wait for consideration under proper procedures. So they should be stricken out of this legislation. 
I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. 
I yield the floor.

It comes at a critical time. Test results released last month show that American high school seniors score far below their peers from other countries in math and science. 
Education Secretary Riley called the scores `unacceptable,' and indicated that schools are failing to establish appropriate academic standards.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon just briefly to recognize National Agriculture Week. It is no secret that America's farmers are the most productive in the world, and it is so appropriate that we take a few moments to recognize their many, many contributions. 
Agriculture is traditionally viewed as small family farms producing for a regional market. Local grain elevators, shipping interests, processors, banks, and consumers are all vital components in meeting the demands of a continually changing domestic and world market. 
From the grocery store in Minneapolis to the rural implement dealer, each of us has an interest in ensuring a vibrant agricultural economy. But the foundation remains the individual producer. These are families who rise each morning and labor into the night to provide each of us the food we eat. These independent-minded individuals are heavy on common sense, and they are not predisposed to taking short cuts or pat answers. 
Without a doubt, some of the best advice I receive comes from the savvy business men and women who are commonly called `farmers.' 
I was raised on an old-fashioned dairy farm in rural Minnesota. I know firsthand the hard work and dedication that it takes to do a job that is often overlooked and unrecognized. 
However, a farmer's responsibility goes far beyond producing a crop or making sure that the cows are milked. To ensure continued productivity, he also must be an environmental steward of the land that he cultivates. In many cases, this leads to lower fertilizer inputs and enhanced wildlife habitat. 
Mr. President, the last few years have brought about some great changes in agriculture. The 1996 farm bill was a step, I believe, in the right direction, yet the job is not yet finished. If farmers are to produce for the marketplace, we must give them the tools they need to manage their operations. 
This includes addressing such issues as regulatory reform, risk-management options, and Federal crop insurance reforms. By providing farmers with the flexibility to manage their own businesses, we are ensuring a better future for everyone. 
In an effort to produce for changing markets, groups of farmers across Minnesota are exploring ways to enhance their income and productivity through value-added ventures and cooperative research agreements. 
It is this spirit of innovation that should be encouraged and not stifled by the heavy hand of Government. These farmers are the leaders of tomorrow who will ensure a safe and steady food supply for America and the world well into the next century. 
So in short, Mr. President, we owe all those involved in agriculture a debt of gratitude, and I am very proud to join my colleagues in recognizing the outstanding contributions of America's agricultural sector. 
With that, Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this morning along with my colleague to make a few brief observations about Social Security and how we can preserve and strengthen it. I thank my colleague from Wyoming for reserving floor time so that we can address this critical issue. 
I was shocked by a recent poll revealing that Americans would rather put their Social Security money under their mattress than entrust it to the Government. According to that poll, 46 to 56 percent of Americans said they would prefer to put their retirement savings under their mattress--only 28 to 35 percent would rely on Uncle Sam. Why are so many Americans skeptical about the government-run Social Security program? The answer is simple: in its present form, the program is a raw deal for most Americans. It will not be there for baby boomers, and it will heavily burden our children and grandchildren. 
Mr. President, the American people's skepticism and worries about Social Security are well founded. Social Security's future is being challenged by a massive demographic shift now underway that will continue for the next 33 years. In 1941, there were approximately 100 workers for every retiree. Today, there are only three workers for every retiree; that ratio will soon drop to two workers per retiree. Even though Congress has increased the payroll tax 51 times since Social Security's creation, the program is clearly headed for insolvency and the future tax burden on workers will be overwhelming. 
The Congressional Budget Office warns that if these problems are not fixed, federal deficits could shatter our future economy, placing a heavy burden on our children and grandchildren. The federal deficit would increase from $107 billion in 1996 to $11 trillion in 2035. The national debt would balloon to $91 trillion during that same period of time. Such rapid growth of federal debt and the deficit would bankrupt this nation, making any bailout impossible. 
Mr. President, I welcome the fact that the Administration has started to pay attention to the Social Security crisis. I am pleased we all agree that Social Security is facing serious financial and demographic challenges. It is a fiscal disaster-in-the-making, unsustainable in its present form. We desperately need reform to preserve and strengthen the Social Security program. The sooner we do it, the less pain we will suffer in the future. But the real question is, how we should go about it? 
It is obvious to me that simply funneling money back into Social Security won't help fix the problem. It will not re-build the fund's assets for current and future beneficiaries and it does not address the flaws of the current finance mechanism. 
The fundamental problem with the Social Security program is that it is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis. The Social Security payroll taxes are not directly invested in assets, and retirees' benefits are not paid from the sale of earlier invested assets. Instead, the current payroll taxes are largely paid directly to current retirees, and the federal government uses the remainder to fund other programs--stealing from the Social Security trust fund to pay for other programs. The Social Security's trust-fund `assets' consist of nothing but Treasury IOUs that can only be redeemed if Congress cuts other spending, raises taxes, or borrows from the public to raise the cash. 
Without fundamental reform, using general revenue to pay for Social Security is nothing but an increase in the payroll tax on American workers. I believe that reforming the Social Security program to ensure its solvency is vitally important, and the sooner we get about the task of doing it the better. Any projected budget surplus should be used partly for that purpose, using it to build real assets by changing it from pay-go to a pre-funded system. 
Yet, I also believe strongly that Congress owes it to the taxpayers to dedicate a good share of the surplus for tax relief. After all, the government has no claim on any surplus because the government did not generate it--it will have been borne of the sweat and hard work of the American people, and it therefore should be returned to the people in the form of tax relief. 
Washington and bureaucrats should not be first in line to take any of the surplus and spend it. It should go back to the taxpayers. 
Should we save Social Security first or provide tax cuts first? My answer is we should do both. We had a similar debate last year about whether we should balance the budget first and provide tax cuts later. The truth is we can absolutely do both at the same time, as long as we have the political will to reform Social Security. 
The President is maintaining that not one penny of the surplus should be used for spending increases or tax cuts--that every penny should go to save Social Security. But in his FY 1999 budget, he has already proposed to spend some $43 billion of the surplus. That's an obvious contradiction. 
Moreover, in the next five years, the President will have to use more than $400 billion out of $600 billion from the Social Security trust funds surplus to pay for his government programs. 
If we're serious about saving Social Security, we should first stop looting the Social Security surplus to fund general government programs, return the borrowed surplus to the trust funds by cutting government spending, and begin real Social Security reform. 
Mr. President, several other recent polls prove that Americans are increasingly concerned about the future solvency of the current Social Security program. A USA Weekend poll showed that one out of two Americans fear they would have inadequate Social Security benefits. 
In a survey conducted during a Social Security conference I hosted recently in my home state of Minnesota, we found that 73 percent of the participants fear they may not achieve a secure retirement from Social Security. 
Eighty-five percent believe America's young people will be facing a major financial crisis and significantly higher taxes because of current and future spending on older generations. 
Eighty percent believe most people could make more money investing their retirement funds in the private sector than they get from Social Security. 
Seventy-nine percent would support conversion of the current pay-go system to a prefunded system. 
Again, 79 percent, or 8 out of 10 Americans, would support the conversion of the current pay-go system to a prefunded system. 
Clearly, the American people want reforms to ensure that any retirement benefits continue to be available to all Americans. And I believe we should consider any Social Security reforms that will provide a better retirement safety net for all Americans by allowing compound interest to work. 
Mr. President, the success of Social Security reform depends on informing and educating the American people. Only a knowledgeable public can make a sound decision about how we should go about saving Social Security. 
As a first step in this effort, I have introduced a bill to require statements providing the American people with essential information on their future Social Security benefits. The information provided by the Social Security Information Act will give us a better idea of what our Social Security benefits will be at retirement age, as well as a comparison to what those retirees would get if Social Security dollars had been invested privately. They need to have that information. They need to have that comparison. Americans need to know up front what they can and can't expect of the Social Security System compared against what they are paying into it and what their employer is contributing. 
Giving individuals an honest accounting of that information serves, I think, the very fundamental objectives of the Social Security Program by enabling workers to judge to what degree they should supplement their contributions with other forms of retirement savings such as pension plans, personal savings, and investment. The Social Security Information Act is a good first step in the fundamental reform that needs to be undertaken. 
Mr. President, in closing, I am looking forward to working with my colleagues and the administration in exploring every possible solution that we can to strengthen Social Security and to help provide better benefits for today's recipients and also provide better benefits for future generations. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Wyoming, and I yield the floor.  
Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Camp Fire Boys and Girls of America on the occasion of the 88th anniversary of its founding in March 1910. 
The Camp Fire Girls, now the Camp Fire Boys and Girls since being incorporated in 1978 to include boys' programs, was started in 1910 by Dr. and Mrs. Luther Halsey Gulick of Sebago, Maine. The Gulicks founded this nonprofit organization to encourage girls to reach beyond traditional limitations. Across the country, Camp Fire was integral in developing America's view of children as an investment in the future of our nation. Within two short years, the new organization of Camp Fire Girls, Inc. was organized in 42 states, one of which was my home state of Minnesota. 
Camp Fire clubs grew quickly in Minnesota, making headlines when girls marched off to camp at Square Lake near Stillwater. With groups consisting primarily of high school and university students, nearly 400 girls were involved in Minneapolis Camp Fire. A 1912 article in the Ladies Home Journal inspired a group of girls from St. Paul to start their own chapter. Dr. F.S. Cone, pastor of the St. Anthony Park Methodist Church, agreed to sponsor this group of eight girls and their 21-year-old leader. 
Currently serving approximately 670,000 participants annually, 45 percent of whom are male, Camp Fire Boys and Girls is organized in 42 states and the District of Columbia. In 1997, the Minnesota Lakes Council alone served 10,865 youth, aiming to provide them with the necessary tools to live their lives productively in an ever-changing environment. 
The Camp Fire Boys and Girls is centered on three concepts: Work, Health and Love (WOHELO). The organization's objective is to provide opportunities for youth to realize their potential as caring, responsible and self-directed individuals. This objective is achieved by providing three main categories of youth development programs: club programs, outdoor programs and Self Reliance programs. Through these efforts, the Camp Fire Boys and Girls offer a variety of courses to provide youth with an opportunity to build their self-esteem, develop leadership skills, practice cooperation and conflict resolution skills and provide service to their community. 
None of this would be possible were it not for the adult volunteers who are the foundation of the Camp Fire Boys and Girls. Currently there are more than 571 men and women in Minnesota who, in the spirit of Dr. and Mrs. Gulick, invest their time and talents to ensure that our youth are prepared for the challenges of tomorrow. Adult volunteers touch the lives of young people by serving as excellent role models and teachers, as well as caring friends. 
Mr. President, for 88 years the Camp Fire Boys and Girls of America has been teaching our youth the skills they need to become effective leaders and responsible citizens. This is truly grounds for celebration.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senate resolution 187. That is the resolution sponsored by Senator Mack directing the administration to pursue a resolution criticizing China's--only China's--human rights record at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. 
As you may know, I earlier objected to an attempt to UC this resolution on the floor, without benefit of committee consideration. I understand that many Senators do not believe a resolution is controversial, but, when it comes to China, I do believe it can be controversial--very controversial. You should too, because quite clearly China legislation, whether it be resolutions or sanctions, is, simply stated, I believe, to be counterproductive. 
Yesterday, this resolution was considered in a business meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee. At that time I offered an amendment which would expand the resolution to include other countries listed in the State Department's annual human rights report. In my judgment, it is incredible that we would pick just one country to criticize when there are even more egregious offenders out there. 
I did not object to having China on that list. We can put China at the head of the list, in the middle of the list, or at the bottom of the list. It should be on the list, but I do not think it should be on a list of only one country, and that is just China when, again, the State Department report on human rights violations has a long list of other countries. And if we are serious about looking at human rights violations around the world, we should also call those into question. 
My problem with this resolution is, again, that it is one of many, many legislative attempts, I believe, to just single out China. They are clearly counterproductive, in my judgment. China certainly does--it does have to make more progress on human rights, but it also has made significant progress as well. I also supported an amendment in our business committee yesterday in the Foreign Relations Committee by Senator Feinstein that would have balanced this resolution with language citing some of the improvements that were listed in the Human Rights Report. 
The right thing to do--and I repeat, the right thing to do--is oppose these kinds of public attacks and join me in efforts to pursue human rights violations in China through quiet diplomacy--through personal visits, including those I have had with President Jiang. These high-level contacts between the United States and Chinese officials, I believe, can be far more productive. 
Yesterday, a comment was made that we have to make this kind of public statement to the whole world to better focus attention on human rights concerns. 
I believe we do have maybe a responsibility to hold these human rights violations up for world scrutiny. But, again, shouldn't they include all countries that are guilty of human rights violations? 
Why do we think that standing up and publicly criticising China, and only China, following repeated efforts in the past, does any good? Do our words effect changes? No--I believe our efforts to build relationships with the Chinese, to talk to them privately about the need to improve and to see that changes are in their best interest are what make a difference. Resolutions make strong statements but I believe they do not accomplish the goals that we intend. 
China has become the whipping boy. 
A continued strong relationship with China will in fact enable us to have a much stronger impact on their reforms than any strong-arm tactics. I agree such tactics can get the world's attention, but do they actually help those who are in prison or face other forms of repression inside China? There is a growing middle class in China. As they are more exposed to the West through our products and our people, the Chinese people themselves are going to be placing more demands on their leaders for change. 
And that is already happening. The growing middle class in China, with their exposure to the West, is putting more demands on the Chinese leaders for change than we will ever accomplish from outside of their borders with these types of resolutions. 
My State has also been long involved in various people to people programs with China, programs which have pursued better relationships between our countries. We value those relationships. They have helped us improve relations with China, and they have helped China achieve the progress it has made economically and politically. I believe threats and censure may only close the door on our relationship with China. And if that happens we will then lose any opportunity that we will have to effect change. 
If we are not there, if we are not involved, if we do not have relationships with China, and if they in fact close the door to us, then what kind of an effect or influence are we going to have on change inside of China? I think it is a lot easier to change their mind if we are there than if we are not. 
As I said previously, it is the volume of efforts--the legislation, the resolutions and the sanctions--and constant criticism that has been the focus of my opposition. Many believe they can change China through public humiliation. 
Each new effort to bash China makes it more difficult, I believe, for our Government to formally address concerns of human rights and religious persecution. 
My point here is just to try to educate America, the Senate, Christians and all people who are concerned about human rights and religious freedom that this is not a `free vote'; it is something we should think about before we vote for it, because, in my view, again, just singling out China is very counterproductive. 
Mr. President, now I want to get back to the language of this amendment itself--since I have been criticizing China resolutions generally. The wording of this resolution is even more disturbing. I am told the purpose, again, is to force the administration to introduce and to pursue a resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission condemning China for human rights violations. However, what you are not told is that there is no support for this resolution at all. The European Union has even passed its own resolution indicating human rights violations are better addressed bilaterally with China. Again, the EU has already passed its own resolution indicating that human rights violations are better addressed bilaterally with China, not in this venue. Nearly all of our fellow U.N. members feel the same. So how do we expect the administration to go to the U.N. Human Rights Commission and garner support for this resolution? They would have the same result whether they pursued one now or 6 months ago. This has been tried before with no success. What leverage do we have to do this? We couldn't even get our U.N. allies, except one, to support us on Iraq. We still haven't settled the arrears question. How much weight will an attempt to pass a U.N. resolution--with no support--have in our quest to improve human rights in China? I believe none. A resolution supported by one country does not send a strong message. What it does is send the message that all other countries support what China is doing on human rights in China and that they need make no further progress because of that. 
I also have heard the administration has not yet determined whether it should pursue a resolution even though they know they will fail if they do so. If they agree to pursue one, they do it knowing that it is going to fail. 
If I were one of our allies, I would be sitting back and watching this and I would relish U.S. efforts to publicly condemn and sanction China, thereby impeding U.S. efforts to improve relations with China. That will give them many more opportunities to gain a firm foothold in what will be enormous trade and investment opportunities. If the U.S. gains the reputation of being an unreliable supplier, well, so much the better for them. They have seen us attempt to impose our laws and values extraterritorially on other countries over and over again. This has all accomplished nothing for us and much for them. For example, Airbus recently won a lucrative contract with China when China has long exhibited a preference for Boeing planes. 
It was a strong message from China and its relationship with the United States. 
This resolution, following all of the other attempts to rein in China, will not allow us to improve our relationship with China, but I believe it will slow that process. This will harm us in the eyes of the world community, it will impact US jobs, it will raise concerns about the U.S. security and leadership role in East Asia and the Pacific, and, most importantly, I believe that it is going to hurt the Chinese people themselves that we are trying to help. It will get us nothing--no progress on human rights, no progress on religious persecution--nothing at all. Many have said it is American involvement inside of China, including American investments, that have helped to improve the lives of many Chinese people and helped to foster more interest in human rights progress. More pressure for improvement comes from the inside out rather than the outside in. The Chinese government will listen more to the Chinese people than it will to threats from outside its borders. 
Let us look at the issue of religious persecution, since I know there is still legislation percolating on that issue as well. Religious leaders, including one from my own State, Reverend Don Argue, president of the National Association of Evangelicals and former president of North Central College in Minneapolis, just returned from a visit with President Jiang himself. 
Now, President Jiang invited them to China--the first time that has ever happened. The leaders noted that with their visit with the President of China, they gained valuable access that they feel will help to open the door to better contacts with the Chinese leadership on religious issues. They felt President Jiang heard their message, and they believe that President Jiang does realize that religious persecution is a major stumbling block to improve Chinese-United States relations, as well as a stumbling block to the lives of its citizens. 
I have also addressed this issue in my visits to China, and I have visited churches there, as well. China does need to make more progress; there is no doubt about it. But Ned Graham, the son of the Reverend Billy Graham, and others tell me they have been working in China now for many, many years, and there has been progress, they tell me, and they are working quietly and effectively, quietly and effectively inside China to further that progress. These religious leaders need to assure China that their goals are to provide religious freedom, not to violate Chinese laws by pursuing separate political goals. That process, Mr. President, is ongoing and it is working. 
Mr. President, I realize that this resolution has broad support. However, I feel it was important to come to the floor to remind my colleagues that we should think about what we are doing because it is clearly, again in my view, not productive but, in fact, could be counterproductive. Further, if we pass a resolution at all, at the very least it should include many of the countries listed in the human rights report as well as China, not just one. 
Again I say, China needs to make improvements in the areas of human rights and religious persecution. It should be on the list that we condemn and hold up for the rest of the world to see. It could be first on the list, it could be last on the list, but it should be on the list. Again, it shouldn't be the only country on the list. I'm concerned about human rights in all countries, not just one. My substitute resolution would have just enabled us to go on record supporting human rights in many countries. It could have been a separate list, it could have included China, China could have been alone. But only to have one resolution on the floor today condemning one country, I think is going to do more harm for the people inside of China than it is going to do good. That was my main concern. 
I yield the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. on the occasion of the 86th anniversary of its founding. 
The Girl Scouts have come a long way since founder Juliette Gordon Low made a phone call to her cousin in 1912, proclaiming that she had something for all the girls of Savannah, Georgia, and all the girls of America. The phone call led to the gathering of 18 girls in Juliette's backyard to study nature and learn to play basketball. This was the start of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. 
The Girl Scouts spread quickly across the United States, reaching my home state of Minnesota in July 1918, only six short years after its inception. Since then, the Girl Scouts have evolved into the largest voluntary organization for girls in the world. The Girl Scouts membership nationwide consists of over 2.5 million girls between the ages of five and seventeen and more than 800,000 volunteers who give their time and talents to ensure these young women are instilled with the knowledge that they can do anything they set their minds to. As for Minnesota, there are approximately 61,000 girls and 19,000 volunteers associated with the Girl Scouts. The Girl Scouts of the U.S.A joins a worldwide family of 9 million girls and adults in 136 countries as a member of the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. 
The Girl Scouts offer, for girls of every background, activities that enhance the development of confidence, determination, and the skills needed to succeed in today's world. One activity rich in Girl Scout tradition is the selling of Girl Scout cookies. This tradition, which began in Philadelphia, has been around since 1934. Many successful businesswomen today say they got their start selling Girl Scout cookies. Girl Scouts develop many skills during the annual cookie sales, such as establishing goals, handling money, and the satisfaction of finishing a job. 
By cooperating with peers to achieve a common end, Girl Scouts learn valuable lessons in leadership. Countless civic, professional, and community leaders throughout our nation were involved in the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. Six of my Senate colleagues here in the 105th Congress--Barbara Mikulski, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Carol Moseley-Braun, Patty Murray, Susan Collins, and Mary Landrieu--were all Girl Scouts. 
Mr. President, for eighty-six years the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. have instilled in American youth the qualities of the Girl Scout Law and Promise, which focus on serving God and country, helping people at all times, being honest and fair, friendly and helpful, considerate and caring, courageous and strong, responsible and respectful, and making the world a better place. These are truly honorable qualities to live by and I am proud to pay tribute to the young women who honor them daily and the volunteers who make the Girl Scout program a reality.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend and colleague from Colorado in support of this amendment, the Mass Transit Capital Investment Grants and Loan Program of the ISTEA II bill. I am very pleased that dialogue has been going on recognizing the needs of the 11 core, or old, systems and also looking at the needs of the future of the 34 cities and others to come on line and how they are going to be able to receive the funding they are going to need to handle the mass transit needs they are facing today and in the very immediate future. 
So I am very glad to see at least the dialogue is going on to begin the process of changing the current formula to take into consideration and into account both the needs of the existing systems but also the growing needs of growing systems as well. So I commend both Chairman D'Amato and also Senator Allard for their work on this. 
In recent years, Minnesota has received, Mr. President, less than a 20 percent return on its gas tax contributions to mass transit, and many States have received even less. Through the Allard-Grams amendment, I seek to ensure that Minnesota gets a fair and equitable return on its gas tax contribution. 
Now, we do not have the ridership on mass transit because we do not have the mass transit. If we do not have the mass transit, we cannot move the number of people, we cannot get into the formula argument of how many--70 percent, et cetera--people move on these existing systems. So there has to be a formula to ensure an equitable return to make sure these cities, such as the Denver or the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, have the funds to be able to invest in their transit needs. 
Now, section 5309 is entirely funded by the gas tax, and it provides nearly half of our Nation's mass transit dollars. We intend to amend this program to provide an equitable and fair distribution of transit dollars to new systems. These are systems in areas where the rising population dictates the need to resolve traffic congestion through mass transit options. 
As the Senator from Colorado has indicated, the amendment consists of two program changes. First, we make a change in the Fixed Guideway Program, and second, an improvement in the New Starts Program. Now, unless the Senate bill is amended, the vast majority of section 5309 will go to existing transit systems only. If mass transit programs are to be effective, well, then, the funding needs to go to the cities in regions of our country that are the fastest growing and drastically need this transit funding. 
In 1997, fixed guideway systems were funded at the level of $760 million in modernization funds. This was distributed on the formula of 90 percent to the 11 `old' or `statutory' systems, and only 10 percent went to the 34 `new' systems. The committee title alters this somewhat, but most of the funding for fixed guideway funds will continue to go to the 11 statutory cities. 
Now, let me make one very important point. This amendment does not alter the current level of funding for the 11 old systems. It merely requires that of all the new funding above the current funding levels of $760 million for 1997 go to the new transit systems. These new systems include the 34 new systems that now receive funds and any additional systems that meet the threshold requirement of 7 years of revenue operation during the 1998 through the 2003 year period. 
Just let me list the 34 new systems that would receive increased moneys from this amendment. They include Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Seattle, Atlanta, San Diego, San Jose, Providence, Dayton, Tacoma, Wilmington, Trenton, Lawrence-Haverhill, Chattanooga, Baltimore, Minneapolis-St. Paul, St. Louis, Denver, Norfolk, Honolulu, Hartford, Madison, San Juan, Detroit, Dallas, Sacramento, Houston, Buffalo, Portland, Miami, Phoenix, Jacksonville, West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and Tampa. 
Of course, this list will continue to grow as other cities come on board in the future years once they meet the existing threshold requirement of 7 years of revenue operation. By the year 2000, the Allard-Grams amendment would direct 24 percent of fixed guideway modernization funds to go to these new cities. Even under our amendment, the vast majority of funds would continue to go, again, to the 11 `old' systems. And that is still a very generous allocation of these resources.  
The New Starts set-aside for projects for new transit systems is defined as projects for completely new fixed guideway systems, or extensions to existing fixed guideway systems placed in revenue service for 15 years or less. 
The amendment would ensure that growth in the New Starts program is directed at assisting new transit systems. Also, another important point to make is that this amendment would not alter the process for selecting worthwhile projects. 
Both Congress and the Department of Transportation would continue to determine which projects have merit, and fund them accordingly. There are no earmarks or language that would direct the funds to our states. While there are additional monies that have been added to the new starts program, the Transportation Appropriations Committees would still need to decide which new start projects to fund and at what levels to fund these projects. 
Keep in mind that both the Fixed Guideway Modernization and New Starts program combined constitute less than one-third of the mass transit dollars. Even with the changes proposed by the amendment this small number of cities will continue to do very well when it comes to mass transit funding. Our amendment is a small step toward ensuring a minimum degree of equity to regions in our nation that now have the greatest growth. I urge my colleagues to support our amendment. 
Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the importance of the ISTEA II bill and thank the floor managers for their efforts to report out very comprehensive and difficult legislation that is vital to all our states. The Senate's ISTEA II bill represents the result of intense negotiations between Chairman Chafee, Senator Warner, and Senator Baucus, each of whom have represented three different legislative approaches to the reauthorization of ISTEA. 
I want to again thank them for the work they've done to bring this bill to the floor. The citizens of my home state of Minnesota strongly support a 6-year reauthorization bill funded at the highest levels we can. This must be one of our top priorities in this session, and I hope we can soon reach a time agreement to facilitate its passage. I know we have only considered a few of over 200 amendments, many of which are nongermane, to this bill. 
As we are all painfully aware, the short-term ISTEA reauthorization bill expires March 31, 1998. After May 1, states will be prohibited from obligating any federal highway or transit funds at all. Although the money has been appropriated, it cannot be spent. 
This makes it especially difficult for a cold-weather state such as Minnesota to fund construction projects for the summer and fall construction seasons. That is why we must pass a 6-year reauthorization bill, rather than merely extending it for another 6 months. Again, on behalf of Minnesota constituents, I ask my colleagues to allow this bill to proceed rapidly. I am pleased that an agreement was reached on transportation spending in order to move this bill forward. 
I'm glad that we will now be able to spend the 4.3 cents per gallon federal gas tax that was moved from the general budget to the Highway Trust Fund in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I was pleased to be a supporter of the effort to use the 4.3 cents for its intended purpose of fulfilling our nation's transportation infrastructure needs and obligations. This will mean that federal highway spending will be increased by some $26 billion over the next few years. 
With these extra funds, the bill's authorizations for roads and bridges jumps from $145 billion to about $173 billion. We will now be able to guarantee states at least a 91 percent return on their gas tax payments to Washington. For Minnesota, this additional spending will result in an average increase of $47 million per year. The bill would also increase Minnesota's average share by over $129 million per year above the 1991 authorization. 
But most importantly, I want to commend Chairman Domenici for his commitment to find real offsets to this new spending so we do not break the spending caps in the 1998 balanced budget agreement. Mr. President, while I was pleased with the spending agreement, I am concerned about the additional spending for new programs that was negotiated as part of this agreement. 
As one who has supported an amendment in the past to reduce the level of funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission, and require that the Commission provide a specific plan for future downsizing, I am particularly concerned about the extra $1.89 billion for the Appalachian highway system. I was disappointed that some Senators would seek to add earmarks for their own states, when all states would benefit from the additional funding. The earmarks have increased the total funding amount--and expected and necessary offsets will undoubtably hurt other states such as mine in unrelated areas, including possible tax increases. 
Mr. President, the short-term extension of ISTEA is approaching its expiration. We need to go forward and approve a new highway reauthorization bill that is fair to states and consistent with our five-year balanced budget agreement as well. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today on the 118th Anniversary of the founding of the Salvation Army in the United States to pay tribute to its valiant tradition of public service. 
In March of 1880, George Scott Railton left his native England and set sail for New York on a mission to further the work of the Salvation Army. On March 10 of that year, Railton arrived in New York where he began spreading the Salvation Army's mission in the United States, working in the spirit of service that has been inherent in the Salvation Army since its founding. 
Although the passage of time has brought with it new challenges, I am happy to say that today, the Salvation Army's presence in the United States is as strong as ever. Whenever there is a human need to be met, the Salvation Army responds to the call, providing comfort in the face of tragedy and hope in situations where there is seemingly no hope to be found. 
In its earliest days, the focus of the Salvation Army's work was attending to the material, emotional, and spiritual needs of the poor by providing shelter for the homeless, food for the hungry, and alcohol rehabilitation for the chemically dependant. Today the Salvation Army's mission is the same, yet the number of services offered has greatly increased. The Salvation Army has indeed adapted to changing times, as seen by the fact that it now offers services such as shelters for battered women, assistance to victims of HIV/AIDS, career counseling, vocational training, day care centers, correctional services, and drug rehabilitation. 
Mr. President, I would like to make special mention of one service the Salvation Army provides which has particularly touched my home state of Minnesota: disaster relief. Minnesotans witnessed that service first hand when the Salvation Army responded to the tragedy which struck in the form of the spring floods of 1997. 
In Operation `We Care', the Salvation Army provided a great deal of comfort and support to Minnesotans who had the misfortune of experiencing the devastation caused by the floods. Thousands were displaced by the floods, their homes destroyed, and necessities such as food, shelter and fresh water were made inaccessible by the flood's fury. In this trying time, the Salvation Army was on hand to give victims hot meals and a roof over their heads, as well as clothing, personal hygiene items, and a variety of other basic commodities that are often taken for granted yet are sorely missed when unavailable. 
Once the flood waters retreated, victims were faced with a new set of problems brought by the flood's aftermath. Victims returned to their homes and businesses to discover the extensive damage left in the flood's wake. Although the task of sandbagging and containing the river was over, the Salvation Army remained in the flooded areas to aid in the clean-up and rebuilding process. The Salvation Army contributed to this effort by providing clean-up kits, water pumps, wet vacs, emergency generators, and the tireless labor of dedicated volunteers. 
Operation `We Care' proved an effective and heartfelt response to this crisis. Through the generosity of the Salvation Army's employees and its many volunteers, Minnesotans were aided by everything from direct assistance to help pay rent, utilities, and other living expenses, to a prayer chain which called on people of all faiths to pray for those devastated by the floods. 
Mr. President, on behalf of the citizens of Minnesota, I would like to express my deep gratitude for the work the Salvation Army has undertaken in my state and send my sincerest congratulations on its 188th anniversary in this country. With its dedication to service and spiritual growth, the Salvation Army truly embodies the good in humanity.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I also thank Chairman D'Amato for working with Senator Allard and myself in recognizing that growing mass transit moneys should be more fairly and equitably distributed to the new systems in our country, including Minneapolis and St. Paul. 
I represent Minnesota, a State that is growing, and growing in areas where rising populations are basically dictating the needs to resolve traffic congestion through new-start mass transit options. I thank the chairman for his commitment to work with Senator Allard and me in the conference and again to make the Fixed Guideway Program more equitable to the new system. I thank the chairman for his acceptance of our fixed guideway language in this amendment and for his commitment to work with us to maintain this language in conference, because it is important that a greater portion of the new funding above the current levels, currently $760 million in 1997, go to these new systems. These are the systems, as we have noted, that are growing the most and growing fast. 
I also thank him for this agreement to work with us in conference to help us establish some very significant funding for new starts. I also thank Senator Allard for all his work with us on this as well. I thank the Chairman very much for his help and cooperation.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of `American Red Cross Month' to pay tribute to one of the most exemplary humanitarian organizations the world has ever known, and to specifically recognize how the Red Cross touched the lives of thousands of Minnesotans during the 1997 spring floods. 
Each year, the Red Cross comes to the aid of victims of 66,000 disasters nationally. When disaster strikes, the Red Cross responds swiftly to the call to relieve human suffering and restore a sense of comfort and normalcy in the face of tragedy--a response honed over its 135 years of service. 
This surely was the case when tragedy hit Minnesota in the form of severe flooding in the spring of 1997. When the Minnesota and Red Rivers overflowed their banks, it brought forth a flood of destruction and human misery unseen in this normally peaceful part of the country. 
The Red Cross response to this catastrophe was swift and effective. With operations in three states--Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota--the Red Cross provided over 6,994 volunteers to aid in the flood relief effort. In addition, the Red Cross contributed direct assistance to approximately 11,867 families. 
In Red Cross service centers, victims were provided with basic necessities which were made scarce or unattainable due to the floods. The extensive damage to private homes displaced thousands, prompting the Red Cross to open 19 shelters which served 6,001 people. In all, the Red Cross served 1,179,950 meals at its 43 feeding sites and with its 64 mobile feeding units. The Red Cross was also able to provide fresh water, clothing, and blankets. 
After the water had returned within its banks and it was time for people to return to their homes to begin to clean up the residue left by the flood waters, the Red Cross provided 12,754 clean-up kits to aid in this long process. 
In a relatively short period of time, the river took away from some what it had taken a lifetime to build. In order to aid people in dealing with the mental strain brought by such a traumatic experience, the Red Cross made mental health professionals available, who attended to the needs of 15,498 individuals. 
During the many weeks of flood recovery work, there were two instances where individuals generously gave significant monetary contributions to the victims of the flood. These anonymous donors were properly referred to as `Angels.' While this label is indeed appropriate, it seems that it should also accurately be used to describe the thousands of Red Cross volunteers who came from all over this country and generously gave their time and labor to people known only to them by their need for assistance. 
Mr. President, while this was indeed a dark time for Minnesotans in the flood areas, the uncompromising compassion of Red Cross volunteers provided a bright display of kindness, a light that shone in the hearts of the many who so generously gave their time and labor in the face of this great tragedy. On behalf of the people of Minnesota, I wish to offer my sincerest thanks to the men and women of the Red Cross and commend this fine organization for its relief efforts throughout the world.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my hope that the agreement reached by Secretary Annan in Iraq results in the end of a conflict that has plagued the international community over the past seven years--the failure of Saddam Hussein to live up to the terms that he agreed to following the invasion of Kuwait and his defeat in the Gulf War. 
If Saddam has truly experienced a change of heart and has decided to abandon the production and concealment of weapons of mass destruction, this agreement is a milestone; if this is just one more ploy to evade the destruction of his arsenal, then we remain on course for a showdown with Iraq. 
We all know Saddam Hussein's record. He invaded the sovereign nation of Kuwait. He used chemical weapons against Iran and against his own people. He used women and children as human shields to protect himself and his weapons of mass destruction. He is both a coward and a menace--and that is a dangerous combination. 
At this time it is impossible to judge whether this deal will truly permit the UN weapons inspectors full and unfettered access. UNSCOM inspectors have always insisted that they need to be able to follow a trail wherever it leads them. They are not seeking access to a certain category of sites--they just need freedom to track the evidence. If this agreement permits them to do this and allows them to use whatever techniques are necessary, then the agreement is a step forward. The inspectors do not seal off buildings because they are `cowboys,' they do it because the Iraqi's were moving equipment out the back door as they entered the front. 
It would have been prudent for the Administration to have studied the plan, and clarified the details before it offered its support. But, as is the case with the lack of information to the Senate on the Administration's plan to bomb Iraq, prudence was apparently too much to expect. 
While I am reserving judgment on the Secretary General's agreement until the terms have been thoroughly explained, one positive immediate effect is that it has created a pause in the crisis. The Congress has a responsibility to the American people, and especially the men and women serving in our armed forces, to ensure that the Administration has clear objectives and a coherent policy in regard to Iraq. The use of air strikes against Iraq may have been averted in this instance, but given Saddam's track record of lies and deceit, I do not believe that this is the last time that we will be forced as a nation to confront him. 
We all witnessed the Administration's public relations offensive with Cabinet officials holding town hall meetings around the country to build public support for limited air strikes. Through these forums it has become painfully clear that the Administration refuses--or perhaps more disturbingly--cannot consistently answer four basic questions: (1) What are the Administration's goals; (2) how will limited air strikes achieve those objectives; (3) what happens after the bombing stops; and (4) what is our endgame? 
First the Administration told us that the goal of the United States was to allow UNSCOM inspectors full and unfettered access to suspected storage sites for chemical and biological weapons. Then we were told that it was to make sure that Saddam would not be able to `reconstitute' his nuclear, chemical and biological weapons production capabilities. But the Administration has failed to explain to the American people how air strikes will achieve these objectives. 
After a round of briefings in the Senate with Administration officials, the only thing that is clear is what US air strikes are not going to accomplish: they will not eliminate Iraq's stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons; they will not eliminate Iraq's capability to produce weapons of mass destruction; and they will not remove Iraq's rulers, who persist on a course of action which threatens international security and the welfare of their own people. 
The Administration's plan for `substantial' air strikes--which I suppose falls somewhere between `pinprick' and `massive' attacks--may delay Saddam's capability to deliver weapons of mass destruction. Of course, many of the buildings where biological weapons are produced and stored are dual-use facilities--like hospitals and vaccine laboratories. There is also a danger that uncontrolled explosions of storage facilities could result in the release of toxic substances. So it is not a question of whether we are able to destroy these targets, but whether the resulting deaths of Iraqi civilians would prove counterproductive to our goals. 
In addition, Saddam has been playing a shell-game with chemical and biological weapons stockpiles. As General Zinni, commander-in-chief of the US central command acknowledged in December, `we do not have a good sense of what he has and where he has it'; and we do not know the location of mobile missile sites. 
Unfortunately, Saddam does not need a huge production capacity or weapons stockpile to remain a threat. As a February 15 article in London's Sunday Telegraph noted, recent investigations of a tiny leak of anthrax from a Soviet facility in 1979 have documented 77 deaths, with animals killed up to 30 miles away, even though less than a gram of anthrax escaped. 
Even if the Administration allows the military to conduct a comprehensive air campaign which cripples Saddam's ability to produce weapons of mass destruction, it is highly unlikely that air strikes will result in UNSCOM inspectors being given unfettered access to suspect sites or will enhance our ability to contain Saddam. 
This brings us to the question of what happens after the bombing stops? The only proven way to effectively eliminate Iraq's chemical and biological weapons capacity is to have inspectors on the ground. As President Clinton remarked in an address last week to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, UNSCOM inspectors, 
 have uncovered and destroyed more weapons of mass destruction capacity than was destroyed during the Gulf War . . . [including] 40,000 chemical weapons, more than 100,000 gallons of chemical weapons agents, 48 operational missiles, 30 warheads specifically fitted for chemical and biological weapons, and a massive biological weapons facility at Al Hakam equipped to produce anthrax and other deadly agents. 
But 17 tons of biological growth agents, 600 tons of VX precursors and 4,000 tons of other chemical precursors remain unaccounted for. Iraq could have produced 200 tons of VX alone with this missing material. If, following the air strikes, Saddam denies permission for UNSCOM to conduct inspections, or if UNSCOM finds that it is not safe to proceed following the air strikes, then US actions will have jeopardized international security, not enhanced it. 
Furthermore, limited air strikes may extend rather than contain Saddam's power and influence in the region. We only have to look at the fact that the states most threatened by Saddam--the Arab nations in proximity to Iraq, with the exception of Kuwait--are not supporting US military action. Even Saudi Arabia, which we protected against invasion during the Gulf War, and our NATO ally Turkey have refused the use of air bases. 
The Arab nations are acting according to their own self-interest. They realize that Saddam is a threat to their national security, but they also recognize that limited US air strikes which fail to depose Saddam could leave them in an even more precarious position. The states neighboring Iraq have legitimate concerns that they could be destabilized if their populations rally around Saddam, who would be seen as a hero for standing up to the West. 
Saddam could gain further sympathy from those disaffected populations by opting out of the oil-for-food program. The entire sanctions regime could crumble, and Saddam could continue to increase his weapons program unfettered by multilateral sanctions. Efforts to promote democracy in the region would be jeopardized. Terrorism could be increased and exported to the United States. 
President Clinton asked a rhetorical question in his speech last week at the Pentagon: `What if he (Saddam) fails to comply, and we fail to act?' Well, I have a question for President Clinton, what if our air strikes only strengthen Saddam's power and eliminate any chance of finding and destroying his weapons of mass destruction? 
Administration officials have glibly answered that we will just bomb again. That is not a policy; that is not a strategy. It is a cop-out for poor planning and the lack of a comprehensive policy toward Iraq. 
How often can we bomb without mobilizing Muslim nations to stand by the people of Iraq? How often can we bomb without some form of retaliation from Iraq against our allies in the region, if not against the United States itself? This Administration talks in terms of limited strikes, but in war we must take into account the `law of unintended consequences,' and the threat of a regional conflict should not be dismissed. 
Which brings us to the subject of an endgame. When air strikes appeared imminent, I called Secretary General Kofi Annan and urged him to personally pursue a diplomatic solution. 
And I asked him at that time whether he had a message he would like to convey to the Senate. He responded that we should think through the endgame--what we will do after a military strike if we proceed to bomb Iraq. That is, I believe, sound advice. 
The Administration claims that it has a long-term strategy in Iraq--a strategy of containment. But I fail to see any connection between the Administration's short-term strategy of limited air strikes and its stated long-term goal of containing Saddam Hussein. As I said earlier, the best way to contain Saddam is to have weapons inspectors on the ground. Even when they are being impeded, their very presence makes it impossible for Saddam to engage in large-scale production of weapons of mass destruction. The Administration's proposed use of air strikes is therefore inconsistent with its stated long-term strategy of containment. 
Now, the Administration has stated that there are no good options for action against Iraq--and I agree. However, one of the reasons why there are no good options is the failure of this Administration to make an all-out effort over the past seven years to remove Saddam from power by establishing a power base for an alternative Iraqi government. Surely, this is an effort which could have secured allies in the region. 
According to news reports, by the end of 1996, both of the CIA's covert operations programs had been obliterated. One effort to recruit Iraqi officers, to try to provoke a military coup was apparently infiltrated by Iraqi double agents, and at least 100 officers were executed by Saddam for cooperating with Americans. Another effort to back the Iraqi National Congress in northern Iraq was abandoned by the US government and thousands were slaughtered when they mounted an offensive against Saddam Hussein. 
An article in the February 15 Los Angeles Times noted that the CIA team that was on the ground when the offensive started was recalled to the US when the acting Director of the CIA asked the FBI to conduct a criminal investigation as to whether five CIA officers involved in covert operations in Iraq were plotting to kill Saddam--charges, by the way, that were later dropped. Now this had a chilling effect on covert activity in Iraq, raising concerns as to whether this Administration is serious about getting rid of Saddam Hussein. 
I do not support Congressional efforts to overturn the Executive Order forbidding the assassination of foreign leaders. However, there is sufficient flexibility for covert operations to succeed in removing Saddam from power and those efforts must be promoted. 
As I stated before, I am pleased that Secretary General Annan succeeded in reaching an agreement with Saddam Hussein. Even if this agreement unravels, it has afforded Congress an opportunity to debate the Administration's policy toward Iraq. 
We must demand that the Administration come forward with a clear explanation of its strategy and tactics. We must condemn the Administration for refusing to give a codeword briefing to Senators on targeting strategy--only later did we read an outline of this strategy on the front page of The New York Times. 
As pressure to bomb Iraq was mounting, I remained convinced that further diplomatic efforts should be explored. There seemed to be a `rush to bomb.' As I said earlier, I called Secretary General Annan before the Administration agreed to his trip and asked him to go to Baghdad and speak to Saddam. 
I let Ambassador Richardson know that I would support a solution allowing representatives of the permanent members of the Security Council accompany UNSCOM inspectors, as long as UNSCOM was not impeded or compromised in any way. 
While I applaud the Secretary General's initiative, I have been appalled by the failure of the UN as an organization, and the Security Council in particular, to support enforcement of the UN resolutions. It is the greatest of ironies that this Administration is sending American men and women to risk their lives to uphold UN Resolution 687. This is a UN Security Council Resolution, but three out of the five permanent members oppose the use of force. France is more concerned with being able to sell Iraqi oil, China wants to buy the oil, and Russia seeks to be paid the $6 billion it is owed by Iraq. Only Britain is standing by the United States. 
There may come a time when the United States has to use force against Iraq to protect our national security. We cannot subcontract our national security policy to the United Nations. When, and if, that time comes, I hope that this Administration will let our armed forces do its job without one hand tied behind its back. And we should send a clear message to the `Butcher of Baghdad': If chemical or biological weapons are used anywhere in the world, and there is even the most tenuous link to Iraq, the full force of the United States will be used against him. 
Mr. President, in an excellent speech on the situation in Iraq, Senator Roberts of Kansas cited the words uttered 30 years ago by Senator Richard Russell, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee during the Vietnam War. I think that it is appropriate for me to once again repeat those words on the Senate floor. He said:  
I for one am not afraid of the old fashioned term, victory. We hear a great deal about limited wars, but I would point out that there is no such thing as a limit on actual combat in which our men our engaged. While it is a sound policy to have limited objectives, we should not expose our men to unnecessary hazards in pursuing them. 
And Senator Russell also made the following pledge: 
As for me, my fellow Americans, I shall never knowingly support a policy of sending even a single American boy overseas to risk his life in combat unless the entire civilian population and wealth of our country--all that we have and all that we are--is to bear a commensurate responsibility in giving him the fullest support and protection of which we are capable. 
It is inconsistent with our history, tradition and fundamental principles to commit American boys on far flung battlefields if we are to follow policies that deny them full support because we are afraid of increasing the risk of those who stay at home. 
It is a confession of moral weakness on the part of this country not to take any steps that are necessary to fully diminish the fighting power of our enemies.' 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues and the Administration to hear those words--they have as much relevance today as when they were first uttered in this chamber. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, throughout Minnesota's history, its residents have been considered among America's most civic-minded citizens, who are interested in public affairs and concerned about how government decision-making affects their daily lives. I have been well-served by the counsel of thousands of Minnesotans who have expressed concerns about high taxes, balancing the budget, and, most recently, U.S. military involvement in Iraq. 
During the 105th Congress, I have also heard from many Minnesotans who are concerned over the reports of alleged illegal or improper campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee and White House during the 1996 campaign cycle. These reports have raised the perception among some Americans that access and votes can be bought in Washington and that the system for financing our federal campaigns is corrupt and `broken.' 
As the Senate considers campaign finance reform legislation, I am not surprised that many constituents have contacted me about this issue--but out of great concern for its potential impact upon their First Amendment right of free speech guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Regrettably, the consideration of the McCain-Feingold amendment is not the first time that Congress appears to have misinterpreted the will of the people. 
Mr. President, I recently received a letter from President Clinton concerning the McCain-Feingold legislation. In his letter, the President urged my support for this measure because it would `make our democracy work better for all Americans.' Many of my colleagues received a similar letter last fall from the President in which he encouraged Congress to work with him and `restore the public trust' by supporting the modified McCain-Feingold bill. 
As someone who has heard first-hand of the public's growing mistrust of their government, I strongly agree with the President's belief that the people's trust in their government should be restored and their participation in our democracy encouraged. However, I respectfully disagree with the President's recommended method for achieving these goals--through passage of new campaign finance laws. 
I believe the people's faith in our democracy can be restored through greater enforcement of our existing laws, rather than passage of new laws. Congress should also require frequent and fair disclosure of every contribution, and allow all Americans to participate in the political process. These measures, not new limits or government controls, will restore the public trust and allow Americans to participate in our democracy. 
Most importantly, Congress should ensure that one of our country's most fundamental freedoms, the right to speak freely and openly in our society, is preserved for future generations of Americans. I believe Congress should focus its attention on preserving the First Amendment, which has always been the basis for active citizen participation in our political process. 
The First Amendment ensures that, among other things, average Americans can participate in the democratic process through publicly disclosed contributions to campaigns of their choice. It also allows Americans to freely draft letters to the editor, distribute campaign literature, and participate in rallies and get-out-the-vote drives. Minnesota has a long history of its citizens becoming engaged in many of these activities during each election cycle. 
Mr. President, we had a lengthy and spirited debate last fall over the McCain-Feingold legislation, in which many of our colleagues on both sides of the issue participated. The Senate wisely voted to reject this attempt to direct attention away from the reports of alleged illegal or improper campaign contributions during the 1996 campaign cycle. In taking this action, the Senate sent a message to the electorate that it will work to preserve the rights of Americans to participate in the democratic process and restore the public's trust in their government. 
Despite this clear message sent by the Senate, and although many Americans continue to express opposition to `reform' efforts such as the McCain-Feingold bill, the President and some of my colleagues forced Congress, through various delaying tactics, to spend valuable legislative time revisiting this issue again this year. 
Mr. President, as I noted last year, proponents of the modified McCain-Feingold bill should be commended for excluding provisions intended to limit candidates spending, requirements for reduced broadcasting time, and the ban on political action committees. However, this measure continues to suppress the rights of Americans to communicate their ideas and express their views. Ultimately, it will control, rather than encourage, greater participation in the democratic process. 
And as a couple from Hastings, Minnesota recently wrote to me about the pending McCain-Feingold bill, `It would be used as a tool to silence all criticism and disagreement by opponents of whatever government regime is in power in Washington at a particular time.' 
First, the McCain-Feingold proposal continues to be premised upon the belief that there is too much money spent on American elections. If we accept this assumption, then Congress has decided to assert questionable authority to suppress the rights of Americans to become involved in the political process and make their voices heard. In fact, the belief that there is government justification for regulating the costs of political campaigns was rejected by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Buckley versus Valeo. 
Second, the McCain-Feingold proposal again includes a new and expanded statutory definition for `express advocacy' that would place additional restrictions on advocacy groups' political communications. 
As my colleagues know, the Supreme Court established in Buckley a `bright line' test for protected speech which stated that a political communication must expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate using such key words as `vote for' `elect' or `vote against' before it would be subject to federal regulation. 
Third, the McCain-Feingold amendment places new restrictions upon the ability of national parties to support state and local party activities. Rather than pursue a suspect expansion of government control of national parties, we should recognize that political parties enjoy the same rights as individuals to participate in the democratic process. 
For nearly two decades, political parties have been allowed to raise money for party-building and similar activities without limits on the size of contributions. 
Additionally, the Supreme Court decision in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC, in which the Court found that Congress may not limit independent expenditures by political parties, makes it questionable whether these restrictions would be constitutional. 
Finally, the McCain-Feingold amendment does not adequately protect the right of Americans to participate in the democratic process without fear of coercion. 
Despite the Supreme Court decision in Communications Workers of America v. Beck almost ten years ago, millions of Americans still have portions of their paychecks taken and used for political purposes for which they may disagree, without their knowledge or consent. 
I believe forcing an individual to make compulsory campaign contributions is contrary to our constitutional form of government and the First Amendment freedoms we enjoy as citizens. 
For these reasons, I support the Majority Leader's decision to offer S. 1663, the `Paycheck Protection Act,' as the underlying bill. 
This will allow individuals to regain control of their paychecks, avoid coercion, and exercise their political freedoms. 
And unlike the Beck provision contained within the McCain-Feingold legislation, it would apply to all dues-paying employees. It would also reduce unnecessary burdens placed upon employees by requiring an employer to receive an individual's written permission before using his or her dues for political purposes. 
Mr. President, there has been some discussion that amendments may be offered to reach a compromise between those who support the McCain-Feingold legislation and others who support greater enforcement of our existing laws. 
While I believe compromise is an important part of legislating, I do not believe the Constitution should be compromised simply to give the public the impression that we are reacting to their concerns over allegations of campaign finance irregularities and illegal fundraising. 
I believe the American people deserve a full accounting and will receive a full accounting of allegations of campaign finance law violations in the 1996 campaign cycle. However, we should not forget that the public's mistrust of their elected officials has not grown from a lack of laws, but from the activities of those who may have broken our existing laws. 
Congress must not use violations of existing law to restrict political speech and participation by those who abide by current law. It is our responsibility to help safeguard the free speech rights of Americans and their ability to participate in the democracy which they have helped to create. 
Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong disappointment as my colleagues waffle on our commitment to allow working Americans to keep a little more of their own money. 
I rise as well, Mr. President, to make the case for returning any potential budget surplus to the taxpayers. 
Mr. President, I was shocked to pick up the Washington Times on February 18 and find the headline `Senate GOP leaders give up on tax cuts.' 
Having been elected on a pledge to reduce taxes for the working families of my state, the idea that we would so quickly abandon a core principle of the Republican Party is a folly of considerable proportions, one I believe would abandon good public policy. 
In all the legislative dust that is kicked up in Washington, someone has to consider the impact of high taxes and spending, and speak up for the people who pay the bills: the taxpayers. 
When the Republican Conference met on February 11 to outline our budget priorities for the coming year, I joined many of my colleagues in stressing the need for continued tax relief. I did not leave the room with the belief that we had abandoned the taxpayers. 
Yet that is precisely what the Conference's `Outline of Basic Principles and Objectives' does, because under the Conference guidelines, tax relief for hard-working Americans would be nearly impossible to achieve. 
Mr. President, since its very beginnings in the 1850s, the Republican Party has dedicated itself to the pursuit of individual and states' rights and a restricted role of government in economic and social life. 
In 1856, the slogan of the new party was `Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Speech, Free Man.' It is still our firm belief that a person owns himself, his labor, and the fruit of his labor, and the right of individuals to achieve the best that is within themselves as long as they respect the rights of others. 
The fundamental goal of the Republican Party is to keep government from becoming too big, too intrusive, to keep it from growing too far out of control. 
 We constantly strive to make it smaller, waste less, and deliver more, believing that the government cannot do everything for everyone; it cannot ensure `social justice' through the redistribution of private income. 
These two different approaches of governance are indeed a choice of two futures: A choice between small government and big government; a choice between fiscal discipline and irresponsibility; a choice between individual freedom and servitude; a choice between personal responsibility and dependency; a choice between the preservation of traditional American values versus the intervention of government into our family life; a choice of long-term economic prosperity and short-term benefits for special interest groups, at the expense of the insolvency of the nation. 
I think history has proven that whenever we have stuck to Republican principles, the people and the nation prosper, freedom and liberty flourish; whenever we abandon these principles for short-term political gains, it makes matters far worse for both our Party and our country. 
Here are two examples. Facing a $2 billion deficit and economic recession in 1932, the Hoover Administration approved a plan to drastically raise individual and corporate income taxes. 
Personal exemptions were sharply reduced and the maximum tax rate increased from 25 percent to 63 percent. The estate tax was doubled, and the gift tax was restored. Yet the federal revenue declined and the nation was deeply in recession. 
President Reagan took the opposite approach in 1981 when he enacted a 25 percent across-the-board tax, and again in 1986 when he signed a landmark piece of legislation to reduce the marginal tax rate to a simple, two-rate income tax system: 15 percent and 28 percent. 
What resulted was nothing short of an economic miracle. Our nation experienced the longest peacetime economic expansion in American history, the benefits of which we are still enjoying today. 
Over eight years, real economic growth averaged 3.2 percent and real median family income grew by $4,000, 20 million new jobs were created, unemployment sank to record lows, all classes of people did better, and in spite of lower rates, tax revenues increased dramatically. 
Mr. President, let us not forget the fact that the Republicans gained control of Congress in 1994 because we were the champions of the taxpayers--the American people trusted us to carry out our promise when we said, `Elect a Republican majority and we will work to let you keep more of the money you earned.' 
The taxpayers elected us with the expectation that Republicans would seize every opportunity to lessen the tax burden on America's families. 
They certainly did not elect Republicans thinking we would be a collaborator of the President's tax-and-spend policies--that we wouldd build a bigger, more expensive government at the first chance we got and completely abandon our promise of tax relief for them. 
Is this the same Republican majority that arrived in Washington in January of 1995, ready to create fundamental change in a government that had enslaved so many working families for so many years? 
Is this the same Republican majority that promised the American people that there was no turning back to the era of big government and higher taxes? Is this the same Republican majority that I was so proud to be part of? 
It has been tremendously disappointing to me, and I believe the majority of taxpayers, to read the recent comments from those who have endorsed the President Clinton's `save Social Security first' gimmicks and are seeking to eliminate meaningful, achievable tax cuts from the next fiscal year's budget. 
As I said before on this floor, if we do not carry out the taxpayers' agenda, we may as well pack up our bags and go home, because we will have failed. And the price of that failure will fall on the backs of those we were elected to represent. I believe any retreat from that promise would be a terrible mistake. 
Tax relief is still critical for America for two basic reasons--moral and economic. 
First, there is a moral case to be made for continuing tax cuts. 
The robust American economy and working Americans, not government action, have produced this unprecedented revenue windfall. These unexpected dollars have come directly from working Americans--taxes paid by consumers, individual labor, and investment income. This money belongs to the American people. 
Washington should not be allowed to stand first in line to take that away from American families, workers, and job creators. It is moral and fair that they keep it. 
We have also heard the argument that we already had a large tax cut last year, so there is no need for more tax cuts. Let me set the record straight. 
Last year, after spending $225 billion unexpected revenue windfall and busting the 1993 budget spending caps to do it, the Republican Party delivered tax relief only one-third as large as what we would promised in 1994. 
Those tiny tax cuts--no more than slivers, really--amounted to less than one cent of every dollar the federal government takes from the taxpayers. Is one cent worth of tax relief too much? I do not really think so. 
And the President today wants to increase spending by $123 billion and increase taxes $115 billion, wiping out entirely--and more--the tax reduction of 1997. 
A recent Tax Foundation study shows that 1997's tax cuts came too late to stem the rising tax burden on the American families. 
The study finds that Federal, State and local taxes claimed an astonishing 38.2 percent of the income of a median two-income family making $55,000--up from 37.3 percent in 1996. 
That is about a 1 percent increase. 
When we ask the Government to take a small cut of 1 percent across the board they say it's impossible. But nobody asked the taxpayers how they were going to manage to pay another percent more of their income in taxes. They either had to reduce their spending or make do without. But the Federal Government doesn't have to do that. Federal taxes under President Clinton consumed 20 percent of America's entire gross domestic product in 1997. That is the highest level since 1945, when taxes were raised to finance the enormous expenses of the Second World War. 
The average American family today spends more on taxes than it does on food, clothing, and housing combined. If the `hidden taxes' that result from the high cost of government regulations are factored in, a family today gives up more than 50 percent of its annual income to the government. At a time when the combination of federal income and payroll taxes, State and local taxes, and hidden taxes consumes over half of a working family's budget, the taxpayers are in desperate need of relief. 
Thanks to the Clinton Administration, the Democratic minority, and the Republicans of this Congress, big government is alive and well. In fact, the Government is getting bigger, not smaller. Total taxation is at an all-time high. So is total Government spending. Annual Government spending has grown from just $100 billion in 1962 to $1.73 trillion today, an increase of more than 17 times. Even after adjustment for inflation, Government spending today is still more than three times bigger than it was 35 years ago. It will continue to grow to $1.95 trillion by 2003 nearly $2 trillion a year. In the next 5 years, the government will spend $9.7 trillion, much of it going toward wasteful or unnecessary government programs. Tax relief is the right solution because it takes power out of the hands of Washington's wasteful spenders and puts it back where it can do the most good: with families. 
There is also an economic case for cutting taxes for working Americans. Lower tax rates increase incentives to work, save, and invest. They help to maximize the increase in family income and improvements in standards of living. Beyond the direct benefits to families, tax cuts can have a substantial, positive impact on the economy as a whole. It was John F. Kennedy who observed that: 
 an economy hampered with high tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budget just as it will never produce enough output and enough jobs. 
President Kennedy was able to put his theories to work in the early 1960s, when he enacted significant tax cuts that encouraged one of the few periods of sustained growth we have experienced since the Second World War. Twenty years later, President Ronald Reagan cut taxes once again. The reinvigorated economy responded enthusiastically. 
Mr. President, should we save Social Security first or provide tax cuts first? My answer is that we must do both in tandem. We had a very similar debate last year about whether we should balance the budget first and provide tax cuts later. The truth is we can absolutely do both at the same time, as long as we have the political will to enact sound fiscal policies. 
I agree with the Conference leadership that reforming the Social Security and Medicare programs to ensure their solvency is vitally important. Any projected budget surplus should be used partly for that purpose. Yet, I believe strongly that the Congress owes it to the taxpayers to dedicate a good share of the surplus for tax relief. After all, the Government has no claim on any surplus because the Government did not generate it--it will have been borne of the sweat and hard work of the American people, and it therefore should be returned to the people in the form of tax relief. 
Our Social Security system is in serious financial trouble, a fiscal disaster-in-the-making that is not sustainable in its present form. Simply funneling money back into it will not help fix the problem. It will not build the real assets of the funds for current and future beneficiaries and it does not address the flaws of the current pay-as-you-go finance mechanism. Without fundamental reform, using the general revenue to pay for Social Security equals a stealth payroll tax increase on American workers. I believe using part of the budget surpluses to build real assets by changing the system from pay-go to pre-funded is the right way to go. 
The President is maintaining that not one penny of the surplus would be used for spending increases or tax cuts. To that, I must say Mr. Clinton is not being at all truthful to the American people. In his FY 1997 budget, he proposes $150 billion in new spending, which is well above the spending caps he agreed on last year. In the next five years, he will raid over $400 billion from the Social Security trust funds to pay for his Government programs. If Mr. Clinton is serious about saving Social Security, he should stop looting the Social Security surplus to fund general government programs, return the borrowed surplus to the trust funds, and withdraw his new spending initiatives--only then will he be qualified to talk about saving Social Security. 
Wrapping up, Republicans should not allow Mr. Clinton to hold any budget surplus hostage. We should continue pursuing our `taxpayers' agenda' and do what is right for working Americans. It is clear to me that returning part of the budget surplus to the taxpayers in the form of tax relief is the right thing to do. But how should we do it? In my view, the best way is to have an across-the-board marginal tax rate cut and eliminate the capital gains and estate taxes. This will help to improve American competitiveness in the global economy and increase national savings. 
However, tax cuts will not solve the problems once and for all. The origin of this evil is the tax code itself. We must end the tax code as we know it and replace it with a simpler, fairer and more taxpayer-friendly tax system. 
By creating a tax system that is more friendly to working Americans and more conducive to economic growth--one based on pro-family, pro-growth tax relief--Congress and the President can make our economy more dynamic, our businesses more competitive, and our families more prosperous as we approach the 21st century. 
Again, to omit tax cuts from this year's budget resolution is totally unacceptable to Republicans seeking to deliver on our commitment to return money to the taxpayers. I will not walk away from our obligation to the American taxpayers to pursue a Federal Government that serves with accountability and leaves working families a little more of their own money at the end of the day. I intend to make good on my promise to the taxpayers, and I urge my fellow Republicans, especially our leadership, in the strongest terms possible, to honor your commitment as well by considering meaningful tax relief in the budget resolution. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the public interest contributions of the radio and television broadcasters in my home state of Minnesota. As a former broadcaster, I appreciate their efforts in our communities, and their accomplishments should not be overlooked. 
Last month, I reflected upon how radio has become an influential medium in the lives of many Americans throughout its 78 years of operation in the United States. As my colleagues know, January was recognized as `National Radio Month.' Today, I wanted to highlight in broader terms, the extraordinary influence and unselfish nature of both radio and television broadcasts. 
Broadcasts over the 12,200 radio stations in the U.S. serve a variety of purposes. Radio communicates with listeners during time of emergency, informs them of noteworthy community events such as fundraising drives, educates them about developing stories and current events, and entertains during long drives across our states. Americans listen to the radio an average of three hours and twelve minutes on weekdays, and four hours and 42 minutes on weekends. 
Similar to the listening power of radio, television has also become a vital part of our daily lives. Since the first television broadcast test in the U.S. took place during the 1920s, this medium has evolved and grown from approximately 36 broadcast television stations in 1948 to more than 1,550 stations across the country today. According to the National Association of Broadcasters, 98 percent of U.S. households currently own television receivers. And television is the main news source for 70 percent of the American public. 
Mr. President, many of our country's radio and television stations have participated in public service to their communities, not only out of statutory obligation for the licenses they receive, but because they have become part of their communities' way of life. I am proud of a recent Minnesota Broadcasters Association survey of station executives in which all 16 commercial television stations and 50 percent of the 242 radio stations responded. As impressive as these findings are, I am sure they represent only a microcosm of the public interest contributions of our nation's broadcasters. 
I was pleased to learn that radio and television stations across Minnesota raised more than $19.4 million for charities between June 1996 and June 1997, including $65 million in donated air time for Public Service Announcements. The hundreds of public service announcements broadcast each week highlighted such issues as AIDS awareness, disaster relief, safety campaigns, drunk driving, and drug and crime education programs. 
Additionally, of those stations surveyed, 100 percent of television stations and 95 percent of radio stations have helped charitable causes or needy individuals through fund-raising and other types of support. 
I know my constituents who suffered through the midwest floods of 1997 are grateful to those stations in Minnesota who were involved in local news broadcasts, public service announcements, public affairs programming, and off-air campaigns to aid disaster victims. 
A typical example of the Minnesota broadcasters' efforts during last year's spring floods is how Minnesota radio and television stations worked together with their listeners to raise $1.6 million to help and assist the flood victims. These stations also produced a video titled `Beyond the Flood,' donating the profits to the hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans who had their lives disrupted by the floods. 
Mr. President, the statistics I have cited do not tell the whole story. There have been hundreds of examples of how Minnesota's broadcasters have provided extraordinary local public service to communities around Minnesota. 
Additional past noteworthy accomplishments that come to mind include efforts by WJON-AM and its two sister stations in St. Cloud to raise money to buy bulletproof vests for the police departments. Its goal was $50,000, but ultimately raised $75,000. And stations 92 KQRS-FM and 93.7 KEGE-FM in Minneapolis have worked with Minnesota Job Services to set up a free interactive telephone hotline to connect employers with qualified applicants. Amazingly, this service registers 10,000 calls each month. 
Finally, some of my colleagues in the Senate have advocated that Congress or the Federal Communications Commission mandate `free' or further discounted air time for political candidates. While I share the concern of many of my colleagues over the decreasing level of voter participation over the last few years, I believe proponents of this idea should more closely examine the level to which broadcasters are already raising the political awareness of the electorate through news coverage and free debate time. In 1996, two-thirds of Minnesota radio stations and four in ten television stations offered free air time to political candidates, with many of those stations actually holding the events. 
Many more stations aired a local political affairs program or segment dealing with the local elections, and special segments profiling candidates and their positions on the issues. And nearly all of the stations surveyed appealed to their audiences to vote, whether through public service announcements, public affairs programming or the news. These efforts by Minnesota's broadcasters have helped to restore the people's faith and participation in our democracy. 
Through disaster relief efforts, holiday safety initiatives, fund-raising drives, school announcements, public affairs programming, and weather emergency information, Minnesota broadcasters have demonstrated their commitment and dedication to public service. 
I am proud to say that in some instances, these efforts have been recognized by the Minnesota Broadcasters Association through their `Media Best Awards' and by the National Association of Broadcasters annual `Crystal Radio Awards.' 
I applaud the leadership shown by all of Minnesota's stations, and am pleased to have shared their accomplishments with the Senate.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express concern at the continued efforts of some Members of Congress to use dairy farmers and consumers as vehicles for political manipulation. 
Late in the day on Friday, February 12, the Office of Management and Budget released a study requested by Congress which is reported to be an analysis of the economic effects of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. Unfortunately, it appears only to be a masterful work of political manipulation that skillfully avoids answering the core question of what actually is the impact of the Northeast Dairy Compact. As a watered-down compromise, the report sheds little light on the plight of dairy farmers both inside the Compact region and around the nation. Meanwhile, the New England milk tax continues to take its toll on the most vulnerable consumers. 
Senator Feingold and I were the authors of the amendment which directed OMB to undertake an unbiased, independent study of the direct and indirect economic effects of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. Did we receive an unbiased study? Hardly. I was informed that Compact supporters had plenty of input. Lacking the same political clout, opponents did not. What the American people have received is a sanitized product of regional politics. It's one more example of this administration's failed dairy policy. 
The OMB has made it painfully clear that they had neither the time, data, nor resources to produce a meaningful analysis. This is not a legitimate excuse for producing a report with exorbitant levels of `statistical uncertainty.' We attempted to work with OMB in addressing the issue of the inadequate time frame for conducting a meaningful study. At the beginning of the year, OMB asked for my assistance in requesting a time-extension before the release of the report. I worked with them to obtain the short extension they requested, in the interest of not rushing through the project. This was the only time an extension was requested even though I made it clear I would work with them in obtaining further extensions as necessary. 
So, why did OMB wait until the week before the initially scheduled release of the study to inform us that not enough time had passed to produce a significant, decisive report? If OMB could see there still was a problem with insufficient data due to the limited time the Compact has been in effect, they should have made a formal request for an extension. 
There was no attempt to seek an extension to allow a meaningful study, only a veiled attempt to get this request off their plate--even if it resulted in an inferior product compromising the integrity of OMB. Aren't the best economists in the government at OMB? This study questions that presumption. 
The attitude in a staff briefing conducted by OMB three weeks ago was that it did not want this task, and sought to get rid of it as soon as possible. We expect OMB to conduct professional and unbiased studies. Apparently, that is not possible. 
Even without a decent report, we all know the Compact hurts consumers. Milk prices have increased an average of 17 cents a gallon throughout New England. Those most adversely impacted include low-income families, children, and elderly residents on fixed incomes.

Mr. GRAMS. Opposition to the Compact is growing among state legislators from the New England area. One state may even be attempting to pull out of the Compact. Those regions with the most to lose are densely populated and have fewer dairy farmers relative to other regions. The result is an effective subsidization by urban consumers. 
A milk tax that burdens financially stressed working families--especially those of lower-income, who rely on reasonable and affordable milk--is wrong. It is high time we put an end to partisan, regional politics which block real, long-term, assistance for dairy farmers. 
I intend to continue my efforts to oppose the Northeast Dairy Compact. This will include fighting to obtain a comprehensive, informative study on its effects and consequences. 
Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today, on the 189th anniversary of his birth, to pay tribute to an American of commonsense ways and uncommon character. 
Let me read to you from the autobiography of Abraham Lincoln, which he penned in December of 1859. 
I was born February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky. My parents were both born in Virginia, of undistinguished families. . . 
There was absolutely nothing to excite ambition for education. Of course, when I came of age I did not know much. Still somehow, I could read, write, and cipher to the Rule of Three; but that was all. I have not been to school since. 
The little advance I now have upon this store of education, I have picked up from time to time under the pressure of necessity. 
Lincoln concluded his autobiography just four paragraphs later with these words: `There is not much of it, for the reason, I suppose, that there is not much of me.' 
That was in 1859, one year before the election that thrust Abraham Lincoln into the Presidency--before the Civil War broke out and helped crystallize all that he believed about his nation--before everything he believed about himself was tested. 
Never again could Abraham Lincoln truthfully make the claim that `there is not much of me.' 
Mr. President, on the 150th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, poet and biographer Carl Sandburg traveled here to the Capitol in 1959 to address a joint session of both Houses of Congress. 
The description he painted that day of the man born in Hardin County, Kentucky, was delivered in words far more eloquent than any I could offer up: 
He said, 
Not often does a man arrive on earth who is both steel and velvet, who is as hard as rock and soft as drifting fog, who holds in his heart and mind the paradox of terrible storm and peace unspeakable and perfect. . . 
The people of many other countries take Lincoln now for their own. He belongs to them. He stands for decency, honest dealing, plain talk, and funny stories. . . Millions there are who take him as a personal treasure. He had something they would like to see spread everywhere over the world. 
Democracy? We cannot say exactly what it is, but he had it. In his blood and bones, he carried it. In the breath of his speeches and writings, it is there. Popular government? Republican institutions? 
Government where the people have the say-so, one way or another telling their elected leaders what they want? He had the idea. It is there in the lights and shadows of his personality, a mystery that can be lived but never fully spoken in words. 
Mr. President, there are many American leaders I admire--for their convictions, their passion, and their pursuit of truth--but Abraham Lincoln towers above most all of them. 
At a troubled moment in our nation's history, he gave a voice to the growing number of Americans who felt out of place with the politics of the time. America is a place of inclusion, they argued, not exclusion. A place of freedom, not of slavery. The United States must stay united, they said, not severed into disparate parts. Abraham Lincoln spoke for what America was meant to be when he spoke of inclusion, unity, and equality, and by the sheer force of his single-minded dedication, his voice kept the Union from splintering forever apart. 
If any one man is responsible for preserving the nation during the Civil War, that man is Abraham Lincoln. 
`Important principles may and must be inflexible,' said President Lincoln in his last public address, delivered in Washington, and for that unflinching commitment, his detractors hated him. 
Lincoln was unfit, they said, `shattered, dazed, utterly foolish' . . . `a political coward' . . . `timid and arrogant.' And those were the words of his fellow Republicans. Outside his party, they labeled him `a mole-eyed monster with a soul of leather' and `the present turtle at the head of the government.' 
But his simple words and powerful resolve endeared him to the people, who looked on him as `Honest Abe,' a straightforward and sympathetic leader. He was their president, but he was also one of them. So, it was a brutal shock to the country when he was shot to death just ten blocks from here, during an evening performance at Ford's Theater. 
Mr. President, poised on the edge of the Reflecting Pool on the National Mall, overlooking Washington from its place of honor, rests a graceful tribute to our sixteenth president. Outside, the Lincoln Memorial possesses the lines of a classic Greek temple--inside, you will find the soul of an American patriot. Lincoln himself rises 19 feet toward the sky, sculpted in Georgia White marble, larger than life, his eyes forever focused forward. He cannot speak, but the walls speak for him. Etched into the stone around him are his words, and each time I visit I am struck by the visual marriage of man and message. One phrase in particular always makes me pause, a quotation from Abraham Lincoln's Second Inaugural Address, spoken just 28 days before his assassination: 
With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in. 
We have come so far as a nation since those words were first spoken. More than one hundred years have passed since brother last took up arms against brother, and we are no longer divided by allegiance to a Confederate or Union flag. By heritage, we are black Americans, white Americans, Italian Americans, Polish Americans, Norwegian Americans--and united under the Constitution, we are simply Americans. Abraham Lincoln did not live to finish the work he began, but the pursuit of liberty and inclusion he inspired in a nation has endured. 
More than once in the million recorded words he left behind, Abraham Lincoln considered his death and the reputation that history would accord him. In keeping with everything else we know about the man, however, he sought not a legacy, but his place in humanity. `Die when I may, I want it said of me that I plucked a weed and planted a flower wherever I thought a flower would grow.' Mr. President, Abraham Lincoln plucked many weeds during his too-brief life, and sowed a great garden of humanity in their place. On the anniversary of his birth, we celebrate the towering truths we have reaped from his planting. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few, brief observations about the President's budget. 
Let me say I welcome the fact that President Clinton has come up with a budget that may finally be balanced in the next fiscal year, although I do not agree with the outlines of his plan. The good news is that if the economy stays as strong as expected, we may soon enjoy a unified budget surplus for the first time since 1969. 
However, Mr. President, again, after a thorough examination of President Clinton's budget, I must say this is not at all a responsible and honest proposal. Here is why: 
First, President Clinton claims it is his fiscal policies that have reduced the federal deficit and brought the budget to the edge of balance. That would be stretching the truth. The productivity of the American people has brought us to this point, in spite of what Congress has done or the President's tax-and-spend habits. The truth is, the President has only been willing to balance the budget, if he is allowed to use all increases in revenues, plus even higher taxes, to match his appetite for spending on expanded programs, new programs, and new entitlements. 
In 1992, candidate Bill Clinton promised he would balance the budget if he were elected. When President Clinton arrived at the White House in 1993, he abandoned that promise at the front door. The first budget he proposed called for the largest tax increase in history and increased federal spending of more than a trillion dollars in just five years, a jump of 20 percent. 
In 1995, the President again promised America he could balance the budget, first in ten years, then nine, then eight, and finally, seven. He made a similar balanced-budget promise in 1996. Finally, after spending all of the $225 billion revenue windfall `miraculously' discovered by the CBO, President Clinton and the Congressional leadership agreed last year to achieve a balanced budget in six years. 
Mr. President, it is the American economy that produced this unprecedented revenue windfall for the federal government, and the unexpected dollars have come directly from working Americans--taxes paid by corporations, individuals, consumers, and investors. 
Washington did not do any heavy lifting: the people did. Yet, Washington takes all the credit. 
Second, the Clinton Administration claims that this budget will produce surpluses `as far as the eye can see.' Sure, as long as you are looking through rose-colored glasses. Such claims are explicitly intended to mislead the American people. Mr. President, this projected surplus is only a surplus under a unified budget. Without borrowing from the Social Security trust funds, the real federal deficit could reach $600 billion over five years. The total deficit will reach a trillion in the next decade. This means we will see deficits, not surpluses, as far as the eye can see. 
In fact, the CBO estimates the possible budget surplus could easily turn into a $100 billion deficit. I asked Dr. O'Neill last week what the odds were we would achieve a budget surplus versus ending up with a deficit, and she said it was 50/50. This uncertainty requires us to exercise fiscal discipline, not to run off and approve another $123 billion in spending as the President has proposed--money from a surplus we have not seen yet and a tobacco settlement that is only a proposal. 
I need to stress that a unified balanced budget is an unacceptable prospect if it is achieved at the expense of responsible governing. The truth is that the President's budget continues the tax-and-spend policies that have been the hallmark of this Administration. Again, after setting spending limits that in 1997 grew the government three times faster than inflation, or the incomes of working Americans, the President wants to blow those spending caps with another $123 billion increase in federal spending. The ink is barely dry on last year's budget agreement, which gave working Americans, or at least a few of them, $90 billion in tax relief, and now the President proposes wiping out that tax cut with $115 billion in new taxes--or increases in existing taxes, permits, or fees. 
The most untruthful thing about this budget is President Clinton's rhetoric that the era of big government is over. OMB director Raines testified in the Senate Budget Committee last week that by any standard, big government was indeed over. A $100 billion government 35 years ago is now 18 times larger, at $1.8 trillion. Who is kidding who? 
If he does not get those new taxes through Congress, the President wants to borrow from the Social Security Trust Fund. Mr. President, the Congress must not permit the President to finance his spending programs, his big-government solutions, by borrowing from Social Security. 
If you count what Senator Gramm calls `hidden spending' of $42 billion, actual spending under the President's budget would reach $1.775 trillion, a 6.4 percent increase, and a Washington record. And it continues to grow from there. In 2003, the President is asking for $1.945 trillion in federal spending. Total federal spending for the next five years would reach $9.2 trillion. Annual government spending was $1.4 trillion when Mr. Clinton became president. 
In five years, the President has already increased government spending by 27 percent. Is there any sign of leaner government? No. The truth is that the government is growing bigger and bigger and bigger. 
Nor does this budget do anything to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary Federal programs. It does nothing to make the government more accountable and efficient. It actually increases civilian nondefense employment by 9,200. This is big, central government by any standard. 
Mr. President, as I said on the floor the other day, if this is a race to prove who can be the most `compassionate' with the taxpayers' dollars, it is a race nobody is going to win, and one the taxpayers most certainly will lose. The truth is simple: you cannot buy compassion. 
Third, the President claims that he will not bust the spending caps set up by last year's budget agreement. Again, this is not true. President Clinton has not only violated the spirit of the budget deal, he has also in effect broken the statutory spending caps established under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
Secretary Rubin assured us last week that the President would be bound by the budget agreement we reached last year. But by the President's own estimates, his budget does not meet the statutory caps on discretionary spending by actually reducing that spending. 
The offsets proposed in the budget are highly questionable. To stay within the caps called for by last year's Balanced Budget Act, the President anticipates the use of $60 billion in tax increases to offset discretionary spending. 
By doing so, without amending the law, the budget in effect violates the two separate enforcement measures set up by the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act, and it violates the spirit of last year's budget deal. 
Mr. President, we broke the 1993 statutory spending caps last year, and we must never repeat that mistake. The current spending caps must stay in place. 
Fourth, President Clinton claims that his budget will save Social Security. Again, the President is not being truthful to the American people. On the contrary, his budget does nothing to address our long-term financial imbalances. 
And his call for increased spending would use all of any surplus, leaving nothing for Social Security. In fact, under the unified budget, the President will borrow another trillion dollars from the Social Security Trust Fund by the year 2012. 
The President's Medicare proposal in this budget does more harm than good. Although the President has proposed putting the projected budget surplus into the Social Security trust funds, he has no specific plan of how to save Social Security. 
Simply throwing money into the system without real reform will not preserve it. President Clinton's own Social Security Commissioner, Kenneth Apfel, recently said the President's proposal to bail out Social Security could not alone come close to solving the system's impending deficit. It may only extend the fund for two to five years. 
Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed with this budget and troubled by its untruthfulness to the American people. 
Although our short-term fiscal condition has improved in recent years, thanks to what Chairman Greenspan called an `exceptionally healthy' economy, our long-term fiscal imbalances still impose a threat to our future. 
Washington's bills remain astronomic. We have a $5.5 trillion national debt, at least $14 trillion in unfunded liabilities for Social Security and Medicare, and more than $5 trillion worth of government contingencies. These risks will shatter our economy if we fail to take action now. 
If the President will not step up and take the lead in ensuring fiscal responsibility, then Congress must. We must continue to cut government spending, shrink the size of the government, and reform Social Security and Medicare to save them. 
Mr. President, in the next few months, I intend to work with my colleagues and the Administration to exercise the fiscal discipline necessary to ensure the federal budget will be balanced--and stay balanced--without new taxes, without new spending, and without borrowing from the Social Security Trust Fund. 
That is the responsible thing to do. That is the honest thing to do. And, Mr. President, that is the right thing to do.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, over the course of the debate on Dr. Satcher's nomination for Assistant Secretary of Health and Surgeon General, Senator Ashcroft and others have expressed some issues of concern. First, Dr. Satcher's comments regarding abortion. Second, an AZT study in Africa to research alternative treatments for developing nations to the costly and inaccessible AZT regimen. 
While I initially had concerns about Dr. Satcher's comments on abortion, I wanted to listen to the debate, examine additional written responses Dr. Satcher provided to the committee on this issue, and make my decision. 
During the committee's consideration of Dr. Satcher, he stated that he supports President Clinton in his veto of the ban on partial-birth-abortions. After the hearings, he tried to back-track. 
In his October 28, 1997 written comments to Senator Frist, Dr. Satcher further explained his position on abortion and I'd like to quote those remarks. 
Let me state unequivocally that I have no intention of using the positions of Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General to promote issues related to abortion. I share no one's political agenda and I want to use the power of these positions to focus on issues that unite Americans--not divide them. 
I am not comforted by this clarification of his position. 
Mr. President, I believe we as a nation require a Surgeon General who's position on this issue is one of furthering policies which, at a minimum, do not give tacit approval of a procedure that 75 to 80 percent of Americans agree is barbaric and unneeded. 
With regard to the AZT trials to prevent the maternal-to-infant transfer of HIV in Africa, I also share some concerns about the protocol set up in this study. Specifically, the use of a placebo control group. 
Mr. President, I have always been a strong supporter of medical research. I cannot, however, endorse or condone research done in developing countries in a manner which we would not conduct it here in our own Nation--with our own constituents as the subjects of that research. 
Mr. President, I listened to both sides of the arguments and came to a conclusion. I have no reason to believe Dr. David Satcher is not qualified to serve as Assistant Secretary of Health and Surgeon General of the United States. However, I, for the reasons cited earlier, could not in good conscience support his nomination.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the `Federal Surplus Property Improvement Act of 1998' and ask my colleagues for their support of this legislation. 
Congressional oversight of our country's surplus personal property donation program may not be a topic of debate in the Senate, but it is of great importance to my constituents and the 70,000 recipients of surplus federal personal property in all of our states. 
Members of Congress and state and local officials all have an obligation to see that the government distributes this property fairly and equitably, ensuring accountability to the taxpayers. 
Too often, federal agencies forget that the owners of this property are the American people--the federal government is merely its public custodian. 
As my colleagues may know, once a piece of federal personal property such as a typewriter, chair or vehicle is declared `excess' by a federal agency, it is offered to other federal agencies for their use. If no other agency can utilize the property, it is donated to the states or other public agencies. 
The current system of disposal is based on reforms signed into law by President Ford over twenty years ago. 
The reforms to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 enacted in 1976 were based on concerns that as surplus property distribution programs multiplied, confusion and inefficiency on the part of the federal government grew as well. 
Congress realized that the various state agencies and the General Services Administration should work together to ensure a fair and equitable allocation of surplus federal property to eligible recipients. 
Under this new partnership, states would have a greater role over distribution, while GSA would guide the overall system on the federal side. 
Mr. President, the 1976 reforms also broadened the pool of eligible recipients to include parks and recreation, conservation, public health and public safety. 
Since then, each state agency for surplus property has worked with neighboring state agencies and GSA to provide the equipment, supplies and material used to educate our children, maintain roads and streets, keep utility rates reasonable, train the workers of tomorrow, protect families from crime, and during natural disasters, treat the health of our nation's sick and needy. 
Through the efforts of the state agencies for surplus property, eligible recipients have acquired impressive pieces of equipment such as trailers, forklifts, fire trucks, aircraft, boats and generators.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am particularly impressed at how effectively the state agencies, GSA and the Defense Re-utilization and Marketing Service have worked together as a team to respond quickly and efficiently during times of national disasters and emergencies. 
Together they have successfully identified and transported sandbags, blankets, cots, tools, trucks and other equipment and supplies to disaster sites. 
In 1997, the state agencies and their federal partners faced a number of emergencies--and they delivered. 
And I know Minnesotans who suffered through the Midwest floods last year appreciated the relief provided to them during these horrible times. I recently received a letter from Dave Allen, Chief Pilot of the Minnesota State Patrol, and a recipient of surplus property distributed by the Minnesota State Agency for Surplus Property for the last several years. 
Mr. Allen wrote:  
In February 1997 our unit had the need for a twin engine airplane. One week after I made the request for this type of aircraft, Gene Glaeser called and said he had located an aircraft he thought would meet our needs. It was a Beechcraft Queen Air and it had been used by NASA for several years and was based at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. 
The Beechcraft Queen Air acquired from NASA including the training of six pilots cost the State approximately $35,000 to place it in service. This aircraft had been appraised at $150,000-$175,000 by an aircraft broker . . . Had the surplus property program not been available to us our chances of acquiring this equipment would not have existed. 
This is a perfect example of our government obtaining the most from a piece of equipment . . . I would hope that this program would continue for many years in the future, as everyone benefits from it. 
The plane filled a very important need during last year's floods by shuttling state and emergency management staff to meetings, where they assessed the damage in our communities and provided guidance to residents. 
The state agencies for surplus property should be commended for following the intent of Congress and fulfilling their responsibilities under Public Law 94-519. However, I believe that the volume and value of distributed surplus federal property would increase if the intent of the Congress when it passed the 1976 reforms was more closely followed. 
If Congress continues to allow surplus federal property to go abroad, or not make its way through proper channels to eligible recipients, our students, workers, taxpayers, and families will lose. The legislation I am introducing will address these concerns through the following provisions. 
First, this legislation would ensure that when distributing surplus federal property, domestic needs are met before we consider foreign interests. It would, however, grant the President the authority to make supplies available for humanitarian relief purposes before going to the states, in the case of emergencies or natural disasters. 
Second, my bill would amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit the transfer of Government-owned excess property to foreign countries or international organizations for environmental protection activities in foreign countries unless GSA determined that there is no federal or state use for the property. 
Fourth, my bill would repeal the authority of the Secretary of Energy to transfer excess DOE research and development facility equipment to educational institutions in the U.S. This current practice by DOE falls outside the Donation Program and denies equal access to all local education agencies, schools and universities. 
Third, it would ensure that 8(a) firms participating in the Small Business Administration's Capital Ownership Development Program maintain their eligibility to receive surplus Federal property, but through the normal process involving GSA and the State agencies. States, not bureaucracies, should determine how to meet the needs of our schools and universities. 
Finally, this legislation would require GSA to report to Congress on the effectiveness of all statutes relating to the disposal and donation of personal property and recommend any changes that would further improve the Donation Program. 
Mr. President, my bill is based on the principle that eligible recipients should be able to maximize their tax dollars through expendable Federal property that meets their needs. 
It takes an important step toward stopping publicly-owned property from being shipped abroad and given to other organizations before it is distributed through each State agency for surplus property. 
My legislation will fulfill the public's right to know how and where their tax dollars are being spent. 
In many ways, it will serve as the second phase of the reforms overwhelmingly passed by Congress in 1976, by preserving the active role of States in the handling and distribution of surplus Federal property. This initiative will benefit thousands of recipients--the Nation's taxpayers. 
The best interests of America's taxpayers has always been at the top of my agenda. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to move this legislation through Congress and give the taxpayers the highest possible return on their investment.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) on the occasion of the 88th Anniversary of its founding on February 8, 1998. 
At the turn of the century in England, Robert Baden-Powell, an outdoor enthusiast and a veteran of the British Army's campaigns in Africa, published a nature skills book intended for young people to expose them to the rewards offered by a working knowledge of nature. The book was titled `Scouting for Boys' and was based on survival manuals Baden-Powell authored during his military career. Shortly after the book's publication, Baden-Powell led a group of 22 boys on a scouting exhibition on Brownsea Island, off the coast of England, for the purpose of applying the principles contained in the book. 
From that original group of 22 sprang forth a movement which now boasts over 5 million members in this country alone, and continues to grow each year. In my home state of Minnesota, the Viking Council of the Boy Scouts of America serves over 57,000 youths between the ages of 5 and 20, making it the 21st largest of the 335 Boy Scout Councils in this country. 
Participation in the Boy Scouts of America gives young people a sense of self-worth and satisfaction that is the product of setting and accomplishing goals, and being a part of a winning team. Such experiences cultivate discipline and a sense of responsibility that are assets for life. 
By cooperating with peers to achieve a common end, Scouts learn valuable lessons in leadership. Countless civic, professional, and community leaders throughout our Nation were involved in the Boy Scouts of America as youths, including 302 members of the 104th Congress. 
Through programs like the `Urban Scouting Emphasis,' which has over 4,300 participants in urban Minneapolis, the Boy Scouts of America is bringing its valuable life lessons to inner city youth who are particularly at risk of falling victim to the entrapments of the streets. The Boy Scouts of America offers a place where young people can gain a sense of belonging and loyalty that they may otherwise seek to find in street gangs. Furthermore, the importance of programs like `Urban Emphasis' is amplified when considering the annual cost per youth served by Viking Council is $58.31, whereas the cost of housing a juvenile offender is $100.00 per day. 
Of course all the forementioned would hardly be possible without the adult volunteers who are the foundation of the Boy Scouts of America. Currently there are over 1.3 million men and women nationwide who, in the spirit of Robert Baden-Powell, graciously give their time and talents to ensure that the youth of society grow into well-adjusted adults. Adult volunteers touch the lives of young people by serving as excellent role models and teachers, as well as caring friends. 
The Boy Scouts' objectives are defined in the `Aim of Scouting' as being character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. On the surface, these aims may seem simplistic, yet many have forgotten the importance of these principles. Thankfully, these principles continue to prosper in the Boy Scouts of America. 
Mr. President, for 88 years the Boy Scouts of America has been teaching the value of community, Nation, and Creator to our Nation's youth. This is truly grounds for celebration.

Mr. GRAMS. 
Mr. President, most people do not realize that torture is practiced or condoned in more than 100 countries. 
We all agree that torture is a horrible act. It is designed to physically and emotionally cripple individuals, to render them incapable of mounting an effective opposition to a regime or a system of beliefs. 
Torture does not affect just the victim--it sends a strong message to the victim's family, community, and nation that dissent will not be tolerated. Torture is not used as a weapon just against an individual--it is used as a weapon against democracy. 
As a nation, we cannot stand by and continue to let the victims of torture suffer in silence. We must do more than proclaim that the practice of torture is abhorrent. We must provide assistance to torture survivors, for they truly are not able to help themselves. 
The `Survivors of Torture Support Act' will assist victims of torture both here and abroad. While the practice of torture is not a problem in this country, many victims of torture flee to the United States to seek refuge. 
As many as 400,000 torture survivors now live in the United States. Many of the survivors may not be getting the assistance they need. Other survivors of torture remain abroad; they deserve effective treatment as well. 
The `Survivors of Torture Support Act' makes changes in U.S. immigration policy to account for the special needs of torture survivors. 
This bill designates torture victims as refugees of special humanitarian concern. 
It ensures expedited processing for asylum applicants who present credible claims of subjection to torture. It also establishes procedures for taking into account the effects of torture in the adjudication of such claims. 
This bill grants the presumption that such applicants shall not be detained while their asylum claims are pending, and provides exemption from expedited removal procedures for individuals in danger of being subjected to torture. 
Many times, torture survivors are not identified by U.S. officials because consular, immigration, and also asylum personnel have not received adequate training in either the identification of evidence of torture or the techniques for interviewing torture victims. 
The `Survivors of Torture Support Act' requires that the Attorney General and the Secretary of State provide training necessary for these officials to recognize the effects of torture on victims, and the way this can affect the interview or hearing process. 
It also requires special training in interview techniques, so that survivors of torture are not traumatized by this experience. 
Torture survivors can be productive members of American society if they have access to treatment. That is why this bill provides $50 million over three years for treatment of victims of torture in the United States and abroad. 
My home state of Minnesota is fortunate to have the first comprehensive treatment center in the United States for victims of torture. 
The Center for Victims of Torture has treated more than 500 patients since it was established in 1985, and by helping those patients overcome the atrocities suffered in their homelands, has assisted them in becoming productive members of our communities. 
In addition to providing treatment to persons who have been tortured by foreign governments, the Center has been active in providing training and support for treatment centers abroad. I have learned a great deal from visiting the Center and meeting its clients and staff. 
Support for legislation to assist torture survivors has been increasing since Senator Dave Durenberger first introduced it in 1994. 
I have worked closely with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, in developing legislation to address the very real needs of these survivors. While we have chosen different paths in bringing this issue before the Senate, our bills differ primarily in approach. 
Therefore, I applaud his efforts and look forward to working closely with him to move legislation forward in 1998 that will assist victims of torture who reside in the U.S. and also abroad. 
The United States should take a leading role in encouraging the establishment of additional treatment programs both at home and also abroad. 
We are making progress in this direction. The U.S. is now the largest contributor to the United Nations voluntary fund for victims of torture. We must continue to support treatment centers, like the one in Minnesota, which help those who cannot help themselves. 
Again, I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, it is with great sorrow that I rise today to acknowledge the passing of my former colleague Dave Moore on January 28, and with great joy that I recall his memory and the happiness he brought to Minnesota television viewers for over thirty-four years. 
Dave Moore was hired by WCCO Television in Minneapolis for a series of announcing jobs in July of 1950. At the onset of daily newscasts at WCCO in 1957, Dave was placed at the helm of the 10 p.m. broadcasts. 
For the next thirty-four years Dave would become a fixture on Minnesota television and a true icon. It is difficult to imagine that in July of 1957 the management of WCCO, and quite possibly Dave himself, knew that Dave would become such an legend. Scores of Minnesotans would tune into WCCO news each night and hear Dave's friendly voice as he reported the news with his warm, yet serious, demeanor. 
Trained as an actor at the University of Minnesota, Dave reported the news with the spontaneity, flair, and wit that only an actor could provide. Dave's acting talents made it possible for him to venture beyond his role as an anchorman to his role on `Bedtime Nooz' where each Saturday night between 1962 and 1971 he would take a satirical look at current events. 
Dave's broadcasting success was acknowledged by a number of awards and honors, including the Mitchell V. Charnley Award in 1983, as well as being named Outstanding Broadcast Personality of 1991 by the Minnesota Broadcasters Association. In addition, `The Moore Report,' a documentary and public interest program hosted by Dave, won numerous awards, including the George Foster Peabody Award for its special titled `Hollow Victory: Vietnam Under Communism.' 
As a truly gifted orator, Dave used his talents to serve his community by doing volunteer reading for Radio Talking Books for the Blind, and making frequent visits to local elementary schools to read to the students. 
A native of Minneapolis, Dave was quite content with establishing his career in the his hometown, untempted by the possibilities available to a person of his talents. Dave was the most visible personality on WCCO when it was at its pinnacle, yet that did not cause him to shy away from the public. Dave often acted in community plays and could be frequently seen around Minneapolis simply participating in life in the city he loved as just another one of its ordinary citizens. 
Mr. President, I wish to offer my sincerest condolences to Dave's family and on behalf of the citizens of Minnesota reassure them that we all share in their loss. At the conclusion of his last broadcast on December 6, 1991, Dave expressed his sentiments by simply stating, `There will be no maudlin, tearful farewell, just a simple, but very heartfelt thank-you to all of you for your support down through the years. I've been very touched by it.' Thank you Dave, you touched us as well.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, 85 years ago today, the 16th Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, giving Congress the power to levy an income tax on the people. As we mark this occasion, I rise to call upon Congress to take immediate action to end the federal tax code as we know it, and end 85 years of ever-increasing hardship for America's taxpayers. 
Let me focus on how we got here and why we need real tax reform. 
Mr. President, this great Nation was born out of a revolt against the abusive taxing powers of its motherland. This tax revolt created a nation of individual liberty. In this land, a person owns himself, his labor, and the fruit of his labor. To protect individual liberty, our founders crafted Clause 4 of Article I, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution, rejecting all direct income taxes that were not apportioned to each State by its population. 
This clause, as originally adopted in the Constitution, clearly reflected the genius, wisdom, and experience of our founders--protecting individual liberty by limiting the Government's power to tax. For more than 100 years following the founding of this nation, the American people enjoyed tax freedom and did not pay any income taxes. Although an income tax was imposed as a temporary measure to finance the Civil War in 1862, it was repealed shortly after the war ended. 
In the same period--during the last decade of the 18th, the entire 19th, and first decade of the 20th century--the Supreme Court also defended this freedom and held the income tax to be unconstitutional. However, under the direct influence of the rise of socialism in Europe at that time, on February 3rd, 1913, the 16th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified. The 16th Amendment says: 
`The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.' 
Mr. President, in my view, nothing has been more damaging to America's families than the 16th Amendment. It opened a Pandora's box we have never since been able to contain. A few months after the Amendment was ratified, the Revenue Act of 1913 was enacted, imposing an individual income tax. The ratification of the 16th Amendment and enactment of the first tax code fundamentally eroded individual liberty and created the shadow of servitude that has darkened our Nation since. 
Former IRS Commissioner T. Coleman Andrews said the 16th Amendment, in effect, repealed Article Four of the Bill of Rights. The 16th Amendment has empowered tax collectors to invade our citizen's homes, papers, and private affairs. Worse still, it is used for social engineering, redistributing private income, and promoting class warfare. 
Initially, the income tax did not apply to individuals with taxable incomes less than $3,000, which in today's dollars means that people with incomes of $44,000 or lower would be exempted from paying tax. It only imposed a one-percent tax on the first $20,000, which equals over $300,000 in today's dollars. The highest tax rate was up to 7 percent for income above $500,000, which equals over $8 million today. 
Less than one percent of all Americans paid any income tax in 1913. Only 5 percent of Americans paid any income tax as late as 1939, before World War II. Then came the New Deal, which tripled Government spending, producing a large Federal budget deficit. 
It was the Second World War that gave the Government an excuse to enact the first mass income tax increase in U.S. history. The lowest tax rate rose from 4 percent on income over $4,000 to 23 percent on income over $2,000. Higher taxes were accompanied by a withholding system that took money out of each worker's paycheck, rather than requiring them to pay their taxes in one lump-sum payment at the end of the year. After the war, tax rates and Federal revenue receded somewhat, but never returned to prewar levels. 
Today, the Federal tax burden is at an historic high. For the average worker, more than three hours of every eight-hour working day are dedicated just to paying taxes. The average American family spends more on taxes than it does on food, clothing, transportation, and housing combined. A typical median-income family can expect to pay nearly 40 percent of its income in Federal, State, and local taxes. This. In 1996, an average household with an annual income between $22,500 and $30,000 paid an average of $9,000 for food, clothing, and housing and paid $11,000 in total taxes. 
Households with incomes ranging from $45,000 to $60,000 averaged $16,000 for basic necessities, and paid the tax collector $25,000. If the `hidden taxes' that result from the high cost of Government regulations are factored in, a family today gives up more than 50 percent of its annual income to the Government. The budget submitted yesterday by the President continues this pattern of growing Federal intrusion into the taxpayers' daily lives. 
While I have always called for a smaller, more efficient Government, the President's budget endorses just the opposite. While I want to close down Government agencies that do not perform their duties, the President wants to give them more money. That includes the Department of Energy, a taxpayer-financed black hole for which the President wants to boost spending by another 8 percent next year. 
Overall, it appears the President would increase Federal spending by $135 billion and raise taxes and fees by $115 billion to pay for all that new spending. And the President's scheme to help fund his laundry list of new initiatives by using $65.5 billion in tobacco settlement proceeds is risky--if a settlement does not occur, then where do the dollars come from? Even higher taxes? I know some of my colleagues take offense when I use the phrase `Washington's big spenders.' But I cannot think of any euphemism in which to couch what is happening here. 
This is a budget cooked up by big spenders and served to a taxpaying public that did not order it and does not want it. But that has long been the pattern in Washington. 
To make matters worse, as the tax burden has grown higher and more unfair, the government tax collector, the IRS, has turned into an arrogant, inefficient, cold-hearted, heavy-handed, intrusive, and abusive bureaucracy. We have heard many horror stories about how IRS agents routinely use their enormous coercive power to squeeze more money out of the taxpayer's pockets to meet the demands of ever-increasing Government spending. Not only do people pay more taxes, but they spend more time and money calculating their tax burden. Our tax system has become extremely complicated and difficult to understand, even for IRS experts. Do you know the tax code was only 14 pages long when it was first enacted, but today it has grown to 10,000 pages, and on top of that, there are another 20 volumes of tax regulations, and thousands and thousands of pages of instructions and other guidance. The current tax code is anti-family and anti-economic growth. It destroys economic opportunity, hinders job creation, impedes productivity, and retards competitiveness. It has deepened despair and disaffection among the poor and disadvantaged. It encourages abuse, waste, and corruption. 
Our Nation faces many great challenges in the 21st century. But without real change, the present tax system will fail to lead us there. We must fix the system. To correct the problem once and for all, Congress must pass new legislation to fundamentally reform our tax system and replace the ever-more-complicated tax code with one that is simpler, fairer, and more friendly to the taxpayers. 
The American people deserve a new tax code that promotes harmony among people instead of promoting class warfare; a new tax code that encourages work and savings; a new code that rewards families and success rather than penalizing them; a new code that stimulates real economic growth and produces more jobs and higher tax revenue for the Government; a new tax code that allows people to keep more of their own money. 
Congress should explore all possible solutions to achieve these objectives. The 85th anniversary of the 16th Amendment's ratification is an ignoble occasion. I urge my colleagues to reflect on this day and what it has come to mean to America's struggling taxpayers. And I urge them to join me in a pledge to the people that we will not let another anniversary come and go before we dedicate ourselves to ending the tax code as we know it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today because after 16 years of denials, delays, and indifference on the part of the U.S. Department of Energy, the American taxpayers are about to find themselves saddled with the liability for our nation's nuclear waste. 
It is a liability they do not deserve, and one they most certainly cannot afford. Unfortunately, the President failed to warn them on Tuesday night during his State of the Union address that many of the achievements he acknowledged are at risk--threatened by a federal government failure so massive that it may take the taxpayers years, even decades, to burrow out from underneath it. 
What could be so potentially devastating? The failure of the U.S. Department of Energy to begin accepting the nation's spent commercial nuclear fuel. 
And, Mr. President, the taxpayers will inherit the responsibility for that failure just three days from now. 
At midnight on January 31, 1998, the DOE is required by law to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from sites across the nation. 
The clock was set in motion 16 years ago, upon enactment of the `Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.' 
Since then, utility ratepayers have been required to pay the federal government more than 13 billion of their hard-earned dollars in exchange for the promise that the DOE would develop and build a centralized repository for the safe and efficient storage of spent nuclear fuel. 
But that's yet another government promise that won't be kept. 
Today, 16 years later--with 7 billion of those ratepayer dollars already spent--the waste is piling up. 
Nobody at the DOE wants it--nobody at the DOE is prepared to claim it--and because there's no place to put it, nobody at the DOE would be ready to take it by the January 31st deadline anyway. That's just three days from now. 
At the same time energy consumers are pouring billions into the waste fund, ratepayers and utilities are continuing to pay for on-site storage at more than 70 commercial nuclear plants throughout the country. 
In other words, ratepayers are being forced to pay twice for nuclear waste storage--all because the Department of Energy has failed to meet its legal obligations to the American people. 
Sadly, these costs pale in comparison to the true catastrophe the DOE has in store for the taxpayers beginning just three days from now. 
The United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, in a ruling issued on November 14, said that not only is the DOE authorized to begin accepting waste on January 31, but also able to fulfill its contractual obligations to remove it. 
By failing to do so, the court ruled, the DOE makes the federal government liable for any damages resulting from even the smallest delay in performance. 
And we all know who foots government's bills. 
By failing to take possession of the nation's nuclear waste just three days from now, the DOE will in essence make the American taxpayer responsible for those damages. 
According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, the estimated cost of storing spent nuclear fuel at power plants across the nation through 2020 is $56 billion, with the federal government--the taxpayers--liable for every dollar. 
And when nuclear power plants begin to shut down because the utilities don't have the facilities to store fuel on site, the chain reaction of higher energy costs and lost jobs that are certain to follow represents yet another costly economic consequence of this federal folly. 
The impact on the environment of alternative energy sources must also be examined. 
How is it possible that all of this will be set into motion just three days from now, and yet it didn't merit a single sentence in the President's State of the Union address? 
Mr. President, it's ironic that, while the DOE has failed to meet America's nuclear waste storage needs, the DOE has resumed collecting spent nuclear fuel from a total of 41 other countries under the `Atoms for Peace' program. 
Similar to the large number of our states which are facing nuclear waste storage problems, countries from around the world are experiencing the same problems. The only difference is that their needs--not our own ratepayers' needs--are being met by our federal government. 
In fact, the DOE has completed `urgent relief' shipments of spent nuclear fuel assemblies from European nations to the agency's facility at Savannah River. It has also accepted nuclear spent fuel from Latin American countries. 
Ultimately, up to 890 foreign research reactor cores will be accepted by the DOE over a 13-year period. 
Mr. President, an important point to discuss when it comes to these foreign nuclear waste shipments is how they are transported once they reach the continental United States. 
Nuclear assemblies from these 41 countries have been and will continue to be transported by rail and truck to the Savannah River Facility. The safety record of these shipments speaks for itself. 
The federal government won't accept commercial spent nuclear fuel, but it's actively accepting nuclear waste from many American universities. 
Nuclear waste from research reactors at our finest educational institutions is being accepted at the DOE's Savannah River facility. Again, this nuclear waste is being safely transported by rail and truck across the nation. 
These shipments serve as a very small portion of the 2,400 shipments of high-level nuclear waste that have already been shipped across the United States, including naval spent fuel. 
So, Mr. President, transportation is no longer a question of technology but becomes one of politics. 
I understand the rationale behind reducing our international nuclear dangers by collecting and transporting spent fuel within our borders. 
But what I and many others cannot comprehend is how our government has made it a priority to help foreign countries with their nuclear waste problems while simultaneously ignoring the concerns right here in our own country. 
Our ratepayers are paying the bill to take care of our own waste problem. Yet that isn't being addressed but our ratepayers and our taxpayers are paying to help foreign countries do the same thing. 
The President on Tuesday also failed to mention that the costs of missing the January 31st deadline will be borne as much by grandma and grandpa as they will by any corporate executives or Members of Congress. 
He didn't mention that nuclear power is a fuel that burns nothing, thereby helping us achieve cleaner air and a better environment. 
He failed to mention that the costs of his global warming treaty will be even higher for every American if we continue to shut down nuclear power plants in favor of coal-burning technologies. 
Most regrettably, he failed to offer any kind of explanation into why his administration supports the Department of Energy as they unlawfully stick it to the American taxpayers. 
It therefore falls to Congress to step forward and offer a solution. 
Along with my colleagues, Senators Murkowski and Craig, I've coauthored legislation that will protect the American public from the costs they face from this impending crisis. 
Our bill will reform the current civilian nuclear waste program to avoid the squandering of billions of dollars of ratepayers' and taxpayers' money. 
It will eliminate the current need for on-site storage at our nation's nuclear plants, keep plants from shutting down prematurely due to lack of storage space, and maintain stable energy prices. 
Our bill will also assure that transportation of nuclear waste will continue to be conducted in a safe manner. 
The `Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997' passed both houses of Congress last session by overwhelming, bipartisan votes. 
While conferees have yet to be appointed, a veto threat from the White House continues to prevent a responsible solution from becoming law. 
Again, a veto threat from the White House on this issue continues to prevent the responsible solution from becoming law. 
As representatives of the people, it's the responsibility of the government to ensure that every taxpayer dollar entrusted to us is spent in a responsible and meaningful way. In the case of nuclear waste storage, the government has failed this most important of tests. 
While the DOE waits, and hides behind courtroom appeals, and shirks responsibilities it is legally bound to accept, Americans across our country can expect yet more rate increases and yet higher taxes from a government that's either too afraid or to incompetent to act. 
Just three days from now, who's going to explain that to the taxpayers? 
Americans deserve to hear from their leader on this issue. They deserve and expect a rational explanation for the Administration's inaction on their behalf. Silence, Mr. President, is not the answer they so desperately need. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I just wanted to come to the floor here for a few minutes this afternoon to somewhat join in the debate, but also to add my support to Senate bill S. 1297, that is, renaming the Washington National Airport to the Ronald Reagan National Airport. 
I have been kind of saddened by the debate that I have been hearing today on S. 1297 and, again, to rename Washington National Airport as the Ronald Reagan National Airport. I simply cannot believe some of the things I have heard on the floor, that somehow this effort would require a quid pro quo. 
Mr. President, in diluting this effort, I think it is insulting that this legislation is being demagoged in this way. This should be a noncontroversial bill. It is a very fitting tribute to a very wonderful American hero. He was a President not just for Republicans, but he was a President for all people. And it should be passed. 
This bill should be passed before President Reagan's birthday, which occurs just a week from tomorrow, that is, February the 6th. What a great tribute it would be. You know, I am very proud that this Senate has taken the time to propose that such a fitting tribute be paid to Ronald Reagan. Again, I do not think that it should be turned in any way into a petty or partisan tirade. 
I have heard and had a chance to listen to a few of my other colleagues who have been to the floor. And they have delivered some real eloquent statements on what Ronald Reagan has done, what it has meant to them, what they feel that he has done for America. 
President Reagan inspired or maybe we could say reinspired a whole generation of Americans, millions of Americans, much in the same way that John F. Kennedy inspired Americans 20 years earlier in 1960. I believe that President Reagan is a man who wanted to leave a legacy, but not a legacy to himself. President Reagan was a man who wanted to leave a legacy to his children and grandchildren and to all Americans that America can be a better place if we only believe in ourselves and what we can do and strive to do better. 
I remember listening to him way back in 1976 when he first appeared on the national scene. And I listened to him--and this was at a time when I was not actively involved in politics --but the things he was saying in 1976 were things that I brought to my campaign as late as 1992 and again in 1994. 
And that was for a better America, a more responsible America, one that was going to deevolutionize Washington, DC, and put more of the control and power back into the hands of State and local governments, but most importantly back into the hands of individuals. 
He talked then about a tax cut, balancing the budget, which is all kind of the legacy that we now have the great opportunity to be talking about here as we begin the second half of the 105th Congress in 1998. I think he filled a void in many of us with those words and that inspiration. 
I am very proud that this Senate is proposing this fitting tribute. Again, we are not renaming an airport that was originally named in honor of another individual. This is Washington National Airport. It is named after the City of Washington. Renaming the airport does not somehow politicize it. It would not convey some sort of partisan advantage, but it would simply provide, again, a tribute to a great American who has been honored by so many on both sides of the aisle. 
This isn't a time to count how many Republicans and how many Democrats have buildings or public facilities that are named after them. This legislation has been around for some time. It simply is not appropriate to make demands at the last minute to hold up this legislation. 
Mr. President, the City of Washington has a new airport terminal. It is a magnificent structure that speaks volumes about the pride that Washingtonians feel for this city. It is a fitting reflection of the pride that Americans feel as well for their National Capital. 
So again, I cannot think of a more appropriate time than now to give our airport a new name, especially when it is the name of a man who represents such hope and inspiration. Ronald Reagan embodies America, and by giving his name to that of our Capital City airport I think is an honor that he has earned and one that he deserves. 
So I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. And I strongly urge my colleagues to end this debate, to come to the floor and support this legislation and let us pass it. 
So I compliment Senator Coverdell on his efforts on this. And again, I hope we can move this legislation forward and make sure that it is passed by the Senate and the House and signed by the President by next week so we can honor Ronald Reagan on his birthday on February the 6th. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the role of the radio broadcasting community in my home state of Minnesota. I cannot think of a more appropriate time to reflect upon how radio affects our daily lives than during `National Radio Month.' 
This year marks the 78th anniversary of radio in the United States. Throughout this time, radio has become an influential medium in the lives of most Americans. Today, there are over 12,200 radios in the U.S. According to the Radio Advertising Bureau, people listen to radio an average of 3 hours and 12 minutes on weekdays, and 4 hours and 42 minutes on weekends. Four out of five motorists are listening to the radio while driving, and 61.7 percent are tuned into radio during TV's prime-time hours. 
As a former broadcaster, I certainly understand the extraordinary influence and unselfish nature of radio. Radio broadcasts serve a variety of purposes. Radio communicates with listeners during time of emergency, informs them of noteworthy community events such as fundraising drives, educates them about developing stories and current events, entertains during long drives across our states, and serves as a calming influence during the most trying times in our lives. Finally, radio plays a key role in preserving our vibrant democracy by encouraging their audiences to vote, and running special segments about candidates and their platforms. 
The public affairs activities of Minnesota's radio stations have been underscored by a recent Minnesota Broadcasters Association survey of radio executives in which 50 percent of radio stations responded. First, 95 percent of radio stations have helped charities, charitable causes or needy individuals through fundraising and other types of support. Second, radio stations run a median of 100 public service announcements each week, highlighting issues such as flood and disaster relief efforts, AIDS awareness, safety campaigns, drunk driving, and drug and crime education programs. Finally, 71 percent of radio stations aired a local political affairs program or segment dealing with the 1996 elections. 
Mr. President, there are 242 radio stations in Minnesota. Each of these stations has made unique and vital contributions toward serving their communities and interacting with listeners. I am proud to say that in some instances, these efforts have been recognized by the Minnesota Broadcasters Association through their `Media Best Awards' and by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) annual `Crystal Radio Awards.' 
The `Crystal Radio Awards' have been issued by NAB since 1987 to shine the national spotlight on those radio stations that have demonstrated a year-round commitment to providing responsive, individual service to the cities, counties and towns they serve. I am pleased to note that since 1989, Minnesota radio stations have received this great honor on eleven different occasions. These stations are WJON-AM in St. Cloud, KBHP-FM in Bedmidji (twice), KSJN-FM in St. Paul, WWTC-AM, WCCO-AM, KQRS-FM/AM in Minneapolis (twice), KCUE-AM in Red Wing, KWOA-AM in Worthington, and WLTE-FM in Minneapolis. 
The Minnesota Broadcasters Association recently recognized public service announcements broadcast by KAUS and KDWB, the `Flood of '97' community service program by KDMA/KMGM, and MNN Radio Networks hard news coverage during this past years' floods which disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans. And for those fans who have agonized over a potential departure of our beloved Twins, WMNN provided an important venue for people to voice their opinions through the station's `Twins Stadium Open Forum.' 
Additional past noteworthy accomplishments include efforts by WJON-AM and its two sister stations in St. Cloud to raise money to buy bulletproof vests for the police departments. Its goal was $50,000, but ultimately raised $75,000. And stations 92 KQRS-FM and 93.7 KEGE-FM in Minneapolis have worked with Minnesota Job Services to set up a free interactive telephone hotline to connect employers with qualified applicants. Amazingly, this service registers 10,000 calls each month. Last year, Minnesota radio and television stations raised $1.6 million for flood relief efforts and produced a video titled `Beyond the Flood' donating the profits to flood victims. 
Through disaster relief efforts, holiday safety initiatives, fund-raising drives, school announcements, and weather emergencies, Minnesota radio broadcasters have demonstrated their commitment and dedication to public service. I am proud of the leadership shown by each of these stations, and am pleased to have shared their accomplishments with the Senate.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, recognizing that January 31 marks the 30th anniversary of the invention of Scotch tape, I wanted to take a moment to honor its developer, Richard Drew, and all the employees of 3M who have followed in Mr. Drew's pioneering footsteps. 
Over the years, Minnesota-based 3M has been a leader in many different ventures. I have always appreciated the opportunity to work with 3M's employees on various regulatory, tax, and trade initiatives. Being able to think outside the proverbial `box' has together enabled us to demonstrate to government that given the flexibility, Minnesota companies can succeed as leaders. 
Just as Mr. Drew accomplished with his invention of Scotch tape, the employees of 3M continue to push the envelope, tackling real problems and developing common-sense solutions. And as with Scotch tape, society wonders how we ever got along without them. 
So on January 31, we will be recognizing the achievements of Richard Drew's achievements, but we also honor the spirit of ingenuity he sparked for all of 3M's employees.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the American taxpayers sat down last night to listen to their Chief Executive speak about the state of the union and the future of our country. Bill Clinton knows how to give a good speech, and as we have come to expect, last night's was filled with lots of proposals and promises and reminders of some of the successes of the past year. 
It is true--our nation has seen some good times recently. By returning accountability to Washington, we have brought the Federal deficit under control and reduced unemployment to its lowest levels this decade. We have cut taxes for working families for the first time in 16 years. The markets have soared to all-time highs and the economy is churning out rewards for anyone willing to work. Americans are feeling good about their country and about their futures. 
Unfortunately, their President failed to warn them last night--even once during his 75-minute speech--that many of the achievements he acknowledged are at risk, threatened by a Federal Government failure so massive that it may take the taxpayers years, even decades, to burrow out from underneath it. What could be so potentially devastating? The failure of the U.S. Department of Energy to begin accepting the Nation's spent commercial nuclear fuel. 
And, Mr. President, the taxpayers will inherit the responsibility for that failure just 4 days from now. 
After 16 years of denials, delays, and indifference on the part of the U.S. Department of Energy, combined with the politics of special interest groups, the American taxpayers are about to find themselves saddled with the liability for our Nation's nuclear waste. It is a liability they do not deserve, and one they most certainly cannot afford. 
The clock has been ticking relentlessly for 16 years, and on Saturday night, at midnight, the clock will finally run out on the taxpayers on this issue. After a decade and a half of playing `cat-and-mouse' with the Congress and the courts, it appears as though the DOE may be successful in ducking out of its responsibility. But that can only happen if Congress allows this Administration to get away with it unchallenged. 
Mr. President, I stand before you today to pledge that this Senator will not let that happen. 
For 16 years, the public has been assured that by January 31st, 1998, just 4 days from now, the Federal Government would take responsibility for storage of the Nation's commercial spent nuclear fuel. Since enactment of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, energy ratepayers have been charged a one-mill fee per kilowatt-hour in exchange for this `promise.' Each dollar collected is from a consumer located in one of the 34 States that benefit from nuclear energy. Only those who benefit from the lower-cost nuclear power--not the general public--would supposedly fund the waste storage. 
Dutifully, ratepayers around the country have paid their fees--to the tune of some $13 billion. For Minnesota alone, this translates into more than $271 million. For 16 years, these fees have poured into the Nuclear Waste Fund based upon a legal--and contractual--obligation that the waste would be removed. 
Today, with $7 billion of those ratepayer dollars already spent, the waste is piling up. Nobody at the DOE wants it, nobody at the DOE is prepared to claim it, and because there is no place to put it, nobody at the DOE would be ready to take it by January 31 anyway. Again, that is just 4 days from now. 
At the same time, energy consumers are pouring billions into the waste fund, ratepayers and utilities are continuing to pay for on-site storage at more than 70 commercial nuclear plants throughout the country. 
In other words, ratepayers are being forced to pay twice for nuclear waste storage, all because the Department of Energy has failed to meet its legal obligations to the American people. 
As troubling as this expensive delay has been, that fact alone is not the greatest affront to the American public. What I find most troubling is the financial risk the DOE has dumped at the feet of the taxpayers, because suddenly, every one of them will soon be on the hook for the nuclear waste debacle. 
Since coming to Congress in 1993, I have watched the Energy Department play a protracted game of `would not, could not, should not' with the States, the ratepayers, and the Congress. It is a bob-and-weave strategy the DOE has had 16 years to perfect. 
In 1994, the DOE argued that it would not accept the nuclear waste by 1998 because the law did not require it to do so. At that time, Minnesota was threatened with a premature shutdown of its Prairie Island nuclear facility, again, due to a lack of on-site storage. The DOE's claim exacerbated an already difficult situation for the State legislature and Minnesota residents, as the State faced the very real possibility it would lose up to 30 percent of its energy resources. 
But the Energy Department's flippant response at the time was, `It's your problem, not ours.' 
And so the States went to court. They sued and they won. In July of 1996, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the nuclear waste was the DOE's problem and that the January 31st deadline did apply. When the DOE argued that they would not take the waste, the court told them, `yes, you will.' 
Over the next few months, the DOE was silent on the issue. And so the States wrote to the department asking of its plans to comply with the court decision. The following month, the Department of Energy responded by writing to utilities soliciting their ideas on how they would cope with a failure by the agency to meet the deadline. Having exhausted the `would not' argument, the DOE was now arguing in essence that they `could not' comply with the law. 
In June of 1997, the DOE, in direct defiance of the 1996 court order, again asserted that delay was unavoidable due to `acts of Government in its sovereign capacity,' and once again made it the States' and utilities problem, not theirs. 
So back to court went the States and utilities. 
Last November, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the same court that ruled the year before, again affirmed that the Department of Energy's obligation to accept the nuclear waste. The panel stated explicitly that the federal government could not surrender its responsibility or liability, and alluded to whether the DOE was putting the taxpayers on the hook for its failure to comply. 
Mr. President, the estimates of potential damages and awards have put the dollar figure as high as $80 billion, and some believe it could go significantly higher. That is a public bailout of immense proportions that would rival the savings and loan bailout. 
It was never the intent of Congress to put the taxpayers at risk when it enacted the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Nor is that the desire of the 34 States that have nuclear waste stored on-site; they would rather see the waste removed so the production of low-cost power can continue. Still, the Energy Department persists in opposing the people at every turn. 
Mr. President, on December 29th, 1997, just a few weeks ago, the Department of Energy filed a `Petition for Rehearing' in an effort to nullify the earlier court rulings. This most recent stunt by the DOE reflects their new position that they `should not' be held responsible--technically or financially--primarily because these lawsuits have been heard in the wrong court. 
After the DOE's cries of `would not, could not, should not,' it is now up to Congress to respond in the positive: we will protect the taxpayers; and we can develop a solution for resolving the nuclear waste storage crisis; and we must enact the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 as soon as possible, legislation I have coauthored with my friends and colleagues, Senators Craig and Murkowski. 
Mr. President, our legislation would set in motion the implementation of a timely and environmentally sound waste solution, and was adopted by overwhelming, bipartisan votes last year in the Senate and House. Nevertheless, with conferee appointments pending, a veto threat from the administration may yet derail the bill. So once again, the Department of Energy is blocking the will of the people. 
The taxpayers have the most to lose if the Department of Energy prevails and we accept the status quo. These are hard-working Americans who have to keep a budget and account for their spending, and they expect the Federal Government to exercise that same accountability with their tax dollars as well. With so many Government agencies and programs fighting for limited funds, how can the taxpayers possibly afford a multi-billion-dollar bailout of the Energy Department? How can the Nation's energy consumers afford additional on-site storage, early decommissioning costs, alternative fuel purchases to compensate for lost power? How can they afford refinancing the billions wasted from the Nuclear Waste Fund? How will the economy handle the loss of jobs and productivity that will certainly follow when energy costs begin to soar and generating facilities begin to shut down? 
How is it possible that all of this will be set into motion just 4 days from now, and yet it did not merit a single sentence in the President's State of the Union Address last night? 
The President last night also failed to mention that these costs will be borne as much by grandma and grandpa as they will by any corporate executives or Members of Congress. He did not mention that nuclear power is a fuel that burns nothing, thereby helping us achieve cleaner air and a better environment. He failed to mention that the costs of his global warming treaty will be even higher for every American if we continue to shut down nuclear power plants in favor of coal-burning technologies. And most regrettably, he failed to offer any kind of explanation into why his administration supports the Department of Energy as they unlawfully stick it to the American taxpayers. 
While the DOE waits, and hides behind courtroom appeals, and shirks its responsibilities that it is legally bound to accept, Americans across our country can expect yet more rate increases and yet higher taxes from a government that is either too afraid or too incompetent to act. 
How can we face ourselves come Sunday morning--just 4 days from today--if we simply step back and quietly allow this to happen? We could not, we should not, and we will not. 
So finally, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reassure their constituents that come midnight on Saturday, the people will not be forgotten, that they will return to Washington next week and fulfill their oath to protect the taxpayers and ensure that their Government fulfills its obligation to them, and that we will never allow such a failure to happen again. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. And I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, there are acts of courage and personal sacrifice that are so great that they should never be forgotten. There are acts which decades--even centuries--later still reverberate, and touch our soul as a nation. Surely, the heroic deeds of the `Immortal Four Chaplains' count among such acts. 
These four Chaplains sacrificed their lives to save the lives of others when the Dorchester, a transport ship, was torpedoed by a German U-boat off the coast of Greenland on February 3, 1943. During the 18 minutes that the Dorchester was sinking, the four Army Chaplains--a Jewish rabbi, a Catholic priest, and two Protestant ministers--worked to comfort the frightened men and direct them to safety. They distributed life jackets, and when there were no more in the storage locker, the Chaplains removed their own life jackets and gave them to waiting soldiers. 
Rabbi Alexander Goode did not ask whether the soldier that he was giving his life jacket to was Jewish; Father John Washington did not ask whether he was Catholic; Reverend George Fox did not ask whether he was Methodist; and Reverend Clark Poling did not ask whether he was Dutch Reformed. The Chaplains simply took off their own life jackets and gave them to the next in line. 
The Chaplains were last seen on the hull, with their arms linked together in prayer, consoling the men who remained on the ship with a final service. The way that they died is so poignant because it reflects the way that they lived--full of devotion to God and serving the needs of their fellow men. As one survivor noted, the Chaplains `were always together . . . they carried their Faith together.' 
Of the 902 servicemen, merchant seamen and civilian workers aboard the Dorchester, only 230 survived. Many of them owed their lives to the actions of the four Chaplains. Their heroic actions served as an inspiration to the survivors of the Dorchester; they should be an inspiration to us now. 
The courage of these four Chaplains, and their service to our country did not go unrecognized. Each was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for services beyond the call of duty; memorials to their sacrifice have been placed around the country, including in the Pentagon and the National Cathedral; a postage stamp entitled `Interfaith in Action' was issued in their memory; and in 1957, Congress declared the anniversary of the sinking of the Dorchester to be a day for the commemoration of the deaths and the heroic acts of the four Chaplains. 
Tragically, however, the memory of their selfless acts has faded. Aside from the American Legion, which has annually observed the anniversary of their deaths, few continue to recognize this somber occasion. 
I am proud to say, however, that some very special individuals in Minnesota are working to ensure that the legacy of the Four Chaplains lives on through The Four Chaplains Foundation, including: David Fox of Hopkins; Barbara Koch of Long Lake; Ardis Wexler of Edina; Kevin Applequist of St. Anthony; Phil Brain of Edina; Ambassador Robert Flaten of Northfield; Shiro Katagiri of Minneapolis; Representative Jim Rhodes of St. Louis Park; Helen Fulford of Bloomington; John Swon of Edina; Bettine Clemen of Minnetonka; and Vice President Walter Mondale of Minneapolis. These Minnesotans, joined by equally dedicated people around this nation, and the world, have established the Four Chaplains Humanity Prize to ensure that the spirit of these Chaplains is celebrated through a living memorial. This prize will be awarded to those who have been willing to put their lives in danger to grant assistance to persons of a different creed or color. 
Mr. President, it is fitting that on the 55th anniversary of the sinking of the Dorchester, and the 50th anniversary of the issuance of the commemorative stamp, Congress once again honors the memory of these four Chaplains by designating February 3, 1998 as `Four Chaplains Day.' We have a duty to make sure that a grateful nation never forgets their sacrifice, and continues to celebrate the ideals for which they stood.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as we reconvene today for the second session of the 105th Congress, there is important work ahead of us. I am certain my colleagues join me in acknowledging that regardless of the headlines and the commotion that is going on outside this chamber, the Senate cannot be distracted from its responsibility to carry out the will of the people. America's families, its taxpayers, have great expectations of us, and we must not let them down. So I look forward to what we can accomplish together on their behalf. 
I have to admit, though, that I have mixed feelings about the session ahead of us. I think Will Rogers explained my predicament best when he said, `This country has come to feel the same when Congress is in session as when the baby gets hold of a hammer.' 
When the baby finds the hammer, somebody almost always gets hit over the head. In 1998, the `hammer' is the much-anticipated budget surplus, and I am afraid it may very well be the taxpayers who get whacked by it. 
Earlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the federal deficit would decline sharply this year from its original estimate of $125 billion to $5 billion. It also forecast a $14 billion surplus in 2001 and a total of $665 billion in surpluses by the end of the next decade. 
Now, tax dollars are always considered `free money' by the big spenders here in Washington, and the thought of all that new `free money' is creating a feeding frenzy here on Capitol Hill. The rush to spend is like something right off the Discovery Channel, like the free-for-all that results when a pack of hungry predators gets hold of a piece of raw meat. A ravenous creature in its own right, Washington will attack a pile of tax dollars and spend, spend, spend until it is all gone--until the bones have been stripped of every last morsel of meat. 
Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleagues in both chambers, I am disgusted by this `stampede to spend,' and angry that it is being championed on both sides of the political aisle. I am a Republican, elected by the people of Minnesota to carry out my promise to lower their taxes and rein in a federal government that has grown out of control. Republicans gained control of Congress because we are the champions of the taxpayers--the American people trusted us to carry out our promise when we said, `Elect a Republican majority and we will help you build a better life for yourselves and families by curbing Washington's impulse to spend your precious tax dollars.' 
They certainly did not elect Republicans thinking we would build a bigger, more expensive government the first chance we got. 
Not only are we rushing to join the spending stampede, but we are doing it before the budget is actually balanced, before a surplus actually exists, before even a single surplus dollar makes its way into the federal treasury. 
If this is a race to prove who can be the most `compassionate' with the taxpayers' dollars, it is a race nobody is going to win, and one the taxpayers most certainly will lose. When is Washington going to understand that you cannot buy compassion? And Washington cannot give something to Americans, without taking more from Americans. I hear the big spenders say that Americans are struggling so Washington needs to do more. And `more' always means taking more from Americans so Washington can control, shape, and direct our families and our lives. 
Who is going to stand up in this chamber for the taxpayers if the Republicans will not? If our party is abandoning our commitment to fiscal responsibility--the commitment that built a congressional majority--we are abandoning the taxpayers as well. And do not think the taxpayers have not noticed. One of my constituents, Dale Rook of Beardsley, Minnesota, summed up the feelings of many in a recent letter: `It appears that the Democrats are still in control of both Houses of Congress,' he wrote. `Why? What has happened to the Republican Party?' he wrote. A lot of us are asking that very same question. 
Of course, the Republicans do not have a monopoly here when it comes to spending. I am deeply troubled by what is happening on Capitol Hill among both parties, and every taxpayer ought to be as well. And as a Senator representing the nation's families--America's hard-working, taxpaying families--I pledge that they will not be forgotten. 
Let me speak specifically about the deficit and the anticipated surplus. Both Congress and the President have rushed to claim the credit for the decline in the federal deficit. Mr. President, I think we should give credit where credit is due. In this case, the credit really belongs to the robust American economy and the working Americans who propel it. And Washington should not be allowed to take that away from American families, workers, and business. Washington should not gain more control of our spending. 
The economy, not any government action, has produced this unprecedented revenue windfall. These unexpected dollars have come directly from working Americans--taxes paid by corporations, individuals and investors. If the economy continues to generate 8 percent revenue growth as in recent years, we could soon enjoy unified budget surpluses. 
However, Mr. President, we must remember this is a surplus only under a unified budget. That means Social Security surpluses that the government borrowed to pay its bills are also counted in the projection. Payroll taxes from the current generation of workers provides far more money than is needed to finance benefits for today's retirees; the extra money is used for other government programs. Without borrowing from the Social Security trust funds, the real federal deficit could be $116 billion, rather than a $14 billion surplus in 2001. In fact, the total deficit will be nearly a trillion in the next ten years. This means we will see deficits, not surpluses, as far as the eye can see. 
In any event, if the budget surpluses, indeed, occur, with or without Social Security borrowing, the question of how to apply these surpluses remains critical. In my view, the right way to use any potential budget surplus is to return those funds to working Americans and their children in the form of meaningful tax relief, national debt reduction, and channeling them toward solutions to our long-term financial imbalances, thus ensuring our economy continues to grow. Since the unexpected revenue has come directly from working Americans, it is only fair to return it to them. Despite the first, tentative steps we took last year toward real tax reform for families, the tax burden on the American people is still historically high. It is sound policy to use part of the surpluses to lower the tax burden and allow families to keep a little more of their hard-earned money. 
Over the past 30 years, we have amassed a $5.5 trillion national debt thanks to Washington's culture of spending. A newborn child today will bear about $20,000 of that debt the moment he or she comes into the world. Each year, we sink more $250 billion into the black hole of interest payments, which could be better spent fighting crime, maintaining roads and bridges, and equipping the military. It is sound policy to use part of any surpluses to begin paying down the national debt and reducing the financial burden on the next generations. 
The budget surpluses also give us a great opportunity to address our other long-term financial imbalances. Federal unfunded liabilities could eventually top $14 trillion, bankrupting our government if no real reform occurs. It is vitally important that we use the budget surpluses to finance these reforms, not to try to buy popularity--spending in the name of compassion and need, while putting our entire futures at financial risk. 
If we fail to fix these long-term fiscal time bombs, the federal deficit could come back and haunt us in a catastrophic way, shattering the health of our future economy and placing an unbearable burden on our children and grandchildren. According to the CBO, the federal deficit would increase to $11 trillion and the national debt would balloon to $91 billion in 2035 without substantial entitlement reform. 
Some of my colleagues have suggested that we put the surpluses into the Social Security trust funds. I generally agree that we should build real assets for the trust funds by returning borrowed Social Security surplus into it. But our Social Security system is in serious financial trouble--a fiscal disaster-in-the-making that is not sustainable in its present form as the Senator from New Hampshire outlined a few minutes ago. Simply funneling money back into a broken system will not help fix the problem. It will not build the real assets of the funds for current and future beneficiaries and it does not address the flaws of the current pay-as-you-go finance mechanism. Without fundamental reform, the system will consume all the surpluses and go broke. Using the budget surpluses to build real assets by changing the system from pay-go to pre-funded is the right way to go. 
The wrong way is to spend all those dollars on new government programs, which is exactly what President Clinton has proposed to do, even before a surplus is realized. The President has recklessly planned to expand Medicare, rather than reforming it to preserve it from soon going broke. He is also seeking a $22 billion increase in child-care expenditures and subsidies. This is after Washington increased child care expenditures by 500% in the last two years, going from $4 billion to $20 billion a year just one year ago. Although I think it is good to bring tax credits back to the table, it is wrong for Washington to control daycare for American families. The President also wants to throw more money into federal education programs for local schools without addressing the real problems of the system. And advocating Washington take more control of education rather than State and local governments and local school boards. 
Despite the President's rhetoric that the era of big government is over, President Clinton, with the help of congressional spenders, has made it even bigger. Actual annual government spending has increased from $1.3 trillion to $1.6 trillion since Mr. Clinton took the White House, adding over $1.2 trillion to the national debt. 
Even under the `97 budget agreement, spending will increase to nearly $1.9 trillion in 2002, a growth of 18 percent over 1992 levels. Is there any sign of leaner government anywhere? No. Like the overweight diner who lunches on lettuce and peaches with the family then sneaks a pint of ice cream once the kitchen lights have been turned off, the enablers of big government profess their new-found fiscal restraint but hungrily pounce on your tax dollars at the first opportunity. 
We must never, never, never repeat the mistake we made in 1997. If you will remember, as soon as the CBO discovered a $225 billion revenue windfall that `might' be received by the federal government in the next six years, Congress and the President spent all of it, to expand existing programs and create new programs. Not a penny is left. Few wasteful and unnecessary programs were eliminated. The savings we achieved through welfare reform are almost completely wiped out. 
If the budget surpluses are not returned to the American people in the form of debt reduction or tax relief, I am absolutely certain Congress and President Clinton will spend them all for new and expanded government programs. When it is paid for by the taxpayers, Washington has never been able to resist raiding the freezer for that late-night pint of ice cream. 
Listen to what the people are saying. A Time/CNN poll conducted in mid January reveals that most Americans--78 percent of them--believe that spending the budget surplus to reduce the national debt should be a top priority. Sixty-eight percent also favored using the surplus to cut federal income taxes. 
I`m hearing that same message in the calls, faxes, letters, and e-mails I have received this month. Here are the words of Mark Keppel of Minneapolis:  
I want you to know how strongly your constituency feel that you do not allow those feeding at the taxpayer trough to waste this opportunity to reduce our huge current debt burden. 
These tax collections are over-collections of our money, and we wish to either reduce our outstanding debt or have this surplus returned to us, not reallocated to new, unfunded projects. Can that be any clearer? 
Brian Tice, a 27-year-old constituent of mine from Anoka, was equally clear. `If our country is bankrupted,' he wrote, `my lifetime of savings and my retirement will go down with it. I encourage you to stand firm against those . . . who will pressure you into spending the surplus on social and special interest programs.' 
After hundreds of billions of new spending and over a trillion in new debts, President Clinton announced on January 5th that he will submit a balanced budget to Congress for the 1999 fiscal year. I am encouraged by his announcement. I welcome the President's intention to balance the budget. But why wait another year? 
The robust economy has offered us a historic opportunity to finally put our fiscal house in order. We should, and can, balance the budget this year by trimming just a few wasteful government-spending programs. 
Compared to nearly $1.7 trillion in annual government spending, a $5 billion spending cut is peanuts. And if we can achieve it, it will balance the federal budget for the first time since 1969, and think of the positive impact it would have on our economy. That is why my colleagues, Senators Brownback, Inhofe, Ashcroft, Allard, Hutchinson and myself sent a letter to the congressional leadership early this month, urging Congress and the President to work together to achieve a balanced budget this year, rather than the next year, by rescinding $5 billion from the 1998 budget. 
More importantly, the sooner we balance our budget the less pain we will suffer in the future. As I said earlier, the long-term fiscal time bombs we are facing require that we take action quickly. Escalating Social Security and Medicare costs pose the primary threat to the federal government's long-term solvency. We have only ten-year's time to fix Social Security. If it is mishandled, millions of Americans could suffer. Medicare is already in a horrific situation. It has accumulated over a trillion-dollar deficit and will soon be broke. Immediate action has to be taken to preserve and improve it. 
There are trillions of other federal unfunded liabilities that we cannot ignore. These include entitlement programs other than Social Security and Medicare: federal civilian and military pensions, railroad retirement benefits, federal insurance programs, bank deposit insurance, private pension insurance, and a huge portfolio of guaranteed loans, environmental cleanup, and deferred maintenance and life-cycle costs for equipment and infrastructure--all of which have some risk of going sour and costing the government substantial sums down the road. 
If we balance the budget this year, it will give us a little more time and a little more flexibility to focus on and fix these long-term financial liabilities. 
Mr. President, I began this statement by quoting Will Rogers. As I conclude, let me quote him once again:  
There is not a man in the country that cannot make a living for himself and family. But he cannot make a living for them and his government, too, the way his government is living. What the government has got to do is live as cheap as the people. 
Our immediate task should be to regain the confidence of the American people by achieving a balanced budget and keeping it balanced by shrinking the size of the government. That is, by asking government to live as cheap as the people. By doing so, we will reduce interest rates, increase national savings, create more jobs, provide more meaningful tax cuts, and generate more revenues. More importantly, we will shrink the financial burden for our children and grandchildren. 
As the Senate meets today to open the second session of the 105th Congress, I urge my colleagues to recall the promises they have made to the American taxpayers. Embrace those promises, and put the needs and desires of the people ahead of the impulse to leave a legacy of compassion--a legacy that could bury the taxpayers if left unchecked. Let us work with the President to achieve a balanced budget this year and begin a new era of government accountability. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I rise to talk a little bit today about how I am extremely disappointed that the House passed the foreign operations conference report without the provisions of the State Department authorization bill attached to it. 
While the foreign operations bill does many positive things, its failure to include language to reorganize our foreign relations bureaucracy and establish benchmarks for the payment of U.N. arrears seriously flaws this bill. 
The proposals to reorganize our foreign policy apparatus and to attach the payment of U.S. arrears to U.N. reforms had been carefully worked out over many months. 
Unfortunately, my colleagues in the House of Representatives are holding these provisions hostage to the Mexico City policy. While I am a strong supporter of the Mexico City policy, I believe that debate on this issue should not hold up the important United States and U.N. foreign policy reforms. 
Now, if the State Department authorization bill dies in the House, the House has lost the Mexico City policy debate, and the only victory they can claim is that they have given the United Nations new money for the United States assessments, but with no reform strings attached, and they block a reorganization of our foreign policy apparatus that we have pursued for more than four years. 
That isn't a record they should regard with pride. 
As chairman of the International Organization Subcommittee, I worked hard to help forge a solid, bipartisan United Nations reform package. The Senate's message in crafting this legislation is simple and straightforward: 
The United States can help make the United Nations a more effective, more efficient, and financially sounder organization, but only if the United Nations and other member states, in return, are willing to finally become accountable to the American taxpayers. 
The reforms proposed by the United States are critical to ensure the United Nations is effective and relevant. We must reform the United Nations now and the United States has the responsibility to play a major role in this effort. 
If we do nothing, and the United Nations collapses under its own weight, then we will have only ourselves to blame. So I urge my colleagues to act now, or this window of opportunity may be lost for achieving true reform at the United Nations. 
But passing this U.N. package is not just about a series of reforms for the future. It impacts directly on the credibility of the U.S. mission at the United Nations right now. 
Ambassador Richardson has been pushing other member states to accept the reforms in this package in return for the payment of arrears. Now that package will not arrive. 
At this critical juncture, when the United Nations is facing down Saddam Hussein, and the United States is trying to keep the gulf war coalition unified, it is reckless for the House of Representatives to do anything that would undercut the negotiating position of Ambassador Richardson and Secretary of State Albright at the United Nations. And believe me, the failure to pass this legislation will have a negative impact on the conduct of our foreign policy. 
Madam President, the United States does not owe most of these arrears to the United Nations. It owes them to our allies, like France, for reimbursement for peacekeeping expenses. 
Under normal circumstances, I am the last one who could be expected to make a pitch for funding for France. But considering that France is one of the members on the Security Council that is going soft on Iraq--soft on Saddam Hussein--depriving the United States Government the ability to use these funds as leverage is irresponsible. After all, our diplomats need carrots as well as sticks to achieve our foreign policy goals. 
Madam President, I am hopeful that my colleagues in the House will see the wisdom of adopting measures that will enhance America's ability to exert leadership in the international arena through the consolidation of our foreign relations apparatus and the revitalization of the United Nations. 
The State Department authorization bill should be allowed to pass or fail on its own merit--not on the merits of the Mexico City policy. This agreement is in America's best interest, and the best interest of the entire international community. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
I see no other Senators wishing to speak, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I just had a couple of statements I wanted to put into the Record for today, dealing with the action here on Labor, Health and Human Services, and also on another unrelated item dealing with the dairy decision in Minnesota earlier this week. 
Later today, as noted, the Senate will complete action on the Labor Health and Human Services appropriations bill which was passed by the House last night. I wanted to express my appreciation to Senator Specter, chairman of the Labor, HHS Appropriations Subcommittee for including a 1-year correction of Minnesota's disproportionate share allotment, otherwise known as DSH. I also want to thank the conferees for accepting this correction as well. Without this correction, Minnesota's hospitals stood to lose millions of dollars in DSH payments, due to an error on the form that the State filed with the Health Care Financing Administration. While that error was corrected when the State filed an amended form with HCFA, the Balanced Budget Act did not allow HCFA to consider amended forms in determining each State's DSH allotment. 
Again, I would like to express my thanks to our chairman, Mr. Specter, and also Chairman Stevens for their assistance and guidance in finding a temporary fix to this problem. 
Mr. President, the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations bill will buy some time for Minnesota hospitals and allow Congress the opportunity to permanently correct this unfortunate error. 
Although Minnesota hospitals have received a 1-year reprieve, it is important that we permanently correct the DSH allotment error. It is my understanding that Minnesota was not the only State with DSH allotment concerns, and those States will also need a permanent solution. 
I look forward to next year when these problems might be addressed in the form of a technical corrections measure.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on an unrelated matter, I also want to take a moment this afternoon to rise in support of the U.S. district court decision that prohibits the U.S. Department of Agriculture from enforcing class I differentials when it comes to dairy and the Nation's milk marketing order system. 
The ruling states that the class I price structure provided under USDA's Federal milk marketing order is unlawful. This ruling was made after providing the Department three opportunities to justify this antiquated regulation which has, again, been found to be arbitrary and capricious. 
I strongly urge the Secretary to forgo any further litigation on this matter. 
Judge Doty's decision has confirmed what we have known all along, and that is that the current class I price structure is unfair and that it makes no economic sense. 
The 1996 farm bill requires the Secretary to provide price structure and Federal milk market order reform. This process is currently moving forward, and there should be no legislative maneuvers to restore the rejected state of affairs. I will be guarding against legislative initiatives put forth by regional interests which would attempt to restore the inequities of the former system. 
USDA and Members of Congress must move forward and cease to be hamstrung by arcane economic models. Traditional economic models are not sufficient in constructing a dairy policy for the next century. The imposition of the 1937 dairy legislation on 1997 dairy economics is ludicrous. 
Today, we have heard from our colleagues from Vermont that without the current system, the rest of the country would be at the mercy of the Midwest for a fresh supply of milk. We are not asking for a monopoly, only that the heel of Government be removed from our dairy farmer's throats so that they be allowed to compete fairly. 
There is no room for regional politics in Federal dairy policy. We should not encourage inefficiency. 
The United States district court has rendered its decision, and now it is in Secretary Glickman's hands to institute long-term and significant dairy reform which will restore equity to U.S. dairy policy. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, Minnesota and Michigan are two States that share a common border with Canada, and so I am very proud today to join my colleague, Senator Abraham, chairman of the Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, as a cosponsor of his bill to ensure Canada will receive current treatment once the immigration law is implemented in 1998. There has been a great deal of concern, especially in Minnesota, as well, as to how the immigration law we passed last year will affect the northern U.S. border. Right now the fear is the law is being misinterpreted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
Minnesota alone has about 817 miles of shared border with Canada and we share many interests with our northern neighbor--tourism, trade, and family visits among the most prevalent. In the last few years, passage back and forth over the Minnesota/Canadian border has been more open and free flowing, especially since the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect. There were 116 million travelers entering the United States from Canada in 1996 over the land border. As our relationship with Canada is increasingly interwoven, we have sought a less restrictive access to each country. 
The immigration bill last year was intended to focus on illegal aliens entering this country from Mexico and living in the United States illegally. The new law states that `every alien' entering and leaving the United States would have to register at all the borders--land, sea, and air. The Immigration and Naturalization Service was tasked with the effort to set up automated pilot sites along the border to discover the most effective way to implement this law, which was to become effective on September 30, 1998. 
The INS was quietly going about establishing a pilot site on the New York State border when the reality sunk in. A flood of calls from constituents came into the offices of all of us serving in Canadian border states. Canadian citizens also registered opposition to this new restriction. It became quite clear that no one had considered how the new law affected Canada. Current law already waives the document requirement for most Canadian nationals, but still requires certain citizens to register at border crossings. That system has worked. There have been very few problems at the northern border with drug trafficking and illegal aliens. 
In an effort to resolve this situation, I have joined Senators Abraham, D'Amato, Collins, Snowe, Burns, Jeffords, Kennedy, Leahy, Moynihan, and Graham of Florida in a letter asking INS Commissioner Meissner for her interpretation of this law and how she expects to implement it. We have not had a response to date, but the INS' previous reaction to this issue indicates that every alien would include both Canadian nationals and American permanent residents--everyone crossing the border. 
Therefore, we must make it very clear that Congress did not intend to impose additional documentary requirements on Canadian nationals; Senator Abraham's bill will restore our intent. Our legislation, the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997, will not open the floodgates for illegal aliens to pass through--it will still require those who currently need documentation to continue to produce it and remain registered in a new INS system. This will allow the INS to keep track of that category of non-immigrant entering our country to ensure they leave when their visas expire. Senator Abraham's bill will not unfairly treat our friends on the Canadian side that have been deemed not to need documentation--they will still be able to pass freely back and forth across the border. 
But our bill will enable us to avoid the huge traffic jams and confusion which would no doubt occur if every alien was to be registered in and out of the United States. Such registration would discourage trade and visits to the United States. It would delay shipments of important industrial equipment, auto parts services and other shared ventures that have long thrived along the northern border. It will discourage the economic revival that northern Minnesotans are experiencing, helped by Canadian shoppers and tourists. 
Mr. President, I do not believe Congress intended to create this new mandate. We sought to keep illegal aliens and illegal drugs out, not our trading partners and visiting consumers. Through the Abraham bill, we will still do that while keeping the door open to our neighbors from the north. The bill is good foreign policy, good public policy and good economic policy. We all will benefit while retaining our ability to keep track of nonimmigrants who enter our borders. 
Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank Senator Abraham for his leadership on this very important matter. I am aware that Senator Abraham had a successful hearing on this issue recently in Michigan. Many Minnesotans, through letters, calls and personal appeals, have also showed their opposition to a potential crisis. I look forward to testifying before the Immigration Subcommittee hearing tomorrow and assisting my colleague from Michigan in his efforts to pass this bill before the 1998 implementation date. Again, this is an unacceptable burden on our Canadian neighbors and those who depend upon their free access that effects the economics of all border states.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, late last month in downtown Washington, the International Republican Institute honored Ronald Reagan as the recipient of their 1997 Freedom Award. Seldom, if ever, has a Washington dinner been held to honor an American when the honor was more richly deserved or more sincerely conferred. There was a deep and abiding outpouring of respect, admiration and affection for our Nation's 40th President. Even a touch of nostalgia was present as guests and speakers recalled when our Nation was led by a President guided by a clear vision and deeply-held convictions. 
The formal program included remarks by James Billington, the Librarian of Congress, and our colleague, the chairman of I.R.I., Senator McCain of Arizona. Mrs. Reagan was there to represent her husband and she made a brief statement in his behalf when the award was presented. These statements focused on Ronald Reagan's indispensable leadership that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and to freedom for hundreds of millions throughout the globe. 
Mr. President, the statements of these distinguished Americans deserve the attention of the Senate and the American people. Moreover, they should be part of the public record so that future generations will have convenient access to them as they examine the life and influence of this great American whose vision and leadership changed the world.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, to outline today's activities, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2:45 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each. 
At 2:45, the Senate will proceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Charles Rossotti to be Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service. Under a previous order, there will be 3 hours of debate on that nomination, with a vote occurring at the expiration of that time. Therefore, Members can anticipate the first rollcall vote at approximately 5:45 p.m. 
The Senate may also consider and complete action on any or all of the following items: D.C. appropriations bill, FDA reform conference report, the intelligence authorization conference report, and any additional legislative or executive items that can be cleared for action. Therefore, there may be additional votes following the 5:45 p.m. vote. 
As a reminder to all Members, on Friday, cloture was filed on both H.R. 2646, the A-plus education savings account bill, and the motion to proceed to S. 1269, the fast-track legislation. Those cloture votes will occur on Tuesday morning at a time to be announced later today. Therefore, all first-degree amendments to H.R. 2646 must be filed by 1 p.m. today. Needless to say, all Senators should expect rollcall votes during every day of the session this week as we attempt to complete action on the very important issues before the Senate. 
Mr. President, I see no other Senators on the floor, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, before we vote on IRS Commissioner nominee Charles O. Rossotti, I'd like to take this opportunity to make a few remarks about the direction IRS reform should take. 
But first let me commend Mr. Rossotti for his courage to take on this job. I believe with his expertise and experience in private business management, Mr. Rossotti is qualified to head the agency, and I am confident that he will help improve IRS services and management. 
Madam President, the American people have every right to be outraged by the disturbing details that emerged during 3 days of Senate hearings into the tax collection practices of the IRS. 
Testimony from taxpayers and current and former IRS officials provided chilling accounts of mistreatment, abuse of power, and the merciless trampling of citizens' rights. What's even more shocking is that these improper and illegal practices within the IRS aren't random occurrences--they happen regularly. 
For decades, IRS agents have routinely snooped through the supposedly confidential tax files of thousands and thousands of Americans. That could include me, or you. IRS agents are evaluated and promoted based on their total tax collections, a practice outlawed a decade ago. 
IRS managers often cover up abusive behavior by collection agents. In stark contrast to our legal system, all alleged tax debtors are assumed guilty and treated as criminals. 
The distressing tales told by the Senate witnesses were hardly isolated incidents; hundreds of working, law-abiding Minnesotans have contacted my office with similar grievances. 
Though the individual details of their stories vary, the message is the same: the IRS devastated their lives. Many lost their homes, cars, businesses, and professional licenses--not to mention their reputation and self-respect. 
Congress established the IRS with good intentions but the agency has evolved into what Nobel laureate Dr. Milton Friedman labels `a self-generating monstrosity over which the people have little control.' 
As a result, our tax system has become extremely complicated, difficult even for IRS experts to understand, and our tax burden has become so heavy and so unfair that it's unbearable for many working Americans. 
The tax system under which the IRS operates today has become a redistributor of private incomes, a mechanism to enforce social re-engineering, and a launch pad for class-warfare. 
It is anti-family. It destroys economic opportunity, hinders our job creation, impedes productivity and retards competitiveness. It has deepened the despair and disaffection among the poor and disadvantaged. It encourages abuse, waste, and corruption. 
Congress deserves much--if not most--of the blame for the abuses of our current tax system because it is Congress that writes the Tax Code in the first place. 
There are now nearly 10,000 pages of Tax Code, 20 volumes of tax regulations, and thousands and thousands of pages of instructions. 
Besides making the tax system so complicated, Congress has seriously neglected its oversight responsibilities over the IRS. In fact, the Senate hearings were the first formal oversight of the agency ever conducted by Congress. That in itself is very shocking. 
Congress for decades has been passing new tax laws and regulations without looking back to see how the system has been affected, or if it's working, or if it's unfair. 
It's more obvious than ever that the present tax system will fail to lead us into the next century without fundamental reforms. But can Washington fix the IRS problems it created? Yes--if Washington can muster the political will to do it. 
The first thing Congress must do is take its oversight responsibility of the agency more seriously. Let's end the secretive ways of the IRS and open the process to the sunlight. 
Let's put the IRS under strict scrutiny, periodically reviewing its operations, exposing abuses, and ending illegal practices. 
I welcome the fact that President Clinton changed his mind and presented a plan aimed at improving taxpayer-assistance services at the IRS, including a board with private citizens to oversee the agency. 
Although this is a positive step, the proposed changes are mostly cosmetic and will do nothing to address the deep-rooted deficiencies within the IRS. Very simply, the heart of the problem with the IRS is the tax policy on which all IRS decisions are based. 
To end the abuse once and for all, Congress must pass new legislation to reform our tax system and replace the ever-more-complicated Tax Code with one that's simpler, fairer, and more friendly to taxpayers. 
The American people deserve a fair Tax Code that promotes harmony between people and doesn't separate us into classes, a code that encourages work and savings; a code that rewards families and success rather than penalizes them; a code that stimulates real economic growth and produces more jobs and, yes, higher tax revenues; a code that allows taxpayers to keep more of their own money. 
Congress must explore every available solution in our quest to re-create our tax system and achieve these objectives. 
Passing the House IRS bill may sound tempting, as it does make some needed changes, but I agree with Senator Roth that we need to do the job right the first time around, not accept minor changes that may prevent or delay efforts to reform our overall tax system. 
Madam President, the leadoff witness at the Senate IRS hearings summed up the debate with a message Congress cannot ignore: `If the public ever knew the number of abuses covered up by the IRS, there could be a tax revolt.' 
The public is beginning to understand the depth of the IRS problems. Tinkering with the IRS won't work and the time for real tax reforms is now. 
Thank you very much. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference report to the DOD authorization bill. One of the issues which held up the resolution of the conference was the high performance computer issue. This matter certainly was not resolved to my satisfaction, and I understand that this is one of three issues that may cause the veto of this legislation. 
On July 10 the Grams-Boxer amendment passed in the Senate by a vote of 72-27. It created a GAO study on the national security concerns related to computer sales between 2,000-7,000 MTOPS to tier 3 countries. Those countries include China, Russia, and Israel. The amendment was a second degree amendment to an amendment which sought to license exports of these mid-level computers, after they had been decontrolled 2 years ago. Rather than creating an unwise barrier to US-made exports, 72 of my colleagues believed we needed more study of this issue before passing this new regulation on the Senate floor circumventing the usual committee debate and consideration. 
Mr. President, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Finance, of the Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over export control matters, I strongly opposed this attempt to circumvent the normal committee process. Chairman D'Amato joined me in vigorously opposing the underlying amendment, paving the way for a strong Senate vote on the issue. 
After the vote, Chairman D'Amato and the Subcommittee Ranking Member Carol Moseley-Braun joined me in sending a letter to the Conferees requesting we be consulted prior to any attempts to modify the Senate provision in conference. I regret that at no time in the months-long process did any consultation occur, even though the issue was clearly one of Banking Committee jurisdiction. 
I was informed by the conferees that they had accommodated my request for a GAO study. What I determined from other sources was that language accompanying my study essentially accomplished the same thing as the underlying amendment my second-degree amendment defeated. And I was supposed to be satisfied because my study remained in the bill. 
I applaud my colleagues who worked hard in the conference committee to complete the report. There were many difficult issues effectively handled. In total, the bill is a good one. However, because this bill may be vetoed, I would like to make a strong case for further resolution of this issue once it is returned to conference. 
My specific concerns with the provisions of the conference report are the following: 
First, rather than a mandate to obtain export licenses for computers between 2,000 and 7,000 MTOPS to tier 3 countries, the conference report would require a 10 day notice to Commerce of a proposed sale. If no government entity opposes, the shipment can be made. This not only creates a bureaucratic nightmare taking scarce resources away from review of truly sensitive export license applications, but the reality would be that there would be an objection to each one of them--if for no other reason that the Government needs more time to look at them. So the 10-day notice requirement essentially implements the intent of the original amendment the Senate defeated. This is not acceptable. The reason we decontrolled in the first place, requiring licenses between 2,000 and 7,000 MTOPS only to questionable end users in tier 3 countries, was to free up needed resources to analyze exports of higher performance computers, including those computers between 20,000 and well over 1 million MTOPS--which are the real supercomputers. Opponents of my amendment insisted on defining computers between 2,000 and 7,000 MTOPS as being supercomputers, but supercomputer technology has long ago passed this level of computers. They are now the kind of computer systems we have in our offices. They are not supercomputers used to design nuclear weapons. 
There is a 180-day layover for future decontrol of computer level changes and a 120-day layover for any changes in which countries remain on the tier 3 list. I believe the President should have flexibility to continue to exercise current authority to make these changes. These layovers will give opponents plenty of time to prevent these changes--and will ensure that no changes will be made in the future even though rapid technology advancements challenge us to maintain a system for decontrols in the future. 
Mr. President, there is also a requirement for end-user verification that could be unenforceable and also create a strain on limited resources. This language should be worked out with the Administration. Certainly post shipment checks should not be required over 2,000 MTOPS regardless of whether decontrol is made in the future. Even by next year that level of computer will be found in the local computer store, so it is unlikely that all of these verifications could be made. Also, there should be some discretion regarding whether verification in every case is even necessary if the exporter maintains service on the computer. 
Mr. President, I am just as concerned about selling sensitive high-technology equipment to military end users, but I don't think this is the right way to stop the few diversions that brought about the original amendment. There is adequate enforcement authority now to address diversions. Those that have occurred are being addressed. 
Mr. President, my floor amendment also asks Commerce to work more closely with companies to identify questionable end users than they are doing now. The GAO study will help us study national security interests involving sales of computers at this mid-level. There simply is no need for the provisions added in conference that will compromise our efforts to remain competitive with other nations which do not have these type of requirements. Anyone who will tell you that an export license takes only a short time is wrong. It takes months. And sales have been lost because of our lengthy, burdensome licensing process.

Mr. Grams. Mr. President, I understand that there is a lot of concern in this body about United States computer sales being diverted for military use to either China or Russia. None of us wants that to occur. But we have to consider whether the Cochran amendment solves the problem. I believe that it does not. 
The Cochran amendment would require export licenses for all midlevel computers. Now, these are not supercomputers, these are not high-end computers. You are going to hear that term, but they are not supercomputers. These are midlevel computers, and they are shipped to China, Russia, Israel, and 47 other countries. We talk about the Third Tier countries. They involve 51 nations, like Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Romania, and the Baltic States. Some of our future NATO Allies could also be involved. Mr. President, export licenses do not solve end-user problems. These are diversions that would not have been caught during the export license procedure. Export licenses do require end-user certification, but if the end user chooses to ignore the agreement, or if the computer is stolen, that possibility will not be evident in the licensing process. In my judgment, the current system works. 
Just yesterday, Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen sent us a letter opposing the Cochran amendment. He said the current law and system can deal with unauthorized exports and diversions. This is from the department that has been very conservative on all export decontrol matters. Secretary Cohen further states that we should focus our controls on technology that can make a national security difference, not that which is widely available around the world and is obsolete. 
Yes, Mr. President, there have been three diversions, but that was out of 1,400 sales. But, no, this is not the right way to address those problems. The right way is to force the administration to publish as many military end users as possible and then to work with the industry to identify all military end users. We have been able to identify diversions through our capable intelligence sources. Mr. President, there is no evidence that there are dozens of computers out there used by military end users. It is just not there. 
Further, I don't believe that the industry irresponsibly ignores available information about military end users. They have too much at stake. A company which violates export control laws takes a very big risk. The penalties are prohibition of all exports for 20 years or more, 10 years in prison, and up to a $5,000 fine for each violation. This doesn't include the blemish that would remain on the company's reputation or the great difficulty that company would have in the future seeking an export license. No company, Mr. President, can afford that risk. 
What we would be doing here this morning is handing this midlevel computer business over to the Japanese and other allies. Now, again, I want to emphasize that these are midlevel computers, they are not supercomputers. Next year, they will be the kind of systems that we will be able to have in our offices here in the Senate, or what you could find in a small company or in a doctor's office. These are not the computers that are sought after for nuclear weapons production or design. Again, we are looking at midlevel computers, between 2,000 and 7,000 MTOPS, which are widely available around the world. 
Supercomputers, which are sought after for weapons design, start at the 20,000 MTOPS level and go all the way up to 650,000 this year, and they will go beyond the 1 million MTOPS level next year. By the way, China already produces a computer at 13,000 MTOPS. No other country considers these computers to be anything but generally available and will step in to take over the business that the Cochran amendment will hand to them. The question is, is that what we want? 
Also, anyone can purchase upgrades, by the way, to raise a PC, a current PC, above the 2,000 MTOPS level. We can't control the box. We can't control the chips around the world that can be put in it. We can't control the upgrades. There is no way to control these low-level PC's under the 2,000 MTOPS threshold, again, since they are available in nearly every country in the world. 
Further, the chips that make up these computers are also available and produced around the world. They were decontrolled during the Bush administration. Our chip producers have markets throughout the world, and they need to maintain them to remain competitive. Chip producers cannot control who receives their end product. 
Also, how do you prohibit a foreign national from using a computer even above the 7,000 level here in the United States and taking the results back, or faxing it back? 
Our friend Jack Kemp has written to us also this week stating that the Cochran amendment would `establish a policy that is destined to fail and would hurt American computer manufacturers without protecting our national security. The American high-technology sector is critical to the future of this country and must be protected from overly intrusive Government restrictions.' 
I wish there was something we could do to effectively control some of these exports, but it is just not possible at these lower levels. We cannot convince our allies to reverse 2 years of their own decontrol. In fact, Europe has tabled a decontrol proposal at 10,000 MTOPS, which proves that they have no intention of even respecting our 7,000 level. We cannot pull all the PC's and upgrades off the retail shelves, and we cannot close our borders to prevent all foreign nationals from entering this country and using our computers. 
We must concentrate our resources on keeping computers above the 7,000 level from reaching military end users; that's for sure. But I fear that an increased license burden in the administration would steer resources away from efforts to locate diversions and investigate them. 
Now, Mr. President, in an earlier statement, I also countered a claim that an export license requirement would not slow down these computer sales. I have heard that someone made the comment that an export license would take 10 days. Well, anyone who knows how the licensing process works knows that it can take many, many months to obtain one. This will only earn our industry a reputation as an unreliable supplier, and it will cost us sales and it will cost us many, many U.S. jobs. The administration admits that a computer license application averages 107 days to reach a decision. I have seen it take far longer. Even 107 days, by the way, is enough to convince the end user to go out and seek a buyer in another country. 
Since so many of the Tier 3 countries are emerging markets, we need to be in there early to maintain a foothold for future sales. When we hear about the 6.3 percent of sales to Tier 3 countries, that is misleading. It is in an area where the market is expanding rapidly. If we leave our companies out of those markets, they will not be there to compete in the future. They will not be there to provide sales and jobs for the United States. 
Another argument I have heard is that there is no foreign availability over 3,500 MTOPS. Well, last year, NEC of Japan tried to sell a supercomputer to the United States Government at a level between 30,000 and 50,000 MTOPS. They match our speeds all the way to the top. 
Mr. President, I believe that all of us are proud of our computer industry, that our industry remains the state of the art in so many areas, particularly in the levels above 7,000. We have made progress to facilitate exports without compromising our national security, progress which began back in the Reagan and Bush administrations, but here is an effort today to reverse all of that progress. 
Our industry has to survive on exports, and it has to pursue commercial business with these 50 countries to remain competitive. All computer sales over the 7,000 MTOPS level do require license now. We have not sold any computers above that level. And, again, the 7,000 MTOPS are not supercomputers--they are not--they are midlevel computers. We have not sold any computers above that level to Tier 3 countries; nor do our allies, to my knowledge. However, we should not restrict the sales of these midlevel and, again, generally available computers to commercial end users. We should simply maintain the current licensing requirement for the questionable end users. I firmly believe that there will be improved cooperation between the Government and industry on end-user information, particularly those for Russia and China. 
Now, I also commend the Commerce Department for starting to publish information on end users and to examine all sales that are made to the Tier 3 countries within these computer speeds. 
The Grams-Boxer amendment requests the GAO to determine whether these sales affect our national security. That is very important. It will look into the issue of foreign availability. It will also require the publication of a military end-user list, and it requires Commerce to improve its assistance to the industry on identifying those military end users. 
There will be some that vote today solely to express their dissatisfaction with China's alleged military sales to our adversaries. Let me remind you once again that there is no evidence that U.S. computers were involved in any of those cases. I also urge you to look at the merits of this issue. Pure and simple, the Cochran amendment would hand the sales of midlevel computers over to the Japanese and the Europeans at the expense of an industry that we have sought to protect and to promote and an industry that we are proud of. 
As chairman of the International Finance Subcommittee of Banking, the committee that has jurisdiction over this issue, I strongly, this morning, urge my colleagues to vote for my substitute and let us continue this debate in the normal manner, through committee consideration. At the same time, the administration should step up its efforts to express to the Chinese and the Russians our grave concerns regarding efforts to divert commercial sales to military end users without knowledge of the United States seller. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of my colleague from Mississippi to address these diversions. I want to work with him in my role as chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction to ensure that the current system does work or on how we can improve it once we have better information regarding the extent of the problem. 
I urge the support of my colleagues for the Grams-Boxer substitute as a compromise to this very, very controversial issue. Thank you very much.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the fiscal year 1998 Agriculture appropriations conference agreement that was passed last night. There is much to be proud of in the conference agreement and I feel it is another step forward in implementing the 1996 farm bill. 
I am particularly pleased with the inclusion of the Grams-Feingold amendment directing the Office of Management and Budget to conduct a study of the economic impacts of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. 
I will not reiterate my long-standing opposition to implementation of the compact or the history surrounding its inclusion in the 1996 farm bill. But along with my colleagues in the House and Senate who have an interest in equitable and lasting dairy reform, I remain committed to bringing fairness to Minnesota's dairy farmers. 
There has been some disagreement as to what should be included in such a study. I know the senior Senator from Vermont has addressed us on more than one occasion in defense of the compact. More recently he outlined his concerns regarding what he felt should be included in the OMB study. 
However, I must stress that these are the remarks of one Senator and should not be misconstrued by OMB or anyone else as the official position of the U.S. Senate. 
The conference agreement clearly calls for a comprehensive economic evaluation of the direct and indirect effects of the compact. I welcome the results of a study I expect to be free of outside influences. I am confident this compact will be exposed as a misguided, ill-fated attempt at market manipulation. 
Mr. President, the OMB study in this conference agreement will help us assess the compact's effects on the poor, needy senior citizens and children, as well as the Nation's dairy producers. 
It is to be completed by December 31, 1997, and I will closely observe its progress in order to ensure that the study is conducted in a fair and equitable manner and is not manipulated by outside interests. I expect the administration to allow an independent study that is not influenced by any USDA or White House political agenda. 
Another provision I am pleased was included will prohibit Agriculture Market Transition Act [AMTA] payments to a producer who plants wild rice on contract acreage, unless the payment is reduced proportionally. 
As it currently stands, producers of other commodities who choose to plant wild rice on land designated for other crops can receive both their AMTA payment and the proceeds for sale of their wild rice. This has placed wild rice farmers at a disadvantage. It violates the intent of the law and it also results in unfair competition. 
I am pleased the House and Senate conferees agreed with my amendment and chose to include it in this agreement. The provision clarifies congressional intent and restores fairness to our farm payment system. 
I also want to make special note of the research funding contained in this bill for fusarium head blight, commonly known as scab, and vomitoxin. 
During a recent trip through Minnesota's Red River Valley, wheat and barley producers stressed time and time again the economic impact these diseases have had on their crops. Minnesota is again experiencing an epidemic of scab which marks the fifth straight year the disease has been seen to some degree in the Northern Plains. 
When added to contributions producers and the State of Minnesota have made to scab and vomitoxin research, I believe that the provisions contained in the research titles of this agreement are an appropriate approach to the Federal commitment regarding long-term basic research. 
Mr. President, as I have stated many times both here and in Minnesota, we must give our farmers the tools to manage their business and not hamstring their creativity and productivity from Washington. 
Although there is much work to be done regarding dairy and regulatory reform and risk-management, this conference agreement is a step in the right direction. I look forward to its immediate passage. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in expressing my support for Senator Kyl's Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act, of which I am a cosponsor. As I explained on the floor in a statement last Monday, the thought that we have to debate in the U.S. Senate whether or not we are going to allow seniors the very basic right to use their money as they see fit is really just testimony to how far this administration is willing to go in trying to impose its will and its vision of socialized medicine on the American people. Socialized medicine, what Americans rejected in 1993, the administration is trying to, in incremental steps, reimpose on the American public. 
Over the past few weeks I have received many letters, many phone calls and e-mails on this very subject. I would like to share one of these letters with my colleagues today. This comment came from a constituent of mine in Saint Paul, MN. The constituent wrote: 
By what right do you arrogate to yourself the right to determine the length of my life? Medicare could easily fall short of the necessary medical steps to preserve health and life. Remember, this will apply to you, too. 
My fellow Minnesotan could not be more correct in the assessment of this provision which was tucked into the Balanced Budget act. It was tucked in there in the dark of the night, without debate and with little regard for the consequences and with the demand by the administration that it be included no matter what. It is unconscionable that the United States, the world's model of freedom and liberty, has now decided that senior citizens are somehow second-class citizens, that they are incapable of making their own choices when it comes to health care. 
Opponents of the Freedom to Contract Act claim that this bill now will make it easier for doctors to force seniors to give up their Medicare rights and be charged `the sky's the limit.' They say that without this protection, seniors will be overpaying for their medical care. 
I give our Nation's physicians and our Nation's seniors a lot more credit than that. This bill does absolutely nothing to force seniors to opt out of the Medicare Program, nor does it implicitly encourage them to do so. It simply will give our seniors an additional choice in how they receive their health care services--an additional choice on how they receive their services. In fact, I believe increasing choices for seniors in the Medicare Program was probably one of the best things that came out of this year's Balanced Budget Act. The Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act is just a logical extension of the Medicare Plus Choice Program that was created in the Balanced Budget Act. 
I urge my colleagues to set aside the demagoguery and restore the rights of our senior citizens. They deserve our respect and they deserve the right to make their own choices. If we don't act on this bill before this session of this Congress ends, it will go into effect and then it will be very hard to restore this right to our seniors. So I am asking my colleagues, urging them, to join with us to make sure that we preserve the rights of our senior citizens to have an additional choice in how they decide on their health care. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the attention of the Senate the dedication and hard work of many individuals in my home State of Minnesota. 
During this past years CRP signup, at least 275 employees from Minnesota's 91 Soil and Water Conservation Districts donated over 6,000 hours assisting U.S. Department of Agriculture employees, ensuring the signups success. Without their efforts, there is little doubt the work would not have been done on time and in such an efficient manner. Their work, along with the work of USDA employees, should not go unnoticed. 
Mr. President, the Conservation Reserve Program is a vital program for the people of my State. It provides incalcuable benefits to farmers, sportsmen, conservationists, the wildlife, and, therefore, all American citizens. I have been, and will continue to be, a vocal supporter of a strong and balanced Conservation Reserve Program. It is simply good for Minnesota and good for our Nation. 
In closing, Mr. President, with the combined efforts of Congress, the USDA, farmers and people like those at Minnesota's Soil and Water Conservation Districts, we can ensure the continued success and viability of the Conservation Reserve Program well into the 21st Century.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am here this morning on the floor to talk about the very important ISTEA legislation that is being held up in the Senate here for many, many different reasons. But the introduction of the Senate's Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1997 represents the results of intense negotiations between Chairman Chafee, Senator Warner, and Senator Baucus, each of whom have represented three different legislative approaches to the reauthorization of ISTEA. 
I thank each of these Senators for the work they have done to bring this bill to the floor because the citizens of my home State of Minnesota strongly support a 6-year reauthorization bill, funded at the highest levels. This should be one of our top priorities before we adjourn this session. Unfortunately, however, this very important piece of legislation is being held up by other Senators seeking to impose a political agenda on a very vital transportation spending issue. Again, it is being held up by Senators who want to impose a political agenda on vital transportation spending. 
Their effort to halt this crucial transportation spending bill are far more egregious than other attempts in the past to influence legislation by holding it hostage. It is inconceivable to me that we would not consider this bill on its own merits. The question of why not is being asked by every State concerned about the availability of transportation funds for continuing projects. It is ironic that Senators claiming to support labor issues would now thumb their noses at the same hard-working Americans who feed and clothe their families through the salaries they earn working on transportation projects, not to mention how important those projects are for improved safety and for meeting our growing transportation needs. 
ISTEA must be considered before we adjourn for the year. There has been a real effort to reach a compromise that achieves balance among the 50 States. This balance is required to address unique transportation needs in the different regions of our country: The congestion needs of the growing South, the aging infrastructure needs of the Northeast, as well as the national transportation needs of the rural West and the Midwest. Almost every State shares in the growth in dollars contained in the bill compared with the funding levels that they received under ISTEA back in 1991. 
I was proud to join Senator Warner as a cosponsor of STEP 21 earlier this year, as Minnesota was a member of the STEP 21 coalition, and I am pleased that much of the bill has been incorporated now into this piece of legislation. 
Mr. President, this bill attempts to preserve the principles of ISTEA that have proven to be successful. We need to ensure that our transportation growth contributes to the preservation of our environment. 
We need to continue to build upon the shared decisionmaking among the Federal, State, and local governments in the transportation planning process. We also need a transportation bill that is based on a formula that is fair. This bill will either succeed on the doctrine of fairness or it will fall victim to politics as it has in the past. 
I am pleased the ISTEA reauthorization attempts to ensure a fair allocation of funds. The new formula was determined with objective factors, such as the number of miles of the National Highway System and each State's contributions to the highway trust fund. 
Under this legislation, every State will receive a minimum return of 90 percent of their contributions to the highway trust fund. That is a very different guarantee from the so-called 90-percent minimum allocation in ISTEA. This is a real guarantee. 
Finally, we must have a transportation bill that makes an improvement in streamlining as well as flexibility. This bill streamlines ISTEA's five major programs down into three, and they are the National Highway System, the Surface Transportation Program, and the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program. 
The Federal focus on our most important network of roads, the National Highway System, which includes our interstate system, is maintained. The streamlining and the flexibility provided by the ISTEA reauthorization will give Minnesota the ability to make its own transportation decisions, and that is a great step forward. Other States also would have the same freedom. 
This bill attempts to get a reasonable rate of return for Minnesota. In this bill, my State will receive 1.50 percent of Federal apportionment dollars, which represents an increase from the 1.43 percent of actual dollars under the 1991 ISTEA. 
The bill would also increase my State's share by over $82 million per average year above the 1991 authorization level. 
I am also pleased to be a cosponsor of the Byrd-Gramm amendment which allows the Federal gas tax of 4.3 cents now dedicated to the highway trust fund to actually be spent on highways. This will provide Minnesota the necessary additional revenue that is so critical to meeting our infrastructure needs. 
Mr. President, the political games must end. The reauthorization of ISTEA has expired. We need to go forward and we need to approve a new highway reauthorization bill. 
It has been proven again and again that transportation spending is one of the most important, it is one of the most cost-effective investments in our Nation's future. For every $1 billion spent on transportation, we create 60,000 jobs, jobs that are now at risk again while some Senators attempt to hold this legislation prisoner in exchange for the advancement of their particular political agendas. I ask my colleagues this morning to help liberate this political hostage to allow the ISTEA legislation to proceed. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wanted to be here today just to make some brief comments in support of the Medicare Freedom To Contract Act, S. 1194. 
During my first term in the 103d Congress, I witnessed President Clinton attempt a Federal takeover of fully one-seventh of our Nation's economy through a nationalized health care system. I was opposed to it then and I remain adamantly opposed to it today. 
Over the past 2 years we have seen a step-by-step encroachment by the Federal Government into the health care system. 
Despite overwhelming public opposition to his attempt to take over the health care system, President Clinton still seems to be intent on imposing his vision of socialized medicine on the American people. 
In fact, on September 15 of this year, the President admitted that he has not abandoned his goal of forcing a nationalized health care system. He stated, `Now what I tried to do before won't work. Maybe we can do it in another way. That's what we've tried to do, a step at a time, until we finish this.' 
I am sorry to say that the Republican-led Congress has been a great service to the President by incrementally adopting and implementing more and more of his 1994 health care scheme. While I supported the heralded Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act, which did accomplish some needed reforms, I have concerns about how this law has since been implemented. 
In addition to its original mandate, we have a host of so-called `body part' protections and coverage mandates which will create a precedent for total Federal control over health insurance packages and thereby ultimately a Federal health system. I have always believed that the American people should have the fundamental right to choose where, when and how they receive their health care services. If individuals choose to enroll in health maintenance organizations, let them. If they want to join a preferred provider organization, let them. If they would like to opt out of health insurance altogether or to pay for the services as they are received, then let them. Clearly, I am not in a position to determine what their needs are or what plan would best suit their family and their budget, nor is any bureaucrat in Washington able to determine the coverage best suited for each individual in the United States. 
Now, that brings us to the recently enacted Children's Health Initiative. I opposed the Balanced Budget Act in large part because of this grossly overfunded, new Federal entitlement. Again, another `step at a time' that the President says we need to take until we have a total Government-run health care system. 
Let me be very clear. I am very fully in support of ensuring access to health insurance for children. However, I have never believed that this was a Federal issue. As a Minnesotan, I witnessed the creation of a State program in 1992 which has provided access to health insurance to thousands of children in my State of Minnesota. It is called MinnesotaCare. 
Now, this State program gives access to State subsidized private health insurance to families up to 285 percent of the Federal poverty level. The Federal Children's Health Initiative provided no consideration to the States which have made a commitment to providing access to health insurance to children or their families. In effect, the Federal Government has now spent $24 billion on a program which clearly will not work in every State. In fact, it will penalize States like mine which have already made significant progress in covering children, and this illustrates my point very well. Washington cannot make the health care insurance decisions for everyone. 
One of the most important corrections needed in the Balanced Budget Act is the Medicare Freedom to Contract Act. This was introduced by Senator Kyl which I have cosponsored. This act tries to correct what is probably the most egregious example of what President Clinton's vision of Federal Government as provider and protector has in store for us. 
While the Balanced Budget Act included a provision which allows a Medicare beneficiary to contract for health care services privately with a physician, it effectively prohibits this from happening by forcing that physician to opt out of treating any other Medicare patients for 2 years. What the President has done is to blackmail doctors and to deny senior citizens the basic right of spending their money as they see fit. 
Even in the United Kingdom, which has had socialized national health service since 1948, it allows its citizens to pay for services outside the national system. Clearly, Americans can do better than that and at least Americans deserve the same option. This is unfair to seniors. It is unfair to physicians. And it must be corrected quickly. 
Opponents of the Medicare Freedom to Contract Act claim that it will force seniors to pay 100 percent of a physician's charge for their services, and it would mean an immediate and dramatic increase in out-of-pocket costs for physician services. 
This is simply untrue. No Medicare beneficiary is required, nor implicitly encouraged, to contract privately with a physician. This act merely makes it possible for seniors to do so if they choose to do so. But the opponents are ready to come to the floor to filibuster any opportunity to discuss this issue or to get a vote on it. And President Clinton has also threatened to veto the bill should it pass. 
Now, he put the provision in the BBA in the middle of the night without debate, another step again toward the President's desire for a nationally run health care program. And he says he will veto any efforts to stop it. Is this what Americans want? The American people strongly rejected it in 1994, and they don't want it now. 
Mr. President, I find it completely amazing that there are individuals who believe it is wrong to allow seniors more options and more choices in how they receive their health care services. Indeed, as the Balanced Budget Act aimed to provide more choices to seniors through the Medicare Plus Choice Program, the Medicare Freedom to Contract Act is the logical extension of the Medicare Plus Choice Program. It creates yet another option for our seniors. 
In fact, a case can be made that if seniors contract privately with their physician for services and do not bill Medicare, it will save money. It will extend the life of the Medicare Program beyond the 10 years the Balanced Budget Act supposedly will do. 
Finally, Mr. President, we have many lessons to learn about the effects of health care mandates. However, denying seniors the option of using their own money to pay for their own health care is a lesson in Government that's gone mad, and that is a lesson we have all learned too well already. I urge my colleagues to support this needed correction. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today Senator Moseley-Braun and I are introducing the United States $1 Coin Act of 1997. The bill calls for a newly designated, golden-colored $1 coin to replace the Susan B. Anthony. 
Unless this legislation is approved in the near future, the U.S. Mint will begin the process of minting more of the unpopular Susan B. Anthony coins by 1999. The supply of Anthony coins in government inventories fell by a total of 137 million coins in 1995 and 1996. Only 133 million remain as of September 30, 1997. The inventory has been falling at the rate of about 5 million per month because Anthony dollars are used at hundreds of vending locations, in more than a dozen major transit systems, and by the U.S. Postal Service. 
Because the U.S. Mint has stated that it needs 30 months to design and fabricate a new $1 coin, the timeframe for a decision by Congress is short. 
The current design of the SBA $1 coin is flawed because it has the same color and reeded edge as a quarter. This makes it difficult for consumers to tell the difference between an SBA $1 coin and a quarter. 
The United States $1 Coin Act of 1997 will require the Treasury Department to change the color and edge of the SBA $1 coin so that it is different from the quarter. The act will not terminate the $1 bill. 
Philip Diehl, Director of the U.S. Mint, stated his support for these reforms in his testimony to the House Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy on October 21, 1997:

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wanted to comment a little bit on the campaign finance debate that is going on. 
Mr. President, over the last several months, Americans have expressed grave concern over the daily reports of alleged illegal or improper campaign contributions to the Democratic National Committee and White House during the 1996 campaign cycle. These reports have raised the perception among some Americans that access and votes can be bought in Washington and that the system for financing our Federal campaigns is corrupt and broken. 
Consequently, there have been many proposals introduced in the Congress that are intended to change the way in which campaigns for Federal office are financed. Most of these proposals call for enacting new limits on how Americans can exercise their political freedoms. Their stated purpose is to ultimately restore the trust of the public in their Government. 
I share the concerns about these reports of irregular and even illegal fundraising during the 1996 elections. However, I disagree that the way to respond to these concerns is to pass new laws that would do nothing more than limit the ability of Americans to exercise their political freedoms guaranteed by the first amendment. 
The first amendment has always been the basis for active citizen participation in our political process. The first amendment ensures that, among other things, average Americans can participate in our democratic process through publicly disclosed contributions to campaigns of their choice. It also allows Americans to freely draft letters to the editor, distribute campaign literature, and participate in rallies and get-out-the-vote drives. 
In my view, the Federal Government can restore the integrity of our electoral process through greater enforcement of existing laws, increased disclosure of contributions and expenditures, and protection of the rights of Americans to become involved in the democratic process without fear of coercion. We don't need new campaign finance laws. Simply loading new laws upon those which have already been broken will not solve the problem. After all, if campaigns or donors would not obey the current laws, strengthened almost 25 years ago after the Watergate scandal, why would we believe they would obey a new set of rules? They simply can't. 
The whole exercise is a public relations scheme designed to let the public think we are reacting--when we are not. To move in this direction would only threaten the ability of Americans to participate in the democracy which they have helped to create. Placing new limits or government controls are not the answer. 
Mr. President, this leads me to my concerns with the McCain-Feingold proposal. While I commend the proponents of McCain-Feingold for making some minor changes to their initial proposal, such as removing the provisions providing for voluntary spending limits and restrictions on political action committees, the modified McCain-Feingold proposal still continues to suppress the rights of Americans to communicate their ideas and express their views. 
For example, this modification is premised upon the belief that there is too much money spent on American elections. If we accept this assumption, then Congress has decided to assert questionable authority to suppress the rights of Americans to become involved in the political process and make their voices heard. 
In fact, the belief that there is government justification for regulating the costs of political campaigns was rejected by the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Buckley versus Valeo. In Buckley, the Court declared,  
The First Amendment denies government the power to determine that spending to promote one's political views is wasteful, excessive or unwise. In the free society ordained by our Constitution it is not the government but the people--individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political committees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of debate on public issues in a political campaign. 
The McCain-Feingold proposal also fails to recognize that Americans have a right to petition the government and have their voices heard. Americans have both a right and obligation to make their views known and hold those that seek to represent them accountable for their actions or positions on issues. 
Mr. President, I expect the American people will receive a full disclosure of campaign finance law violations. I believe the testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee has thus far proved the need for the Federal Government to focus its efforts on greater enforcement of our existing laws and prosecution of those who violate the laws, before Congress seeks to pass new laws. Congress should not use violations of existing law to restrict political speech and participation by those who abide by current law. 
In addition to more timely enforcement of our existing election laws, we should encourage greater disclosure of each contribution and expenditure. Fair and frequent disclosure of contributions by Federal office seekers will open up the political process to the electorate. 
I am encouraged by the disclosure provisions contained within the McCain-Feingold proposals. We share the same goal of letting the sun shine on the process. I am sure there will be additional opportunities to debate this aspect of the McCain-Feingold proposal. 
Finally, Congress should work to protect the right of Americans to participate in the democratic process without fear of coercion. Despite the Supreme Court decision in Communications Workers of America versus Beck almost 10 years ago, millions of Americans still have portions of their paychecks taken and used for political purposes for which they may disagree, without their knowledge or consent. 
I believe forcing an individual to make compulsory campaign contributions is contrary to our constitutional form of government and the first amendment freedoms we enjoy as citizens. As Thomas Jefferson once said, `to compel a man to furnish contribution of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical.' For these reasons, I support the majority leader's decision to offer the `Paycheck Protection Act' as an amendment to the McCain-Feingold bill. I do not consider this a `poison pill' to passage of campaign finance legislation, but rather effective medicine for our Nation's employees because it will allow individuals to regain control of their paychecks, avoid coercion, and exercise their political freedoms. 
Finally, Mr. President, as we approach the next century, the Senate has the responsibility to restore the public's trust in their government and preserve the political freedoms that were enacted over 200 years ago. I remain hopeful that our actions here will not affect the ability of future generations of Americans to enjoy these same freedoms. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks about an important issue facing our Nation in the information era--the issue of legal protection of data bases. The U.S. Copyright Office recently released a comprehensive report on the issue of data base protection. I welcome this new information and look forward to both the prompt consideration of the report by Congress and to the introduction of much-needed legislation that will protect the enormous investments of data base producers, to assure scientists, educators, businesses, and other consumers that they will continue to have access to accurate, verifiable information. 
The Copyright Office report provides the requisite legal and legislative analysis that Congress needs in order to act in an appropriate and timely manner to respond to the legitimate concerns of all parties. 
It is an important step in the process of addressing recent technological and legal developments that have left valuable American data bases vulnerable to unauthorized copying and dissemination. 
The report states that it is expected that all member countries of the European Union will implement the European Union's directive on data bases by January 1, 1998--a fact that underscores the international implications of this issue for American data base producers. The directive provides a new form of protection for data bases to supplement copyright law. The directive extends this new protection only to data base producers located in a European Union member state and will not protect data bases originating in the United States until we adopt our own data base protection legislation. 
Mr. President, the United States, as the world's leading producer and exporter of data bases of all types, needs legal protection abroad far more than any other nation. Unless the United States adopts this protection, the data bases of U.S. companies will be at risk. Smaller U.S. firms without global operations will be the most vulnerable. The worst-case scenario is that this could potentially force U.S. companies to move their operations out of this country and into countries that offer data base protection. Such a move poses a serious threat to U.S. jobs. 
After studying the report, I believe current U.S. law and precedent are insufficient to adequately protect the enormous investment of money and effort that typically goes into creating data bases, both print and electronic. This is especially true given the declining copyright protection afforded to data bases after the Supreme Court's 1990 decision in Feist, and the inherent vulnerability of data bases to piracy made easy in the new digital environment. 
America's data base producers employ or represent thousands of editors, researchers, and others who gather, verify, update, format, and distribute the information contained in their data base products. They also invest billions of dollars in hardware and software to manage these large bodies of information. 
Mr. President, comprehensive data is indispensable to the successful operation of today's American economy, including information about communications, finance, medicine, law, news, travel, defense, and many other topics. As one of America's leading growth industries--one that generates jobs and supports American families--the information services industry creates a wealth of user-friendly, reliable, and up-to-date information critical to the lives of American citizens. Congress must provide the legal protection that ensures the future viability of the information services industry. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today, I rise in support of S. 462, the Public Housing Reform and Responsibility Act. This bill is compassionate legislation that provides much-needed regulatory relief and commonsense reform for public housing in America. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of S. 462. It makes permanent the reform measures that have been added onto recent appropriations bills. It provides much needed additional regulatory relief and paperwork reduction to well-managed public housing agencies. It imposes tougher penalties on troubled housing authorities. And finally, it strengthens the ability of authorities to improve the safety of their tenants by enhancing their powers of screening and eviction.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments and discuss some of the points raised by my colleagues today on the subject of campaign finance reform. 
Proponents of campaign finance reform have expressed concern over the cost of Federal election campaigns. One Senator stated that the cost of campaigns has increased 73 percent over the last 10 to 20 years. However, the cost of most things in life have also increased. For example, the Federal Government has grown so much over the last three or four decades that it spreads out and touches nearly part of our lives. In fact, there was a study which found that the Government involves itself in about 60 percent of everything we do today. 
The Federal Government's intrusion in the lives of my constituents has led many of them to either become involved in campaigns or travel to Washington to have their voices heard about the role of the Government in their lives. Congress should not suppress the ability of Americans to have their voices heard. 
If we go back to the level of Government that we had in 1930, we would not see the need for the number of people who have to travel out here day after day, year after year to get their points across, to let the Government know how certain legislation is going to affect them, good or bad. 
We often hear the phrase, `The system is broken.' The average campaign today costs about $4.5 million on average and the cost should be debated. However, the cost of political campaigns is still less, as we heard many times, than we spend every year on advertising for potato chips, yogurt, or toothpaste. 
So are the campaigns getting out of hand in the amount of money we spend? No. In fact, there are those who argue that we need to have more Americans involved in politics to have their voices heard. That is what makes a great democracy. The more involved you can get in what the Government does, the more that Government is going to respond to your needs and the needs of the country. 
Mr. President, the system is broken. It is a club for millionaires or could become a club for millionaires. If we continue to impose new restrictions, that is exactly what would happen. It would only be millionaires who would be able to run for office. So, in other words, we would cut off the average American's chance of ever running or holding any public office, to come and bring concerns to the floor of the U.S. Senate, the House of Representatives, or even in the State houses. 
I have also heard people say that `Fundraisers used to be held around Senate schedules. Now it's just the opposite, that the Senate schedules are held around fundraisers.' 
That isn't true in my office. We try to spend the vast majority of our time doing the work that we were sent here to do. Yes, we are going to face a campaign; yes, we are going to have to raise money, but we are sure not going to make the work that we were elected to do a lesser priority. I do not believe most of our colleagues have done that. But that is one of the charges issued today. 
If we increase the limits on the ability to raise X amount of dollars or we are required to accept smaller contributions, we will discourage many individuals who would like to campaign and serve in Congress. These individuals will have to spend more time trying to raise money than doing the job that they were elected to do. It gets to be a money chase, as we have heard here many times today. 
Each election, however, is like a basic ad campaign. Every candidate needs to communicate a message. Every candidate needs to be able to go out and talk to the voters to tell them what he supports, what his agenda will be, how he is going to vote on the important issues. 
If he does not have a chance or the opportunity to communicate his view to the voters, how are they going to know what this candidate represents? How are they going to know what to expect from him, and how are they going to make a decision between candidate A and candidate B? 
When you look at costs--I believe it was said earlier, too, today it is about $1.2 million to buy a 30-second ad during the Super Bowl. Now, we are not going to advertise during the Super Bowl. But if you go into an average television market across the country, an average spot for 30 seconds today is going to cost you over $3,000. Now, again, that is a lot of money, but you are going to have to run a decent campaign again to deliver your message. 
We need to inform our voters. If we cannot, as candidates cannot tell our voters how we are going to vote, what our values are, what we are going to stand up for, how we are going to vote on special issues, you can bet somebody is going to tell them that. But they are not going to tell it probably the way you would like. In other words, we are going to have opponents out there. You are going to have special interest groups, independent expenditures, or, more terrifying, you are going to leave it up to the media, you are going to allow the media to frame this debate. 
I do not want a newspaper or TV station, liberal or conservative, to be out there telling the voters what they think my position is or to frame my campaign in their words. As we know, I have views about how a lot of these stories and editorials are written. So if we leave it up to the editorial pages of our newspapers, or television reports and other stories, I do not think they are going to get the accurate picture of the campaigns or the candidates involved. A truly informed electrorate will result from preserving the free speech of people to become involved in these campaigns and the right of candidates to communicate their agenda. 
What we are hearing today in the Senate is to put on more limits. `The system is broken.' We hear that again. `The public is cynical.' I do not think they are cynical about honest campaigns. But they are from the headlines of those who have broken campaign laws. That is what you should be cynical about. 
We heard Senator Kerry here just a few minutes ago talking about his last campaign, spending in the neighborhood of about $12 million. That was a tough race. That is a lot of money. But have we heard any charges of illegalities involved in the race? No. So did the amount of money corrupt the race? Evidently not. 
So it isn't the money. But it is real chutzpah--if you know what the term is; that is really `in your face'--when we have those who are out there calling the loudest for campaign finance reform saying that it could even involve a special session of Congress. I would call that `a good defense being a good offense.' In other words, let us deflect the real problem of the issue today, 
and that is over the problems of past campaigns, those who have broken the laws but yet are calling for new laws to be implemented. In other words, the chutzpah is similar to a saying in this morning's paper, `It's like the person who killed his parents and then argued for mercy from the courts because he was an orphan.' `Stop me from killing again. Do not allow me to go out and break these laws again. Let's have new laws on the books,' just like somehow new laws are going to prevent the intent of breaking them. 
There has been discussion about independent expenditures and establishing new limits. But, again, we cannot muzzle everybody. We are going to allow the unions to continue spending and collecting millions of dollars. No attempts really to rein in that abuse. So in other words, when it comes to reforms, it is OK to reform only if it limits my opponents more than it would limit me. Now, that would be good reform, but, again, in whose eyes? If we cannot do across-the-board reform, then no reform is good reform. 
A good defense is a good offense, again, to divert attention from the problems at hand. A lot of people are looking at hearings going on in Congress this year, and you hear the rhetoric or the spin that this is all about campaign finance reform. 
This is about those who broke existing laws, who abused the laws in the last campaign. That is what these hearings are supposed to flush out and look at, not by putting new limits on what we can say, who can say it, when we can say it. Who is going to determine that? Who is going to become a new censor? 
What that would do is take away more of your rights as individuals to participate in any campaign, whether Democrat, Republican, independent, whatever it might be. New limits would only mean average Americans would have new constraints placed on how they could become involved in the political process. In this instance, groups, individuals and candidates would be muzzled in a free country. 
Again, who would be out there talking? Again, `The system is broken.' Their answer, `Put more controls on free speech.' But in order to do that, it means bigger Government. `More Government is the answer. If we can only put a few more controls, put a few more limits, spend a few more dollars somewhere else, somehow that is going to fix the system.' 
The system may need some reforms. It may need some tinkering. It may need some changes. But I think overall our system is not broken. Have laws been broken? Has the system been abused? Yes, it has. That is exactly what the Thompson hearings have been trying to find out. But they have been blunted by those who have been accused and, yes, even charged with breaking those very laws. They say, `Well, if we did, we're sorry, but we need to push for new laws. We need new changes.' 
If there are those in Congress or any place else who would sell their integrity for a $2,000 contribution rather than representing the millions of people back home--by the way, an individual contribution is somewhere around the neighborhood of $25 per contribution--if there are individuals who would do that, they would be easily found out. If they are going to vote that way or betray the trust back home, they are going to be found out. If they are found out, they should be thrown out. 
But I believe nearly all, if not all, Members in this body are very honorable men and women who work very hard to try to serve their constituents back home, Republicans and Democrats, having the best interests of their constituents back home at heart. They try do that with a lot of honesty. 
But what are Americans to think if they hear day after day that campaigns, that Congress, is corrupt, that it is for sale to the highest bidder? Again, if there are such individuals, they will be found out and they will be thrown out. But I believe the public concern of campaigns in a large part is not because of the system itself but because of those who have abused the system, those who have broken the laws, and they remain unpunished. 
New laws, I do not believe, will cure the intent of those who 
want to break them. So I say, let us open the system, let us have full disclosure--Who contributed to the campaigns? How much did they contribute? --so that the public can judge who is supported by whom, which groups are involved, what are the issues at stake. 
Let us not put the Federal Government in control. Isn't public involvement better than having censorship by the Federal Government? You know, most people have a real concern today about big Government. A lot of people say they do not think a bloated bureaucracy can provide the best service today. They have sent many of us here to Washington with the charge of streamlining and downsizing the Federal Government that they believe is out of hand, unwieldy, spending too much money. 
Is the way to fix the campaign finance system by putting more control of the system into the hands of the Federal Government, to give them more control, more power, and, yes, even censorship on what you can say, when you can say it? Is it negative? Is it positive? Who is going to decide all of that? 
I believe Americans as a whole want the ability to participate and to participate in the elections as they choose. 
With that, I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act. 
While this legislation covers many areas under the FDA's jurisdiction, as chairman of the Medical Device Caucus, I want to focus primarily on the provisions relating to the regulation of medical devices. 
The medical device industry is an important asset to Minnesotans. I am proud to say that many of the world's leading and most innovative medical device companies call Minnesota home. In fact, there are over 500 medical device manufacturers in Minnesota. 
In my State, the medical device industry has created more than 16,000 manufacturing jobs. Minnesota ranks fifth nationally in total employment for medical devices--and since 1988, the number of medical device manufacturing jobs has grown faster in Minnesota than in the rest of the Nation. In 1994 alone, 53 new medical device companies were created in Minnesota. 
Yet, despite all the successes, there are significant hurdles the industry must clear in order to succeed in the increasingly competitive global marketplace. 
Medical device manufacturers face incredible barriers that too often prevent them from marketing new products, creating jobs, researching and developing the latest technologies, and most tragically, from providing U.S. patients the best medical technology in the world. 
Mr. President, it is easy for debates on reforming or modernizing the FDA to develop into an FDA bashing session which does nothing to persuade or accentuate the positive results of suggested changes made in the FDA reform measure, S. 830. 
I want to be very clear: The individuals charged with ensuring the safety of medical devices, drugs, biologics, food, and cosmetics are good people, trying their best to do a difficult job. The pace at which new technologies are introduced in the medical community is staggering--and at best, difficult to keep up with. 
This legislation will give the FDA the tools they need to keep pace with technology and ensure the safety and effectiveness of drugs, medical devices, food, and cosmetics well into the 21st century. 
I would like to thank the Labor and Health and Human Services Committee for drafting what is a well-balanced and meaningful FDA modernization package in addition to reauthorizing the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. 
The User Fee Act has proven itself as an example of how an agency and an industry can work together to bring highly regulated products to the market more quickly and more efficiently--without sacrificing safety. 
However, the regulatory burdens imposed on the medical device industry have had a chilling effect on the industry and its customers--the patients. As a result of regulatory delays, device manufacturers are falling behind their foreign competitors or moving their production and development overseas. 
While approval of devices in Europe takes only 6 to 8 months, the same device can be caught up in the regulatory process for years here in the United States. What this means is that Europeans have access to the most up-to-date technologies while patients in the United States are forced to wait. 
If this continues, we will not be able to claim that the United States has the world's best health care for very much longer. 
Many will say we need a strong FDA. I agree. I would argue, however, that far too many Americans have become victims of the Government's bureaucracy because they were denied access to devices which have been available and safely used in Europe for years. 
We can no longer allow ourselves to perpetuate out-of-date rules and regulations which ultimately harm the patient, nor can we allow those same rules and regulations to force American jobs, technologies, and health care overseas. 
The FDA Modernization and Accountability Act is a solid piece of legislation which will ensure American patients' access to the most advanced medical devices as well as create jobs and strengthen the economy. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
Mr. President, I understand that there are no other speakers on our side of the aisle wishing to come to the floor and talk about the subject today. So, on behalf of the manager of the bill, the Senator from Vermont, and the majority, I yield my time and the remainder of the majority's time. 
Thank you.

Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, 
I rise today to introduce legislation to require the Social Security Administration to provide key information to the American people for retirement planning. 
In that regard, I plan to send my bill to the desk in just a moment. 
But to explain that, every working American has a significant part of each paycheck designated to the Social Security Program, but few know how much they've contributed over their lifetime, the real value of their Social Security investment, or how much they'll need for a secure retirement. 
As average life-expectancy increases and the oldest baby boomers approach retirement, the answers to those three questions become critically important, for there's growing concern over the future of Social Security and how individuals should prepare themselves for retirement. 
Over the next 33 years, the number of retirees and their dependents who are eligible for Social Security benefits will increase by more than 100 percent; from 30 million in 1997 to more than 60 million in 2030, while the number of workers 20 to 64 years old will increase by only 20 percent. 
By 2030, the ratio of workers per retiree will be the smallest ever, straining the entire Social Security system to the breaking point. Most of these older Americans will rely on Social Security benefits as their major source of retirement income. 
For many families, Social Security is the largest and most important financial investment they'll make, consuming up to one-eighth of their total lifetime income. Yet, the Federal Government remains unaccountable for the dollars working Americans have invested in the program. 
Current laws do not require the Social Security Administration, [SSA], the agency managing the Social Security trust funds, to send clear and complete account statements to individual taxpayers. 
Therefore, Americans don't receive adequate information about the retirement benefits they can expect to receive, the rate of return from their Social Security investment, or the future financial status of the Social Security trust funds--information, by the way, private investment agencies are required to provide to their investors. 
As a result, the vast majority of today's baby boomers won't be financially secure at retirement. 
My legislation would help to correct this problem and bring Social Security closer to meeting the disclosure requirements expected of private investment firms. This legislation will help ensure that working Americans receive the information they need to plan for a secure retirement. 
In 1989, Congress passed the personal earnings and benefits estimate statements, it is commonly known as PEBES. That legislation requires the SSA to send to eligible individuals statements on their yearly earnings and estimated benefits. 
A recent study by the General Accounting Office, the accounting arm of Congress, suggests that while the PEBES is useful, it is extremely difficult for average Americans to understand and, in fact, could be misleading. Therefore it isn't as effective as it could be or should be. 
Moreover, the current PEBES statement does not include the information an individual needs to most effectively plan for retirement. 
My proposal would require Washington to provide key information on the real value, or the yield, of a worker's investment in the Social Security Program by counting employers' contributions as workers' earnings to calculate the rate of return. Washington currently excludes this type of contribution from a worker's earnings statement. 
The employer's share of Social Security is a labor cost that's ultimately borne by the employee; it is only fair that it be counted as a worker's contribution. 
To ensure that the information is easy to understand, my legislation would also direct the SSA to provide benefit estimates in real rather than current dollars. To show the impact of inflation on Social Security benefits, consider the case of a typical individual retiring in 2043. That American is 25 years old today, retiring in the year 2043. 
The current benefit estimate found in PEBES will tell this worker that he or she can expect to receive $98,989--nearly $100,000 annually in Social Security benefits. That sounds pretty good, doesn't it? But most workers will never consider the effects of inflation on this number. They'd never guess that an income of $98,989 in 2043 will actually be the equivalent of only $14,180 today because of inflation. 
If the PEBES includes such misleading information, it is likely that more working Americans will misunderstand and, therefore, overestimate the value of the benefits they will receive from Social Security. Only after it is too late will they find themselves financially unprepared for retirement. 
Not only would my legislation direct the SSA to include all of the most important information found in PEBES on a single, easy-to-read form, but the SSA would also be required to provide the current and projected balance in the Social Security trust funds, and let individuals decide on their future by providing them honest information today. 
With this information, Americans will be able to quickly and easily determine what the PEBES report is about and find the information essential to successful retirement planning. 
Working American need to know up front what they can and cannot expect out of the Social Security system compared against what they are paying into it. 
Giving individuals an honest accounting of that information serves the fundamental objectives of the Social Security Program by enabling workers to judge to what degree they should supplement their contributions with other forms of retirement savings such as pension plans and personal savings and investments. 
While much more needs to be accomplished to preserve and strengthen the Social Security safety net for today and tomorrow, the approach I've outlined would be an important first step in that attempt.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. I want to thank my colleague from Texas for yielding. 
Mr. President, I came to the floor yesterday to discuss in detail my strong support for the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. I do not intend to repeat the arguments I made then, but I do have just a couple of other points I think need to be made. 
When my good friends, Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas and Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, and I first proposed the $500-per-child tax credit back in 1993, we were not doing it to grab headlines and it was not a piece of cheap political theater. We pursued the $500-per-child tax credit because we believed that working families are horribly overtaxed. And how did we know that? Because the American people told us so. 
Americans are by nature a very giving and generous people. For a long time, they did not complain--at least too loudly--that their tax burden seemed to be rising every year even though they were not seeing any improvements in Government services. If anything, their tax dollars seemed to be buying less and less. But when taxes reached the point where working Americans were spending more of their hard-earned money feeding the Government than they were spending to feed, clothe, and shelter their families, well then, the taxpayers started feeling as though their generosity was being taken advantage of. They began demanding that the Government stop spending their dollars so recklessly. They began asking for tax relief, so they could start meeting the needs of their own families, instead of feeding Washington's mixed-up priorities. 
So what do working families want from their Government? Well, let me first tell you what they do not want. 
America's working families do not want handouts. 
They do not want more government agencies or programs. 
They do not want their tax dollars feeding bigger Government. 
They do not want the Government to intrude unjustly into their daily lives. 
They just want to go to work to make a good living, have a decent place to call home, and to have the opportunity to provide for their children. And they want to keep a little bit more of their own money at the end of the day. That is what this package of tax relief will deliver. For my home State of Minnesota, the $500-per-child tax credit at the heart of our legislation adds up to at least $300 million that will stay in the hands of families every year. More than 700,000 middle-class children will benefit. That is what families have told me they want, and that is what we are on the verge of delivering. 
It should not be an occasion to celebrate when politicians actually keep their promises. That is how the process ought to work. But we all know that Washington has gotten pretty good at making promises, but too often fails miserably when it comes time to keep some of those promises. But, today, Congress is delivering on what I consider to be an irrevocable promise we made to the taxpayers 2 1/2 years ago. Send us to Washington, we said, and we will cut your taxes. That is not a political slogan--that was a promise. 
Now, let us not kid ourselves--our package of tax relief is not going to make anybody rich. As tax cuts go, it is pretty paltry. The net tax relief amounts to less than 1 percent of all the tax revenue collected by the Federal Government over the next 5 years. It begins to roll back the President's 1993 tax increase, but we would have to pass a bill three times bigger than the one before us today to wipe out the 1993 increase completely. It is an important start, however, in moving the Government in a new direction. 
Relying on a radical philosophy of faster, better, cheaper, NASA launched the Pathfinder probe and successfully--and dramatically--opened a new era of exploration on Mars. The return on that investment has gone far beyond anything that can be totaled up on a balance sheet. I would like to see the same philosophy of faster, better, cheaper applied to the rest of Washington as well, for a payback I believe can be equally as impressive. A faster government has fewer layers of bureaucracy, so that it can more quickly meet the needs of the people. A better government is responsive to its citizens and responsible to its taxpayers. A cheaper government needs fewer dollars to carry out its work, opening the door to future tax cuts that leave even more money in the hands of the taxpayers. 
Faster, better, cheaper is an idea that worked on Mars. It is an idea that ought to work just as well here on Earth. 
To paraphrase a favorite quote of mine, Mr. President, politics are temporary--but the American family is permanent. Enactment of the $500-per-child tax credit is a great victory for families, one I believe will help bring them together, and hopefully keep them together. I am proud that I can go back home this weekend and tell the working families of my State--who for years have watched their taxes rise and their take-home pay shrink--that Washington finally got the message. We are at last going to cut their taxes, not because it is the politically easy thing to do, but because it is the right thing to do. 
Again, I want to thank and commend the majority leader and my colleagues, the chairmen of the Finance and Budget committees, for having the determination to bring the Taxpayer Relief Act to the floor. This is a great day in the history of the Senate, and it is also a day that I am proud to be a part of. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to give my congratulations to the chairman of the Budget Committee and all the others who have worked so hard over the last couple of weeks to work out an especially very important tax package, which I believe is going to be a step in the right direction of relieving some of the tax burden placed on American families over the last several years. 
So with that, Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the tax relief package that will be coming before the Senate tomorrow. I want to take this opportunity, again, to commend and thank the majority leader, Chairman Domenici, Chairman Roth, and the negotiators for the administration for all of their efforts to bring us to this historic point here today. 
Mr. President, when my good friend Tim Hutchinson and I went to the floor as freshmen members of the House in June 1993 to introduce a budget plan we called Putting Jobs and the American Family First, I could never have guessed the long road we would have to travel to reach the point we find ourselves at today--on the verge of enacting the $500 per-child tax credit that served as the centerpiece of our 1993 legislation. 
Our proposal did not have a lot of support in Washington in 1993, and family tax relief did not even make the radar screen of most lawmakers. But that was not important, because we had support where it mattered the most: with the American taxpayers. In the years since, I have watched the enthusiasm for the $500 per-child tax credit continue to grow until it could no longer be ignored here in Washington. After being embraced by the President and congressional leaders in both parties, 1997 is the year in which the $500 per-child tax credit will finally become law. 
I have been pleased with many of the changes we been able to bring about in our Government during my service in Congress--but the vote we'll take tomorrow on our tax relief plan charts an important new course. This week, we fulfill what I consider to be a fundamental promise we made 2 1/2 years ago to the American taxpayers: that Washington would finally listen to the people and let them keep a little bit more of their own money at the end of the day. 
This legislation is a victory--not for the Senate, or the House, or the President, but for the working families of America. Those are the men and women who go to work every day--and sometimes to a second job at night--in the summer when the heat is horrific and the winter when the car will not start and the snow is piled up to their knees. They put in their 8 hours and often stay for another 3 or 4 for the overtime if they are struggling to save for a new furnace or the kids need braces. They do not ask for much--just to be treated fairly. These are the folks who look at their checkbooks each week and wonder `Where did it all go?'--the same folks who stare at their tax returns each April and ask `How come the government takes so much?' 
Thanks to the $500 per-child tax credit, the Government will be taking a little less on tax day. 
Mr. President, I am pleased with the improved $500 per-child tax credit provision contained in the fiscal year 1998 reconciliation conference agreement. It is a needed improvement over the Senate-passed version, which I voted against in June. 
At that time, I opposed the Senate tax bill because of the way it restricted the use of the $500 per-child tax credit, and in the process, diluted its value. The Senate plan offered a $250 tax credit in 1997 for children under the age of 13, which increased to $500 per-child in 1999. For children age 13 to 16, the tax credit was available only if parents dedicated it toward their children's education. While I fully support the idea of putting away those tax credit dollars for college, I do not believe the Government should mandate exactly how the taxpayers should spend their own money. That is not the place of Congress and the President. 
When I cast my vote against the Senate's tax cut bill in June, it was to send a signal to budget negotiators that we must craft a $500 per-child tax credit that does more for working families. With the recent improvements made by the House and the Senate, it is clear Washington finally got the message--as a result, more families will keep more of their hard-earned tax dollars. 
The $500 per-child tax credit remains the centerpiece of the our tax relief plan. Under the agreement, working families will be provided a $400 per-child credit in 1998, which increases to $500 per-child in 1999 for dependent children below age 17. The credit is phased out for families earning more than $110,000 per year. The result is that the families of 43 million children nationwide will receive more than $70 billion in tax credits over the next 5 years. 
It is the Nation's middle-income families who will benefit most once this provision is enacted. In my State of Minnesota, nearly 700,000 children from middle-class families will be the primary beneficiaries. Those families will see over $300 million in tax relief. That is $300 million that will not go to Washington to fund the priorities of the Federal Government. Instead, families can use that money to fund their own priorities, whether that is groceries, medical expenses, insurance, or education. 
An additional 170,000 Minnesota children will receive the tax credit under this expanded version than would have under President Clinton's plan. 
Another notable improvement is that the agreement broadens the child tax credit to low-income families. 
When Senators Hutchinson, Coats, and I introduced our most recent version of the child tax relief legislation earlier this year, we urged Congress to provide immediate tax relief to families effective in 1997, provide it to as many families with children under age 18 as it possibly can, regardless of their income, and make it available against all taxes paid by workers, including payroll taxes. I am pleased the agreement adopted our proposal and offset this tax relief by tightening the earned income tax credit. 
For a typical family of four, the $500 per-child tax credit means $1,000 in tax relief, which would pay 1 month's mortgage and grocery bills, or 11 months' worth of electric bills, or nearly 20 months' worth of clothing for the children. 
More significantly, the $500 per-child tax credit will reverse a 16-year tide of rising Federal taxes to finally reduce a family's total Federal income tax burden. This is the first tax cut in 16 years, but, in the meantime, there have been 10 tax increases in that 16 years. This begins to reverse the tide. 
For a family of four earning $30,000 per year, $1,000 in tax relief would cut their income tax burden by 51 percent. Meanwhile, a family of four earning $40,000 would see their tax burden cut by 30 percent, a family earning $75,000 would see their tax burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family earning $100,000 per year would receive a tax cut of 7.4 percent. 
This tax relief will restore some fairness for the taxpayers of my State. Over the past several decades, the Federal tax load on Minnesota residents has grown larger and larger while their share of Federal spending has gotten smaller and smaller. Minnesotans last year paid an average of $5,563 per person in taxes to the Federal Government, $203 more than the national average. But Minnesota received back only 78 cents in Federal spending for every $1 its taxpayers sent to Washington, among the lowest return of any State. This regional disparity is an additional financial burden to Minnesota residents. 
Mr. President, I also applaud the inclusion in the agreement of important pro-economic-growth and pro-prosperity tax provisions such as capital gains relief and estate tax reduction. Although these tax cuts are rather small and hardly keep pace with inflation, it is nonetheless a move in the right direction. These tax cuts will spur job creation and economic growth. In doing so, they will reduce the cost of capital, increase worker productivity, and provide higher salaries for the American people. 
However, I believe Congress could have done much more in the way of tax relief for working Americans if Washington would just spend less and allow working families to keep more of their hard-earned money. 
I personally would prefer a full and immediate $500 per-child tax credit for all families with children under 18 without any restrictions, zero capital gains tax, elimination of the death tax, and ending double taxation. But those battles will have to wait for another day. 
My greatest disappointment with the tax deal is that it contains no real tax reform. Instead of simplifying the Tax Code, this tax bill increases its complexity. Tax policy is still used as a tool for the redistribution of private incomes and for social engineering. Nothing is done to end the IRS as we know it. Unfortunately, these defects greatly diminish the positive impacts of the tax bill. I pledge to continue to work with my colleagues on real tax reform in the future. 
Although the tax relief in the improved bill is still tiny when compared against both the total tax burden of the American taxpayers and total Government spending, it is the first time in 16 years that the Government has acknowledged that working families are being heavily overtaxed. That is reason enough to celebrate. 
Mr. President, ever since the people of Minnesota sent me to represent them in Congress--first in the House and now in the Senate--Americans have been writing me to share their dreams for themselves and for their nation. 
Their letters fill dozens of files in my office. Some of the most passionate stories have come from families--working families who heard that I had proposed a $500 per child tax credit and wanted to tell me what a difference such a seemingly simple piece of legislation would make in their lives. 
I would like to share just a few of their letters. A family in Illinois wrote:  
We are a one-paycheck family struggling to keep our heads above water . . . It is encouraging to know there are members of the government who understand our struggle and are working on our behalf. 
`Thank you for your efforts in trying to help families receive a tax credit of $500 per child,' wrote another family, this one from Texas. `As parents of three children, we truly appreciate your endeavors in a time when other politicians are trying to get more and more of our hard-earned money.' 
From Michigan came this letter: 
There are not very many people in Washington who remember the pro-family community--and even fewer in Washington who will support the family. 
And a family in my own State of Minnesota sent me this heartfelt letter: 
As the mother of seven children with one income, I am especially interested in the $500 per child tax credit. We refuse to accept aid from federal or state programs that we qualify for. 
We believe this country was built with hard work and sacrifice, not sympathy and handouts. We also believe that we can spend this money more effectively than the government, which has only succeeded in creating a permanent dependent welfare class with our money over the last 40 years. Let us get back to basics. 
Let us get back to basics. 
I think `getting back to basics' is what this debate is all about, Mr. President. The American family has always been our Nation's most basic level of government. The power begins with the family and it ought to remain with the family at the end of the day. By enacting the $500 per child tax credit into law, Congress and the President will at last send a message to real Americans--the folks outside the confines of this Capitol--that we understand what it means to be a working family in the 1990's, that we know government demands too much while delivering too little, and that we can put aside the politics that too often divide us and do what is right by the American taxpayers. 
Mr. President, the $500 per child tax credit is not going to make anybody rich, but we cannot measure its value in just dollars and cents. After 16 years without a drop of tax relief, we are finally going to let the taxpayers keep a little bit more of their own money at the end of the day. From the vantage point of this Senator, that is a priceless investment in the American family. 
Again, after 4 years of hard work to bring about at least this portion of the tax bill, which has been called `the crown jewel,' we are going to finally succeed in giving the American family some hard-earned tax relief. 
Thank you, very much, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to commend the members of the Subcommittee on VA/HUD Appropriations for their work to provide adequate benefits to veterans. In a letter to the Chairman, I urged the subcommittee to support a level of spending that adequately funded veterans' benefits in rightful recognition of their efforts to defend our country in war. I am pleased to learn that the VA will get a full appropriation which shows a total budget increase of $222.6 million above last year and $92.9 million above the President's request. 
I also applaud their foresight in voting $68 million additional funding over the President's request for the medical care account. The high priority which the subcommittee placed on this area reflects the heightened concern the country feels for providing appropriate health care to those who have served us so well. 
The mandatory spending has also been increased by $1.26 billion over last year for pensions and compensation. 
Mr. President, I am pleased that the subcommittee has included a provision which will allow the VA to retain third-party collections, which I have long supported, in addition to the regular appropriation. This additional estimated $604 million will be retained by the VA medical centers giving the care. This will provide much needed additional revenue which should allow the centers to treat more veterans. It will also provide an incentive to improve health care for more veterans at each of the 171 facilities throughout the country. 
The committee report supports the restructuring efforts of the Veterans Health Administration; I will be interested to see the results of this effort over the next 5 years as this, too, will improve health care for our veterans. I also share the subcommittee's concerns that the VA has yet to develop a nationwide plan for community-based outpatient clinics to ensure equitable access to medical care nationwide. We will be seeing great changes at the VA in the next few years that will make it a more streamlined and improved provider of services to veterans. 
Again, I thank my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their efforts to help America's veterans.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning after hearing some of my colleagues earlier talking and debating about the proposed tax cuts that is now in conference. The question is always: Who qualifies for the tax cut? How much is that tax cut going to be? Who is going to receive what share of that tax cut? 
I would like to start out by saying that it is kind of ironic to hear some on the floor arguing about these tax cut packages because these are the same individuals who, along with President Clinton, just 4 years ago were on this floor arguing for the largest tax increase on Americans in history. 
When we look at this major tax increase of just 4 years ago, I would like to relate to the comments made by the minority leader, the Senator from South Dakota, earlier this week when he argued that the $77 billion tax cut was not fair. That is what we have heard here this morning on the floor--it is not fair. While I don't believe it was fair in 1993 to raise the largest tax increase in history on Americans, they say, `Well, it was only aimed at the rich.' But let me tell you. 
Let me remind my colleagues what happened in 1993. After campaigning on middle-class tax relief in 1993, President Clinton turned around and then raised taxes by $263 billion, again making that the largest tax increase in history. But he said it was only for the rich. But everybody paid more, including $114 billion in new income taxes, $24 billion in new gasoline taxes, $35 billion in new business taxes, and $30 billion in new payroll taxes. Then you add on top of that nearly $25 billion more in Social Security taxes. In other words, if you work, if you are retired, if you drove a car, if you owned a business, or if you paid any kind of income tax, you paid for the 1993 income tax increase. 
I heard also this morning that what we are talking about today in this tax package is that about $77 billion so far of net tax relief is `substantial' tax relief. Well, when you get back only $1 on every $4 that was raised in 1993, I don't call this `substantial.' This is a meager tax package that we are talking about. The reason that it is not fair, in my opinion, is because there is not enough in this tax package to go around. 
It does not take a mathematician also to calculate that if taxes raised were $263 billion 4 years ago and you get $77 billion back now, that is not a good deal. If you look at since the tax reduction that everybody blames for the deficits, and that is the Ronald Reagan tax cut in 1981, they say since that tax cut it has resulted in all these deficits: We have these deficits today because of the Ronald Reagan tax cut. In fact, we have had 10 tax increases since 1981--10, over $850 billion in new tax increases since 1981. And now we are talking about $77 billion. This is less than $1 on every $10 of tax increases over the last 10 years. 
We also hear about, well, who is going to be getting these tax breaks? The top 20 percent, they say, are going to get over 60 percent of the tax cut. And as we just heard the Senator from Texas say, the top 20 percent of wage earners in this country, which is $60,000 and over--and most people do not consider making $60,000 rich, but they pay 80 percent of income taxes in this country today. 
I also heard about a couple of instances--and I did not have time this morning to bring to the floor pictures of families, but let me read a couple that were mentioned here today. They showed pictures of a young family making about $25,000 a year, and they said under the Republican tax plan they were going to get no tax cut this year. But for that family making $25,000 a year, they pay total, with two children, about $3,000 in income taxes and payroll taxes, but they receive $1,100 in EITC. EITC, that is earned income tax credit, an earned income tax credit that was passed in 1986, increased in 1993. So this family making $25,000 a year does receive a tax refund, a tax refund of $1,100, not zero but $1,100. 
What they want to do is to add to that. Now, I will talk about that later. They also spoke about and had the pictures of a young family making $20,000 a year, and they said, under the Republican plan, they would get no tax refunds this year. But in fact that family making $20,000 a year will pay this year about $1,800 in payroll and income taxes, but they will receive a refund under EITC of over $2,150. So that family, granted, a hard-working middle-class family, but they are receiving some tax relief under the current system. 
Let us go to the family making $31,000 a year. Say the husband is making $9 an hour, the wife $6, or vice versa, they are working 40 hours a week trying to raise a family of two children, have to pay child care, et cetera. And what does this family get? They are going to pay this year about $4,300 in payroll and income taxes and they receive zero under EITC. Now, those two children will not get, under this plan, any tax relief if they are 13 or 14 years old. So who is not getting the relief here? 
And when they talk about making it fair, we do want to make this fair, but we want to make sure that those families making $31,000 to $60,000 a year are also going to join and also receive some kind of tax relief today. 
Now, I would like to see every family get a $500 per child tax credit refund. That would be great. But if we are going to talk about fairness what we are going to have to do is make this pie larger. The $77 billion is not enough to make sure that all families will enjoy some kind of tax relief. Now, if we want to start talking about class warfare, and that is what we hear in the Chamber all the time, that is, we are going to give it to the rich but not the poor, that is not true. We want to make sure that all families are going to get some kind of tax relief. 
So along with the tax relief already in the system under the earned income credit, we also need to expand that so other working families also are going to receive some kind of tax relief this year. Everybody needs to share, not only the low income but also middle-income working families. If my colleagues are serious, let us enlarge the tax cut. 
When we talk about the $77 billion that is in this package, if you want to spread that over what this economy is going to generate over the next 5 years, a $7 or $8 trillion a year economy and we are saying, well, we are going to have this substantial tax package, it would be comparable to looking for a new car and the car dealer said, well, this is the sticker price, but I am going to take a penny off from that and I am going to make you a real deal on this car. 
That is exactly about what the $77 billion is equal to when you put it into context of what this economy is going to do over the next 5 years. You are going to get a penny back on the purchase of a new car. So what makes the entire debate over what is fair and equitable in this tax relief package so ridiculous is that Washington is not willing to give up more of the money. 
So I just wanted to come to the floor and talk a little bit about how we do not want to make this a class warfare issue, that we want to make sure all Americans receive some kind of tax relief. And again, as I said, since 1981, American families have seen their taxes go up 10 times--$850 billion in new tax increases in the last 16 years. Now we are talking about tax relief, and we want to make sure that tax relief is fair and it is broad based, and that those families making between $30,000 
and $60,000 a year will also have an opportunity to share in some reduction in their tax burden. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, tonight I am pleased that an amendment by Senator Feingold and I, which we intended to offer, has now been accepted in modified form. 
Because this issue is so important to my State, I wanted to take some time to briefly review why I offered the amendment and why this amendment is requiring a study of the Northeast Dairy Compact. 
My amendment is straightforward and is noncontroversial. It simply requires the Secretary of Agriculture to study and report the economic impacts of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. 
The focus of this amendment is to examine the impact of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact on food nutrition programs and on the entire Nation's dairy industry. 
This amendment will help protect senior citizens, children, and the most needy among us. 
This amendment helps all who rely on food stamps, the School Lunch Program, the Summer Food Service Program, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, the Special Milk Program, the School Breakfast Program, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, as well as dairy producers in 44 States. 
Joining me in offering this amendment are Senators Feingold, Thomas, Kohl, Levin, Wellstone, DeWine, and Craig. 
As many of my colleagues may know, on July 1, 1997, the Compact became effective in a six-State region in New England giving producers there an arbitrary, fixed price for their milk--nearly $17 per hundredweight. 
Unfortunately, few of us know exactly what this will mean for consumers in that region, particularly the poor; for the cost of delivering food nutrition assistance by Federal, State, and local governments; and for dairy producers in 44 other States, including my producers in Minnesota, who receive far, far less for their milk than their New England counterparts. 
We are not sure of the Compact's impact, in large part, because there has been so little light shed on it. It became law attached in a conference committee. The Compact has always seemed to travel under a cloud with no justification for its existence. 
For example, in the 103d Congress, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a business meeting to consider the Compact--without the benefit of a single hearing--and reported the Compact to the floor. The Senate never considered it.

Mr. GRAMS. This technical amendment, which I offer with Senator Wellstone, simply provides that if a producer decides to grow wild rice on acres on which he receives Agricultural Market Transition Act [AMTA] payments, that producer's AMTA payment will be reduced on those acres. 
This amendment ensures that wild rice producers, who do not receive any kind of program payment, do not have to compete against producers who unfairly grow wild rice plus collect farm payments on the same acreage. In short, it ensures fairness by prohibiting double dipping and keeps producers on an equal playing field. 
USDA once believed that the substance of this amendment could be accomplished through regulation but later indicated that legislation is necessary. 
This same amendment was approved during consideration of last year's Agriculture appropriations on a voice vote but was removed during conference with other provisions for reasons unrelated to the substance of the amendment. 
I understand the amendment I offer has been approved by the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senators Lugar and Harkin. I want to thank each of them for their assistance in this regard. 
I also understand that this amendment has been accepted by the chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Senators Cochran and Bumpers. 
Accordingly, I would ask the chairman to accept this amendment I offer today with Senator Wellstone.

Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I would like to speak a little bit tonight about taxes and the big controversy over tax cuts--and not only over tax cuts themselves but who qualifies for these tax cuts--what is fair, what is not fair. And really the basic bottom line is there is not enough money in the pot for the tax cuts that Americans need. 
Madam President, as negotiators from the House and Senate meet with administration officials to hammer out a tax package, I rise today to be the voice for the millions of Americans who no longer seem to be heard here in Washington: the Nation's hard-working, overtaxed, middle-class families. 
And I want to ask my colleagues, is there no shame in Washington? 
Madam President, I read the comments made by the minority leader this morning, arguing that the $77 billion tax cut bill `is not fair.' 
I have to say that I agree with the Senator from South Dakota. Any bill that cuts taxes by just $77 billion is not only unfair--it's an outrage. 
Let me remind my colleagues what happened in 1993. 
In 1993, after campaigning on middle-class tax relief, President Clinton turned around and raised taxes on working Americans by $263 billion--making his the largest tax increase in the history of this Nation. Everybody paid more, including: $114.8 billion in new income taxes, $24 billion in additional gas taxes, $34.9 billion in business taxes, $29 billion in payroll taxes, and $24.6 billion in new Social Security taxes. 
In other words, if you worked, were retired, drove a car, owned a business, or paid income taxes, you paid for the President's 1993 tax increase. 
Although it was billed as nothing more than a tax increase only on the rich, but using this funny calculation called FEI--or family economic income--the President was able to say only those who worked were rich and, therefore, needed to pay more in taxes. 
So today President Clinton--again, the same President who in 1993 raised taxes on the American people by $263 billion, and also, by the way, Madam President, vetoed two Republican bills to cut taxes for Americans--now considers himself to be a champion of the middle class because he now wants to cut taxes by a measly $77 billion, and only allowing the majority of those tax reductions if Americans--this is like your children--if Americans, the people who get up every day, go to work to earn this money, now, if they only will do what they are told. And that is to `be seen, not heard.' That seems to be the philosophy that we use out of Washington today. And, what is worse, both the House and the Senate are ready to go along with it. 
Again, the question has to be: Is there no shame in Washington? 
It doesn't take a math wizard to calculate that if the taxpayers had their taxes hiked by $263 billion 4 years ago, and will only get back $77 billion in so-called `tax relief' under the plan being crafted as we speak--the American taxpayers are still $186 billion in the hole to the Federal Government in new taxes in just the last 4 years. 
And the men and women--the working families who have paid dearly for that tax increase every day since--are supposed to thank Congress and the President for this mere pittance of a tax cut? 
Is there no shame in Washington? 
Madam President, since the last meaningful tax cuts were signed into law by President Reagan in 1981, Washington has raised taxes on 10 occasions--10 different times tax increases have been imposed on Americans, and always with the caveat if we can only raise taxes again one more time we are going to be able to get our budget under control. 
Every time the Washington politicians have wanted to spend more money, so they could brag to the folks back home, Look what I did for you. 
But I need to raise your taxes in order for you to pat me on the back for all those projects that I am going to do for you back home. But they have raised taxes on working families 10 times. They have done that. 
You hear this complaint on the floor many times, `Oh, that tax cut that we had back in 1981 led to all these deficits that we have today.' If you put that in real technical economic terms, you could say that is a bunch of hooey. It has not raised the deficit. It has been Congress not controlling the spending that has raised the deficit. 
The $77 billion now slated for tax relief amounts to barely one-tenth of the amount that taxes were raised in the great tax hikes of 1990 and 1993. 
You know, this little tax cut that we are talking about--$77 billion over 5 years in a $7-plus trillion annual economy in this country--this little tax cut would actually be like a car dealer taking one penny off the price of a new car and bragging to the buyer that, Boy, I am giving you a great deal. That is what Congress is doing. They are saying, We are going to knock a penny off the price of this new car for you, and you had better come out to Washington and thank us for allowing you to keep some of the money that you have worked for. 
With a track record like that, I am afraid the Congress and the President have a long way to go before they can claim true victory on behalf of the American taxpayer. 
Again, they said that the 1981 tax cut led to all of these deficits. If that was the problem, wouldn't you think that the 10 tax increases over the last 16 years would have solved that problem? No. No, that hasn't done it. 
I have seen enough of the way Washington works to know that if we eliminated the tax cuts from this budget entirely--if we could take the advice of some on the floor here and say, We don't need any tax cuts at all, we can't afford any tax cuts, we have to save this $77 billion, we can't let Americans keep any more of the money they make--that $77 billion would never be dedicated to deficit reduction. The politicians would spend it faster than you can say reelection, and they would spend it on more Government programs and more pork. It certainly would not go toward reducing the deficit and giving our children and grandchildren a debt-free future. If you want evidence, you can just ask yourself: What happened to that $225 billion that was miraculously found just before the budget deal was put together a couple of months ago? It all went to spending. Nothing went to tax relief. Nothing went to deficit reduction. 
So to say that if we could give up this tax package now of tax relief that somehow it would go to deficit reduction, the record doesn't show that. 
I guarantee you that the more we allow Washington to keep, the more Washington will spend. And that is what makes the entire debate over what is fair and what is equitable in this tax relief package so ridiculous. Washington is not willing to give up dollars, and it is not willing to give up the power that those dollars represent to the taxpayers. Therefore, a $77 billion tax cut will never be fair, and it will never be equitable because the pie can never be cut into enough pieces to give a fair slice to everyone. The pie is just simply too small. And once it is divvied up, working families will be left with little more than crumbs. 
Clearly, Madam President, there is no shame in Washington. It is absurd to expect the American taxpayers to fall on their knees to Washington in thanks for a tax relief plan that offers them dollars that were rightfully theirs to begin with. 
Again, giving $10 and getting $1 back I do not think is fair. It is not equity. If my colleagues want to talk about tax fairness, we can do it. Let us repeal the 1993 tax increase on our senior citizens--$24.6 billion. If my colleagues want to talk about tax fairness, repeal the 1993 tax increase on motorists--that is $25 billion. If my colleagues want to talk about tax fairness, repeal the 1993 tax increase on working families. If we could do even a part of that, only then will this Congress and this President have the credibility to discuss meaningful tax relief for America's working families. Until then, Madam President, it has been just a lot of empty talk. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today Senator Moseley-Braun and I are introducing the Efficient Currency Act of 1997. The bill calls for a newly designated, golden-colored $1 coin to replace the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin. 
The argument for a $1 coin is simple: it saves money. According to estimates of the General Accounting Office and the Federal Reserve, replacing the $1 bill with a coin saves the Government $2.28 billion during the first 5 years it circulates. As we consider plans to balance the budget and eliminate Government waste, I believe that carrying a $1 coin along with $2 bills is a relatively painless option compared to the alternatives of raising taxes or cutting important programs. 
A public opinion poll conducted in May 1997 reveals that 58 percent of the American public favors replacing the $1 bill with a coin when informed that such a change would save the Government $456 million annually. 
I want to stress that the Efficiency Currency Act of 1997 does not call for a phase out of the $1 bill until 1 billion $1 coins authorized under this legislation are in circulation. If the public rejects the new coin, the phase-out will not occur. 
Unless this legislation is approved in the near future, the U.S. Mint will begin the process of minting more of the unpopular Susan B. Anthony coins by 1999. The supply of Anthony coins in Government inventories fell by a total of 137 million coins in 1995 and 1996. Only 146 million remains as of May 30. The inventory has been falling at the rate of about 5 million per month, because Anthony dollars are used at hundreds of vending locations, by more than a dozen major transit systems, and by the U.S. Postal Service. Contrary to reports by opponents of the dollar coin, the U.S. Postal Service has no plans to discontinue the use of the Anthony dollar in their self-service operations. The timeframe for a decision by Congress is short, because the U.S. Mint has stated that it needs 30 months to design and fabricate a new $1 coin. 
I think one of the most compelling reasons to replace a $1 bill with a $1 coin is the cost savings. First, the Treasury Department will save money. A $1 coin lasts about 30 years while costing about 8 cents. A $1 bill is significantly more expensive, as it lasts only 1 year and 1 month at a cost of 4 cents per bill. 
Second, the private sector will save money. A $1 coin is easier to process than a $1 bill. Paper money received on buses must be hand-straightened at a cost of over $20 per 1,000, or about 2 cents for each dollar. Coins can be processed for less than one-tenth of the cost. The change to a $1 coin is estimated to save the mass transit industry $124 million annually. 
Furthermore, vending operators could avoid placing dollar bill acceptors, which cost between $300 and $400 each, on each vending machine. The additional cost of these machines eventually must be passed on to customers. In addition, bill acceptors frequently do not work and are more expensive to maintain than coin mechanisms. 
Another benefit is that many consumers will actually have less, not more, change in their pocket. Instead of having to use 4, 8, or 12 quarters to pay for mass transit, parking meters, phone calls, and car washes, they will use dollar coins weighing a fraction the weight of many quarters. 
The visually impaired support the introduction of a $1 coin because the $1 bill can be confused with bills of higher denominations. A useable $2 coin will permit them to complete small transactions without ever having to use paper money. 
This legislation is called the Efficiency Currency Act because passage would bring efficiencies to the private sector as well as to Government. This commonsense approach to modernizing our currency is not an original idea. In fact, the United States is the only major industrialized country that does not have high denomination coins. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both a copy of the Efficient Currency Act of 1997 and a summary of its contents be entered into the Record.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I understand that there is a lot of concern in this body about United States computer sales being diverted for military use to either China or Russia. None of us wants that to occur. But we have to consider whether the Cochran amendment solves the problem. I believe that it does not. 
The Cochran amendment would require export licenses for all midlevel computers. Now, these are not supercomputers, these are not high-end computers. You are going to hear that term, but they are not supercomputers. These are midlevel computers, and they are shipped to China, Russia, Israel, and 47 other countries. We talk about the Third Tier countries. They involve 51 nations, like Russia, China, India, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Romania, and the Baltic States. Some of our future NATO Allies could also be involved. Mr. President, export licenses do not solve end-user problems. These are diversions that would not have been caught during the export license procedure. Export licenses do require end-user certification, but if the end user chooses to ignore the agreement, or if the computer is stolen, that possibility will not be evident in the licensing process. In my judgment, the current system works. 
Just yesterday, Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen sent us a letter opposing the Cochran amendment. He said the current law and system can deal with unauthorized exports and diversions. This is from the department that has been very conservative on all export decontrol matters. Secretary Cohen further states that we should focus our controls on technology that can make a national security difference, not that which is widely available around the world and is obsolete. 
Yes, Mr. President, there have been three diversions, but that was out of 1,400 sales. But, no, this is not the right way to address those problems. The right way is to force the administration to publish as many military end users as possible and then to work with the industry to identify all military end users. We have been able to identify diversions through our capable intelligence sources. Mr. President, there is no evidence that there are dozens of computers out there used by military end users. It is just not there. 
Further, I don't believe that the industry irresponsibly ignores available information about military end users. They have too much at stake. A company which violates export control laws takes a very big risk. The penalties are prohibition of all exports for 20 years or more, 10 years in prison, and up to a $5,000 fine for each violation. This doesn't include the blemish that would remain on the company's reputation or the great difficulty that company would have in the future seeking an export license. No company, Mr. President, can afford that risk. 
What we would be doing here this morning is handing this midlevel computer business over to the Japanese and other allies. Now, again, I want to emphasize that these are midlevel computers, they are not supercomputers. Next year, they will be the kind of systems that we will be able to have in our offices here in the Senate, or what you could find in a small company or in a doctor's office. These are not the computers that are sought after for nuclear weapons production or design. Again, we are looking at midlevel computers, between 2,000 and 7,000 MTOPS, which are widely available around the world. 
Supercomputers, which are sought after for weapons design, start at the 20,000 MTOPS level and go all the way up to 650,000 this year, and they will go beyond the 1 million MTOPS level next year. By the way, China already produces a computer at 13,000 MTOPS. No other country considers these computers to be anything but generally available and will step in to take over the business that the Cochran amendment will hand to them. The question is, is that what we want? 
Also, anyone can purchase upgrades, by the way, to raise a PC, a current PC, above the 2,000 MTOPS level. We can't control the box. We can't control the chips around the world that can be put in it. We can't control the upgrades. There is no way to control these low-level PC's under the 2,000 MTOPS threshold, again, since they are available in nearly every country in the world. 
Further, the chips that make up these computers are also available and produced around the world. They were decontrolled during the Bush administration. Our chip producers have markets throughout the world, and they need to maintain them to remain competitive. Chip producers cannot control who receives their end product. 
Also, how do you prohibit a foreign national from using a computer even above the 7,000 level here in the United States and taking the results back, or faxing it back? 
Our friend Jack Kemp has written to us also this week stating that the Cochran amendment would `establish a policy that is destined to fail and would hurt American computer manufacturers without protecting our national security. The American high-technology sector is critical to the future of this country and must be protected from overly intrusive Government restrictions.' 
I wish there was something we could do to effectively 
control some of these exports, but it is just not possible at these lower levels. We cannot convince our allies to reverse 2 years of their own decontrol. In fact, Europe has tabled a decontrol proposal at 10,000 MTOPS, which proves that they have no intention of even respecting our 7,000 level. We cannot pull all the PC's and upgrades off the retail shelves, and we cannot close our borders to prevent all foreign nationals from entering this country and using our computers. 
We must concentrate our resources on keeping computers above the 7,000 level from reaching military end users; that's for sure. But I fear that an increased license burden in the administration would steer resources away from efforts to locate diversions and investigate them. 
Now, Mr. President, in an earlier statement, I also countered a claim that an export license requirement would not slow down these computer sales. I have heard that someone made the comment that an export license would take 10 days. Well, anyone who knows how the licensing process works knows that it can take many, many months to obtain one. This will only earn our industry a reputation as an unreliable supplier, and it will cost us sales and it will cost us many, many U.S. jobs. The administration admits that a computer license application averages 107 days to reach a decision. I have seen it take far longer. Even 107 days, by the way, is enough to convince the end user to go out and seek a buyer in another country. 
Since so many of the Tier 3 countries are emerging markets, we need to be in there early to maintain a foothold for future sales. When we hear about the 6.3 percent of sales to Tier 3 countries, that is misleading. It is in an area where the market is expanding rapidly. If we leave our companies out of those markets, they will not be there to compete in the future. They will not be there to provide sales and jobs for the United States. 
Another argument I have heard is that there is no foreign availability over 3,500 MTOPS. Well, last year, NEC of Japan tried to sell a supercomputer to the United States Government at a level between 30,000 and 50,000 MTOPS. They match our speeds all the way to the top. 
Mr. President, I believe that all of us are proud of our computer industry, that our industry remains the state of the art in so many areas, particularly in the levels above 7,000. We have made progress to facilitate exports without compromising our national security, progress which began back in the Reagan and Bush administrations, but here is an effort today to reverse all of that progress. 
Our industry has to survive on exports, and it has to pursue commercial business with these 50 countries to remain competitive. All computer sales over the 7,000 MTOPS level do require license now. We have not sold any computers above that level. And, again, the 7,000 MTOPS are not supercomputers--they are not--they are midlevel computers. We have not sold any computers above that level to Tier 3 countries; nor do our allies, to my knowledge. However, we should not restrict the sales of these midlevel and, again, generally available computers to commercial end users. We should simply maintain the current licensing requirement for the questionable end users. I firmly believe that there will be improved cooperation between the Government and industry on end-user information, particularly those for Russia and China. 
Now, I also commend the Commerce Department for starting to publish information on end users and to examine all sales that are made to the Tier 3 countries within these computer speeds. 
The Grams-Boxer amendment requests the GAO to determine whether these sales affect our national security. That is very important. It will look into the issue of foreign availability. It will also require the publication of a military end-user list, and it requires Commerce to improve its assistance to the industry on identifying those military end users. 
There will be some that vote today solely to express their dissatisfaction with China's alleged military sales to our adversaries. Let me remind you once again that there is no evidence that U.S. computers were involved in any of those cases. I also urge you to look at the merits of this issue. Pure and simple, the Cochran amendment would hand the sales of midlevel computers over to the Japanese and the Europeans at the expense of an industry that we have sought to protect and to promote and an industry that we are proud of. 
As chairman of the International Finance Subcommittee of Banking, the committee that has jurisdiction over this issue, I strongly, this morning, urge my colleagues to vote for my substitute and let us continue this debate in the normal manner, through committee consideration. At the same time, the administration should step up its efforts to express to the Chinese and the Russians our grave concerns regarding efforts to divert commercial sales to military end users without knowledge of the United States seller. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of my colleague from Mississippi to address these diversions. I want to work with him in my role as chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction to ensure that the current system does work or on 
how we can improve it once we have better information regarding the extent of the problem. 
I urge the support of my colleagues for the Grams-Boxer substitute as a compromise to this very, very controversial issue. Thank you very much.  
Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

I want to say our friend and colleague from Mississippi has a well-intended amendment, but it is aimed at the wrong level. These are not supercomputers, as they continue to try to say. These are midlevel computers. If you are talking supercomputer, a low-end supercomputer starts at 20,000 MTOPS and goes now to 650,000, and next year it will be over a million; so these are not supercomputers.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, in wrapping up the debate this morning, I want to, again, say that I believe the controls we have in place are working. We are taking a step backward if we approve the Cochran-Durbin amendment. The rest of the world is moving forward very fast. Anybody who has bought a computer in the last 2 years knows that technology has already passed them, and they have to look at a new system. But between the 2,000 and the 7,000 MTOPS level, computers are going to become so commonplace that any commercial industry or any office in this country will be able to buy them next year. These are well intended controls but, again, as I say, placed on the wrong levels. These are not supercomputers. These are not computers that countries would be looking for military end use. These 
are computers that are more for business and office use. I believe that putting any kind of restrictions or recontrolling these would be a step backward in our efforts to provide jobs and assistance. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. 
Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, Washington has undergone a remarkable transformation since the people of Minnesota first sent me here in 1993. Back then, no one was talking about tax relief. Certainly no one was talking about family tax relief. And with both the White House and Congress under Democratic control, the chances were slim that we would ever have an opportunity to give working Americans the tax relief they so desperately need. 
My good friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, and I were freshman Members of the House in 1993 when we came together to develop a budget proposal that could serve as the taxpayers' alternative to the higher taxes and bigger government plan offered by President Clinton. The key component of our legislation at that time was family tax relief, and that was through the $500-per-child tax credit. 
We were able to convince the House and the Senate leadership to make our families-first bill--with the $500-per-child tax credit as its centerpiece--the Republican budget alternative back in 1994. 
That November it became known as the crown jewel of the Contract With America. The Washington crowd was finally beginning to listen to the people and to talk about tax relief. In 1995, the $500-per-child tax credit seemed certain to finally be passed into law, with a Republican congressional majority and a President who had campaigned at that time on family tax relief. Unfortunately, however, it never made it past the President's desk. 
In 1996, the voters again asked us to enact the taxpayers' agenda, but this time they wanted Congress and the President to come together to complete the work that we started in the 104th Congress. So this May, both President Clinton and the congressional leadership agreed on a number of tax-cutting measures built around the $500-per-child tax credit. The House and Senate passed them in a reconciliation package just before the Fourth of July recess. 
Mr. President, working families need tax relief today more than ever, and Minnesotans have asked me to make it a top priority because taxes dominate the family budget. In fact, a survey just released in Minnesota last week showed that the main concern of Minnesota families was taxes. 
Now, you factor in State and local taxes and also those hidden taxes that result from the high cost of Government regulation, and a family today gives up more than 50 percent--50 percent--of its annual income to the Government. 
So all we are saying is let us allow the working people of this Nation to keep a little bit more of their own money in their pockets. 
It is hard to believe that there are some who say we are offering too much in the way of tax relief in our Senate budget plan, and that is just plain wrong. Working families are not getting nearly the amount of tax relief we promised them. 
Over the next 5 years, as we know, the Federal Government will take in about $8.7 trillion in taxes from the American people. What we are asking in this bill is just that 1 cent of every dollar the Government plans to take from the taxpayer be left in their hands. 
That is what the $500-per-child tax credit and other tax cuts are all about, and that is making sure that a penny earned by working Americans would be a penny kept. 
Unfortunately, by imposing severe restrictions on who can receive it, the $500-per-child tax credit proposal passed by the Senate falls still well short of delivering meaningful tax relief to working families that are trying to raise children. 
The $500-per-child tax credit that I introduced originally says families are eligible for the credit as long as their children are under the age of 18. The bill passed by the Senate, however, cuts the tax credit once a child reaches the age of 13. If your children are between the ages of 13 and 16, the Senate bill says we will give you a tax credit but only if you spend it the way Washington thinks it should be spent. In this case, it would have to be spent on education. 
I applaud the parents who take the $500-per-child tax credit and dedicate it to their child's college education fund, but that is a decision that belongs with parents, not with Washington. 
It is not our place to tell families what they can and what they cannot do with their own money. Some may elect to spend that $500 on braces for their child or groceries or maybe health insurance, and that is fine because it is their money. An unrestricted $500-per-child tax credit takes the power out of the hands of Washington's big spenders, and it would put it back where it could do the most good, and that is with families. 
The second unreasonable restriction in the Senate bill was to deny the child tax credit to families with children at the age of 17. According to the Agriculture Department, this age group is the most expensive one in the typical middle-income household, and it makes no sense to cut off the tax relief just when working families need it most. 
The hard-working families of Minnesota and the Nation have been waiting far too long since Congress last cut their taxes--16 years ago. And we have yet to prove to them that we understand and, more importantly, we appreciate the hardships they face every day. I know we cannot increase the level of tax relief we are offering in the fiscal 1998 budget, but I urge my colleagues, the conferees, to take whatever steps they can to repair the $500-per-child tax credit so that it benefits the maximum number of Americans. 
This debate will be revisited many times in the months ahead and the years ahead, and I look forward to working again with my fellow Senators to finally deliver on the tax relief promise that we made to the people. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the amendment offered by Senator Abraham. After all, if the revenues do increase, it is going to come because of the hard work of the American people. While spending levels on Federal programs have already been set, it only makes sense, if the revenues increase, they should go either to tax relief to those hard-working American families or to deficit reduction. They should not go to enlarge the size of Government. The era of big Government is far from over. This amendment would help protect future taxpayers.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Roth for the great leadership he has demonstrated in bringing this legislation before us. And I commend Senator Gramm for this amendment tonight. 
My good friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Tim Hutchinson, and I were freshman Members of the House in 1993 when we came together with Senator Coats of Indiana to develop a budget proposal called Family First that could serve as the taxpayer's alternative to the higher taxes and bigger Government plan offered by President Clinton. 
The key component of our legislation was family tax relief through a $500 per child tax credit. 
We convinced the House and Senate leadership to make our Families First bill--with the $500 per child tax credit as its centerpiece--the Republican budget alternative in 1994. 
For overtaxed American families, 1997 looks to be the year this long-promised, long-overdue middle-class tax relief is finally delivered. 
As you know, working families today need tax relief more than ever. 
Factor in State and local taxes and the hidden taxes that result from the high cost of Government regulations, and a family today gives up more than 50 percent of its annual income to the Government. So all we are saying is let us let the working people of this Nation keep a little bit more of their own money. 
The $500 per child tax credit proposal in the bill before us goes a long way toward delivering tax relief to working families raising children. However, it imposes restrictions that will significantly dilute the purpose of the child tax credit. 
The legislation before us tells families that, yes, we will give you a tax credit, but if your children are between the ages of 13 and 16, you are going to have to spend it the way Washington thinks it should be spent. In this case, it would have to be spent on education. By mandating how the tax credit must be spent, we are in effect denying it to teenagers, leaving 11 million children out in the cold. 
And if your child is 17 or 18, you do not get it at all. 
Mr. President, I applaud the parents that take the $500 per child tax credit and dedicate it to an IRA or their child's college education. 
But that is a decision that belongs with parents, not with Washington. It is not our place to tell families how they can spend their money. 
The family tax relief provisions in the bill before us can be greatly improved by striking the mandate that the tax credit be dedicated to education. I am pleased to be joining my colleagues in offering this amendment to give that choice back to families. And I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment. 
Thank you, Mr. President.  
Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of some very important Medicare reforms made within the reconciliation package before us. Specifically, I am pleased the committee included reforms to the formula used to determine the reimbursement rate for health plans under the Medicare Program to make it fairer and more equitable for States like Minnesota and other parts of rural America, changes to ensure better access to emergency medical services, and an expansion of Medical Savings Accounts. 
Reform of the Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost formula has been needed for years because the formula has discriminated against seniors who choose to live and retire in rural communities. It has penalized States like Minnesota which are efficient in delivering health care services, and in doing so, discouraged quality health care. Since being elected to the Senate in 1994, I have made restoring fairness and equity to Medicare recipients in Minnesota and other parts of rural America a top priority. 
Mr. President, we are all aware of the fact that the current Medicare reimbursement formula discriminates against Minnesota by giving our State the second-lowest payment rates in the Nation. Not one county in the entire State of Minnesota, or in 15 other States, receives the national average of $467 in AAPCC payment per month. 
Because of these low reimbursement rates, managed care organizations have been discouraged from offering our senior citizens many of the alternative health plans available in other parts of the country, plans which offer additional benefits such as eyeglasses and prescription drugs. Clearly, this is a problem which should have been addressed long ago. 
In February, several of my colleagues and I introduced S. 359, the Medicare Payment Equity Act, which would have established a floor of 80 percent of the national adjusted capitation rate for the year and made the AAPCC formula more equitable by blending the national and county specific percentage. More recently, I cosponsored S. 862, authored by Senator Grassley, which followed the same lines of reform and even more closely resembles what was ultimately passed by the Finance Committee. Under the leadership of Finance Chairman Roth and through the tireless efforts of Senators Thomas, Burns, Grassley, and Roberts, we have succeeded in beginning to fix the Medicare formula to make it fairer for Minnesota's seniors and right some of the wrongs against us. 
The AAPCC reforms contained in the reconciliation bill are a very important step in restoring fairness and providing greater choices for Medicare recipients who live in Minnesota, particularly in rural communities. This truly represents a great victory for Minnesota's senior citizens as we close the longstanding gap of inequity in the Medicare Program. 
Mr. President, this legislation also addresses another important issue in which I have been deeply involved. In January, Senator Graham of Florida and I introduced S. 238, the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act, to establish a reasonable standard for determining Medicare reimbursement for EMS services. Our bill would ensure that EMS providers would be reimbursed based upon a prudent layperson standard, rather than the ultimate diagnosis of a physician. This revised definition will ensure that EMS providers are prepared to meet the challenges facing them as they work to improve their services. 
All of us depend daily on the readiness, efficiency, and immediate response of our emergency medical system. And while many of us take it for granted, we all want it to work well when we need it. Many of the men and women who risk their lives delivering emergency care have told me the system can be improved, yet their desire to improve the services they provide has rarely been recognized by Congress. This provision in the reconciliation bill is the first step in helping EMS providers help themselves become more efficient. I would like to thank Senator Graham for his efforts in the Finance Committee to see that this important issue was included in the package. 
Finally, I would like to thank Chairman Roth for his efforts to include an expansion of Medical Savings Accounts. In developing a Medicare Choice Program modeled on the Federal Employee Health Benefits plan, this will offer, for the first time, a real choice to America's seniors. 
Again, I commend and thank Chairman Roth and his Finance Committee colleagues for including these important changes in the reconciliation spending package.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, when Congress and the President reached agreement on the broad outlines of plan to balance the Federal budget, I had hoped that I could stand before the Senate during debate on the reconciliation legislation and proudly announce my full support. It is with deep regret, Mr. President, that I cannot. After careful examination of S. 947, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, I have come to the conclusion that this legislation is good for Washington but bad for the taxpayers, and because it is not in the best interests of the working Americans we represent, I must reluctantly oppose it. Here are the major grounds on which I base my decision. 
As I have said in previous statements before this Chamber, I have made the pursuit of a balanced budget my top priority in Congress, and have always said that I would support a budget plan that meets three specific criteria: First, it must shrink the size and scope of Government and return money--and the power those dollars represent--to the taxpayers; second, it must balance the budget by the year 2002 with steadily declining deficits each year without the use of rosy economic scenarios; and third, it must provide meaningful, broad-based tax relief to working families. 
Tax relief, of course, will be dealt with in the other half of the reconciliation package. While there are many good provisions included in the bill, this so-call spending reduction legislation still fails to meet those pro-taxpayer standards. 
First and foremost, like the budget agreement on which this reconciliation legislation is based, this bill does not shrink Government and return power to the taxpayers. In fact, it does the opposite; it increases mandatory spending. In the next 5 years, total mandatory spending would increase from $825 billion in 1997 to $1.1 trillion in 2002, a growth of 32 percent. Over the next five years, Medicare will increase at a rate of 6.1 percent and Medicaid will increase nearly 7 percent each year from the inflated baseline. Instead of eliminating wasteful spending to reduce the Federal deficit, this budget plan actually creates numerous new programs, including $34 billion in new entitlement programs funded by the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars. 
In doing so, the plan has erased all of the savings achieved in last year's landmark welfare reform legislation. The reconciliation legislation includes about $24 billion in spending for new children's health care initiatives, while adding back $14.2 billion in welfare benefits for legal aliens and food stamp recipients. 
Under this legislation, the Federal Government will spend $1.2 trillion on welfare alone over the next 5 years. That is $15 billion higher than the CBO projected. Of every dollar collected by the IRS, 14 cents goes to welfare programs, with less than 1 cent dedicated to tax relief for working families. 
The fundamental flaw of the bill and the major source of my opposition to it is the new entitlement programs it creates. Such spending is a serious mistake at a time when we should control the explosive growth of mandatory spending and reduce the size of the Federal Government. History tells us that earlier entitlement programs started small, with perhaps the best of intentions, but have since exploded and now consume about 70 percent of all Federal revenues. To my disappointment, Washington has still not learned its lesson. 
Second, Mr. President, despite some positive changes, including structure changes in Medicare, the entitlement programs remain intact. This not only breaks our promise to the American people on fundamental entitlement restructuring, but also ensures that big Government lives on by allowing Washington to avoid the hard choices it must make to address our long-term fiscal imbalances. 
Without fundamental changes, the imbalance between the Government's entitlement promises and the funds it will have available to pay for them will eventually shatter our economy. In its recent report, `Long-Term Budgetary Pressures and Policy Options,' the Congressional Budget Office warns us that if these long-term budgetary pressures are not relieved, Federal budget deficits would mount and could seriously erode future economic growth. The Federal deficit would increase from 1.4 percent of GDP, or $107 billion today to 30 percent of GDP in 2035, nearly $11 trillion. The debt held by the public would increase from 50 percent of GDP, or $3.9 trillion in 1996 to 250 percent of GDP, $91 trillion in 2035. Such rapid growth of the Federal debt and deficit will bankrupt this great Nation. 
This gloomy picture has been confirmed by the recently released report of the Social Security and Medicare boards of trustees. Without clear changes in public policy to address the financial imbalance, the hospital insurance fund, one of the Medicare trust funds, will be bankrupt in just 4 years. The Medicare trust fund will run a deficit of $13 billion this year. By 2001, it will run a deficit of $49 billion and go broke. The disability insurance trust fund will be bankrupt in 2015, and Social Security trust funds will be bankrupt in 2029. And we do not have any clear and agreed public policy to address this imbalance. 
Although the proponents of the legislation claim that it will avert the crisis of Medicare bankruptcy until 2007, the fix is temporary and is no more than tinkering with the system. Accounting gimmicks are also applied to extend the life of Medicare. It shifts home health care from part A to part B and use the general account to cover the deficits of the trust fund. This means a surge of new spending in Medicare in the future that taxpayers will be obligated to fund. 
Third, unlike the Balanced Budget Act produced by the Republican Congress in 1996, this Balanced Budget Act does not result in steadily declining deficits, because the savings are achieved not through honest accounting but through rosy economic scenarios. Although this legislation claims over $117 billion savings in Medicare and $8 billion in Medicaid, all of the spending cuts result from a baseline projection of Government spending in which programs are assumed to grow according to such factors as the rate of inflation, population growth, and formulas written into the law. 
Any honest budget plan must reach balance through steadily declining deficits every year; in other words, the deficit must be lower each year than the preceding one. This 5-year budget agreement actually increases the deficit for the first 2 years, then projects enough of a reduction in the final 2 years to reach balance. The deficit under this budget will go up by $23 billion next year, from $67 billion this year to $90 billion, and remain as high as $90 billion in 1999. Over 70 percent of the deficit reduction will not occur until after President Clinton leaves the White House. A significant percentage of the plan's deficit reduction results from optimistic economic assumptions, not sound policy changes. 
A budget plan must also be based on real numbers and not the inflated budget estimates that have been used in the past to justify more spending and higher taxes. This budget agreement fails on that score as well by continuing to use the inflated budget estimates of the past to mask the spending increases it contains. I cannot support a budget that uses such gimmicks simply to make the numbers add up on paper. 
In its analysis of the budget, the Heritage Foundation concluded that `a credible plan to balance the Federal budget must result in a smaller Government that costs less and leaves much more money in the pockets of working Americans. The current reconciliation bill not only fails these important tests, but in many cases would implement policies that are worse than taking no action at all.' 
Our current sound economic growth has reduced the budget deficit to a 17-year low without any fiscal constrains and reforms. We should use this historic opportunity to balance the budget in less than 5 years, start to pay back our $5.4 trillion national debt, and address our long-term fiscal imbalances. Unfortunately, we have once again missed this opportunity. 
Mr. President, under the legislation before us, Washington will spend more of the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars creating new entitlement programs, while expanding old programs just to please the big-spending politicians and the special interest groups they feed. That is not the budget the taxpayers of Minnesota are expecting. That is not the budget Congress owes America's working families. But that is the budget Washington claims is the right answer. I regret that I do not agree, and cannot therefore support the spending portion of the budget reconciliation legislation.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I rise this morning to strongly oppose the amendment by my colleague and friend from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran, first for jurisdictional reasons, and most importantly because it is a seriously, I believe, flawed policy. 
As chairman of the International Finance Subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee, I object to the consideration of this matter, since it is within the jurisdiction of my subcommittee and the Committee on Banking. This is a very controversial issue and it should be heard and debated in the normal congressional process, by the proper committee of jurisdiction, not by a floor amendment with little opportunity for opponents to be heard. Many Members of this body may have already returned to their States and will not even have the opportunity to listen to the debate today. 
The Senate has not had an opportunity to have a full debate on export controls in the last few years. Members need the benefit of time to fully analyze changes in an area that can have such a negative impact on U.S. companies and on U.S. jobs. 
What really concerns me, Madam President, is that this amendment turns back the clock on technology. This amendment indicates it is directed at supercomputers, but computers at the 2,000-7,000 MTOPS level are not supercomputers, a point I will discuss later. The amendment reverses 2 years of effort to decontrol computers that are generally available. You will hear all sorts of talk today about how this amendment improves national security. But it does not. If the goal is to stop the sale of high performance computers to questionable end users in Russia, China, India, Pakistan, and Israel, it will stop the sale of United States computers to those end users--but it will not stop our allies from making those sales. 
It is true that there are two companies currently under investigation for alleged sale without license to a questionable end user. Those investigations are still pending and should be pursued, so it seems premature to, in effect, have the Congress find them guilty. Let us let the process work. If they are guilty, they will be penalized. The U.S. companies selling computers abroad at this level are few; they are reputable and they do care about selling to questionable end users. The investigations have also had a positive effect in that they have encouraged companies to seek more validated licenses for uncertain end users. I disagree with my colleagues who believe businesses care only about the almighty dollar, and not national security. 
This amendment will bring us back to the cold war days when export controls were required for computers sold in drug stores. A computer at 2,000 MTOPS, which is the level we would control, is a low-end work station which is widely available all over the world. We would establish unilateral controls on any computer over this capability. Our companies would have to obtain a validated license. Their competitors in other nations would not have that requirement. Therefore, European and Japanese companies would have a competitive edge in many, many computer sales in countries where it is important to establish a foothold as a reliable supplier to facilitate future sales. Licenses would be required for every sale above this limit, not just those to questionable end users. We want to expand markets in those countries, while protecting our national security interests, rather than handing them on a silver platter to our trading partners who will then be seen as reliable suppliers in the future. 
I know the argument will be that it is not hard to get an export license and that there are statutory deadlines on agency review of license applications. I can give you quite a list of companies--many of them smaller companies--which have come close to shutting down due to export license delays, even in recent years. We cannot return to this uncertainty and bureaucratic maze. Even the larger companies will see their expenses increase as they will have to hire more high-priced attorneys to facilitate many of the licenses through the process. Export licenses to these countries do not get approved in a couple of months. Many of them take many months and earn the U.S. the designation as an unreliable supplier. While we are pursuing regulatory reform in many areas, what we are doing here is reimposing regulations we eliminated 2 years ago. 
What is curious to me is an independent study commissioned in 1995 for the Departments of Commerce and Defense which determined that computers could be decontrolled to the 7,000 MTOPS level without a negative impact on national security. The Departments of State, Defense, Commerce, the intelligence agencies, and ACDA all signed off on this report, and the decontrol was made at that time to 7,000 MTOPS. The determination was made because the 2,000-7,000 range, again, Madam President, was widely available throughout the world. 
But you have also heard that we are stopping the sale of supercomputers to tier 3 countries without a license. Again. Madam President, a 7,000 MTOPS computer is not a supercomputer. Supercomputers still need export licenses. I am told that the MTOPS for a supercomputer is in the 20,000 range and can go up to one million MTOPS--a far cry from 7,000. 
Let's look at the level the amendment seeks to control--2,000 MTOPS. This is a low-level work station computer. By 1998, personal computers will reach this level. Also, the alpha chip available next year will be 1,000 MTOPS itself. So just two of those in a computer would qualify the computer for an export license. It is very difficult for me to justify that companies will have to jump through so many hoops just to sell fairly low-level computers. We are truly turning back the clock on technology. 
I have previously made the point that we are stabbing ourselves in the foot, since computer companies in other countries do not have these controls, and therefore our efforts are futile to say the least. There are four European companies which sell computers in the 2,000-7,000 range as well as Japanese companies. We all know that they will be eager to make these sales. 
What is really ironic is that the Chinese themselves have now produced a computer at the 13,000 MTOPS level. They have surpassed the 7,000 current limit the sponsor of this amendment is trying to roll back. 
One argument I have heard is that Japan also requires validated licenses for its sales. Yes, that is true, but Japan's validated license system has always been a rubber stamp operation. The entire process takes 24 hours, if that. Ours can take months. And I can show you some unhappy constituents who can verify that. 
Another question I have is whether it is good policy to codify export controls at certain levels rather than leaving them to regulation. Do we really want to be in a position to have to change the law each time we need to decontrol? Is the Congress really able to act as quickly and as often as needed to adjust to rapidly changing technology? I think not. 
Madam President, I plan to send a second degree amendment to the amendment by my colleague from Mississippi and in a moment will ask for its immediate consideration. 
But I again want to mention that this amendment would request the GAO to perform a study of the national security risks that would be involved with sales of computers in the 2,000-7,000 MTOPS range to military or nuclear end users in tier 3 countries. It would also analyze the foreign availability issue to determine whether controls at 2,000 MTOPS and above would make any sense. 
Further, the amendment would require the Department of Commerce to publish in the Federal Register a list of end users which would require the filing of a validated license application, except when there is an administration finding that such publication would jeopardize sources and methods. 
Madam President, this is a sincere compromise in my position as subcommittee chairman of the committee of jurisdiction over this issue, which will help us decide whether there is a need to recontrol at the 2,000 level. It is far too controversial to decide this question today, or by next Tuesday when we will vote. 
I believe Commerce should be asked to publish this list and to further seek ways to work with computer companies to determine whether other end users are questionable in order to alleviate some of the uncertainty that is out there. 
Madam President, let us not turn back the clock on technology. Let us make a rational national security decision that also take into account the best interests of our exporters--and the jobs that they represent.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, during the negotiations to achieve passage of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1997, a number of concessions had to be made to accommodate competing interests. One such example was the continuation of the authorization for the East-West Center at the current level of $10 million for both fiscal years 1998 and 1999. 
According to its budget justification, the East-West Center seeks to improve understanding and relations between Asia, the Pacific islands, and America. While this may be a worthwhile endeavor, we must question whether it merits a direct subsidy when the center seems to duplicate State Department activities and other private business, academic, cultural exchange, and tourism programs. 
The East-West Center already receives a high proportion of its funding from private sources and project specific Federal grants. It seems that it could continue its core functions without the American taxpayer footing the bill. Even the Clinton administration has recognized the need to terminate Federal funding for this center. The administration's budget summary noted that the effort to phase out governmental funding for the East-West Center will continue with its request of $7 million. Yesterday we took a step backwards from achieving that goal. It is my sincere hope that the appropriators will reduce funding from the current level. 
I started my fight to eliminate Federal funding for the East-West Center nearly 2 years ago, and I plan to continue my efforts. Many of my colleagues think that $10 million isn't a lot of money considering that we have a $1.6 trillion budget. I believe every expenditure should be reviewed regularly. At a time when Congress, at the request of the taxpayers, is working to finally balance the budget, this kind of sole-source, noncompetitive project can no longer be justified.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, during the debate on reforming the United Nations to make it a more effective organization, there was little discussion about the important work that the United Nations carries out. One good example which directly relates to my State is, the U.N.'s leading role in promoting and providing financial assistance to treatment centers for victims of torture around the world. The passage of my amendment to the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1997, which authorizes the United States to contribute $3 million in fiscal year 1998 and $3 million in fiscal year 1999 to the U.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, ensures that treatment centers in more than 50 countries will continue to receive support. I would like to thank the junior Senator from Minnesota for cosponsoring my amendment, and joining me in being an advocate for helping victims of torture. 
My home State of Minnesota is fortunate to have the first and only comprehensive treatment center in the United States for victims of torture. The Center for Victims of Torture has treated over 500 patients since it was established in 1985, and has enabled them to become productive members of our communities by overcoming the atrocities suffered in their countries of origin. I have learned a great deal from visiting the Center and meeting its clients and staff. In addition to providing treatment to persons who have been tortured by foreign governments, the Center has been active in providing training and support for treatment centers abroad. 
The United States should take a leading role in encouraging the establishment of additional treatment programs both at home and abroad. We are making progress in this direction. The United States is now the largest contributor to the U.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. We must continue to support treatment centers, like the one in Minnesota, which helps those who cannot help themselves--victims of torture. Dedicating more of our U.N. voluntary funds for this purpose will help provide this important service to more needy victims.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this historic, bipartisan deal was the result of arduous, delicate negotiations--nearly 5 months of painstaking talks with the chairman, the administration, Senator Biden, and his staff. After all that work, after all that effort, we have succeeded in hammering out a fragile bipartisan deal--a deal which saves the American taxpayers money, reforms our foreign affairs apparatus, and requires much needed reform at the United Nations. None of us got everything we wanted. All of us had to make concessions. But the result is a package that, while far from perfect, is something we should all be able to live with. 
I strongly support the U.N. reform measures. These reforms will help the American taxpayer, and help the international community by creating a United Nations that works. History shows that reforms at the United Nations only happen when Congress mandates those reforms by making its U.N. payments conditional on the implementation of reforms. Consider the recent record: Congress withheld funding until the United Nations established an Independent Office of Internal Oversight--and it happened, and Congress withheld funding until the United Nations appointed an inspector general--and it happened. 
Under the terms of this legislation, we reduce our regular budget assessment to 20 percent. We reduce our peacekeeping assessment to 25 percent. We reimburse the American taxpayers for U.S. assistance to U.N. peacekeeping operations. We establish an inspector general in the big three agencies to root out waste, fraud, and corruption. We ensure a U.S. seat on the budget committee. These are some of the conditions which must be accepted by the United Nations in order to receive the payment of the $819 million in arrears. They are not radical; they are not extreme; they provide a framework for change so the United Nations can become more effective. We have crafted a reform package that is necessary. This is a package that will work. 
This is a historic piece of legislation. We are dismantling our cold war foreign relations bureaucracy; we are creating a more effective United Nations, and we are prioritizing our international affairs expenditures. We need a more effective foreign affairs apparatus, both at home and at the United Nations, in order to confront the challenges to peace and security in the future. This bill will help us to provide the structure that we will need for America to secure its leadership role in the international arena.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as the subcommittee chairman with jurisdiction over the bill before us today, I worked diligently with members on both sides of the aisle, and with the administration, to craft legislation which will strengthen America's leadership role in the international arena. This package reorganizes our foreign relations bureaucracy, establishes benchmarks for the payment of U.N. arrears, and prioritizes our international affairs expenditures. We need a more effective foreign affairs apparatus, both at home and at the United Nations, in order to confront the challenges to peace and security in the future. 
This bipartisan agreement is the result of a good-faith effort to accommodate conflicting perspectives on how we, as a nation, should mobilize our resources. There were tough, lengthy negotiations on this package. We had to reconcile competing interests, and as a result, nobody is completely satisfied with the final product. I will be the first to say that this bill is not perfect. I would have preferred much more in the way of reforms and budget discipline. But this is a good agreement; and in this case, we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. I want to reassure my colleagues that I am open to oversight hearings that would address their concerns and closely examine the implementation of the changes we have made. 
In order to effectively safeguard the national interest, we must reorganize our foreign policy apparatus. This nation is saddled with an unwieldy Cold War foreign policy bureaucracy in which many of the functions of AID, ACDA, USIA and the International Development Cooperation Agency could be better handled by the State Department. This legislation does not go as far as I would like in consolidating our foreign relations bureaucracy. But for now, this package has a major advantage over a more complete consolidation--this package is achievable. It is a solid first step. Hopefully, these reforms will lead to further streamlining in the future--the American people want our Government to not only reflect their wishes abroad, but they want it to do so coherently. 
We are more likely to achieve our goals if we have a single voice representing the administration's position in the conduct of foreign relations, rather than a number of competing fiefdoms which undercut the authority of the Secretary of State. 
For example, under the new structure, we no longer should be stymied by a good-cop, bad-cop approach to foreign policy, whereby the entities who hand out U.S. foreign aid maintain good relations with client nations, while the Department of State essentially holds the line in protecting U.S. interests. We should not be handing out foreign aid to a country at a time when that very country is clearly acting against our interests. When we distribute foreign aid, it should be with an understanding that the United States entity asking for cooperation from a country in one arena is coordinating with the United States entity that will be delivering assistance to that country. Under this plan, the different parts of our foreign policy apparatus have a structural imperative to act in concert. 
Granted, the United States is not alone in the need to downsize its bureaucracy and eliminate waste. The United Nations must do the same. My visits to the United Nations as the United States Congressional Delegate to the U.N. General Assembly served to reinforce my commitment to salvage this organization. In this age, any organization burdened with a bloated bureaucracy and no mechanisms to control spending, will collapse under the weight of its own inefficiency. Most United Nations officials recognize the need for reform, and have started to work to achieve some of them. Indeed, in her former position as Ambassador to the United Nations, Secretary Albright was an outspoken critic of waste, fraud, and abuse and was instrumental in initiating an oversight process. However, most of her efforts were stymied by an entrenched bureaucracy. True reform will only occur when there are tangible incentives to change. I believe that the United Nations needs the discipline of actual benchmarks tied to the arrears to provide the impetus for fundamental change. We have seen how difficult it is to streamline our own bureaucracy. It is even more difficult to streamline an international organization where each member is involved in these decisions. 
We are not seeking to micro-manage U.N. reforms. We want to work with our fellow U.N. members to make the organization the best it can be. 
This bill provides a 3-year payment of $819 million in arrears to the United Nations in conjunction with the achievement of specific benchmarks that will help us enhance the vitality of the United Nations. I joined Ambassador Richardson at the United Nations late last week to brief Secretary General Kofi Annan and the Permanent Representatives of many of our allies' delegations on the details of this package. I was repeatedly asked whether the $819 million was a firm number. I indicated that it is a carefully negotiated figure that I believe will remain firm. I would like to remind my colleagues that the House bill contains no provision at all for the payment of arrears. The U.N. officials also wanted to know whether the benchmarks were conditions or suggestions. The benchmarks are what I call, somewhat tongue-in-check, `mandatory suggestions.' They are suggestions in the sense that the United Nations can choose whether or not to adopt them, and mandatory in the sense that if the U.N. wants the money it will have to implement the reforms. 
If the United Nations ignores the need for reform, than the United Nations will have to forgo the $819 million. 
I regret that a statement I made in New York last week was misinterpreted to suggest that somehow benchmarks were negotiable or optional. 
My intent was to indicate that the details regarding the implementation of certain conditions could be worked out with our fellow U.N. members--as long as the benchmark goals are achieved. 
You know, there is a difference here. Many of the benchmarks establish broad parameters on the direction we believe the United Nations should be going. The final small details and the micromanaging of how those are accomplished and reached will be the work of negotiations between member states. We are setting out a macropackage of reforms that I believe most members at the United Nations recognize need to be made. These reforms are heading the United Nations in the direction that it needs to go in order to become a very efficient organization. 
There is significant interest in the Congress to withhold the payment of arrears until there is tangible evidence that reform has occurred. After all, this is not the U.S. Government's money, it is the taxpayers money. Americans should be able to ensure that their hard earned money will not be squandered. 
I was greatly encouraged that the Secretary General remains committed to reforms and will work with us to achieve them. 
I strongly believe that the United Nations is an important forum for debate between member states and a vehicle for joint action when warranted. It is not a world government. 
However, the United Nations must endorse reforms that provide transparency and accountability so it is embraced as the former, instead of feared as the latter. I firmly believe that this package will improve the United Nations to the point where the United Nations can win back public support which has eroded over the years. 
These reforms are critical to ensure the United Nations is effective and relevant. 
I urge my colleagues to support the entire bipartisan package and, especially, to understand how difficult it was to arrive at an agreement on the arrears. 
I commend the chairman and the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee for their diligence and perseverance in effecting this compromise, an effort which took many months. I am pleased that the Administration has agreed, albeit reluctantly, to this agreement. 
I look forward to the implementation of the measures which will enhance America's ability to exert leadership in the international arena through the consolidation of our foreign relations apparatus. 
I am hopeful that the United Nations will accept the reforms and in doing so, will increase its ability to perform its mission. This agreement is in America's best interest, and the best interest of the entire international community. 
Thank you, very much. Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am very pleased that Congress and the President have finally agreed to the compromise proposal I offered earlier this week to smooth the way for passage of emergency flood relief for the people of Minnesota and the Dakotas. 
My compromise calls for separate votes on the emergency disaster relief bill and on legislation to protect the American people from a Government shutdown. Today's vote confirms that was the best way to build the necessary consensus in Washington to deliver flood relief as quickly as possible. 
The people of my home state of Minnesota have been waiting with increasing impatience for Washington to stop talking about delivering recovery aid and finally do something about it. 
They have been waiting for Congress and the President to work together to finally bridge the gap that led to the veto that now holds up flood relief. I am pleased to say that today, the waiting ends and the rebuilding process can move ahead. 
This flood recovery aid means more to us in Minnesota than simply dollars. It sends the message that the people of Minnesota and the Dakotas, who have endured so much during this critical time, have not been forgotten by Washington, and that the promises made by Congress and the President to our States will be promises kept. 
But our work does not end with this vote. Once we pass this bill and the President signs it into law, we must keep a watchful eye to ensure that the recovery and rebuilding process in Minnesota and the Dakotas can go forward without any further delays caused by gridlock in Washington. 
That is why I believe that Congress must pass the Government Shutdown Prevention Act, which will protect Minnesotans from a Government shutdown as we rebuild our State from the damages caused by the flood. 
Under my proposal, which we will adopt today, we can have that vote, free from any procedural delays, and give the people of Minnesota and the Dakotas that important assurance. 
Mr. President, this has been a stressful time for individuals, families, farmers, and businesses in the Midwest devastated by the flooding. The delays from Washington did not help anybody. 
But with this agreement today, we have reduced the chance that a manmade disaster this fall, in the form of a Government shutdown, will follow the natural diaster that victimized so many people this past spring. 
Again, I am pleased that we could work out this agreement and act on my proposal to pass emergency flood aid to Minnesota and the Dakotas. With this compromise, the blame game can end and the rebuilding can continue. It is time to move forward. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I was very disappointed by President Clinton's veto of the emergency aid bill, which provided some $5.5 billion in disaster relief nationwide, with a major portion of those dollars dedicated to helping to rebuild the flood-ravaged communities of my home State of Minnesota and also in the Dakotas. 
Having been with the President in seeing firsthand the damage and the despair that was caused by the flooding, I cannot believe that he was willing to reject our legislation to help support the people of Minnesota and the Dakotas as they rebuild their homes, communities, and their lives in the wake of the flood. 
Our legislation sent a very clear message that the people of Minnesota have not been forgotten by Congress during this critical time, but the President's veto suggests, however, that some in Washington need to have their memories refreshed. 
I am particularly disturbed by the fact that the President used as his primary excuse for vetoing the emergency flood relief bill our inclusion of a measure to protect flood victims in Minnesota and Americans everywhere from a potential Government shutdown later this year. 
For reasons I have repeated on this floor many times, I believe that delivering emergency aid to flood victims and keeping the Government open for business during the rebuilding process must be our twin goals at this time. 
Just as the emergency flood relief serves as an assurance to Minnesotans that their urgent needs will be met, our efforts to keep the Government from shutting down will also give them a guarantee that any budget squabbles that happen to pop up here in Washington will not affect our long-term efforts to help rebuild our State. And that is an assurance we can't afford to go without. 
By vetoing our flood relief bill, the President indicated that having a leg up in this year's budget debate is higher on his priority list than delivering flood assistance to those who need it. That was wrong, but, as we know, it cannot be changed. The people of Minnesota and the Dakotas already know how well Washington politicians can talk, and they don't want any more talk; they want some action. 
Stopping our work in the Senate and blocking us from taking action on anything accomplishes nothing. Positive, constructive action is what the Senate should be working on to deliver. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in working to ensure that flood relief gets out of Washington and that it gets into the hands of the people of Minnesota and the Dakotas as quickly as possible. 
Immediately after the veto was announced, I wrote letters to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and also Minority Leader Tom Daschle. In that letter, I proposed a compromise I believe will help speed up the enactment of the disaster relief legislation, while at the same time allowing Congress a separate vote, without any unnecessary delays, on the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. In my letters to Senators Lott and Daschle, I proposed that they consider removing the Government shutdown provision from the emergency aid legislation with a specific time agreement for debating and voting on the two issues in separate pieces of legislation. 
That would allow the Senate to debate and pass both the emergency flood relief bill and the Government Shutdown Prevention Act on their individual merits, away from the political haggling that has delayed action on these important bills. 
I was encouraged yesterday to learn of the support for my proposal by Vice President Al Gore and Senate Minority Leader Daschle. Their announcement of support clearly shows that there is room for negotiations to reconcile our differences and to deliver the flood assistance to Minnesota and the Dakotas. 
I have also been in negotiations with the majority leader, who expressed his intention to consider a number of different alternatives, including mine, on how best to move ahead and deliver flood relief. 
I am going to continue to work closely with both Senators Lott and Daschle, as well as my other colleagues in the Senate, to expedite this process. From the events of the last 2 days, I am optimistic that the two sides are closer to a reasonable settlement than anyone in the media may be suggesting. 
Now we must take action to bridge the gap and ensure the delivery of emergency disaster relief and the continued protection of the American people from a Government shutdown. 
At the very least, my proposal has opened the negotiation process to move ahead on these important issues post-veto. Again, while I am disappointed that the President chose to veto emergency flood relief, I hope that he will not shut the present window of opportunity to try to work together to find some common ground. 
Certainly, my constituents in Minnesota, who have already suffered so much at the hands of the flood, cannot afford inaction. 
As flood victims in Minnesota begin rebuilding their homes, their neighborhoods, their businesses, and their lives in the wake of the flood, they need our assurance that the Federal Government will deliver the aid that it promised. 
Flood victims also need to know that the Government will be there throughout the year to meet their urgent needs as their rebuilding progresses. 
Our efforts to keep the Government open for business will also help give Minnesotans a guarantee that budget squabbles in Washington will not affect the long-term efforts to rebuild our communities. 
Now, I know we may have reached a budget agreement in overall numbers and terms, but a lot of the debate will continue. And there is still the possibility of an agreement not being reached on every part of that budget this fall which could lead to a possible Government shutdown. It has happened before; it could happen again. 
In light of that, we want to provide assurances to these victims of the flood this spring in Minnesota and the Dakotas that they would not come up short this fall, they would not face a stop in the work that they are trying to do in rebuilding their lives. 
Under my compromise proposal, checks would continue to go out and contracts would be honored this year--in spite of what happens in Washington. And that is an assurance we cannot afford to go without. 
In announcing the President's veto, the White House spokesman said that `Americans in need should not have to endure further delay.' I could not agree more with that statement. 
The people of Minnesota and the Dakotas cannot afford for Washington's budget politics to stand in the way of the rebuilding that has already begun. Now that we have a starting point, let us move ahead and pass the emergency disaster relief we promised. 
And let us do it as quickly as we can. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield back my time.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, during the Budget Committee's debate on the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution, I joined with my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden to introduce a Sense-of-the-Senate amendment regarding the Medicare reimbursement rate for health plans. In fact, most of my colleagues on the Budget Committee cosponsored this amendment, and I was pleased to see it incorporated into the final budget resolution passed by the Senate. 
Reforming the way Medicare determines the reimbursement rate for managed care plans is critical to provide Medicare equity in States like my home State of Minnesota--especially for those citizens in rural communities in my State and throughout the country. 
Mr. President, there are three points I would like to emphasize. 
First, the Medicare reimbursement rate is unfair. While every American pays the same 2.9-percent payroll tax to the Medicare trust fund, Minnesotans find themselves with the second-lowest reimbursement rates in the Nation. Every single county in Minnesota falls below the national average in terms of Medicare reimbursement. In fact, Minnesota is not alone in this category. There are 16 States in which every county is below the national average--Iowa, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Clearly, Mr. President, having this many States without a single county at the national average indicates something is wrong with the system. 
Second, the Medicare reimbursement formula discourages quality health care. Minnesota has consistently been recognized throughout the Nation, and perhaps the world, as one of the most innovative, efficient, cost, and quality-conscious States in terms of health care. Yet, these same traits--which should be encouraged, not discouraged--have skewed the Medicare formula against our providers and beneficiaries. We are being penalized for our success, while those less efficient States benefit--and have no incentive to move in our direction. 
Mr. President, I think it is clear to everyone that efficient health care markets have reduced overutilization, eliminated unneeded hospital beds, and aimed for the highest quality service at the lowest price. Urban areas that are efficient in delivering health care--like Minneapolis, MN--decrease overutilization in the fee-for-service category of Medicare. This reduces the adjusted average per capita cost [AAPCC] which makes it difficult for health plans to remain competitive due to the lower payment. 
Third, the Medicare reimbursement formula discriminates against seniors who live in rural communities. These rural Americans already face fewer health care options than those living in urban centers. Because of the lower reimbursement rates health plans receive, there is no incentive for them to offer their services--let alone provide extra benefits many seniors in other States receive at no added cost. That means even fewer choices for the senior citizens living in rural Minnesota. 
Mr. President, no one would suggest that we take away the extra benefits seniors receive in other States; indeed, we should encourage health plans to do what they can to provide these benefits, while at the same time focusing on the need to become more efficient and cost-effective. However, what we are saying is that senior citizens living in rural America should at the very least have the opportunity to make these same choices in their health care plan. 
I'd like to conclude by offering an example of how the disparity in payment affects the benefits of two seniors living in different States.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. Leader. 
I just would like to take a few moments to address a couple concerns and questions. And as I think we are all very disappointed in the fact that yesterday President Clinton vetoed the emergency aid bill which would provide $5.5 billion in disaster relief nationwide--and that comes with a major portion of those dollars directed toward rebuilding and repairing those communities that have been devastated by floods in my home State of Minnesota and, of course, the Dakotas--our legislation I think sent a very clear message that the people of Minnesota have not been forgotten by Congress at this time. 
And I just really am concerned and disturbed by the fact that the President has used, as his primary excuse for vetoing the emergency flood relief bill, our inclusion of a measure that would go on to protect these very same victims this fall from what could become a manmade disaster if we do not come to some time agreement between the Congress and the President on funding legislation in the budget debates coming this fall. So for those reasons, I raised repeatedly on the floor that I believe that delivering this bill to the President is of utmost importance. 
And I just ask the leader if all considerations have been made or taken into account of trying to get this issue to the President again, to have him somehow--I would like to remind my colleagues who voted for this bill a week ago, that if they say these issues are so controversial, why did they then vote and approve this bill by 67 votes, as the majority leader said, last week and move this on to the President? 
So when they say that we are unbending and not willing to compromise on the issue, that it is `our way or no way,' really that is what we are hearing from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, that if it is not the President's way, it will be no way.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I have come to the floor this afternoon to express my support for the Family Friendly Workplace Act introduced by my colleague from Missouri, Senator John Ashcroft. I join with the Nation's working men and women in thanking my friend for his leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor and giving us an opportunity to focus on what has become the single most precious commodity for working families in the 1990's, and that is time. 
Trapped between less time and greater demands, the American people are calling for more choices and flexibility in setting their work schedules. They want help in balancing the competing demands for time between their families and their jobs. When surveyed in March by Money magazine, 64 percent of the American public--and 68 percent of working women--said they would prefer time off instead of extra pay for overtime, if the law permitted such a choice. 
Unfortunately, the law does not allow such choices, even though dramatic changes have taken place in America since 1938, when Congress wrote the basic law governing U.S. workplaces. Six decades ago, most laborers were employed in industrial plants or on farms. Fewer than 16 percent of married women with children in school were employed outside the home. Today, service jobs are a key part of the economy where more than 75 percent of married women with school-age children now work outside the home. 
Many parents are under tremendous stress, often holding down more than one job while trying to raise their children. The strain can be even more pronounced in single-parent households or two-parent families where both spouses work. Is it any surprise that today's parents are spending 40 percent less time with their children than parents did just three decades ago? It seems there are not enough hours in the day anymore to always fulfill the demands of family and of work. 
Twenty years ago, Congress overwhelmingly approved relief for federal workers by enacting flexible work options for government employees. During House consideration of the bill, then-Representative Geraldine Ferraro said, `Flexible schedules have helped reduce the conflicts between work and personal needs, particularly for working women and others with household responsibilities.' Also, Representative Patricia Schroeder added, `Flextime increases employee morale and productivity.' 
Even though federal workers have enjoyed these benefits for years, the rules governing the workplace and working hours for the private sector remain frozen back in 1938. Predictably, this has created unintended burdens for millions of workers. 
For example, under today's law, a worker who wants to put in 45 hours one workweek in exchange for 35 hours the next--in order to attend a child's soccer game, parent-teacher conference, or doctor's appointment--must first have an employer who is willing to pay five hours of overtime pay for the 45-hour week. Because many employers cannot afford additional overtime expenses, working parents are left with two choices: One is lose five hours of pay in order to be with a child, or miss the soccer game, school award, or doctor's appointment. That is an unfair choice parents should not be forced to make. 
Employers who try to extend a helping hand to employees with flexible scheduling do so at the risk of fines and penalties from the Department of Labor. It is the law--you are not allowed to work 45 hours now in return for 35 hours in another week and still keep a full paycheck. 
President Clinton has said he understands this problem and has proposed expanding unpaid time off under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Unfortunately, his plan only allows leave without pay. It was designed for periods of extended leave, not for the flexibility needed to meet the daily challenges of modern family and working life. Working parents would still have to take a pay cut to be with their children. 
Mr. President, I firmly believe the time has come to bring our employment laws into the 1990's, and so I have proudly signed on as an original cosponsor of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. Our bill would create flexible scheduling options for working Americans, benefiting millions of hard-working women and men. 
First, workers under this legislation would have paid flexible leave. To create time for their families, employees could choose to work additional hours in one week, to fill in a shorter week later. Employees could bank up to 50 hours of flexible leave that can be taken with pay. 
Also second, employees could set 2-week schedules totaling 80 hours in any combination. For example, an employee might want every other Friday off, compensating for the day off by working 80 hours over the course of 9 days. This system has worked well for Federal employees. 
Third, employees could take time and one-half off, instead of overtime pay. Employees would have the option of cashing out these comp time hours for overtime pay, if they wished. It is important to note that these options are entirely voluntary and any action must be set into motion by the employee, not the employer. Your employer can't force you to take comp time if you prefer the overtime. The bill, in fact, sets stiff penalties for coercive or abusive actions by employers.  
While I believe the bill affords employees the necessary protections, should there be reports of widespread abuse under this legislation, I will be among the first to call for its repeal. 
Mr. President, an editorial published in the April 7, 1997, edition of the Minneapolis Star-Tribune raised some of these same concerns--concerns I believe have been satisfied--and the newspaper found the premise behind the bill to be solid. The newspaper wrote:  
This is pretty appealing to busy Americans, many of whom would happily forgo $60 in overtime pay for the chance to spend Friday with their kids or a string of walleyes. And it is an efficient form of time management for employers who see their offices swamped with work one week but becalmed the next. 
The editorial concluded by saying that 
Clinton and Congress' Republican leadership should find a way to accommodate the needs of business and American workers in a changing economy . . . After all, the whole point is flexibility. 
Mr. President, I trust working parents with that flexibility because only they know what is best for their families. The flexibility is especially meaningful for the Nation's working women as well. Both Working Women and Working Mother magazines have endorsed the flextime and comptime measures in the Family Friendly Workplace Act, recognizing that 28.8 million working women stand to gain from this proposal. 
Times have changed dramatically since 1938, and change is long overdue. In fairness to workers and their families, and in the interest of the productivity of our economy, it is time to modernize our labor laws and give all workers the choice of flexible work options. So Mr. President, in concluding, I would like to say that the Family Friendly Workplace Act offers much-needed help for Americans striving to meet all the needs of their families. I urge the support of my colleagues, and once again I want to thank the Senator from Missouri for his leadership in bringing this bill before the Senate. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President. I will be brief, but I will try to talk loudly. 
This is a simple and straightforward amendment, and it will address just two of the weaknesses of the budget agreement; namely, big spending for the Government and small tax relief for working Americans. 
All it does is to require that we use half of the $225 billion of the CBO revenue windfall for tax relief and half for deficit reduction and keep nondefense discretionary spending at the cap freeze baseline level. 
If the $225 billion in extra money is, indeed, real, it did not fall mysteriously from the sky. It is money that belongs, first and foremost, to the American taxpayers, and it should be put to proper use. Keeping nondefense spending at freeze baseline levels would reduce total spending by only 1.5 percent over the next 5 years. If American workers are working harder and producing more, they should be able to keep it, not send it to Washington. 
So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I should like to talk a little bit about today's budget vote and some reasons why I had to anguish over it and vote no on this budget, a budget that I hoped we could all be proud of and we could go home and really tell our constituents we had done the best job we could and we were providing an honest budget that was going to provide the things we had talked about--smaller Government, less taxes, et cetera. 
But, Mr. President, there is an old saying that if something seems too good to be true, then it probably is. In Washington, that scene can be taken one step further. If something seems too good to be true, then it probably is and the taxpayers are somehow going to get stuck paying for it. 
Such is the case with the budget resolution passed by the Senate earlier today. On paper, the plan purports to eliminate the deficit by the year 2002 by reining in Federal spending while providing significant tax relief for America's working families. 
I appreciate all the efforts that were made to try to reach a good budget agreement I hoped I could support, and I know how hard Senators Domenici and Lautenberg and the leadership on both sides of the aisle worked to bang out this budget. But in reality, this budget will ultimately create bigger Government, a budget that is going to demand more dollars from the taxpayers rather than giving them most of the tax relief they have been promised. 
It is, in other words, a deal between politicians here in Washington, not between the taxpayers and the people they elected to represent them. 
I have made the pursuit of a balanced budget my top priority here in the Congress, and I have always said I would support a budget plan which meets just three basic specific criteria. First, it must shrink the size and scope of Government and return money and the power that those dollars represent to the tax people. It must balance the budget by the year 2002 with steadily declining deficits each year and without the use of rosy economic scenarios. 
And it must provide meaningful and broadbased tax relief to working families. 
Now, while I would like to join the bandwagon in supporting the budget resolution, this Washington budget does not meet those protaxpayer standards. 
First, shrink Government and return power to the taxpayers. Balancing the budget by the year 2002 is a responsibility we must meet, but it is simply the beginning. If we intend to reduce the $5.3 trillion national debt that will remain even after the deficit is eliminated, and take power from Washington and return it to the taxpayers, we must do more than simply balance the budget. We were not elected to serve as the Nation's accountants, simply trying to make sure the numbers all add up on paper. We were elected to be policymakers--and balancing the budget is just one of these policies. 
We cannot lose sight of the overall goal of shrinking the size of the Washington bureaucracy and sending those dollars back to the taxpayers. Yet, this budget plan does just the opposite. It increases the size of Government by giving President Clinton even more money for pet projects than he originally requested--$74 billion more than he requested in his budget just last year, and $5 billion more than the budget he put forward in February of this year. 
Mr. President, instead of eliminating wasteful programs to reduce the Federal deficit, this budget plan actually creates numerous new programs, including $34 billion in new entitlement programs that will cost billions of the taxpayers hard-earned dollars. 
Now, if some of these new programs have merit, they should be authorized and appropriated through open hearings and through normal committee process. Total spending in this budget plan for all programs is $18 billion higher than President Clinton's budget request for the next 5 years. So where is that in shrinking the size of Government? It is increasing the size of Government. The discretionary spending for the next year alone will be $6.3 billion more than even what the President had requested back in February. 
Compared to the budget resolution we passed last year, this budget plan has significantly increased discretionary spending. In fiscal year 1998, discretionary spending will be $26 billion higher, $26 billion more than last year's budget, while the total discretionary spending for the next 5 years will be $194 billion higher than last year's budget request. 
I do not believe this is what the taxpayers had in mind when they heard the President declare that the era of big Government is over. During the last 5 years, Congress spent an additional $240 billion raising the size of Government that much over the years, but over the next 5 years we are going to increase the size of the Government another $270 billion. Again, plus the $34 billion in new spending initiatives, not just fattening some of the old programs but actually creating, giving birth to $34 billion in new programs that will have to be supported even more in the outyears. 
By increasing discretionary spending and creating new entitlement programs, this budget plan would ensure that big Government is not only here to stay, but that it will grow even bigger, and it will ultimately mean higher taxes in the future. In the continuing struggle between taxpayers and big Government, this budget deal takes the wrong side, and I cannot be a part of it. 
Second, the claim of balancing the budget with steadily declining deficits, not through rosy scenarios. One of the dirtiest little secrets in Washington is the economic hocus-pocus that goes on in the budgeting process. The Washington folks seem to believe that as long as they have a balanced budget on paper, however they can reshape the numbers to fit their goals, it does not matter how they got there because the end will justify the means. But, as everyone knows, you can't write a household budget with inflated numbers or unrealistic assumptions, and you should not be able to write a Federal budget that way as well. 
Any honest budget plan must reach balance through steadily declining deficits every year. The deficit must be lower each year than the preceding one. But this year's 5-year budget agreement actually increases the deficits for the first 2 years, then projects enough of a reduction in the final 2 years to reach balance. So, in other words, let's spend more now and then we will cut later. In other words, this President will be out of office, this Congress will have many new faces, probably, but they are going to let the next President and the next Congresses make the tough decisions that this Congress has turned its back on making. 
Mr. President, James Glassman wrote on this subject in Tuesday's Washington Post, and I found this observation to be most appropriate. He said: 
The way to get to smaller government is by spending less money. In fact, federal spending will rise sharply in fiscal year 1998--that's the year that starts on October 1, 1997, and the only budget year that has any real significance. 
Why? Because `all the other numbers for all the other 
years are sheer fantasy. As anyone who runs a business knows, the only figure you can possibly control is next year's spending.' 
Let me say when the budget deal was struck here in 1990 that raised taxes, part of the agreement was we will put a cap on future spending. We will not spend over this limit. In 1993, a new tax increase came into being, and along with that new tax increase came the removal of those old caps, and new caps on spending were put at a higher level. They said, all right, we will not spend over this level if you give us these tax increases now. 
Now, in 1997, for the 1998 budget year, the first thing that has to be done in this budget, we have to bust those spending caps again because this budget can't live within those promises, and it extends the level ever higher. 
What does that mean? Where does the revenue come from? It is taken from the taxpayers and the hard workers of this country. Budget proponents are claiming to balance the budget by immediately increasing the deficit by at least $23 billion, or an increase of 34 percent, and then finding the savings to eliminate the deficit in the preceding years for the following years. 
If this does not make sense to the American taxpayers, that is because it does not make sense at all. It is just another example of the budget tomfoolery that is going around in Washington. A budget plan must also be based on real numbers and not the inflated budget estimates that have been used in the past to justify more spending and higher taxes. Somehow the new revenues, the increased dollars that come to Washington, can never be put into the category of reducing the deficit or returning some of it in tax relief. It always goes on the other side of more spending. 
This budget agreement fails on that score as well as by continuing to use the inflated budget estimates of the past to mask the spending increases it contains. I cannot support a budget that uses such gimmicks simply to make the numbers add up on paper. 
There are two other weaknesses of the agreement I would like to point out. For quite some time we have been told repeatedly by the CBO that we needed at least $500 billion in spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. It will take hard choices to accomplish that. However, the need to make some of the most difficult choices supposedly vanished recently when we were told that we can spend more while balancing the budget at the same time because somehow the CBO discovered $225 billion in extra money. This cannot be true. It contradicts the CBO's own recently completed study that examined the potential impact of a recession on budget projections and the goal of a balanced budget by the year 2002. 
In this study, the CBO examined two possible recessions, one possibly in 1998, another in the year 2000, and it concluded in both cases GDP would fall 3.7 percent below potential and would add about $100 billion to the deficit. That would make the goal of achieving a balanced budget in the year 2002 very difficult. 
Again, if the $225 billion in `extra money' is indeed real, it did not fall mysteriously from the sky. It is money that belongs first and foremost to the American taxpayers, and it should be put to proper use. The right way would be to return it to the taxpayers as tax relief and/or designated for deficit reduction. The wrong way is to spend all that. Unfortunately, this budget resolution takes the wrong way. 
Now, there are some who said on the floor today only $30 billion of that $225 billion was spent. If that is true, where is the rest of it? Where did it go? If it is still there, let's put it to tax relief. But the secret is that it has been put into spending. 
I introduced an amendment earlier today that would have required that we use the $225 billion of the CBO revenue windfall as assumed under this budget for tax relief and deficit reduction, and to keep nondefense discretionary spending at the current freeze baseline level. My amendment called for giving back half of the $225 billion windfall to the taxpayers and then devoting the other half for deficit reduction. Again, the question is, where did that money go? 
Another element of my amendment called for keeping nondefense spending at a freeze baseline level. Now, baseline budgeting has been the subject of great debates, many debates, and I will not repeat the arguments today, but let me tell you briefly why this is so important. For years, Republicans criticized the use of inflated baseline budgeting because it did not reflect the actual spending levels in terms of an increase or a cut in a program's funding. By that, they always project next year's spending to already be higher so they set a new baseline. So if we were going to spend $100 this year, the new baseline next year would be $105, so that is what they work off. If we only spend $104, the claim would be we cut the budget by $1, when actually we spent $4 more. 
Now, there are claims in this budget that we will save $1 trillion in spending for the American taxpayer over the next 10 
years. Now, that sounds great, doesn't it? If you go by the baseline budgeting, what they are really saying is, if we froze spending today, over the next 10 years we would spend about $16.2 trillion, but under the baseline budgeting, we are going to only spend $19.2, but we could have spent $20 trillion, so we are saving you $1 trillion. We could have spent $20 trillion, but by the baseline we will cut back. 
The difference is, we are not saving $1 trillion in spending for the taxpayers. We are adding $3 trillion in new spending over the same 10 years. 
It was Lee Iacocca who said if American businesses used baseline budgeting the way Congress does, `They would throw us in jail.' Many of us share Iacocca's views and believe inflated baseline budgeting is a fraud and it should be ended. 
During the past 2 years we have been telling the American people we would guarantee an honest accounting of our Federal budget by implementing zero-baseline budgeting. In other words, be honest. This is what we spend this year. This is what we propose to spend next year, not the baseline that we could have spent, but we are not going to spend quite that much, so we will save you money. That is like going to a sale and saying I am going to spend $100 to save $4. 
We adopted zero-baseline budgeting, and Congress has produced two balanced budgets by using the freeze baseline. But the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution abandoned this policy that we had used over the last 2 years of honest accounting by reverting to inflated baseline budgeting. In my view, this is a shift, again, in the wrong direction. 
Returning to the inflated baseline not only again breaks a promise to the American people but also ensures, ensures that big government will live on by allowing Washington to avoid the hard choices that it must make to eliminate wasteful programs and address our long-term fiscal imbalances. We could have met the problem head on this year. They were negotiating the budget and could have finally had to face those problems, but somehow, at the last minute, the White Knight, the CBO, with $225 billion in new projections, rode in for the rescue and Congress did not have to make any choices. They went ahead and spent all the money. 
Mr. President, my amendment, as you know, was defeated by the Senate this morning. But this issue is not one that is going to go away. We must be honest with the American people, and we must, again, use zero-baseline budgeting as we promised, so we can rebuild the American people's confidence in the Government and make Congress accountable to the taxpayers. 
No. 3, meaningful broad-based tax relief for working families. I have been the Senate's leading advocate of what we call meaningful broad-based tax relief for working families through an important measure such as the $500-per-child tax credit. 
Rhetorically, everyone from colleagues in Congress and the President has joined me in calling for such tax relief. Once again, a closer look at this budget agreement reveals that reality does not match the rhetoric. 
What does this Washington deal mean for the millions of families who would benefit from a broad-based tax cut? Proponents of the budget agreement argue that since $135 billion has been set aside on paper for tax relief, that it is good. I beg to differ, because, as with all things in Washington, there is more, or, in this case, there is less than meets the eye. 
For example, when they say there is $135 billion available for tax relief, they are ignoring the fact that $50 billion of this pool will be raised through higher taxes, so, in other words, to give a tax break to some we will have to raise taxes on others. We are going to have to borrow from Peter to pay Paul. So that leaves us a net tax cut of $85 billion and someone will have to pay for the $50 billion. You can bet that someone will not be Uncle Sam. 
Also consider the fact that $35 billion has already been promised away to the President for his narrowly targeted college education tax plan. 
Now, as the Senate author of the broad-based tax relief for working families represented by the $500-per-child tax credit, I am deeply troubled that this Washington budget agreement dedicates too much money for narrowly targeted tax relief at the expense of broad-based tax relief. The debate over targeted versus broad-based tax relief raises the single most important question for us today, and that is the question of who decides. Targeted tax relief says Washington will decide who is going to get a tax break, how they are going to get it, and what they have to do to get that tax break. If you, as a taxpayer, want to cut, you have to do what Washington tells you to do, whereas broad-based tax relief says taxpayers can decide. If you want to use your tax cut for higher education, go ahead, for housing, go ahead, for health care, go ahead, but tax relief should not be narrowly tailored to fit the priorities set by Washington or used as a tool for social engineering purposes. 
Tax relief should be as broad based as possible leaving the decisionmaking on how best to use that to the taxpayer themselves. Every household is different. Washington cannot 
decide. 
Now, while all of us support the use of tax relief for higher education expenses, we must recognize that there are many other needs faced by working families every day that can be best met by a tax cut, and it should not be up to Washington to make those decisions. But that is what this budget agreement does by reserving $35 billion from the President's college tax deduction which benefits a few. This Washington deal takes away tax relief dollars from the child tax credit which benefits the many. 
Finally, there are many other claims to those dollars remaining in the tax relief pool, including a capital gains tax cut, estate tax relief, IRA's and a host of other tax proposals. But if you start out with $135, you take away $50 in tax increases, you have $85 net. From those $85 million, the President has targeted tax relief of $35 billion, which leaves a pool of $50 billion. 
To go through some of this other child tax relief, if you are going to get the full-blown tax relief you have been promised, it would be $104 billion. If you are going to get tax gains, tax reduction, it would be $24 billion; estate tax, $18 billion; IRAs, about $11 billion. What we have is about $170 billion of tax cuts promised that somehow we are going to squeeze out of a box of $50 billion. So, in other words, somebody is going to get something, but it will be a shadow. While all these ideas have merit, the competition for this ever-shrinking pool means more bad news for those of us who care about getting tax relief. 
Again, we have promised working families a $500-per-child tax credit, but once you factor in all the tax hikes, special interest tax cuts, and deals that have been made a part of the budget agreement, it is easy to see that this $500-per-child tax credit could end up being nothing more than a token gesture, a promise of meaningful broad-based tax relief for working families without the dollars to back it up. 
In other words, working families will be squeezed out again, a broken promise, and that is something that I cannot support. 
Contrary to the claims of its proponents, this Washington budget deal is a retreat from the promises we made to the taxpayers for meaningful tax relief. As I have argued, the figures set-aside for tax relief are wholly inadequate to keep the promises we made to take from Washington and give back to the taxpayers--a fatal flaw in this budget agreement and another brush-off to the working families we are supposed to represent. 
In its analysis of the budget, the Heritage Foundation concluded that `a credible plan to balance the Federal budget must result in a smaller Government that costs less and leaves much more money in the pockets of working Americans. The current budget deal not only fails these important tests, but in many cases would implement policies that are worse than taking no action at all.' 
The medical profession is guided by the doctrine of `First, do no harm.' The American people should demand the same of their Government as it establishes the Nation's spending and tax priorities through the budget process. A budget that fails to meet even the most basic tests of honesty and common sense--and that may actually leave the Nation in a fiscal situation more perilous than the one we face today--is a budget the American taxpayers will not support. Congress and the President can, and must, do better. 
In closing, let me add a final thought about this so-called balanced budget resolution. 
As I stand here in this Chamber, on a day when I should be proudly telling the taxpayers of Minnesota that Congress has finally heard their pleas and produced an honest budget that reduces the size of government and offers meaningful tax relief, I am saddened and angry that I cannot. 
The budget resolution passed by the Senate today is not the budget I was elected to carry out. It is not the budget a great many of my colleagues were elected to carry out. It is a budget built of concession, not of compromise, of illusion, not of reality, of whispers, not of boldness. It is a budget built like a house of cards, without a foundation, and held together by nothing but wishes and assumptions. This may be a so-called agreement between the Republicans and Democrats in Washington, but it is not the budget agreement we promised the taxpayers. 
It is a budget Congress hopes America will like. As you see more of the details, it will be one they don't. For this reason, it is a budget I deeply regret I cannot in good conscience support.

Mr. GRAMS. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I also just would like to offer an amendment and lay it aside.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am proud to be a leading co-sponsor of legislation introduced today with my friend and colleague, Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont. The Earned Income Credit (EIC) Fairness Act of 1997 is a direct response to back-door efforts by the Internal Revenue Service to raise revenue on the backs of family farmers. This legislation simply clarifies the intent of Congress by preserving this important tax credit for our Nation's dairy farmers. 
I want to thank Senator Jeffords for his leadership on this issue. My colleague from Vermont and I have differed from time to time on what is best for the Nation's dairy industry in the way of federal dairy policy. However, I have always had a profound respect for his hard work and genuine commitment to Vermont's dairy farmers. They have in Senator Jeffords a tireless advocate in the U.S. Senate. 
I also want to commend Mike Foley, a teacher and dairy farmer from Melrose, MN for bringing this issue to my attention. Like other problems created by IRS misinterpretations of Congressional intent--including the alternative minimum tax [AMT] and the self-employment tax problems--few knew of the EIC problem and the hardship it would ultimately cause. Thanks to Mike, we now have the opportunity to restore the IRS to its proper role of carrying out current laws instead of creating new ones. 
Mr. President, unless Congress acts on this legislation, the Nation's dairy farmers will be forced to pay $76 million in taxes they were never intended to pay. In effect, this is an agency-created $76 million tax hike on hard working, generally low-income, dairy producers. For dairy farmers in Minnesota, the tax hike would amount to about $6 million. As a boy who grew up on a dairy farm, I know all too well how hard dairy farmers must work to make ends meet. Long hours. Early mornings. Late nights. The vacations--even for a day--which a lot of us take for granted are unthinkable for most of our dairy producers. This is especially true for the dairy producers who would be hit hardest by the new IRS-imposed tax hike. This is wrong. Wrong because the IRS has no business raising taxes by agency fiat. And, wrong because of the severe hardship the tax hike would impose on our Nation's dairy producers. 
During consideration of the 1996 Farm Bill, we promised our farmers long overdue tax relief, regulatory relief, improved risk management and research, and free and fair trade. My request of the administration, particularly the IRS, is simple. If you don't want to help keep this promise to America's farmers, simply step aside and at least don't hinder those of us who do. 
I urge my colleagues to give the EIC Fairness Act of 1997 speedy consideration and passage.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Daschle, Johnson, Grassley, Harkin, and Wellstone as a proud cosponsor of legislation authorizing the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System. This much-needed legislation will help provide a long-term, high-quality water supply from the Missouri River to over 180,000 individuals in portions of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa. 
For too long, and to the detriment of community development, residents of this region have been deprived of a sustainable water resource. In light of Minnesota's reputation as the `land of 10,000 lakes,' it might come as a surprise to hear my home state described as being desperately short on water supplies. The southwestern corner of the state, however, is geographically very different from the rest of Minnesota. Rock County, which would be served by the Lewis and Clark system, is the only county in Minnesota without a natural lake. 
Communities within the proposed water system are now served by shallow aquifers highly susceptible to drought, leading most of these communities to impose severe watering restrictions. The constant deterioration of these aquifers is evidenced through the detection of ever-increasing nitrate levels that threaten the safety of current drinking water. Moreover, increasing federal regulations have imposed expensive, unfunded mandates on communities seeking to deliver clean and healthy water to their residents. 
This situation has forced communities throughout the region to aggressively explore alternative water supplies. Since 1989, the community of Worthington, Minnesota has spent between $50,000 to $75,000 annually searching for another source of water, all without success. The nearby community of Luverne, Minnesota has experienced the same disappointing results despite its significant expenditures. It is little wonder struggling communities across this region have joined together to strongly support the Lewis and Clark proposal. 
Bill Weber, the distinguished mayor of Luverne, Minnesota stated: `It made sense to us to combine our financial assets in building one system that can provide an alternative supply of drinking water for 22 systems. The only other alternative was for each of us to continue as we have in the past, exploring more costly alternatives that only helped one at a time and alternatives, which in the case of Luverne appear to be nonexistent.' 
Greg Degroot, President of Worthington Public Utilities, wrote that the system `will provide our community with an alternative source of water that will give us some protection in the event of the loss of our existing water source and will also provide the additional water that is necessary for our community to continue to prosper and grow.' 
Mr. President, under our legislation, local communities will come together with the affected states and the federal government to form a strong, financial partnership, thereby ensuring an adequate, safe water supply while reducing the costs to the American taxpayers. In fact, with our revised proposal, the city of Sioux Falls, South Dakota--by far the largest user of the proposed system--will pay 50% of the construction costs for its share of Lewis and Clark water. 
Mr. President, providing healthy water to our communities is one of the most basic functions of the government. It is not a partisan issue, and therefore I am proud to join with a bipartisan group of my colleagues and the Governors of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa in supporting this bill. We believe our legislation to be the best, most cost-effective answer to a severe and growing problem. 
The time to enact this bipartisan legislation is now. As a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I look forward to working with the distinguished Chairman, Senator Murkowski; Senator Johnson, the primary sponsor of this legislation and a Committee member; the rest of our colleagues; and the Clinton Administration in providing much-needed relief to our communities. They deserve nothing less.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize National Emergency Medical Services Week and the heroic and courageous work our emergency medical service providers perform everyday. 
As an author of the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act, I have had the opportunity to meet with many EMS providers both in Minnesota and Washington to hear firsthand the problems they face every day--and their suggestions on how those problems can be resolved. The meetings were constructive, and we identified specific areas of concern and ways in which Congress can address them. I hope that the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act will serve as a blueprint for helping these dedicated public servants make the system more efficient. 
Mr. President, emergency medical services have come a long way since the 1860's when the first civilian ambulance service was begun in Cincinnati and New York City. Now we have sophisticated medical equipment on ambulances around the country, and the American people have come to rely on the readiness, efficiency, and quick response of the EMS system. Yet many Americans--including Members of Congress--take these crucial services for granted. 
Mr. President, I have a great admiration and respect for those who dedicate their time and talents to the emergency care profession, whether as a career or through volunteering. It's a field that offers a great many rewards. And yet along with those rewards often come great challenges. EMS professionals are often thrust into dangerous situations--situations that set their profession apart from most any other 9-to-5 job. It's a difficult, sometimes terrifying time to be part of the public health and safety professions. 
I'm reminded of a frightening example of the terrors EMS professionals face that happened here in Washington just 5 months ago when a paramedic team was attacked by a gunman. Emergency workers were transporting a shooting victim to the hospital when the gunman stormed the ambulance, killing the victim and wounding one of the paramedics. That followed another violent incident just a month earlier, when a man who had been shot was stalked by his attacker to the hospital and was fatally wounded as he sought treatment. 
Despite these risks, there are many thousands of Americans who serve their communities with determination and compassion as paramedics and emergency medical service personnel. Last night, they honored those who exemplify the best of their profession as `Stars of Life.' I was asked to speak to their group, but was unable to attend due to the Budget Committee's markup of the 
fiscal year 1998 budget resolution. I was disappointed I could not attend so I wanted to take the time to recognize their achievements on the Senate floor today.

 Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I rise to proudly acknowledge the contribution that my home State of Minnesota made to the recently dedicated memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 
On May 2, 1997, over 6,000 people joined President Clinton beside the tidal basin midway between the Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials to dedicate a memorial to our Nation's 32d President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. As those present at the dedication walked among the granite walls, waterfalls, and bronze sculptures, they were witnessing a piece of history which Minnesota's own Cold Spring Granite Co. helped make possible. 
Minnesota's role in the Roosevelt Memorial began in 1975 when designer Lawrence Halprin chose Cold Spring Granite for the walls and floor of the memorial. Located just south of the Granite City of St. Cloud in central Minnesota, Cold Spring Granite Co. provided the more than 6,000 tons of granite that adorns the memorial. 
Started in 1898 by Henry N. Alexander, the Cold Spring Granite Co. has grown into one of the world's largest granite quarrying and fabrication operations. Today the Cold Spring Granite Co. is headed by Patrick D. Alexander, the grandson of Henry Alexander, who oversees a company of over 1,400 employees with five fabrication facilities and 28 quarries located throughout North America. 
Mr. President, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial is expected to draw as many as 2 million visitors each year. I am pleased that those who visit this site will see not only a memorial to one of our Nation's most remembered Presidents, but also a testament to the hard work and patriotism of the men and women of Minnesota, particularly the dedicated employees of the Cold Spring Granite Co.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues urging the release of Wei Jingsheng, currently imprisoned in China for his efforts to promote democracy in China. Serving his second long-term sentence, Mr. Wei is seriously ill without access to proper medical care. He has served nearly 18 years in various prisons and labor camps and will not be released until 2009. It is doubtful he will last that long without medical attention. 
I hope the leaders of China will grant Mr. Wei's release as an humanitarian gesture that would show the world that China has a commitment to improve the human rights of its citizens.

Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to commend my friend and colleague, Chairman Jeffords, for the exemplary work he has done in regard to the reauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. That this is the first time in 22 years that Congress has attempted major changes to its law with any likelihood of success speaks volumes about the time, energy, and commitment Senator Jeffords and others have devoted to it. 
Over the last 5 months, I have listened to the concern of school board members, students, parents, principals, teachers, and administrators from all over Minnesota on the issue of IDEA. Primarily, each of these groups stressed concern over proliferating litigation, program inflexibility in regard to discipline, and the tremendous cost burdens associated with the mandates that have been placed on our schools. 
In regard to the issue of discipline, this legislation provides additional flexibility to deal with children who are disruptive in the classroom or who are otherwise a danger to themselves or others. Clearly, this is an instance where the interests of the child and the interests of sound learning in the classroom must be carefully balanced to ensure that neither are breached. Unfortunately, current Federal law dictates that a child may only be removed from school if the parents consent to removal or if the student brings a firearm to school. 
Mr. President, this is not balance at all. This legislation makes considerable strides toward restoring some balance by 
returning more decisionmaking to the people who know best, and that is those who actually teach our children. 
Another issue is litigation. According to a study done by the Minnesota State Legislature, one of the largest factors contributing to the increased costs in educating their children is the cost of special education. Unfortunately, too many of these expenses have nothing to do with buying things such as Braille for the visually impaired or providing instruction for children with disabilities. Many of these expenses are legal fees resulting from litigation between schools and the parents of children with disabilities. 
In light of the limited resources available to pay for the mandates imposed by IDEA, this is a glaring flaw that is ripe for reform. Toward this end, S. 717 requires States to establish a mediation system and provides incentives for parents to avail themselves of mediation instead of litigation to amicably resolve their differences. 
The one issue that is not addressed in this legislation, however, and it is, in my view, a critical one, is the issue of funding. The Senator from Vermont has urged Senators to wait for another day to tackle this issue. The Senator's objection to dealing with funding at this juncture is not based on substance but, rather, on process, and I fully appreciate these constraints. We need to pass this bill. 
However, because I believe the issue of funding is so vital to the success of IDEA's reforms, I must reluctantly part paths with the chairman. I believe the funding issue should be addressed now. As Senator Gorton has pointed out, IDEA is an unfunded mandate on our 50 States and our schools. As such, consistent with the spirit, if not the letter, of the unfunded mandates legislation we approved last Congress, the mandate imposed by IDEA should either be repealed or it should be paid for. As it stands, the Federal Government pays a mere 7 percent of the total cost we impose on our schools through IDEA. It is my considered opinion that the Federal Government should put its money where its mouth is. In short, Congress must fully appreciate the consequences of its actions. If Congress places a premium on a desired goal or sets a priority for States or local governments to attain, the Federal Government must ante up or then reconsider that mandate. And because I believe IDEA serves an important role in the education of our disabled children in Minnesota and throughout the Nation, in this case I believe Congress should ante up. Accordingly, if it is offered, I will support the Gregg amendment to fully fund the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I just wanted to say again I support S. 717 because it does improve upon the commitment we have made to disabled students in Minnesota and throughout the country. Although I wish it would have gone a little farther, I support the Gregg amendment, as I said, because it backs up this profound commitment. But in my view, if we at the Federal level really desire to help our Nation's schools, we will finish the jobs we started. Beyond this, the Federal Government's next job in furthering the education of our children is to step aside and allow parents and school boards to do the job they were designed to do and not the Federal Government. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief comments about the Government shutdown prevention plan contained within the supplemental appropriations that would protect flood victims and every American whose paycheck depends upon the Federal Government by preventing future shutdowns of the Federal Government. 
In the 104th Congress, as a result of disagreements between Congress and the President during the budget process, we witnessed the longest shutdown of the Federal Government in history. The shutdown created enormous financial damage, emotional distress, and just plain inconvenience for millions of Americans. Hundreds of thousands of Americans could not receive their social services, such as Medicare benefits, or travel overseas, or visit national parks and museums. Small business owners and local communities lost millions of dollars. Federal employees were furloughed with the fear of not getting paid. Even our troops stationed overseas were affected by the shutdown. 
But the most serious damage caused by the 27-day shutdown was that it shook the American people's confidence in their Government and elected officials. 
We have not yet undone that damage, but we have the opportunity to do that today. We need to restore the public's faith in its leaders by demonstrating that we have, indeed, learned from our mistakes. 
Now, we can all point fingers at who was the cause of this shutdown. But the inclusion of the Government shutdown prevention plan will send a clear message to the American people that we will no longer allow them to be held hostage in future budget disputes between Congress and the White House. 
I am surprised by the opposition to this plan, and one has to ask the question, why would they oppose it? Each of us have differences in philosophy on policy and budget priorities. Often we do not necessarily agree on these priorities, but there are essential functions of the Federal Government that provide critical services to the American people, and those services must continue, regardless of our budget differences. 
Now, consider the devastation caused by the flooding in Minnesota and the Dakotas in recent days. I have heard some declare that the supplemental appropriation that is before us today will be the answer to all of our problems. That could not be further from the truth. 
What would happen if a budget shutdown in Washington forced a Government shutdown just as it did 2 years ago? Minnesotans who have struggled against the floods could find themselves victimized a second time if their rebuilding efforts were stopped. This natural disaster has already been an exhausting nightmare for Minnesotans, and we cannot tolerate a manmade disaster on top of it. 
Mr. President, I will work not to allow the citizens of Minnesota to be used as chips in some sort of high-stakes budget contest. Therefore, I support the critical provision within the disaster relief bill that will prevent a future Government shutdown. I believe this is the only way to stop the politics, to ensure that Congress and the President are committed to keeping the Government open, and protect our flood victims from any gamesmanship in Washington. 
Now, last Friday, a budget agreement was reached between the White House and negotiators in Congress, and as a result some of my colleagues have argued there is no longer any need for this language. Well, if they did not intend to use the threat of a shutdown as a tool to extract more of what they want in budget talks, why would they oppose it? 
I think a provision like this is kind of like insurance. We always hope we never need it, but it would be there if we did. 
Last week's agreement does much to take the political pressure away from the current debate, which would allow us to focus more on the merits and the necessity of the shutdown prevention language and whether it is sound policy to have such a plan in place to prevent future shutdowns. More often than not, the lack of a Government shutdown prevention plan has yielded a `money grab' at the end of each fiscal year, as Members take advantage of the last-minute rush to pass a budget and avoid a shutdown by loading it up with pork projects. The merits of the spending are not debated at all, and programs are funded based not on merits but, many times, on political leverage. As a result, billions of hard-earned taxpayers dollars are wasted in the process. 
Mr. President, the American people should not be held hostage to the efforts of those who want to keep alive the threat of future Government shutdowns for their own political purposes. We cannot allow for the possibility of a Government shutdown in the future that would prevent us from addressing the longer term needs of those Minnesotans who are trying to rebuild their lives in the wake of the flood. We must ensure we have a plan in place that will keep the Government up and running in the event the budget agreement is not reached. 
Again, Mr. President, the Government shutdown prevention plan 
is sound policy. It is wise policy. It is also responsible policy. It is the right priority. And, by the way, it cuts nothing, and it allows the Government to do its job. 
I urge all my colleagues to vote against the Byrd amendment.

Mr. GRAMS. I would like to remind my colleagues that our CDBG request is based on very preliminary loss figures. There are many residents of communities along the Red River Valley who still have not returned to their homes. It will take months before we have a better idea of what the total losses will be. 
As a result, all of us in Minnesota, North and South Dakota hope we can count on the support of the Appropriations Committee to help meet our future needs during the 1998 appropriations process, or, if necessary, in future supplemental requests. I realize that the rebuilding effort will take some time, and I would request the support of my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to help us fund additional disaster relief beyond this supplemental request as the true losses are determined.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment by Senators Conrad, Dorgan, Grams, Wellstone, Daschle, and Johnson. This is an amendment that is strongly supported and promoted by all six Senators in the three States devastated by the flooding of the Red River as well as the Minnesota River. It will increase the funds available in the bill for community development block grants from $100 to $500 million from funds offset from FEMA. 
While I appreciate the $100 million request by the President for CDBG funds, included in the supplemental, it was evident to me as I surveyed the damage in my own State, that $100 million for all 23 States covered in this bill, was not enough. Therefore, I am grateful to my colleagues, Senators Bond, Mikulski, Stevens, and Byrd for supporting this additional request, since I am well aware of how difficult it is for the committee to find the needed offsets. 
I am grateful also to the efforts of Lynn Stauss, the mayor of East Grand Forks, MN, who traveled to Washington to communicate the needs of his city to Senate leaders yesterday. Mayor Stauss had particular concerns that the $100 million in the bill, combined with limited FEMA funds, would not be enough to help the flood communities complete the mitigation process involved with actually moving homes and businesses off the flood plain. It seems reasonable to increase CDBG funding in the bill to allow these devastated communities to start the relocation process with the certainty they need to sign construction contracts and start the rebuilding before the Minnesota winter complicates that process. Further, one of FEMA's goals is to move people off the flood plain to minimize future flood losses. This funding will facilitate that process. 
I am pleased that the committee has made a commitment to address our funding needs through the supplemental conference committee as well as additional funding needs in the 1998 appropriations cycle and future supplementals. Since we are still paying for the 1993 floods in Minnesota, I am aware that the rebuilding effort is long-term, and I appreciate the concern and commitment of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to help us recover. 
Again, on behalf of Minnesota flood victims, I thank my colleagues on the committee, and all of my Senate colleagues for their support of this amendment.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as we know, the eyes of thousands of residents of Minnesota and North Dakota and South Dakota have been watching this debate today. I want to thank the chairman, Senator Stevens of Alaska, and all the others who have worked on this, like my colleague from Minnesota and the Senators from the Dakotas, for helping to provide flexible funding for the flooding disaster that ravaged our State and the Dakotas. We look to our colleagues in the House now to ensure that this additional money and community development block grants are preserved and the dollars make it into the hands of those who need it in these communities. 
I wanted to take a moment to say thank you very much, Mr. President, for all their hard work and for all the hard work on the floor. I know the eyes and ears of Minnesotans and South Dakota and North Dakota residents have been watching and they thank you as well.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, a good deal has been said about the terrible devastation in Minnesota in the Red River Valley and along the Minnesota River. When we visualize the disaster, we picture communities like Ada, Granite Falls, East Grand Forks, Montevideo, Breckenridge, Moorhead, and Warren submerged in river water. I have seen most of these communities first hand and have at once anguished over their loss and admired them for their courage. We tend to overlook some other folks in Minnesota who were equally devastated by the terrible floods that came so soon on the heels of a very long and blistering cold winter. We tend to overlook the same folks who, year-in and year-out, are charged with an enormous responsibility: feeding the world. 
It is estimated that over 3 million acres of prime farmland were under water at the height of the flooding. These are the same acres that Minnesota farmers use to produce much of the world's supply of potatoes, wheat, sugar, barley, corn, and soybeans. In short, without any exaggeration, this disaster upset the bread basket of the world. 
But, I am inexpressibly proud to report to my colleagues that it takes more than `hell and high water,' as the Grand Forks Herald put it, to keep Minnesota's farmers down. As a matter of fact, despite the absolutely staggering statistics--3 million acres under water, the loss of 2,300 farm homes, 2,500 farm buildings, 3,400 pieces of farm equipment, countless fences, 10,000 head of cattle, hogs, and sheep, 130,000 poultry, 2.3 million pounds of milk, and 15 percent of Minnesota's stored crop--Minnesota farmers have not shrunk from their occupation, or indeed, their avocation. Minnesota farmers have not shrunk from their job of feeding the world. In fact, I want my colleagues here to know that within 1 week of this calamity, every farmer that could manage, was back in the field. Mr. President, when one reflects on all the adversity Minnesota farmers have experienced in recent years--highlighted by the drought of 1988, the floods of 1993, the harsh winter storms in 1996 and 1997, and now the flooding--it instills in me a solid respect for our Minnesota farmers who work through whatever Mother Nature throws at them--and sometimes even get the best of her. 
But, just like everyone else, even the hardiest of people need a hand from time to time. And, this is such a time. That is why I am pleased that the disaster relief we now consider provides some $18 million in additional emergency loan assistance and $77 million in emergency conservation cost-share dollars. I am also pleased this legislation, which I trust will have speedy consideration and passage, provides $50 million for a livestock indemnity program to help livestock producers. 
Mr. President, on behalf of Minnesota farmers and ranchers, 
I am grateful for the commitment Congress and the President have made to those who guarantee America has the most abundant, most affordable, and most wholesome food supply in the world. 
Consistent with this commitment, I hope the administration, particularly the Department of Agriculture, will help our farmers through this difficult time. Specifically, in recent days, I have expressed to the Secretary of Agriculture my concern and the concern of many farmers and Farm Service Agency personnel in Minnesota over some very important matters. First, I am concerned the existing emergency loan assistance (ELA) Program may not assist all our disaster-stricken producers as the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration assist homeowners and businesses. Second, under current Federal Crop Insurance Corporation regulation, I am concerned that farmers may not be able to plant in time to ensure their crops are fully insured until fully harvested. And, third, I am concerned about many of our farmers who lost program or non-program crops in storage since these crops were largely uninsured. In the interest of equity for Minnesota's disaster-stricken farmers, I hope the Secretary will use his existing authorities to work with me to prevent these inequitable results. 
Mr. President, some time ago, Rudyard Kipling fondly wrote about the one who could: 
watch the things [he] gave [his] life to, broken, and stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools . . . [or] make one heap of all [his] winnings, and risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, and lose, and start again at [his] beginnings, and never breathe a word about [his] loss. 
I suspect Rudyard Kipling would have had a profound respect for Minnesota farmers.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a provision in the fiscal year 1997 supplemental appropriations bill which has received little attention so far, but would fund $100 million to begin paying U.S. arrears to the United Nations. 
As the chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations, I believe U.N. reform should be one of Congress' top foreign policy priorities this year. I know that this view is shared by the Republican leadership and other influential Members in both the House and Senate. 
There is general consensus among Republicans, and, perhaps, even some agreement among Democrats, that the only way to get real reforms enacted at the United Nations is by linking the payment of U.S. arrears, in legislation, to their achievement. The appropriation of $100 million in fiscal year 1997, which is even earlier than the administration had requested, for a down payment on U.S. arrears demonstrates congressional seriousness on this issue. 
I want to thank the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and Senator Gregg, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary, for working so closely with the Foreign Relations Committee on this provision. 
In the past, there has not always been such a cooperative spirit between the authorizing and appropriating committees on funding for foreign affairs and, therefore, I very much appreciate the efforts that Senators Stevens and Gregg have made to consult with those of us on the Foreign Relations Committee. 
Indeed, I am supporting this fiscal year 1997 appropriation to pay U.S. arrears because the bill specifically states that such funding must be subsequently authorized. The language reads that `none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act for payment of U.S. arrearages to the United Nations may be obligated or expended unless such obligation or expenditure is expressly authorized by the enactment of a subsequent act.' 
This language explicitly reinforces the role of the Foreign Relations Committee in authorizing or approving any funding for U.S. arrears. Therefore, let me make absolutely clear what I believe must happen before this $100 million appropriation for fiscal year 1997 can be expended. 
First, as I stated earlier, any legislation authorizing payment of U.S. arrears must condition such payment on the achievement of specific, meaningful U.N. reforms. 
Second, legislation authorizing any payment of U.S. arrears must be a comprehensive, multiyear plan. I would not support a 1-year authorization bill, which would simply allow the $100 million appropriated in fiscal year 1997 to be expended, but would fail to outline a longer-term vision for how this issue should be addressed. 
U.S. arrears provide crucial and unique leverage that can help encourage the United Nations and its member states to finally enact budget, personnel, and structural changes that will have a lasting, positive impact on how the United Nations functions. We should not squander or dilute this leverage by failing to enact comprehensive legislation that lays out exactly what the United States expects from the United Nations in exchange for almost $1 billion. 
Republicans have developed and proposed a 5-year plan to repay all legitimate arrears to the United Nations as long as specified reforms are achieved. This 5-year plan is fiscally responsible because it gives Congress a reasonable opportunity to find funding for U.S. arrears within the international affairs budget, known as the 150 account. It is sensible because it gives the United Nations a realistic timetable for enacting some of the more difficult reforms. And it is accountable to the American taxpayers by ensuring that the dollars the United States sends to the United Nations will go toward a more efficient organization. 
Just last year, President Clinton proposed a 5-year repayment plan for U.S. arrears. But this year, the administration has declined to support our responsible approach and, instead, insisted that it wants all arrears paid in full by the end of fiscal year 1999. 
As part of this request, the administration asked that Congress provide $100 million for arrears in fiscal year 1998 to give it diplomatic leverage in negotiating U.N. reforms. With the provision in S. 672, Congress has indicated that it is willing to begin paying back arrears even sooner, provided that an authorization bill is enacted and provided that the United Nations meets the reform conditions stipulated in that bill for the release of arrears in fiscal year 1997. 
Mr. President, in the next few weeks, the Foreign Relations Committee will be moving toward its markup of the fiscal year 1998-99 State Department authorization bill. Included in that bill will be our 5-year plan for paying U.S. arrears in exchange for U.N. reforms. If the administration wishes to have funding available to pay arrears in fiscal year 1997 or in future years, it would do well to give this legislation more serious consideration and embrace its commonsense provisions to advance meaningful reform at the United Nations.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we are going to be voting in a few minutes on the Grams-Johnson amendment that will help complement disaster relief efforts currently underway now in my home State of Minnesota, as well as North and South Dakota, by making it easier for farmers, homeowners, small businesses and local governments to help rebuild from the devastation that has been brought on by the floods. 
Our amendment, simply put, will permit Federal regulators to provide temporary and targeted modifications to current banking regulations. It will permit homeowners, farmers, and small businesses to have faster access to a larger pool of credit. It will also help banks and credit unions to reopen their doors faster to serve their communities. 
Also, Mr. President, the Grams-Johnson amendment is supported by the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and also the National Credit Union Administration.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as you know, over the past several weeks, towns and farms in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota have been battered by the floodwaters of the Red River. It is impossible to describe the devastation that the flooded Red River is causing in Minnesota and North Dakota, because the enormity of the damage, so far, is far beyond what anyone has ever put into words. 
The lives of those who live in the flooded areas have been shattered. Entire communities--homes, schools, churches, hospitals, libraries--have literally been washed away. Thousands of residents have no home to go to, so they crowd into shelters, unsure yet of what the river will leave behind when it finally releases its hold. Many cannot sleep because there is so much uncertainty. They cannot bathe because there is no running water. They cannot make plans because there are so many unanswered questions. 
Mr. President, I have been working with the Governor of Minnesota and my fellow Senators in the flood area to assess how to address the needs of these deserving people. Part of our effort has been to get the funds and assistance to rebuild through the supplemental appropriations bill that will, hopefully, pass today or tomorrow or Wednesday at the latest. Part of it has been to listen to the concerns of our constituents and to make sure that they do get speedy assistance from the agencies that are administering the State and Federal relief efforts. 
While I have been involved in many efforts to ease the suffering of my constituents, I am here today to offer as an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill, along with my colleague from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, the Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act. This amendment will complement the other relief efforts by making it easier for farmers, homeowners, small businesses and local governments to rebuild from the devastation that has been brought by the floods.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act will help speed up the pace of recovery for flooded farms and towns. Our amendment will permit homeowners, farmers, and small businesses to have faster access to a larger pool of credit from the banks and credit unions that serve their communities by ensuring that there will be no regulatory roadblocks to local lending. It will permit Federal banking and credit union regulators to make temporary exceptions to current laws that act to reduce access to banks and credit unions in disaster areas. It will also permit Federal regulators to provide temporary relief from regulations so that it will be easier for flood victims to get loans. 
The temporary regulatory relief offered by this bill is strictly limited to those counties in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota that have been declared Federal disaster areas. Because of its targeted scope and limited duration, it will permit flood victims to rebuild their homes, farms, and businesses without compromising the integrity of our banking system. 
When I served in the House of Representatives, I authored similar legislation in 1993 during the Mississippi River flooding. My legislation received bipartisan support and was signed into law by President Clinton as part of the supplemental appropriations bill for disaster relief. Since this legislation worked well to help flooded communities rebuild in 1993, I am here to urge my colleagues to again support this amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I just want to rise today and talk a little bit about the supplemental bill and the needs that are awaiting in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota as well. 
As a Senator whose state has been devastated by the flooding of the Red and Minnesota Rivers, I rise in strong support of the emergency supplemental that is before us. I have personally assessed the destruction on several occasions over the past few weeks. If I had not seen the damage myself, it would have been difficult to comprehend the severe impact the snows and floods have had on my State of Minnesota. 
My colleagues know of Minnesota's reputation for snow and cold. We are a hardy people and we pride ourselves on our ability to endure even the worst winters. But when we receive 3 years' worth of snow in a single season --that is more than 10 to 12 feet--even Minnesotans can reach their limit. To make matters worse, we have had to endure several straight years of above-average rainfall. With the arrival of spring this year, there was no place for the snow to go, other than into rivers unable to bear the melt-off. 
Many Americans watched the television coverage of Grand Forks, ND, and sympathized with the displaced residents of that community when the flood waters swept into town. They saw the burning buildings which have destroyed nearly a city block, all in a sea of water. But just across the Red River, on the Minnesota side, is East Grand Forks, a town of nearly 10,000 people. Their mayor, Lynn Stauss, whom I have talked to several times over the last few weeks, has had to deal with a town that has no water, has no electricity, and has no sewer system. 
When I was last in East Grand Forks, most of its homes and businesses were under water. Now that the waters are receding, assessment of the damage is continuing and, of course, the expenses are mounting. Willem Schrage, a Minnesota Department of Agriculture employee, returned to his home and found his basement backed up with 2 feet of sewage. Actually, he said he is one of the lucky ones, and says, `Things could be worse. At least I still have my home.' 
As you know, about 3 weeks ago, just as the spring thaw began to swell the rivers, Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit with another blizzard that dumped a couple of additional feet of snow. This contributed greatly to the severe flooding already predicted. 
At the time of year when farmers should be out in the fields, planting, they were out helping their neighbors sandbag to try to minimize the damage. Randy Tufton is an example of that. He is the director of the Farm Service Agency in Ada, MN, and wanted to spend his time helping farmers get the advice and financial assistance they need to cope with the floods. 
But instead, Randy found himself sandbagging his own home for several days. He had to travel by motorboat just to get to his house. 
Jerry Larson, a seed potato grower in the town of Climax, is another such example. Instead of planting this year, he is helping another farmer to try to save his home. Many of our farmers will be losing their homes and farm buildings to the floods. While some of them will be able to start planting after the water recedes, many are still unable to do so and may lose their income for this year. We had almost 2 million acres of farmland in our region under water. In the Red River Valley, one of the most fertile areas of the country, this is a crippling blow to our agricultural economy. 
Now we are coming to that time of year when high school students should be thinking about their proms and their graduation festivities. Instead, Don Vellenga, who is the superintendent of Ada Borup Public Schools in Ada is now meeting with FEMA officials to discuss replacing the high school, 67 percent of which has been damaged. There will be no prom this year at the high school and there will be no graduation ceremony either. Don Vellenga, by the way, after meeting with FEMA officials about the school during the day, goes home to a house that has 4 feet of standing water in the basement. 
In Breckenridge, at Breckenridge Elementary, Jeri Yaggie, president of the school board, is meeting with FEMA officials and wondering if the school will be replaced, as parents ask where their first graders will begin school this fall. 
Hospital administrators normally spend their time providing for the care of their patients. Laura Nelson, who is program director of Bridge Medical Services in Ada, is now looking for ways to get the additional money needed to replace the hospital there. 
In Moorhead, I was impressed by the dedication of our young people as they worked alongside their parents and their neighbors in filling sandbags against the rising waters. In East Grand Forks, there was an army of volunteers to feed the hungry, who found shelter for the homeless, and comforted thousands more as the Red River was swallowing an entire community. Their determination repeatedly reminded me of the spirit that brought us together as communities and will keep us together as communities. 
It was a week ago today, that I spoke about the flooding crisis before a joint session of our Minnesota State Legislature. I was proud to be accompanied by seven Minnesotans who know all too well the struggle it has taken to fight the floods. They were representatives of the towns that have suffered some of the worst damage, and they deserve our appreciation for guiding their communities through this nightmare. I want to take a moment to mention them by name. They were: Mayor Russell Onstad of Ada, Mayor Kal Michels of Breckenridge, Mayor Donald Osborne of Crookston, Mayor Lynn Stauss of East Grand Forks, Mayor David Smiglewski of Granite Falls, Mayor Jim Curtiss of Montevideo, and also City Council President Millie McLeod of Moorhead, who was there for Mayor Lanning at the meeting. They have served their neighbors well during these trying times. 
FEMA has done an outstanding job in Minnesota, and I would like to personally thank the staff, from the Director Mr. Witt, all the way down, for their yeoman-like efforts to be on the scenes and to help provide assistance to Minnesotans and those in North and South Dakota. 
When I inspected the flood damage with President Clinton, I was assured that the Government would help the people of Minnesota recover from its devastation. A week ago, the majority leader and our floor leader here today, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, made similar pledges during meetings with Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson and me. 
I would like to thank Senator Stevens for reporting out the emergency supplemental so rapidly. We all know how difficult it is to determine the exact extent of damage until the cleanup and the rebuilding is underway, but I believe the committee did an outstanding job to address the needs of the 23 States that have suffered disasters over the past few months. The total $5.581 billion for disaster relief is desperately needed. 
The $100 million for CDBG, the EDA money, and the assistance provided by USDA, including the livestock indemnity program in the supplemental, are crucial for Minnesota, where losses could add up to more than $1 billion once we have been able to accurately assess our damages. 
Governor Carlson expressed his support for the President's requests of $2.3 billion for FEMA and $100 million for CDBG in the supplemental when he was here in Washington as well last week. At the same time, he recognized that once we obtain an accurate accounting, additional relief could be pursued through the 1998 appropriations process, and/or a future supplemental request that would be made by the President. 
I am also pleased that the committee included language I supported that would provide more flexibility in the granting of CDBG funds. That language was useful to the State of Minnesota, as you know, after the 1993 Mississippi River flooding and was requested by the State for this year's flood as well. 
Some have raised concerns that it is too early to fully estimate the extent of the damage and therefore we may find ourselves with inadequate funding in this bill. To address those concerns, I am working with my colleagues from North Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota on an amendment that would add additional funding for CDBG and EDA that represents a better estimate of what we believe the damages will be in our three States. The amendment would also include funding for meeting the education needs of displaced students in our States plus several other smaller items that are not covered yet in the bill. 
The amendment would be a compromise among the three States and hopefully the appropriators, who believe they have addressed our needs for the remainder of this fiscal year and prefer to consider longer-term rebuilding requests through the regular appropriations process. It would be offset with current budget authority. 
Mr. President, earlier I discussed some of the devastation faced by Minnesota farmers, many of whom are still not sure when they can begin planting for this year. I strongly support the efforts by Secretary Glickman to help farmers through authorization of CRP grazing, increasing the Emergency Loan Assistance Program, deferring payments for FSA borrowers, and inclusion of more farm losses under FEMA itself. 
Since it is uncertain whether existing agriculture or FEMA programs will address the needs of all Minnesota farmers, I have also asked Secretary Glickman to consider extending the delayed planting deadline for crop insurance, as well. I have requested clarifications on how, or whether, the disaster relief would cover soil erosion and other run-off problems. 
I have asked the Secretary to consider using existing authority under CCC to address the grain storage losses of Minnesota farmers, as well as other property losses suffered by farmers who may not currently qualify for the Emergency Loan Assistance Program. 
Mr. President, I want to note again that earlier this afternoon I offered my amendment, the Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act of 1997, or more commonly referred to as DIDRA, which would facilitate and increase the availability of credit in the disaster areas of all 23 States. 
It is noncontroversial, costs nothing, and is supported by the Banking Committee chairman and ranking member, and my colleague from South Dakota, Senator Johnson. I urge support from all of my colleagues. 
Mr. President, the funds provided by the emergency supplemental will facilitate the cleanup effort, which has just begun. We know it will take many months and possibly several years. The worst part of a disaster like this is the aftermath, when the extent of the damage finally sinks in to all who have suffered losses. It is a time when we need to reach out to those within the disaster area and let them know they have our full support. 
It is gestures like that of the California woman who contributed $2,000 apiece to thousands of suffering flood victims as one we will remember for some time. She is one of many heroes of the floods whose efforts will never be fully recognized. 
To ensure that I am thoroughly appraised of every step in the cleanup, I have opened an office in Crookston with FEMA to have staff on location to provide whatever assistance we can to facilitate available relief. I want to assure my constituents that I will not allow them to be forgotten now that the flood waters have receded. 
Mr. President, I again want to thank the Senate for its efforts to facilitate this needed relief legislation.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as we discuss the topic of voluntarism, I rise today to acknowledge a group of individuals who are making a very big difference, a tremendous difference as the people of Minnesota are fighting the floodwaters that have paralyzed so much of our State. 
The men and women of the Minnesota National Guard have stepped up these last several weeks and served with distinction under what have been very deplorable conditions. Battling a rising river is back-breaking work in itself. It is nearly impossible when combined with the ice and the extreme cold produced by a blizzard. Yet those are the conditions that the Guard endured as they worked side by side with the residents of Minnesota's flood devastated communities. 
Well over 2,000 National Guard troops have been called up to assist in both preventing flood damage and cleaning up when the waters finally begin to recede. These are men and women who have full-time jobs and lives outside the Guard and take time away from their other responsibilities to fulfill an obligation they feel to Minnesota and its communities. Many of the mayors and elected officials within the declared disaster area told me that the Guard has been such an integral part of their flood response efforts that they cannot imagine being without their assistance. 
The National Guard have always been instrumental in so many ways, in so many communities, that it is nearly impossible to list every activity in which they have been involved. 
Now, as the flood waters began to rise, they helped with the sandbagging that saved so many homes and buildings. They went door to door, urging residents to leave before the waters forced them to go. They put their engineering expertise to work, finding ways to ward off the flooding. And when it came time to evacuate, the National Guard played a key role moving Minnesotans to safety, whether by helicopter or truck, and helped evacuate nursing homes and hospitals. When all the residents were gone, they were there to guard the deserted towns and kept away sightseers and potential looters. The Guard's water purification units and electrical generators have been invaluable during the flooding. 
The members of the Minnesota National Guard have served with little sleep and under the worst of conditions, but they have continually exceeded our expectations and they deserve a great deal of the credit for leading us through this time of crisis. Without the Guard, I think it is safe to say that a great many more lives would have been lost and a great deal more property would have been damaged. They have earned the respect and the deep gratitude of all Minnesotans and I salute them for standing with us and I thank them for their service. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. I want to take a little bit of time this afternoon to talk about voluntarism, the subject we are debating on the floor this afternoon, and to add to that a discussion about the supplemental disaster appropriations bill that we will hopefully take up this week, dealing with the flood waters of northwest Minnesota and northern North and South Dakota. 
I think it is a shame a bill that is so plain and so simple and so necessary as the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997, or S. 543, has been stopped from coming to the floor of this Senate for debate. I think it is kind of ironic when you look at what has been going on in Philadelphia over the weekend, the talk of voluntarism. 
You do not have to attend a conference in Philadelphia to find voluntarism, Mr. President. If you want to discuss that subject, you need to look no further than those Minnesota communities that have been so devastated by flood waters. In the Midwest we consider ourselves independent. We proudly celebrate our differences, yet we also take great pride in knowing that when our communities call on us, that we are very quick to come together. We have seen that happen so many times during the flooding. 
I have heard some of my colleagues talk against this bill on voluntarism and how really we need a program of training because you have to have people trained in order to come in and perform adequate or good volunteer work. That might be true in some cases, but that does not get to the heart or the point of this bill. There is not much time to do on-the-job training when there is an accident, when somebody is caught in a burning car, when they have fallen off a bridge, or another disaster has befallen them such as the flooding of Minnesota. 
In Moorhead, the dedication of our young people impressed me as they worked alongside their parents and neighbors in filling sandbags against the rising waters. They did not get training for that ahead of time. That was on-the-job training, something they had to do at the time. In East Grand Forks, an army of volunteers fed the hungry, found shelter for the homeless, and comforted thousands more as the Red River swallowed an entire community. People have been evacuated from their homes, people were moved out of nursing homes and hospitals. This was all done on an emergency basis, by volunteers who offered their help and their time. Again, they do not have time for training. They react to the situation that is needed. 
In Ada, Mr. President, when the easiest thing in the world would have been to give up what seemed to be a hopeless battle against the rising river, nobody gave up. Over and over again, I witnessed simple acts of fellowship, demonstrations of stewardship, and above all, voluntarism, neighbors helping neighbors, and was reminded of the spirit that brought us together as communities and that will keep these communities together, I believe in the future. 
Voluntarism is a lofty goal and it usually shows itself in times of emergency, but you cannot just pass it by mere legislation. The anguish that rose every day with the flood waters has not been confined to those communities along the Red River or the Minnesota River. That pain has been felt in every corner of my State, and Minnesotans have responded with a tremendous outpouring of not only sympathy, but real, tangible offers of help. The volunteers were there when we needed them. The telephones at the Red Cross and the Salvation Army have been ringing constantly as people asked where can they send donations. Thousands have called the State's emergency operation center to sign up as volunteers for the long weeks of cleanup to come. Scout troops are also pitching in, churches are taking up special offerings, schools and families from parts of the State not touched by the floods have offered to host students without homes and teachers without classrooms. That is the spirit of voluntarism that Americans are capable of. 
Mr. President, I have come to the floor to argue and to urge my colleagues to support the supplemental disaster appropriation, again, that we hope to take up yet this week in the Senate. The breadth of the flooding in Minnesota and the Dakotas has been difficult to comprehend. If you have not been there, if I had not seen it, I would not have believed that a pair of raging rivers could produce such widespread devastation. The cost has been enormous, both in the financial costs which may run well over $1 billion just on the Minnesota side, and the emotional and personal costs to our fellow Minnesotans, many of whom watched their homes, farms, businesses, and basically their possessions just literally washed away. 
I inspected the flood damage last week with President Clinton and also the week before with Vice President Gore. Without hesitation, they all assured me that the taxpayers of this Nation would stand with the people of Minnesota today and they would be there and remain with us until every family that had lost a home would have a home, and every life that had been turned upside down would somehow be righted again. Again, we cannot make everybody whole, but we need to be able to be there 
with whatever help and assistance we can afford. Senate majority leader Trent Lott made a similar pledge last Friday when he met with Governor Carlson of Minnesota and myself to talk about the promises that Washington has made, and promises we will make sure it lives up to. 
It is imperative we bring the disaster aid legislation to the floor and we pass it this week. There are thousands upon thousands of Americans who are depending on us to meet our responsibilities and also to deliver the aid that we have promised. 
To avoid Government's possible disruptions in future funding, we should also have a good Government contingency plan in place to make sure that the Government has the ability to continue supporting in the areas that it can, with aid and other supports. This is the way to ensure that the needs of our flood victims in Minnesota will be met now and will be met in the near future and in the long run. After all, the aid we are promising, the aid that we will debate this week on the floor, $488 million that the President has requested for the Midwest flooding and the Red River Basin will only be 20 percent or 25 percent of what the long-term aid and dollars are going to be. 
If we do not reach agreement that we will be able to keep the Government running to assure that the Government will be there in October, in November, they could be without the Government assistance they are depending on. This is good Government. It would help to take politics out of the process, because if we cannot come to terms on a budget agreement down the road, we cannot afford to have our flood relief efforts halted because of that. 
Now, this is not playing games with the flood victims, as we have heard the charges here on the floor today. It would cost no money. We are not asking for additional money. We want to put in place a process, and this should have been there last year, it should have been there 2 years ago, and it should be there next year if it is needed, this is not playing games with any of the flood victims, with their families, or their possessions or their future. This is to help guarantee that the aid and the help and the supplies will be there. 
It is an effort to take politics out of the process, because if the budget debate that we have this year does not result in a total budget, we do not want any part of this Government to shut down. We want to make sure that the Government is up and running and that nobody--no Government service, no Government program, no Government employee, no people relying on those type of services--will be held hostage. 
I am right now disturbed by the political gamesmanship that is already being played, talking about this, going on, while our constituents are out there waiting for aid, emergency aid, short-term funds and long-term, that we need to pass this bill immediately this week. It is the responsible thing to do, again, because the disaster aid today nor the Federal services, and again the programs and employees that we should keep funding, must not be held political hostage in the near future. So we have to make sure that we pass some reasonable and some good Government contingency plans along with this. I hope it is part of this bill. I hope it has overwhelming support to ensure that these obligations are met. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 651, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code to exempt charitable gambling activities from Federal unrelated business income tax [UBIT]. 
Charitable gambling consists mostly of games such as pull tabs and raffles. The difference between charitable and regular gambling is where and how the profit is spent. Most of the income derived from charitable gambling games are spent in communities to fund activities such as Boy and Girl Scouts, Head Start, and city and school programs. 
In fact, charitable gambling and bingo games have become one of the most important sources to provide funding for many activities in communities for people of all ages. In my home State, Minnesota, charitable gambling pumped up $77.5 million in profits into a variety of community and charitable causes in 1995. The beneficiaries include youth recreation and eduction, as well as organizations serving the sick, handicapped, retarded and disabled and many other community programs. 
Many charitable gambling games are set up solely for the purpose of raising money for public projects, thus reducing the burden on taxpayers. For example, Minnesota Belle Plaine Friends of the 
Library charitable gambling was started 4 years ago for the purpose of helping fund a new library in town. Today, they have donated more than $105,000 to the library project. 
In 1978, President Carter signed into law a bill that classified bingo income as related business income. As a result, this charitable game is not subject to the Federal UBIT. But the law did not include other forms of charitable gambling. Consequently, the income of these charitable gambling games is taxed under the UBIT. 
Taxes take a big bite out of charitable gambling income. It has seriously undermined nonprofit organizations' ability to provide financial assistance for local activities. Here is an example of the revenue loss. Last year, the Minnesota American Legion donated $103,000 to the Cancer Research Center at the University of Minnesota. However, under current law, the income is subject to the UBIT. Only $5,150 of the $103,000 was a deductible contribution, and $97,850 was taxed at rates up to 38 percent. 
This is simply not fair. Charitable donations should be encouraged, not penalized, to fund more local initiatives, projects and programs that benefit our communities. That's what the bill is all about.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to speak about a subject this morning dealing with the flood situations back in Minnesota, and North Dakota and South Dakota as well. 
Mr. President, as you know, over the past several weeks, towns and farms in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota have been battered by the flood waters of the Red River and Minnesota River. It is impossible to describe the devastation the floods are causing in Minnesota and North Dakota because the enormity of the damage is far, far beyond what anyone has ever had to put into words. 
As I made my third trip into the flood disaster area this week, traveling with President Clinton and my colleagues in the Minnesota and North Dakota congressional delegations, I found myself searching for adjectives but finding none that could reflect the loss and heartache inflicted upon our neighbors. Their lives have been shattered. Entire communities--homes, schools, churches, hospitals, libraries--have literally been washed away. Thousands of residents have no home to go home to, so they crowd into shelters, unsure what the river will leave behind when it finally releases its hold. 
Many cannot sleep because there is so much uncertainty. They cannot bathe because there is no running water. They cannot make plans because there are so many unanswered questions. 
At the moment, it does not seem like much of a life. By nature, Minnesotans are a stoic people. In a land where the temperatures can plunge to 30 degrees below zero in mid-winter and soar past a hundred in the summer, we have learned how to get on with life without too much complaining. But for many, the veneer is wearing a little thin. It is hard to be stoic when you have lost your home and your job. It is hard to look forward to tomorrow when all you have got is a cot on the floor of an airplane hanger, where you may be living for weeks. 
Mr. President, I am working with the Governor of Minnesota and my fellow Senators in the flood area to assess how to address the needs of these deserving people. Part of our effort will be to get the funds and assistance to rebuild through the supplemental appropriations bill that we will pass next week. Part of it will be the efforts of myself and my staff to listen to the concerns of our constituents, and to make sure they get speedy assistance from the agencies that are administering the State and Federal relief efforts. 
I would like to announce this morning that I am opening a new, temporary office in Crookston, with FEMA and other members of our delegation, and my staff will be immediately available to help out in the flood relief projects that are currently underway. 
While I will be involved in many efforts to ease the suffering of my constituents, I am here today to introduce--with my colleague from South Dakota, Senator Johnson--the Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act. This bill will complement the other relief efforts by making it easier for farmers, homeowners, small businesses, and local governments to rebuild from the devastation brought by the floods. 
The Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act will help speed up the pace of recovery for the flooded farms and towns. Our legislation will permit homeowners, farmers, and small businesses to have faster access to a larger pool of credit from the banks and credit unions that serve their communities, by ensuring that there will be no regulatory roadblocks to local lending. It will permit Federal banking and credit union regulators to make temporary exceptions to current laws that act to reduce access to banks and credit unions in disaster areas. It will also permit Federal regulators to provide temporary relief from regulations so that it is easier for flood victims to get loans. 
The temporary regulatory relief offered by this bill is strictly limited to those counties in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota that have been declared Federal disaster areas. Because of its targeted scope and limited duration, it will permit flood victims to rebuild their homes, farms, and businesses without compromising the integrity of our banking system. 
When I served in the House of Representatives, I authored similar legislation in 1993 during the Mississippi River flooding. My legislation received bipartisan support, and was signed into law by President Clinton as part of the supplemental appropriations bill for disaster relief. Since this legislation worked well to help flooded communities rebuild in 1993, I will ask Chairman Stevens to include this bill as part of the emergency supplemental that the Senate will likely be considering next week. I urge my colleagues to support my effort.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we need to assure the people of Minnesota and North Dakota that the Senate stands behind them,. . . . and that the entire Congress and the President stand behind them as well. 
I urge swift action on my legislation and the emergency supplemental appropriations, which I expect will have the overwhelming, bipartisan support of my colleagues when it comes to the floor. 
Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson and his staff have been here in Washington these past two days, working with my staff and that of my colleagues to ensure Federal officials are doing everything in their power to help our residents put their lives back together. 
Director James Witt and his team at FEMA have been outstanding. I can say with confidence that everyone here understands the gravity of the situation and the magnitude of the work that remains.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Senior Citizens Home Equity Protection Act. This bill will help protect low-income seniors from being gouged by people who are charging them massive and unnecessary referral fees when they receive a reverse mortgage through the Federal Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Insurance Demonstration Program. 
The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Insurance Demonstration Program is a Federal program to benefit low- to moderate-income seniors that was authorized by section 417 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987. 
HECM provides an FHA guarantee for a special type of home equity loan for homeowners who are 62 years of age or older. HECM permits a senior citizen to borrow against the equity of his or her home. The senior receives cash through a reverse mortgage by either: First, a lump sum payment, second, a lifetime guaranteed monthly payment, third, a line of credit, or fourth a combination of monthly payment and line of credit. The HECM loan is repaid after the senior citizen passes away by his or her estate. 
Since the program's inception, approximately 20,000 loans have been closed. HECM is a good program, because it permits low-income seniors who are homeowners to be able to conveniently tap into their home equity. The median age of the participants is 76 years old and the median income level is approximately $10,000 a year. 
Unfortunately, a few companies are calling up seniors to let them know about the availability of HECM and then charging them a referral fee of 8 to 10 percent of the total loan. This is a scam, as the senior could contact a lender or HUD directly and not have to pay such a fee. 
The Senior Citizens Home Equity Protection Act responds to this problem. This bill amends section 255 of the National Housing Act to permit HUD, which manages this Federal program, to define and prohibit excessive referral fees for the HECM program. 
I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I commend Senator D'Amato for bringing this bill before us today. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the Chemical Weapons Convention [CWC] with the full complement of 33 conditions on U.S. participation, which are now being considered by the Senate. 
As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have been reviewing and studying this treaty for over a year now and have had some serious reservations about the CWC throughout that process. 
Therefore, I believe the conditions in Senate Executive Resolution 75 are essential to ensuring that the CWC has real benefits for American national security and will be truly verifiable and effective. Before we commit the American taxpayers to paying more than $100 million annually for U.S. participation in the treaty, we owe them nothing less. 
Let me outline the conditions I believe are the most important. 
First, I am pleased the Clinton administration has finally reversed its long-standing position that the CWC would prevent U.S. soldiers from using tear gas to rescue downed pilots or to avoid deadly force when enemy troops are using civilians as human shields. 
Second, we must be sure that Russia will both comply with the existing chemical weapons destruction agreements it has already signed, and that it will ratify the CWC. Russia has the largest chemical weapons stockpile in the world and its compliance with earlier agreements will help the United States be more confident of its ability to monitor Russian compliance with the CWC. 
This is especially important given reports that Russia has already developed new chemical weapons programs specifically designed to evade the treaty. More than 15 months after the United States ratified the START II Treaty, Russia has refused to follow suit. What makes us think that if we join the CWC before Russia does, it will then follow our example? 
Third, the CWC will not protect American soldiers from chemical attack unless it has a serious and immediate impact on those countries that have hostile intentions toward the United States. This means that countries which are suspected of having chemical weapons programs and are sponsors of terrorism--such as Libya, Syria, Iraq, and North Korea--must participate in the CWC. Just this morning, a newspaper article reported that a prominent North Korean defector has warned that his former country is fully prepared to launch a chemical weapons attack on its neighbors. North Korea has not yet signed the CWC. 
Fourth, we need to provide as much protection as possible for U.S. Government facilities and businesses when faced with international inspections. While the CWC does allow the United States to refuse specific inspectors, it should be a matter of policy that we will not accept inspectors from terrorist states like Iran. We are certainly justified in suspecting that these inspectors would be intent on gaining access to classified or confidential business information. 
Fifth, I understand the administration has offered assurances that the United States will not seek to transfer chemical technology or information about chemical defenses to countries that might put it to harmful use. But because of the vagueness of the treaty language, we need to go further to prevent the proliferation of chemical weapons. 
We need to close off the possibility that other countries could use language in the treaty as cover for their desires to transfer chemical technology to countries like Iran. As we have seen in Iraq and North Korea, nuclear technology acquired supposedly for peaceful purposes can advance weapon capabilities. 
Sixth and finally, we need to be sure that the CWC is effectively verifiable, meaning that the United States has a high degree of confidence in its ability to detect significant violations. I strongly supported the START II Treaty because it met this traditional standard. If we don't think we can detect cheating under the CWC, it seriously calls into question the value of the treaty. 
Recently, there have been reports that China is selling chemical weapons components to Iran. Both countries have signed the CWC and, therefore, are supposedly committed to banning such activity. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, there are conditions in the current resolution of ratification for the CWC that address every single one of the concerns I have mentioned. 
I sincerely intend to support and vote for the Chemical Weapons Convention as long as the resolution of ratification is fortified with such strong conditions. They will help ensure that this treaty will have a real impact on the proliferation of chemical weapons and provide proven protection for U.S. forces. 
However, I understand that some of my colleagues may try to strip out these important conditions on the CWC. This would be very unfortunate and would cause me to reconsider my current support for the treaty. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against any killer amendments that would strike these conditions and, therefore, deprive the United States of assurances that the Chemical Weapons Convention is effective, enforceable and verifiable. The American taxpayers, who will be funding U.S. participation in the CWC, deserve a treaty that unquestionably and unambiguously advances our national security. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my visit to Minnesota last week to see firsthand the floods that have ravaged my State, as well as North and South Dakota, and the damage left behind in the water's wake. For the many Minnesotans who live and work in counties devastated by these floods, this continues to be a very difficult and emotional time. 
Let me say first that President Clinton has approved the request of Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson to declare an additional 25 counties a major disaster area. That would help to bring to 46 the total number of counties eligible to receive Federal disaster assistance. 
As Governor Carlson said in making his request to the President, this assistance will help to get people back into their homes. 
The worst may not be over for many Minnesotans, however, especially those in the Red River Valley. Upstream on the Red River at Breckenridge, over 400 people were evacuated yesterday from the southern section of the community. It appears that the river may have stopped rising, and efforts will continue today to try and save the rest of the city. 
There is still the danger that the river might crest all at once from Wahpeton south of Fargo to Grand Forks on the north because of water created by melting snow. 
Last Thursday, I traveled with Senators Conrad and Dorgan of North Dakota, Senator Wellstone of Minnesota, and other members of the congressional delegation, along with James Lee Witt, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Administration, to the cities of Ada, Moorhead, and many others. I traveled the next day with Vice President Al Gore to survey the damage in Breckenridge and elsewhere in western Minnesota. 
On Saturday, I visited Red Cross and emergency service centers with Minnesota Lieutenant Governor Joanne Benson. At each stop over those 3 days, we witnessed widespread devastation and the strength of Minnesota's community spirit, as we spoke with many citizens whose lives have been turned upside down by the floods. 
The disastrous flooding has severely disrupted the lives of many Minnesotans. Dreams of enjoying warm spring weather after a brutally long Minnesota winter has been replaced with efforts to ensure families and communities are safe and that adequate food, water, and shelter is available. 
I am pleased that both State and Federal tax filing deadlines have been extended for those taxpayers living within the disaster areas. 
Later this week, I will introduce legislation modeled after a bill I signed into law during the Midwest floods of 1993 to help ease lending regulations in those disaster-declared areas as well. This will make it easier for the restructuring of loans and prevent unnecessary foreclosures on farmers and other small businesses. The flooding--and the snow, the ice, and the cold that made relief efforts extremely difficult--has been an exhausting nightmare for those who are in it, and it has been agonizing for the rest of the Nation to watch. The Minnesotans I met with at the flood sites we traveled to have been tested time and time again. 
The floods of 1997 are creating an agricultural disaster as well. While hard numbers do not exist yet, more than 2 million acres of Minnesota cropland are now under water, affecting thousands of farms, and all of Wilkin County's 400,000 acres of cropland are flooded. In Clay County, it is 200,000 acres under water. 
It has been estimated that farmers who already lost more than $100 million due to the blizzards that caused the floods could now have flood losses totaling over $1 billion. 
Dairy farmers have been hit especially hard, forcing them to dump hundreds of thousands of pounds of milk because milk trucks could not reach them. The biggest problem has been getting out to the farms that are surrounded by water. 
Spring planting, which is normally just 2 weeks away, will be a problem in parts of southern Minnesota. Along the Red River Valley, more than 40 percent of the sugar beet crop is normally planted by the end of April. No one will be planting by then this year. 
According to the National Weather Service, flood warnings remain in effect until April 20 along the Mississippi from St. Paul to Red Wing, as well as for portions of the St. Croix and the Minnesota rivers. 
Red Cross volunteers have begun to close emergency shelters and are now distributing flood cleanup kits. By the end of last week, the Red Cross had served more than 55,000 meals to sandbaggers and those people in shelters. 
While tough times are still ahead, I was moved by Minnesotans coming together for the common goal of protecting and cleaning up their communities. 
In Ada, people are tense, weary from days of flood relief work, and still shaken by their losses. For those lucky enough to remain in their homes, the loss of heat and electricity were devastating in the harsh, winter-like conditions. 
You may have read the story of Ada residents Warren and Colleen Goltz. Although the Goltzes lost electricity as water in a nearby drainage ditch began to rise, they decided to stay in their house. Four feet of water seeped into the basement, ruining many of their possessions. 
They burned old newspapers in the fireplace to keep warm, but the temperature fell to 38 degrees. Finally, a friend arrived with a generator, another dropped off firewood, and another opened his house so they could use the phone. 
As Rev. Earl Schmidt of the Zion Lutheran Church of Ada said, `It's going to make us much more caring for each other. I hope it makes us look to God more, obviously. And it's given us a quick lesson in survival.' 
We have been inspired once again by people of Minnesota, who have rallied together for their communities as they always do when tragedy strikes. It is during critical times such as these that we finally understand the importance of neighbor helping neighbor. 
At a time when we rarely make the effort to get to know and appreciate our neighbors, Minnesotans in a great many of our communities have formed lasting bonds over this past week and found their civic spirit had been restored. 
Mr. President, I was equally impressed with the efforts of Minnesota's young people. All too often we hear and read about young people who are not responsible, who do not care about their community. 
Last week, I witnessed countless occasions when young and old worked together, filling and hauling sandbags, feeding those who had lost their homes, and finding them shelter. They set a remarkable example for the rest of the Nation. 
Much work has been done, but the most difficult work is yet to be accomplished, and that will be the cleanup that takes place over the next few months, after the news crews have moved on, the TV cameras have been hauled away, and the spotlight has shifted to another part of the country. 
I will be working with the Governor's office and with local officials to ensure that available Federal assistance will be distributed to those counties that so desperately need it. 
Mr. President, last week I witnessed neighbor helping neighbor and volunteers working side by side to help save their communities. It is this kind of determination that will lead people through these difficult times, as we deal with what one Minnesotan described as `a flood frozen in place.' 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, there are 365 days in each calendar year, but I can think of no other date that the American people await with such universal dread as April 15, tax day. 
However, there is one other date working Americans should look upon with equal disdain, and that is the date that says a great deal about the Federal, State, and local tax burden working families are expected to bear. That date is May 9, this year's tax freedom day. 
As it does every year, the Tax Foundation has calculated the date the average American stops working just to pay their share of the tax burden and begins working for themselves. This year, tax freedom day falls on May 9. And while the use of the word `freedom' in tax freedom day implies something to celebrate, working Americans have absolutely nothing to celebrate when it comes to their taxes. 
Tax freedom day falls a full day later this year than it did in 1996, meaning taxpayers must work 128 days before they can count a single penny of their salary as their own. 
Of those days, 44 will be spent paying personal income taxes; 38 days will be spent paying payroll taxes; sales and excise taxes, 18 days; property taxes, 12 days; corporate income taxes, 13 days; also 3 days will be spent paying miscellaneous taxes. 
When you total all that up, that is 128 days, Mr. President, 128 days in which the American people spend imprisoned by their own tax system. If the cost of complying with the tax system itself were included in the calculations, tax freedom day would be pushed forward another 13 days. 
The tax burden on middle-class Americans is rising rapidly. Taxpayers are now working an entire week longer to pay off their taxes than they were when President Clinton first took office in 1993. That sounds like Government getting larger and more expensive, not the `era of big Government is over.' If you calculate the tax load in hours and minutes, instead of days, Americans spend fully 2 hours and 49 minutes of each 8-hour workday laboring to pay their taxes. 
That is a great deal more than the 1 hour, 40 minutes it takes to pay for their family's food, clothing, and shelter. 
May 9 marks the arrival of Tax Freedom Day for the average State. 
Unfortunately for taxpayers in my home State, Minnesota ranks well above average in the tax burden my constituents are forced to bear. In 1997, Tax Freedom Day will not arrive in Minnesota until 4 days later, until May 13. Only five other States and the District of Columbia mark Tax Freedom Day as late or later than we do. 
There has never been a time in our history when the need for tax relief was so obvious and so great. Let us make 1997 the year we enact the $500 per-child tax credit. Let us make 1997 the year we kill off the death tax. Let us make 1997 the year we promote savings and investment by cutting capital gains. Let us not let another Tax Day go by before we deliver on our promise of substantial relief for the American taxpayers. 
Mr. President, it is not a normal practice of mine to quote poetry on the Senate floor. I prefer to leave the rhymes to those Senators who possess a more poetic nature than I. But because this is Tax Day, I would like to share the closing lines of a poem by Ogden Nash and then follow it up with a final comment. 
`Abracadabra, thus we learn 
The more you create, the less you earn. 
The less you earn, the more you're given, 
The less you lead, the more you're driven, 
The more destroyed, the more they feed, 
The more you pay, the more they need, 
The more you earn, the less you keep, 
And now I lay me down to sleep. 
I pray the Lord my soul to take 
If the tax-collector hasn't got it before I wake.' 
It was 1935 when Mr. Nash first published his poem warning of the dangers of a tax system run amuck. At that time in our history, the Federal tax rate was less than four percent. 
Now, I cannot imagine what kind of poem Mr. Nash would write today, at a time when Washington demands an average 28 percent of our income in taxes. And even if I could imagine what Mr. Nash would write I am not sure I would be allowed to read it on the floor of the Senate.

Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I would like to talk a little bit about tax day and, of course, the arguments going on here in the last few minutes about taxes and who should pay them, how much should be paid. I find it a little ironic, but perhaps not surprising, that efforts to get a couple of resolutions on the floor to approve or have the Senate go on record that the American taxpayer, the American family, the American working people need tax relief--we tried to get just a resolution approved under a unanimous-consent agreement, but it was denied. 
Many talk about tax relief. The only problem is there are many more in this body who talk against tax relief. I have been a strong supporter of family tax relief, and I have been the author and have supported for the last 4 years an effort to get a $500-per-child tax credit across the board. That is not really enough, because when you look at how we support families and children, if we kept pace--and a lot of you just looked at your 1040 forms, 1040EZ forms, and you found out for every dependent you can deduct $2,550. If that had kept pace with inflation from 1955, it would be worth over $9,000. So over the last 20 or 30 years, somehow we have found children or families less worthy of tax relief than we do today. 
We talk about other tax relief, like the death tax, the estate tax. In other words, you have worked all your life, you have tried to put something away, as you are encouraged to do, to provide for your family after you are gone, to be able to leave your children or your spouse some money for the means of doing better. But yet, when you die, the Government wants to come in and take the majority of it. I think it was Paul Harvey who went through this the other day on the radio and talked about if you had a $3 million estate, by the time the Government got finished taking money away from you through penalties, et cetera, and the estate tax and everything else, your family would get $400,000, the Government would get $2.6 million of that. 
If you had an estate of $1.9 million, the tax on it would be 85 percent that would go to the Government. What kind of a message does this send to anybody? Does it tell you that you should save? `Why? I'm going to save up all my money so that the day I die, the Government can come in and take 85 percent of it away from my kids.' 
We talk about the death tax, and we talk about eliminating the estate tax. You worked all your life, you have already paid your taxes on those dollars. This is after-tax income, and yet, when you die, the Government says, `That's not enough, we want the bulk of whatever you have in your savings account and cap gains tax.' 
There is always talk about how it is only a tax cut for the wealthy. Granted, there are people who have money who are going to benefit from this, but it is capital they are going to reinvest. When we talk about being able to provide an economy for working families in this country, we need to grow, and that needs investments, it needs capital, no matter where it comes from--foreign investors, local, domestic. We need those dollars. 
Right now, it is estimated that $7.5 trillion is locked up in old investments; in other words, in companies that maybe are not as efficient as new companies, old products that could be replaced by new, because of penalties of taking your money out of one investment to put into another, and the Government is standing there to grab a majority of it. In other words, people cannot afford to take it out of one investment because the Government is going to confiscate a large part of that. So those investments remain locked up. What we are saying is cap gains would release a flood of new investments into new jobs, new companies, new products; it would expand the economy, it would provide new revenues. 
I know my time is going to run out, but let me talk quickly about tax cuts. We always hear these charges of where did the deficit go wrong, and they all go back and blame it on Ronald Reagan in 1981. He said, `Let's have some tax relief for Americans,' and he pushed through a tax relief package. During 1981 to 1990, revenues to the Federal Government nearly doubled. They increased 99.4 percent--99.4 percent--but that was not enough because this Congress spent 112 percent. They spent far exceeding even the growth in the revenues. 
They say, and we have seen the charts this morning, `Let's look at where the blame is; the blame is the Reagan-Bush administrations because that is when the deficits went up, and let's give all the credit to President Clinton because this is where the deficit is coming down.' 
Let's retrace that. During the Reagan-Bush administrations, who controlled the purse strings? Who was in control of Congress? I don't want to throw stones, but I think everybody knows. It was controlled by Democrats. Who controlled spending? Ronald Reagan suggested and was able to get through tax relief under the premise that for every $1 in tax relief, there would be a $2 reduction in spending. But once the revenues came in, the eyes got big and people just could not 
resist being the good guy on the block and taking your money and spending it. In fact, they spent it so fast they even outspent a rapidly growing economy. 
Who was to blame? It was not Reagan or Bush, it was the democratically controlled Congress spending the dollars. 
Let's look at the last 4 years. They say in the last 4 years, deficits have actually gone down. From 1993 to 1995, they went down because Bill Clinton got through the largest tax increase in history. Again, who passed it? It was Congress who passed it, and that was controlled by the Democrats. So we did have deficit reduction but, again, because of tax increases. In fact, this Congress has raised taxes once on average every 22 months. 
The last 2 years, under a Republican controlled Congress, deficits continued to go down, but because of reductions in spending. 
Here we have a difference in philosophy. We could balance the budget if we take 80 percent of everything you make. We can probably balance the budget and still increase spending, but it would come out of somebody's pocket. I don't know, it does not seem to make sense. In a recent USA/CNN poll, 70 percent of Americans said they wanted tax relief, meaningful tax relief. Not this give-and-take, smoke-and-mirrors, a little bit here, little bit there, targeted what you believe as tax relief, not what they believe you should have but what you believe you should have. 
Let's look at 5 years. The Government is going to take $8.6 trillion from you over the next 5 years, and we are asking in tax relief one penny on every dollar. Somehow, you are going to hear from this body that we cannot live with 99 cents on the dollar, but you, as taxpayers, sure can give it all up. Somehow you can make the sacrifice, tighten your belt, spend less on your children, education, food, clothing, shelter, homes, maybe a night out for pizza, but do not let Congress take one penny on the dollar less than what they want to spend. By the way, that would not even be enough. 
The support for taxes, I still support--let's look at DC and the budget in DC.

Mr. GRAMS. I was going to wrap this up by saying the District of Columbia has problems with their budget, and what has been the proposed solution? Give them tax relief. I think the whole country has a serious problem, taxpayers have a problem, just like what is facing Washington, DC, and I think they need tax relief as well.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. This much needed legislation will help protect the American taxpayers and ratepayers and resolve our Nation's growing nuclear waste storage problem. 
As many of my colleagues know, the Department of Energy will not live up to its 15-year promise to collect commercial nuclear waste into a centralized repository. Unfortunately, with over $6 billion of ratepayer's money already spent by the Federal Government, a permanent repository will still not be completed until well into the next century. 
The map behind me illustrates the result of this failed policy: The creation of over 80 nuclear waste storage sites across our Nation. From coast to coast and from one international border to another, over 41 States have been affected by the lack of action. As my colleagues can see, this is not a regional problem; it's a national problem demanding a Federal solution. 
Mr. President, the Federal Government should no longer be allowed to forget its commitment to the American public. Last year, the Federal court of appeals agreed that this was a Federal problem when it ruled that the Department of Energy will be liable for damages if it does not accept commercial nuclear waste by January 31, 1998. 
Under current law, no one at the DOE will be held personally liable for any assessed damages; the bill will go to the American taxpayers at an estimated cost between $40 and $80 billion. Such a tremendous liability burden on taxpayers would make the public bailout of the savings and loan collapse seem small in comparison. 
Many others agree that a Federal solution is needed immediately. Frustrated with the DOE's inability to resolve our nuclear storage problem, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, 48 State agencies, and 38 utilities have joined forces to ask the Federal courts to suspend ratepayer's payments into the nuclear waste fund, which finances the Federal Government's commercial nuclear waste program. 
They are concerned that their constituents and customers are being asked to pay too many times for a failed policy. 
Take, for instance, the situation facing ratepayers in my home State of Minnesota. Since 1982, Minnesota's nuclear energy consumers have paid over $250 million into the nuclear waste fund believing that the Federal Government would fulfill its obligation to transport nuclear waste out of Minnesota. 
But as time went on and the DOE continued to ignore its responsibilities, utilities in Minnesota and around the country were forced to temporarily store their waste within the confines of their own facilities. 
When it became clear to many utilities that storage space was running out and the Department of Energy would not accept waste by the established deadline, utilities then had to go to their States to ask for additional onsite storage or else be forced to shut down their operations. 
For example, ratepayers in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin were forced to pay for onsite storage in cooling pools at Prairie Island in southeastern Minnesota. In 1994, with storage space running out, the Minnesota Legislature--after a bruising battle--voted to allow for limited onsite dry cask storage until the year 2004. 
Mr. President, the cost associated with this onsite storage is staggering. Ratepayers in the midwestern service area alone have paid over $25 million in storage costs and will pay an estimated $100 million more by the year 2015, in addition to the required payments to the Federal Government. 
To make matters worse, storage space will run out at Prairie Island just after the turn of the century, forcing the plant to close unless the State legislature once again makes up for the DOE's inaction. This will threaten over 30 percent of Minnesota's overall energy resources and will likely lead to even higher costs for Minnesota's ratepayers. 
In fact, the Minnesota Department of Public Service estimates that the increase in costs could reach as high as 17 percent, forcing ratepayers to eventually pay three times: once to the nuclear waste fund, again for onsite storage, and yet again for increased energy costs. 
And Minnesota is not alone in facing this unacceptable situation; 36 other States across the Nation are facing similar circumstances of either shutting down and losing their energy-generating capacity or continuing to bail out the Federal Government for its failure to act. 
So, Mr. President, when some of my colleagues speak about how well the status quo is working, I would simply point them to my home State of Minnesota where the status quo has failed dismally--to the detriment of the ratepayers and soon to the taxpayers.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, if there's one part of the status quo that is working within our Nation's overall nuclear waste disposal program, it is the way in which the Federal Government is actively meeting the needs of foreign countries. 
It is not working for domestic spent fuel, but our program seems to be working very well in meeting the needs of spent nuclear fuel from foreign countries. 
As this map shows, the DOE has resumed collecting spent nuclear fuel from a total of 41 countries under the Atoms for Peace Program. 
Similar to the large number of our States which are facing nuclear waste storage problems, countries from around the world are experiencing the same problems. The only difference is that their needs--not our own ratepayers' needs--are being met by our Federal Government. 
In fact, the DOE has completed urgent relief shipments of 252 spent nuclear fuel assemblies from European nations to the agency's facility at Savannah River. It has also accepted nuclear spent fuel from Latin American countries. Ultimately, as I learned during a recent trip to the Savannah River site, up to 890 foreign research reactor cores will be accepted by the DOE over a 13-year period. 
So they can take it from foreign countries and handle it safely, but somehow they cannot handle domestic spent nuclear fuels. 
Mr. President, an important point to discuss when it comes to these foreign nuclear waste shipments is how they are transported once they reach the continental United States. Nuclear assemblies from these 41 countries have been and will continue to be transported by rail and truck to the Savannah River facility. These photographs illustrate just one of the means by which shipments of foreign-generated fuel are being transported to the DOE's facility. Here, my colleagues can clearly see how foreign nuclear waste is being loaded on to railcars at Charleston Harbor and then shipped to the Savannah River facility. The safety record of these shipments speaks for itself. 
The Federal Government is also actively accepting nuclear waste from many of our universities nationwide. As this map indicates, nuclear waste from research reactors at our finest educational institutions is being accepted at the DOE's Savannah River facility. Again, this nuclear waste is being safely transported by rail and truck across the Nation. Chairman Murkowski also spoke extensively on this safety record earlier today. 
There has not been one accident nor any release of nuclear fuel. 
These shipments serve as a very small portion of the 2,400 shipments of high-level nuclear waste that has already been shipped across the United States, including naval spent fuel. So, Mr. President, as the distinguished chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has indicated, transportation is no longer a question of technology but becomes one of politics. 
I understand the rationale behind reducing our international nuclear dangers by collecting and transporting spent fuel within our borders. But what I and many others cannot comprehend is how our Government has made it a priority to help foreign countries with their nuclear waste problems while simultaneously ignoring the concerns right here in our own country. 
Under this scheme, our Nation will have a disjointed nuclear waste storage policy: one that works for our universities and foreign nations and another that has failed and will soon be partially administered by the actions of the Federal Court of Appeals. It seems clear to me that while States, utilities, and ratepayers have kept their end of the bargain, the DOE has not. That sends the wrong message to the American people about trusting the promises of the Federal Government. 
The Federal Government is living up to its promises in the Atoms for Peace Program. It is accepting spent nuclear fuel from 41 countries. They have lived up to that policy, that agreement, and that contract, but somehow they can't live up to contracts with the American ratepayers. 
Despite widespread support for action to create an interim storage site--including support from former DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary and Dan Dreyfus, the former administrator of the civilian nuclear waste program under the Clinton administration--the DOE has failed to offer a substantive alternative to our legislation. Although the Department's new Secretary, Federico PenAE6a, now admits that a Federal solution is needed to resolve our interim storage problems, he recently indicated in a meeting with nuclear utility executives that the DOE is still unwilling to move commercial spent fuel. Instead, the DOE offered a proposal to compensate utilities for on-site storage. 
In other words, they will not accept it. But the DOE says it is willing and offered a proposal to compensate utilities for on-site storage. 
Unfortunately, this proposed compensation scheme does little but needlessly spend the taxpayers' money while continuing the failed status quo. In other words, it just wants to collect more money from the taxpayers and then pay it out as compensation. So you are going to take it from one pocket and put it into another. It is still the taxpayers who are going to be left holding the bag, not the Department of Energy, not their budget, not the Secretary of Energy Mr. PenAE6a, but the taxpayers. In other words, they don't want to solve the problem. They just want taxpayers to continue to pay for their mistakes. 
It signals to the ratepayers that the Federal Government has no intention of moving commercial nuclear waste in the near future, despite a Federal court mandate. 
Moreover, continuing the policy of noncentralized storage facilities may lead to the premature shutdown of one nuclear plant in Minnesota--compromising 30 percent of the State's energy needs and significantly increasing ratepayer costs. 
Again, this is not only typical to Minnesota. Many other States face the same problem. Many utilities are facing the same problem. Ratepayers could be paying the same increase in power because, again, of the lack of action by the DOE. 
In recent communications to the Senate, DOE Secretary PenAE6a and the President's Office of Management and Budget yet again indicated the Clinton administration's opposition to our legislation to move nuclear waste from the over 80 sites around the Nation. 
Speaking of the need for a long-term, permanent repository, the letters failed to address any specific alternatives to our legislation or how the Federal Government will address future taxpayer liability in light of the DOE's failure to live up to its 1998 contractual deadline. They offer no alternative except to sit back and say, yes, they will adhere to any court-ordered compensation because it is no money out of their pocket. They can just delay or defer any kind of an agreement or answer and will not live up to their contractual deadline. 
In the last week of debate on this legislation, we have negotiated with Senator Bingaman and others who want to resolve our interim nuclear waste storage needs. Some important and constructive changes to our bill have resulted from that. Although I oppose one change that moves the construction of the interim storage facility back 1 or 2 years, a number of reforms have been made to address the concerns of the administration. Among them are helpful provisions strengthening radiation protection standards, preemption of State and Federal laws, environmental concerns, and funding for the civilian nuclear waste program. 
These important changes should help persuade some of my colleagues to support this commonsense environmental protection bill, and it should also help pave the way for the President to sign this legislation based on sound policy and not to veto it due to political concerns. Again, this is not oversight. It is not over technology. It is not over the safety record of transportation of spent fuel. It is basic, raw politics. And above all, Congress has an obligation to protect the American public from the estimated $40 to $80 billion they face in liability expenses. Our bill will reform our current civilian nuclear waste program to help avoid the squandering of billions of dollars of ratepayers' and taxpayers' money--not that the Federal Government hasn't wasted enough recently, but with tax day tomorrow, this should also come as more important to taxpayers to say they don't want billions more dollars squandered. 
It will eliminate the current need for onsite storage at our Nation's nuclear plants, keep plants from shutting down prematurely due to the lack of storage space, and maintain stable energy prices. 
Mr. President, for too long our States, our ratepayers and taxpayers have been threatened by a policy of inaction. As reported out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and amended in the Chamber, this legislation sets up a time line for the DOE to finally live up to its promises again while helping to protect our environment. As a result, this bill has broad bipartisan support across the Nation. It deserves to be passed overwhelmingly on behalf of the American public. In closing, I urge my colleagues to cast politics aside and to take a giant step forward by voting for this very much-needed legislation. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I join my other colleagues this morning in talking about the dubious date of April 15, which comes upon us tomorrow. I rise today to speak briefly in support of what we call profamily and progrowth tax relief. I will focus on two of the most frequently asked questions, and that is: Why is it critical to provide tax relief this year, and then, can we do it while still trying to balance the budget? 
You always hear the question asked of the people: `Do you want a balanced budget, or do you want tax relief,' just like they are two separate questions and they cannot be one. I believe they are dual track and both have to be done at the same time. 
Before I begin, let me set one fact straight, and that is, over the next 5 years, the Federal Government will take away $8.6 trillion in taxes from the pockets of working Americans. What we are asking is that 2 cents of every dollar that the Government takes from the taxpayers--again, I repeat, just 2 cents of every dollar--be returned to them in the form of tax relief. That is what S. 2, the Family Tax Relief Act is all about. It is 2 cents worth of tax relief. Too much? Well, I don't think so. 
Madam President, tomorrow will be the cruelest day of the year for millions of Americans as they rush to meet the April 15 tax filing deadline, and cruel is not only an appropriate word to describe the tax burden faced by working Americans, it is perhaps the best word. Taxes imposed on American families are at an all-time high, as we have heard from other colleagues this morning, and this year, tax freedom day--that is the day when Americans stop working for the Government and start working for themselves--will be announced by the Tax Foundation this morning and it could come as late as May 9, which would be later than ever before. 
The average American family today spends more on taxes than it does for food, clothing, and housing combined. A typical median-income family can expect to pay nearly 40 percent of its income in Federal, State, and local taxes. This means, again, more than 3 hours of every 8-hour working day are dedicated just to pay taxes. In 1996, an average household with an annual income of between $22,500 and $30,000 paid an average of about $9,073 for food, clothing and housing, but they paid $11,311 in taxes. Households with incomes ranging from $45,000 to $60,000 averaged about $16,000 for basic necessities but paid more than $25,000 in taxes. 
If the hidden taxes that result from the high cost of Government regulations are factored in as well, a family today gives up more than 50 percent of its annual income to the Government. If you want to put that in context, 50 percent to taxes, if you go back to the Boston Tea Party, that was staged over a one-half of 1 percent tax when the Revolutionary War started and people thought they were being taxed too high at one-half of 1 percent. 
When the Government takes more, families get less. Between 1989 and 1995, the typical American family's real income fell by about 5.2 percent. Most economists point out that the decrease in income was the result of slow economic growth, and that is a direct result of higher Federal taxes. 
We all recognize the children are our future of our Nation and that families are the foundation of our society, but Washington's deficit spending and high-tax policies have systematically ignored our children's future and severely have undermined the basic functions of the family. We must abandon the policies and help restore the family to an economic position that is capable of fulfilling its vital responsibilities and, therefore, we should provide American families with meaningful tax relief, allowing them to keep more of their hard-earned money. 
Again, S. 2, the Family Tax Relief Act, is truly a progrowth, profamily tax-cut plan for working Americans. It 
will reduce taxes by $172 billion and with 95 percent of that tax relief going directly to middle-class families. 
I am proud we have built our plan around the $500 per child tax credit which the taxpayers in Minnesota have asked me to make a top priority. The $500 per child tax credit means real relief and will return nearly $500 million to overtaxed Minnesota families every year. 
Our plan will also expand individual retirement accounts for spouses and allow penalty-free withdrawal from an IRA for education, business startup and emergency expenses. It promotes savings in investment by lowering the antigrowth capital gains tax and takes on the damaging estate tax, or the death tax, that jeopardizes so many family businesses and farms. 
By enacting these tax cuts, we can begin turning back the decades of abuse that taxpayers have suffered at the hands of their own Government, a Government that has been too often eager to spend the taxpayers' money with reckless disrespect. As the Government takes money out of the hands of private citizens, the Government itself keeps expanding. Even though President Clinton has proclaimed otherwise, he said the era of big Government is over, but the era of big Government is far from over. Despite a shrinking Federal deficit, the Government is getting bigger not smaller. 
Total taxation is at an all-time high. So is total Government spending. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Government will spend $9.4 trillion over the next 5 years, much of it going toward wasteful or unnecessary Government programs, and tax relief is the right solution because it takes power out of the hands of Washington's big spenders and it puts it back where it can do the most good, and that is with families. 
By leaving $500 per child in the family bank account, taxpayers are then empowered to use it to directly benefit their household. If you wonder what kind of impact that could have on a family budget, consider that for a family with two children, the $500 per child tax credit could pay for 3 months of groceries, nearly 20 months of clothing for the kids or your home mortgage for a month and a half. 
The President's tax cut proposal, on the other hand, includes a mini-child-tax credit that only begins with $300 per child and increases to $500 per child 2 years later, but only to be eliminated entirely after that. Furthermore, the President's plan provides tax credit only to families with children under the age of 13. So only up to the age of 12, again greatly diluting its value. 
We have 18.3 million teenagers age 14 to 18 in this country. As we all know, family expenses soar during those teenage years, so excluding this age group from the benefits of family tax relief simply makes no sense. 
Let me focus for a moment also on the estate tax. Today, when a small business owner or a farm owner dies, the Federal estate tax confiscates 37 percent of his or her assets valued between $600,000 and $1 million. 
That rises to 55 percent of assets valued at more than $3 million. 
Gifts valued at more than $1 million to grandchildren are also taxed at 55 percent. Many, if not most, businesses are severely crippled or forced to close by this unfair tax hit. 
Family-owned and closely held businesses are the backbone of America's economy and a bedrock of the American culture. They must be preserved. 
I am reminded constantly by proud family farmers in my home State of Minnesota--like Andy Quin, who is a corn farmer from Litchfield, and Don Buhl, a pork producers from Tracy--that if we are to preserve our proud, rural traditions, we must ensure that farming remains an attractive and viable profession. 
Making it easier to pass the farm from one generation to the next should be a priority in Congress. I am also pleased that S. 2 includes a meaningful estate tax cut for small family business owners and for farmers. 
Beyond the direct benefits to families, tax cuts can have a substantial, positive impact on the economy as a whole. 
It was John F. Kennedy who observed that `an economy hampered with high tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budget just as it will never produce enough output and enough jobs.' It was President Kennedy who said that. 
And he was able to put his theories to work in the early 1960's, when he enacted significant tax cuts that encouraged one of the few periods of sustained growth we have experienced since the Second World War. 
Twenty years later, President Ronald Reagan cut taxes once again. The reinvigorated economy responded enthusiastically as 19 million new jobs were created and take-home pay grew 13 percent between 1982 and 1989. 
Madam President, let me now turn to the other question of whether we are able to balance the budget and provide tax cuts at the same time. The truth is we can absolutely do both at the same time, as long as we have the political will to do it. Many States have already proved that this can be done. 
Some examples. While Washington was busy debating whether to give 2 cents of every dollar it collected back to working Americans, many States took action to lower their taxes. 
In the State of New York, Governor Pataki cut taxes 15 times, returning more than $3.5 billion to New Yorkers in just 2 years. By the end of Governor Pataki's term, $13 billion will be returned to New Yorkers. 
What is remarkable about New York is that the Governor provided tax cuts while balancing the budget. What is more, New York ran a $400 million surplus and it put the money into the State's rainy day fund for the first time since 1978. 
Governor Rowland of Connecticut also cut taxes and balanced the budget. He turned deficits into a $250 million budget surplus in only the first full fiscal year of his term. Many other States, including New Jersey, Mississippi, Michigan, Iowa, and Arizona, have done the same. 
My own State of Minnesota is another example. When Gov. Arne Carlson was elected to office in 1990, he inherited a deficit greater than $1.8 billion and a government that was spending 15 percent faster than the rate of inflation. 
But the Governor cut spending by making the tough choices that elected officials are supposed to make, decisions that cut wasteful spending and cut taxes. 
Thanks to that dedication, Minnesota today finds itself with a stronger economy, more jobs, and an unemployment rate of just 3.8 percent--that is well below the national average--and a $2.3 billion budget surplus. Now the Governor is planning to cut income taxes by 22 percent. 
By balancing the budget and lowering taxes, those States have produced remarkable economic results: The 10 States that cut taxes the most have seen strong job growth, a 10.8-percent increase compared to a national average of 5.9 percent. 
And also the top 10 tax-hiking States, they registered a zero job growth during that same period. No wonder even the State of Maryland has recently adopted a plan to cut tax by 10 percent. Madam President, I strongly believe we should follow the tax-cutting trend at the Federal level. 
By implementing profamily, progrowth tax relief and creating a tax system that is more friendly to working Americans and more conducive to economic growth, Congress and the President can make our economy more dynamic, our businesses more competitive, and our families more prosperous as we approach that 21st century. 
I strongly disagree with those who insist the deficit cannot be reduced as we simultaneously provide tax relief. The States have shown us that the deficit can be reduced, the budget can be balanced, and taxes can be cut at the same time. 
After eliminating wasteful, redundant, and needless spending from the Federal budget, we can still allow for a spending increase while providing tax relief to working Americans. 
To omit tax cuts from the budget resolution is not acceptable to Republicans seeking to deliver on our commitment to return money to the taxpayers. 
Therefore, I support the alternative budget prepared by Senator Gramm, a budget Democrats and President Clinton have supported that is based on the President's own numbers. It is a compromise for us that includes tax relief. 
I also disagree with the suggestion that we should delay any tax cuts or separate our budget agreement from tax relief. Again, the taxpayers have been very clear on this: A recent USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll shows that 70 percent of Americans want us to keep tax relief in our budget plan. 
Despite what you hear from the arguments on the other side, 70 percent of Americans want us to keep our pledge to cut taxes. 
Madam President, as I close, I am certain there is nothing we can ever do to make tax day an occasion to celebrate. But it is within our power to make it a great deal less painful. So we have made a promise. We must keep that promise. And let us give back that 2 cents on every dollar to America's hard-working families. 
Madam President, thank you very much. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on March 20, my dear friend and former colleague, Senator Dave Durenberger, lost his father, George Durenberger, at the age of 90. 
But, because the Senate was just beginning its recess at that time, I did not have the opportunity to pay respect to my friend and the much-celebrated life of his father. It is for this purpose that I rise today. 
It has been said that, `the worst sin against our fellow creatures is not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them; that is the essence of inhumanity.' George Durenberger, the parent, the teacher, the coach, must have been acutely aware of this because there was not indifference in him. He saw worth in every person he met and rewarded them with a first chance, a second, and a third. 
In short, George Durenberger never gave up on anyone. Beyond all his other contributions, George Durenberger will be most remembered for his abiding faith in people. 
According to newspaper accounts, George Durenberger was one of the `best known and most well-liked men in Central Minnesota.' By the same accounts, `Big George' as he was often called, was `a legend.' 
Coming to St. John's Abbey and University in Collegeville, MN in 1924 as a student, George Durenberger obtained hero status as the star offensive center on the football team, the first three time All-Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference award winner, and also the captain of not only the football team but the basketball team as well. 
Upon graduation in 1928, Durenberger became a professor and coach at St. John's and, over the course of 44 years, served as head coach of the football, basketball, and baseball teams--and sometimes all at once. 
Durenberger served as athletic director for both St. John's University and St. John's preparatory school athletics for all but 2 of his 44 years at St. John's. 
Many Minnesotans still recall that it was George Durenberger who started the round robin system of intercollegiate competition in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. And, some still remember the national recognition he gained through his ace athletic program to condition the 87th Airborne Detachment for World War II. 
Perhaps, these accomplishments figured into St. John's decision to name the college's athletic field complex, the `George Durenberger Field.' But, I believe that what contributed most to his Herculean stature can be best expressed in George Durenberger's own words:  
A coach should be judged not only on his ability to produce winning teams, but also on whether or not he has made a positive contribution to the moral, mental, social and emotional growth of his students. 
George Durenberger was the epitome of a teacher. He knew and loved people. He saw the good in them--even when they could not see it in themselves. 
`The young men who came to St. John's in the early forties from the small towns of Minnesota and North Dakota were very much in need of a role model,' recalls former Minnesota Supreme Court Justice John Simonett. `Then we met `Big George'. And we looked up to him--both literally and figuratively.' 
George Durenberger lifted spirits, recalled another St. John's alumnus, `I always left George feeling better about myself.' George Durenberger `was the first person I met as a student at St. John's in 1924,' remembered Fred Hughes, a St. Cloud attorney and former University of Minnesota Regent, `and to this day, he remains the best.' 
And, consider what the Hill newspaper's Al Eisele, who attended St. John's, had to say. Mr. Eisele said, `George Durenberger was as much a part of the modern history of St. John's University as the Benedictine monks who founded it 150 years ago.' 
Durenberger, `a physically imposing man with a booming voice and outgoing personality,' as described by Eisele, `helped shape the lives of thousands of young men.' As athletic director, Durenberger was such a forceful man, noted Eisele, that he even got the monks to exercise. 
In closing, Eisele remarked that Durenberger and his wife Isabelle were `surrogate parents to many * * * and an inspiration to all.' 
George Durenberger never left St. John's until he died. He loved the institution and all the people and memories that came with it. However, this love was not connected to stubborn consistency but to confection. George Durenberger, said one friend, `was driven by a vision of a `better city',' something akin to the city referred to in the book of Hebrews. 
Another book in Scriptures, Proverbs, states, `Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.' According to George Durenberger's eldest son, my friend and former colleague, `All my desire for public service and for making the world a better place than I found it, came from him.' That was Dave Durenberger. 
In this way, and in so many others, George Durenberger made a very profound and lasting contribution to the world. All he withheld from the world was indifference. 
Mr. President, I offer George Durenberger's wife, Isabelle; his daughters, Constance and Mary; his sons, George Mark and Thomas; his nine grandchildren and two great grandchildren; and most especially I offer his eldest son, my dear friend, David Durenberger, my most heartfelt sympathy. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield back the remaining part of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this morning in strong support of the Farm Independence Act of 1997 which my good friend, Senator Grassley, and I introduce here today. This legislation is critical in protecting American farmers and ranchers from yet another IRS attack--the third this year--on the family farm. 
I suspect when President Grover Cleveland remarked that, `just when you thought you were making ends meet, someone moves the ends,' the former President must have been thinking about the Internal Revenue Service. 
This time, the IRS has issued a decision in one of its technical advice memoranda that, if fully enforced, will result in a 15.3-percent tax increase for thousands of farmers. Let me repeat that. A recent IRS decision could result in a 15.3-percent tax increase for thousands of farmers. 
Essentially, if a producer incorporates--and many Minnesota producers, both small and large, do--and then rents his land to the farm corporation, the rental income the farmer receives is not only subject to income tax but to an additional 15.3-percent self-employment tax. 
The purpose of the Grassley-Grams Farm Independence Act of 1997 is simple and it is straightforward. Our bill would stop the IRS from imposing this 15.3-percent tax increase on our farmers and ranchers. 
Mr. President, last Congress, we passed the most sweeping reforms in agricultural policy in 60 years and gave farmers the freedom to farm. At that time, we also promised farmers regulatory relief, improved research and risk management, free and fair trade, and--perhaps most importantly--we promised farmers tax relief. 
Now, many of us in Congress have made tax relief a top priority. I do so, in part, because it is a top priority for Minnesota farmers, and toward this end, I am an original cosponsor of a bill to repeal the estate tax, and I strongly support legislation to cut capital gains taxes. 
But, unfortunately, we haven't made much progress in convincing the President and some in Congress that this is not fat-cat legislation but absolutely necessary for the survival and success of the family farm. 
But, even more frustrating than these obstacles to providing farmers with critical relief from the death tax and capital gains taxes are back-door attempts by the IRS to actually raise taxes on our farmers and ranchers. 
First, came the alternative minimum tax which attacked cash-based accounting. Second, came a decision that income from culled cows--cows that don't milk--is income that disqualifies low-income farmers from receiving the earned income tax credit. And, now, the IRS wants to exact a 15.3-percent tax increase on thousands of American farmers and ranchers. 
Mr. President, I am 100 percent committed to providing Minnesota farmers with tax relief they desperately need. I hope the President and others in Congress come around on this issue as well. 
But, at a bare minimum, the President should send a signal to the IRS that these back-door attempts to raise revenues on the backs of the Nation's farmers and ranchers is totally unacceptable. 
I am convinced that a second gold age of agriculture is within reach in the final days of this century and also the whole of the next if only we in Government help--rather than hinder--our farmers' and ranchers' efforts. 
So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Farm Independence Act of 1997. I also commend the Senator from Iowa for his leadership on this issue.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I just want to take a few minutes today to discuss the devastating floods that are paralyzing much of my home State of Minnesota. Most of the Nation knows we are experiencing some of the worst flooding in our history this week, and due to the severe snowfall of this past winter, damage is expected to surpass that of the disastrous 1993 floods. 
Not only are Minnesotans fighting against the rising floodwaters, but they are doing it in the wake of a blizzard that brought snow, ice, and bitterly cold temperatures to our State this weekend, as well. It has truly been an ordeal--my heart goes out to those who are working desperately to save their homes and land, and my thanks go to the thousands of Minnesotans who have stepped forward this week to help their friends, families, and neighbors. It is reassuring to know that our communities share a collective heart, and can be counted upon to come together during tough times. 
Now that President Clinton has approved our request that Minnesota be declared a disaster area, Federal money for flood victims is available in 21 Minnesota counties. That will enable cleanup efforts to get underway, and help families and individuals whose homes and property have been damaged or destroyed. 
As of this past Monday, Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson had activated more than 1,000 of the state's 11,000 National Guard troops to assist with sandbagging, emergency evacuation, and other flood-related duties. The Guard has been tireless in their desire to help and we thank them for that as well. 
The disastrous floods have severely disrupted the lives of many, many Minnesotans, whose primary concern now is to ensure that their families and communities are safe, with adequate food and shelter. 
That being the case, I have requested that Commissioner Richardson of the Internal Revenue Service extend the tax filing deadline for those taxpayers living within the disaster area. Considering the many challenges Minnesotans will face in the next few weeks, cleaning up and rebuilding their lives and communities, extending the April 15 deadline is crucial. I hope Commissioner Richardson will act immediately to grant the extension. 
Mr. President, we are used to harsh winters in Minnesota, but even we Minnesotans have never seen anything like this. Earlier this winter, heavy snows resulted in a Presidential disaster declaration for snow removal in 55 Minnesota counties. That rapidly melting snow has now caused extensive flooding on virtually every river and tributary in the State. This past weekend, the situation was compounded when Minnesota was hit by a combination ice storm and blizzard. Freezing rain and snow downed countless utility lines in northwestern Minnesota, leaving more than 50,000 residents without power. Some power has been restored, but it is estimated that other areas may be without power for another 7 days before repairs can be completed. The weekend storm, along with the severe snows of this past winter, will make flooding this spring some of the worst in our history. 
For communities along the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers east and south of Montevideo and south of Anoka, which includes the Twin Cities metro area, the worst flooding is on the way and record and near-record crests are expected there. The same is true along the north-flowing Red River along the Minnesota-North Dakota border. In Ada, in the State's northwestern corner, three-quarters of the town's 1,700 residents have been evacuated from their homes. 
The flooding has been an exhausting nightmare for those who are in it, and agonizing for the rest of the Nation to watch. Yet, we have been inspired once again by the people of Minnesota, who have rallied together for their communities as they always do when tragedy strikes. 
Young and old are working side by side to save their communities, filling and hauling sandbags, feeding those who have lost their homes and finding them shelter, and making sure the volunteers are well cared for. I read the comments of Marvin Patten of Granite Falls, who does not have flood insurance and whose living room is flooded under 18 inches of water. He said, `At first I sat and cried, but after a few days you realize that we will manage.' 
Shortly after the mayor of Granite Falls pleaded for sandbagging volunteers, he told a reporter that `everybody in town showed up. Just like that. Amazing. I am stupefied.' Now, as I read comments like those and speak with Minnesotans who live in the flooded areas, I cannot help but think it is during critical times such as these that we finally understand the importance of community, of neighbor helping neighbor. Those are the qualities that make us Minnesotans. 
I want to take this opportunity to thank God for the mercy he has granted and the blessings he has bestowed upon our families and communities. It is within His strength that we find our own. 
Mr. President, I heard the remarks of my colleague from Minnesota earlier this afternoon, and I appreciate his words and his efforts on behalf of the people of our State. 
We stand together with our colleagues from North and South Dakota, who are facing devastation in their States equal to our own. When disaster strikes, we are not Republicans or Democrats. We are representatives of the people, and we will do whatever we must to protect our citizens when their lives, homes, and property are threatened.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, 1 week from today, we will mark the anniversary of two infamous, manmade disasters. One may slip by unnoticed. I am certain the other will not. 
The first disaster we will commemorate next Tuesday is the 85th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, an event made all the more tragic because it could have been prevented. The story of the Titanic is a sad story of excess, of man's ongoing reach for something bigger, something more powerful. 
The second manmade disaster is the arrival of tax day. Now, I do not mean to draw a direct comparison between the loss of life in the Titanic incident and the plight of America's working men and women. But for many Americans, April 15 is another potent symbol of man's ongoing reach for something bigger and more powerful. The bigger and more powerful entity in this case is not the world's largest ship, but the largest government the world has ever known. And Washington's constant need to expand its reach has imprisoned working families in a disastrous cycle of taxation. 
Look what our outrageous tax burden has done to families over the past 40 years. Taxes today dominate the family budget. The annual tax bill for a typical family now averages $21,365-- significantly more than they spend on food, clothing, and shelter every year. 
Factor in State and local taxes and the hidden taxes that result from the high cost of government regulations, and a family today gives up more than 50 percent of its annual income to the government. We pay an especially high price in my home State of Minnesota--a study released last year by Harvard University revealed that Minnesota taxpayers pay the seventh highest taxes in the Nation. 
Taxes are not merely an inconvenient fact of life. They are the 1990's version of highway robbery. 
Who has borne the brunt of these ever-increasing taxes since the 1940's? Working families with children. No wonder these Americans shake their heads in dismay each April. 
Mr. President, when my colleagues and I in the sophomore class were elected in 1994, we were sent here by our constituents on a promise that we would balance the budget and cut taxes. That same promise was made by the Members of the new freshman class. And we do not intend to let 1 more year pass without delivering on those promises. Tax relief and deficit reduction can and must go hand in hand. Any budget presented in this Chamber that favors deficit reduction at the expense of lower taxes--what Washington's big spenders like to call the save-the-dessert-for-after-dinner approach--is nothing more than an exercise in futility. 
Until the opponents of tax relief recognize that what they call dessert is what most taxpayers consider their salary, we will never reach agreement on a budget. 
I would like to also add that I received a letter today from a mayor back home who opposed tax relief. He didn't call it dessert, but he called it political goodies that we would like to disperse to our constituents. Allowing working men and women to keep more of their money is what he calls political goodies. 
This is the mindset of many who are serving in government today, whether they be local, State, or Federal officials. Somehow the people's money is somehow government's claim, and if we want to make sure that they can keep some of it, it is somehow political goodies. 
But it was later in his letter that I found what was really his real concern. In the letter I think he felt that lower taxes could mean fewer dollars to be sent from Washington to his town. So his concern wasn't the political goodies, but it could mean fewer dollars if we reduce the size and scope of the Federal Government. That is money that would be allowed to be spent, or really the pork from Washington--not political goodies but pork. Let the Federal Government raise the taxes rather than having the local taxes support the programs for pork that they want. So, in other words, provide for their residents. It is really great that we can stand here and get credit for spending their money--the taxpayers' money--for programs, for what really is pork that the Government thinks that they should have, or that they need. It is great that we have this great ability to figure out for the local citizens what is best for them. 
The American people have spoken very clearly on this point. A USA Today-CNN-Gallup Poll released just last week confirms what many of us have been saying all along: Tax cuts must be part of any budget agreement we enact this year. When asked if they think the Republicans should drop their attempts to include tax cuts in their overall plan to reduce the budget deficit, or should they keep the tax cuts in their plan, fully 70 percent of the respondents said the tax cuts should stay. Seven out of ten Americans are calling on us to keep our tax-cutting pledge. And a majority agreed that tax cuts and deficit reduction can be accomplished at the same time. 
Mr. President, if Congress intends to make the strongest possible statement in support of working Americans, we will not do it by building a bigger Federal Government that demands more taxpayer dollars. We will do it by cutting taxes and leaving families a little more of their own money at the end of the day. 
Earlier this year, I was proud to join my colleagues, Senator Hutchinson and Senator Coats, in reintroducing this desperately needed tax relief in the form of the $500 per-child tax credit. 
The $500-per-child tax credit takes power away from Washington and puts it back with families, where it can do the most good. Once we leave that money in the family bank account, taxpayers are empowered to use it meeting the needs of their families, whether that is clothing, medical and dental expenses, insurance, or even groceries, or education. 
Mr. President, there is no action Congress can take today that will make next Tuesday, April 15, any easier for America's working families. But we have before us unlimited opportunities to profoundly change every other tax day, far into the future. Washington created the mess we are in, and the taxpayers are now demanding that Washington get us out of it. 
Thank you very much. I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. This much-needed legislation, as has been outlined today, will help resolve our Nation's nuclear waste storage crisis, help restore the commitments to our Nation's ratepayers, and ultimately to save taxpayer dollars from the Department of Energy's failed policies of the past. 
Again, I applaud the majority leader and Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Murkowski and Senator Craig of Idaho, for their leadership in moving this bill. 
Again, bottom line, our Nation cannot afford further delay, and the time to act on this commonsense legislation is now. But for the Senate to fully appreciate the gravity of the situation, I believe a brief summary of its history is in order. Since 1982, utility ratepayers have been required to pay the Federal Government nearly $13 billion of their hard-earned money in exchange for the promise that the Department of Energy would transport and store commercially generated nuclear waste in a centralized facility by January 31, 1998. However, with this deadline less than a year away and with over $6 billion already spent by the Department of Energy, there has been little progress toward keeping this 15-year-old promise of establishing a centralized Federal storage facility. In fact, though there has been measurable progress at the Yucca Mountain, NV, facility, a permanent repository will not be completed until well into the next century. As of today, nuclear waste is piling up at more than 80 sites due to the DOE's failure to live up to is commitment. 
Clearly, if the DOE is to meet the January 31, 1998 deadline, it must begin accepting nuclear waste at an interim storage facility--that, however, has not yet happened. In fact, the DOE recently notified States and utilities that it would not accept their commercial nuclear waste despite the law and the Federal court's effort to enforce it. Meanwhile, utility ratepayers are still being required to pay for a mismanaged program. In fact, over $630 million from the ratepayers go into the nuclear waste fund each year--without any tangible benefits or results to show for them. 
Our Nation's utility consumers and their pocketbooks aren't just hit once, either. Because of the DOE's failure to act, ratepayers are currently being forced to pay their hard-earned dollars to store waste on-site at commercial utility plants--a burden that would not be necessary had the Energy Department lived up to its legal obligation. Take, for example, the situation facing ratepayers in my home State of Minnesota. Since 1982, Minnesota's nuclear energy consumers have paid over $250 million into the nuclear waste fund believing that the Federal Government would fulfill its obligation to transport nuclear waste out of Minnesota. But as time went on and the DOE continued to ignore their responsibilities, utilities in Minnesota and around the country were forced to temporarily store their waste within the confines of their own facilities. 
When it became clear to many utilities that storage space was running out and the Department of Energy would not accept waste by the established deadline, utilities then had to go to their States to ask for additional on-site storage or else be forced to shutdown their operations. 
For example, ratepayers in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin were forced to pay for on-site storage in cooling pools at Prairie Island in southeastern Minnesota. In 1994, with storage space running out, the Minnesota Legislature--after a bruising battle--voted to allow for limited on-site dry-cask storage until the year 2004. 
Mr. President, the cost associated with this on-site storage is staggering. Ratepayers in the Midwestern service area alone have paid over $25 million in storage costs and will pay an estimated $100 million more by the year 2015, and that is in addition to the required payments to the Federal Government. 
To make matters even worse, storage space will run out at Prairie Island just after the turn of the century, forcing the plant to close unless the State legislature once again makes up for the DOE's inaction. This will threaten over 30 percent of Minnesota's overall energy resources and will likely lead to even higher costs for Minnesota's ratepayers. 
In fact, the Minnesota Department of Public Service estimates that the increase in costs could reach as high as 17 percent, forcing ratepayers to eventually pay three times: once to the nuclear waste fund, again for onsite storage, and yet again for increased energy costs. 
And Minnesota is not alone in facing this unacceptable situation. Thirty-six other States across the Nation are facing similar circumstances of either shutting down and losing their energy-generating capacity or continuing to bail out the Federal Government for its failure to act. 
Ratepayers are not the only ones who face serious consequences because of inaction by the DOE. The taxpayers are threatened too. Last year, the Federal courts ruled that the DOE will be liable for damages if it does not accept commercial nuclear waste by January 31, 1998. 
Under current law, no one at the DOE will be held personally liable for any assessed damages; the bill will go to the American taxpayers at an estimated cost between $40 to $80 billion. Such a tremendous liability burden on taxpayers would make the public bailout of the savings and loan collapse seem small in comparison. 
What is worse is that while our States, our utility ratepayers, and the taxpayers are being unfairly punished by the Department of Energy's inaction, the Federal Government has been active in meeting the interim nuclear waste storage needs of foreign countries. 
Under the Atoms for Peace Program, the DOE has resumed collecting spent nuclear fuel from a total of 41 countries. Last year, the DOE completed urgent relief shipments of 252 spent nuclear fuel assemblies from European nations to the agency's facility at Savannah River. It has also accepted nuclear spent fuel from Latin American countries. 
Ultimately, as I learned during a recent trip to the Savannah River site, which is down in South Carolina, up to 890 foreign research reactor cores will be accepted by the DOE over a 13-year period. 
Again, up to 890 foreign research reactor cores will be accepted by the DOE over a 13-year period. 
In addition, our Government is actively helping other countries reduce their nuclear waste stockpiles. With the Department of Defense spending up to $400 million on designing and constructing an interim nuclear waste storage facility in Russia to help dismantle the cold war threat, the world will certainly be a safer place, if that happens. 
But, again, our Defense Department is spending $400 million to help Russia design, construct, and facilitate an interim waste storage facility, but yet cannot do it in this country. 
Now, Mr. President, as a Senator who is concerned about our national security needs, I understand the rationale behind reducing our international nuclear dangers. But what I and many others cannot comprehend is how our Government has made it a priority to help foreign countries with their nuclear waste problems while simultaneously ignoring the concerns right here in our own country. 
It seems clear to me that while States, utilities, and ratepayers have kept their end of the bargain, the DOE has not done its part. That sends the wrong message to the American people about trusting the promises of the Federal Government. Maybe that is why the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, 48 State agencies and 36 utilities have now all joined together in a lawsuit to stop ratepayers' payments into the nuclear waste fund and to escrow $600 million that will soon go into that fund this year. Because too long, our States, utilities, and ratepayers have acted in good faith and relied upon the Federal Government to live up to its obligations. Evidently, they have had enough of the DOE's excuses for inaction and have proposed their own recourse. 
This issue has created strange bedfellows as well. In a recent interview, former DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary agreed that action on an interim site is needed as soon as possible. It is unfortunate that Secretary O'Leary waited until she was free from the administration to openly support interim storage, but I think her comments are important to remember as we attempt to protect our Nation's ratepayers and taxpayers. 
In addition, Mr. President, the former head of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management under the Clinton administration, Daniel Dreyfus, also said that he believes the DOE must move to meet the January 31, 1998, deadline. Key labor unions have even joined the fight to restore the DOE's promises. J.J. Barry, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, recently wrote me, and he said, `I am calling on you and your colleagues to put partisan politics aside for the good of our Nation and America's workers and their families. We must address this problem now or else face serious economic and environmental consequences later.' He went on to say, `Please support passage of S. 104.' 
Despite this widespread support, the DOE has failed to offer an alternative to our legislation. 
Although the Department's new Secretary now admits that a Federal solution is needed to resolve our interim storage problems, he recently indicted in a meeting with nuclear utility executives that the DOE is still unwilling to move commercial spent fuel. Instead, the DOE offered a proposal to compensate utilities for onsite storage. 
Unfortunately, this proposed compensation scheme does little but needlessly spend the taxpayers' money while continuing the failed status quo. It signals to the ratepayers that the Federal Government has no intention of moving commercial nuclear waste in the near future, despite a Federal court mandate that it does. 
So again, who will pay for this? It will not be the new Secretary, Mr. PenAE6a. It will not be the Department of Energy or out of its budget. It will gladly pay the fines, but it will come out of the ratepayers' and the taxpayers' pockets in order to do this. So they are playing fast and loose with the taxpayers' money once again. 
Moreover, continuing the policy of noncentralized storage facilities may lead to the premature shutdown of one nuclear plant in Minnesota--compromising 30 percent of the State's energy needs and increasing ratepayer costs. 
So again, clearly, leadership is needed to restore the promises made to the American people. If such leadership will not come from the Clinton-Gore administration, then it will have to come from Congress. Senate Energy and Natural Resoruces Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, Senator Larry Craig, and I crafted a bipartisan proposal, again, S. 104, identical to legislation supported last year by 63 Senators. 
We have put this proposal forward as a good-faith effort to help resolve this situation for the sake of protecting the legitimate interests of our ratepayers and taxpayers, as well as protecting national security and protecting the environment. Last month, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee passed this bipartisan legislation on a 15 to 5 vote. 
Mr. President, Congress has an obligation to protect the American public also from the estimated $40 to $80 billion that they face in liability expenses, because the DOE has refused to act. 
Our bill will reform our current civilian nuclear waste program to avoid the squandering of billions of dollars of ratepayers' and taxpayers' money. It will eliminate the current need for onsite storage at our Nation's nuclear plants and keep plants from shutting down prematurely due to the lack of storage space. And it will also help to maintain stable energy prices. 
Our legislation also assures that transportation of nuclear waste will continue to be conducted in a safe manner. 
For the interests of my colleagues, there have already been 2,400 shipments of high-level nuclear waste in our Nation, including numerous shipments of naval spent fuel and foreign research reactor fuel. 
In fact, in these pictures behind me it illustrates the means by which shipments of foreign-generated fuel are being transported to the Department of Energy's Savannah River facility. The safety record of these shipments speaks for itself. 
They come into the Port of Charleston, SC. They are loaded off the ships and on to rail cars, and then transported to Savannah River. That is 2,400 shipments. And they have all been completed safely. And I think, again, the safety record of these shipments speaks for itself. 
Again, this is spent fuel that is already being shipped across the United States, so it is no longer a question of technology but becomes one of politics. 
Even so, modifications have been made to this legislation to further ensure that all spent fuel will be transported safely. 
Mr. President, for too long our States, our ratepayers and taxpayers, have been threatened by a policy, again, one of inaction. As passed out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, this legislation sets up a reasonable deadline for the DOE to finally live up to its promises. We cannot, in good conscience, delay that deadline any further. It is unreasonable to ask the taxpayers to sacrifice any further for a department that has failed--a department that has failed--to do its job. 
So I am here today also to urge my colleagues to take a giant step forward in moving this legislation closer to Senate passage by voting for cloture and allowing the bill to be debated. 
Again, this is not a question of science. It is not a question of technology. And I do not believe it is a question of safety in transportation. But it has become a plain question of politics. Will the political decisions be made to allow this bill and the solving of this problem to go forward? I think this bill is the first step in that direction. As I said, I urge my colleagues to support this. 
I want to thank you, Mr. President, very much. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, in November 1994, the American voters sent a clear message to Washington that resulted in a watershed election and the first Republican Congress in 40 years. That message was to enact a taxpayers' agenda of balancing the budget, limiting the size and scope of Government, and returning tax dollars and power to the taxpayers. 
Two years ago today, the House of Representatives was marking day 76 of its unprecedented 100-day effort to carry out the taxpayers' agenda reflected in the Contract With America. They kept their promise to the American people by bringing all 10 provisions of the contract up for a vote and passing almost all of them. 
In 1996, despite an unprecedented assault by the media, hostile special interest groups, and the big tax and spenders in Washington, the Republican majorities in Congress were preserved, indeed, even increased here in the Senate. The voters once again sent the message that they wanted the taxpayers' agenda enacted, but they wanted Congress and the President to come together in completing the work started in the 104th Congress. 
Yet somehow this message has been misinterpreted by a number of my Republican colleagues, who seem to have come away from the 1996 elections with the mistaken notion that the effort to pass the taxpayers' agenda should be stalled or delayed. What concerns me most is that some of the loudest calls for retreating from that agenda are coming from within our own party leadership. This is not the same Republican majority that arrived in Washington in January 1995, ready to create fundamental change in a government that had enslaved so many working families for so many years. It is like the ancient Vikings who sometimes burned their boats after arriving in a new land. We stepped onto the shore and claimed there was no turning back to the era of big Government and higher taxes. 
We were determined that Washington would never be the same once we passed the taxpayers' agenda into law. 
Today, it appears some of my colleagues are wishing they had their boats back. 
Mr. President, I have tremendous respect and admiration for my friend and colleague from Georgia, the Speaker of the House. As a freshman Member of the House in the 103d Congress, I worked with Newt Gingrich, Tim Hutchinson, and others in making the $500-per-child tax credit the centerpiece of the Republican budget alternative in 1994. I was honored that Mr. Gingrich included our tax cut in the Contract With America, creating a platform on which I ran and won election to the Senate. 
That said, you can imagine how disappointed, and even a little saddened, I was to read his comments in the newspapers this week, when he was quoted as endorsing the suggestion that plans for a major tax cut be temporarily shelved. 
With all due respect to the Speaker, such a retreat would be a horrible mistake. 
Mr. President, it was 2 years ago this week that the Speaker wrote a commentary for the Wall Street Journal he titled `The Contract's Crown Jewel.' The crown jewel in this case was our package of tax cuts around which our balanced budget legislation was crafted, and the Speaker was its most vocal supporter. 
`The bill proposes fundamental change in the relationship between the American government and the American citizenry,' wrote the Speaker, `and is the plainest assertion we have yet made of the key principle underlying the Contract With America. 
`Simply put,' he went on to say, `the bill says this: `The American government's money does not belong to the American government. That money belongs to Americans, and it's time to give Americans some of their own money back.' 
Mr. President, I realize those words were written before the Government shutdowns, before the thrashing the Republicans took in the press, before the special interests waged a guerilla war of lies and distortions against us. Even so, those words were true in March 1995 and are no less true in March 1997. The only thing that has changed during these past 2 years is that courage has been supplanted by timidity and lions have turned into lambs. 
It was disheartening to read in the Washington Times on Tuesday that popular radio host Michael Reagan, son of the former President, was denouncing his ties to the Republican Party. The Times quoted him as saying:  
The Republican Party has forgotten grassroots America, they are not talking to grassroots America, not paying attention to grassroots America. Until the Republican Party remembers it won the election and acts like a winner and not a loser, I find myself as an independent. 
I wonder how many other Americans are feeling equally abandoned? 
The Washington Post this week carried the comments of a senior Republican aide in the House who suggested we were, quote, `just drifting' on budget and tax issues because many Republican leaders were unwilling to stick their necks out.' Well, that is how it feels here some days. Imagine how it must feel to the millions of American taxpayers who are outside the insulation of the Washington Beltway. 
Two years ago, we promised them tax relief. Congress delivered, but our hard work fell victim to a Presidential veto. So the American people were denied the tax relief that we promised in 1995--enacted and passed in our legislation; vetoed by the President. They were again denied tax relief in 1996. And now, the leaders of our party--our majority party, the party of the taxpayers, of families, the working class--are suggesting that the American people will not get tax cuts this year, either. And I say to them, you ought to be ashamed. 
Believe it or not, Mr. President, when I am back home in Minnesota, people do not stop me on the street to tell me how grateful they are we failed to enact the $500-per-child tax credit, or how grateful they are we cut the capital gains tax, or that we were unable to enact estate tax relief. No, the Minnesotans who stop me are angry and they are disappointed, because when they ask, `Where are the tax cuts you promised?' They are really asking `when are you going to do what you were elected to do?' 
The folks here in Washington seem to have forgotten there are two parts to every promise: the making, and the keeping. The politicians have never had a problem with the making, but they have a great deal to learn about the keeping. And Mr. President, this is one issue that all comes down to keeping promises. 
To go back on our promises now would deprive average American taxpayers of the leadership they voted for in 1994 and 1996, and say we were wrong in staking our claim on the side of the taxpayers and against big government. More importantly, it will deprive us of our biggest and most important constituency--and that is the hardworking, middle-class voters who cannot pay for the high-priced lobbyists, who cannot afford to take time off from work or take a break from caring for their kids to fly out to Washington to lobby us on a moment's notice for more money from taxpayers. 
Let us not forget the people we represent. Our constituents are not the Washington talking heads who chant and babble as if they can read the minds of the family farmers in Winona, MN, or the senior citizen working the counter at the Brainerd hardware store. And our constituents are certainly not the big spenders who have used and abused the people's tax dollars for decades. 
No, our constituents are the American taxpayers who sent us here to Washington to fight for them, because if we do not, who else will? If we do not stand beside them today, what reason do the taxpayers have to stand beside us, if all they will get in return are empty promises without any action or leadership to back them up? 
If we retreat from the taxpayers' agenda now, then who really won the 1996 elections, despite our majority in Congress? If we do not carry out the taxpayers' agenda, we may as well pack up our bags and go home, because we will have failed. And the price of that failure will fall on the backs of those we were elected to represent. 
We should make a good-faith effort to work with the President, present him with our plan to balance the budget and cut taxes this year, and if he cannot accept it, let the voters decide who is right and who is wrong. Bipartisan action should not translate into inaction, and trying to cooperate should not involve being coopted. 
If Congress and the President find the courage to move forward, the rewards can be immense. Let me tell you what has happened in my home State of Minnesota, where the headlines focus on a budget surplus, not a deficit, and our taxpayers finally have something to smile about on the State level in Minnesota. It is an example of what can be achieved when leaders make a promise and stick to it, even when it is not the politically easy thing to do. 
When Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson was elected to office in 1990, he inherited a deficit greater than $1.8 billion and a government that was spending 15 percent faster than the rate of inflation. The Governor and the State legislature cut spending by making the tough choices elected officials are supposed to make, decisions that met the needs of our residents and left no one behind. Thanks to that dedication, Minnesota today finds itself with a stronger economy, more jobs, an unemployment rate of just 3.5 percent, well below the national average, and a $2.3 billion budget surplus. 
So now the Governor has now presented a plan of tax relief that will cut income taxes in the State by an amazing 22 percent, offer $900 million in property tax relief, $150 million in education tax credits, and eliminate the sales tax on all capital equipment replacement. It has been an amazing turnaround for Minnesotans. 
Tax relief and fiscal discipline have worked in Minnesota. It is a combination that can work for the rest of the country as well. We need to remember, however, that Rome was not built in 1 day and neither was big government. The problem will not be fixed in 1 day, one year, or even 2 years. But every journey begins with one step--it is our job to ensure it is one step forward, not backward. 
In less than a month, Tax Day will arrive, and in preparation, the American taxpayers will once again gather around their kitchen tables to take stock of their finances. One can almost hear the collective groan. Unfortunately, it is too late for Congress to make any changes to lighten the tax load this year. It is not too late to enact the tax relief that will fundamentally transform the next. 
Mr. President, I did not come to the floor today to draw a line in the sand--at least not at this time. I must admit that I will be hard pressed to support any budget, any budget, that does not call for significant tax relief for the working families of Minnesota and each of the other 50 States. If we, as the majority, cannot deliver on this one, fundamental promise we made to the voters, we will have abandoned the taxpayers. And in doing so, we, the Republican majority, and this Congress as a whole, will have raised significant questions about our desire, and ability, to lead this Nation. 
It will be hard for us or this generation to explain to our children and to our grandchildren how we failed to provide them with a future as bright as the future that our parents and 200 years of generations left to us. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the accomplishments and contributions of a great Minnesotan, Harold Edward Stassen, as he approaches his 90th birthday. 
Harold Stassen began to make his mark on our Nation's history when he was elected Governor of Minnesota in 1938 at the young age of 31. He was known as the Boy Governor, he was twice reelected and remained the youngest chief executive of any State until 1943. 
In 1943, Mr. Stassen resigned from office as Governor to accept a commission in the U.S. Navy. There, he served honorably on the staff of Adm. William Halsey until 1945 and attained the rank of Captain. During World War II, Mr. Stassen earned the Legion of Merit award, was awarded six major battle stars, and was otherwise decorated three times. 
One little known fact about Harold Stassen is that he was personally responsible for freeing thousands of American prisoners of war in Japan shortly before that country surrendered in World War II. 
According to a 1995 newspaper account, Mr. Stassen spent 2 weeks planning the evacuation of some 35,000 prisoners from POW camps scattered throughout Japan. At the time, there was considerable anxiety that Japanese soldiers would choose to retaliate against the prisoners for their country's loss in the war. 
On August 29, 1945, before the official surrender date, Mr. Stassen actually set foot in Japan and began what would be the largely successful implementation of his evacuation plan. 
After World War II, Harold Stassen was appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt as a delegate to the 1945 San Francisco conference on the founding of the United Nations. He is now the only living American who participated in the drafting, negotiating, and signing of the United Nations Charter. 
Mr. Stassen went on to become an influential advisor throughout the administration of President Eisenhower. This included serving as a member of the National Security Council, as the Director of the Foreign Operations Administration, and as the Deputy Representative of the United States to the United Nations Disarmament Commission. 
Mr. Stassen also has made many contributions outside of public life, including his service as the president of the University of Pennsylvania from 1948 to 1953. 
However, he will be best remembered for his life-long interest in the United Nations. Since his involvement in the founding of the United Nations, Harold Stassen has maintained a dedicated and passionate commitment to bettering this international organization. 
In fact, he has published numerous proposals for reforming the United Nations Charter and has made it his personal mission to educate the American public about the U.N. 
Just 2 years ago, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. On April 13th of this year, Harold Stassen will celebrate his 90th birthday. A wide array of national and State officials will come together on this day in St. Paul, MN, to recognize Mr. Stassen. 
As we continue our bipartisan efforts to renew and strengthen the relationship between the United States and the United Nations, I think it is fitting to honor one American with a distinguished record of public service who has long supported that effort. 
As the chairman of the International Operations Subcommittee, the U.S. Congressional Delegate to the United Nations General Assembly, and also a fellow Minnesotan, I want to wish Harold Stassen a very happy 90th birthday and congratulate him for his accomplishments and many positive contributions to the history of the State of Minnesota, the United States, and the United Nations. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I take a few minutes this morning to talk about today's pending nomination, and also some of the problems that are surrounding one of our most important issues, and that is the storage of this country's nuclear waste. 
Mr. President, as the full Senate takes up the nomination of Federico PenAE6a to become the next Secretary of Energy, I rise today to discuss an issue of critical importance that has become necessarily linked to the PenAE6a nomination again, that is our Nation's nuclear waste storage problem. 
I say the two are linked because it has been the failure of the very agency Mr. PenAE6a has been appointed to lead--the U.S. Department of Energy--to carry out its legal obligations that has led to the nearly critical situation in which we currently find ourselves. It is this very failure on the part of the DOE which threatens utility ratepayers today and taxpayers in the future. 
For the Senate to fully appreciate the gravity of the situation, I believe that a brief summary of the history of this problem is in order. 
Since 1982, utility ratepayers have been required to pay the Federal Government nearly $13 billion of their hard-earned dollars in exchange for the promise that the Department of Energy would transport and store commercially generated nuclear waste in a centralized facility by January 31, 1998. 
However, with this deadline less than a year away and with over $6 billion spent by the Department of Energy, there has been very little progress to date toward keeping this 15-year-old promise of establishing a centralized Federal storage facility. 
In fact, though there has been measurable progress at the Yucca Mountain, NV facility, a permanent repository will not be completed until well into the next century. Mr. President, the 80 nuclear wastesites on this chart graphically illustrate the extent of this growing problem. 
Clearly, if the DOE is to meet the January 31, 1998 deadline, it must begin accepting nuclear waste at an interim storage facility, yet, that has not happened. In fact, the DOE recently notified States and utilities that it would not accept their commercial nuclear waste despite the law and the Federal court's effort to enforce it. Worse yet, even in the face of significant taxpayer liability for such irresponsible behavior by the Federal Government, the DOE has failed to offer a single constructive proposal to even begin the process of fulfilling its responsibility to the American people. 
Despite those facts, utility ratepayers are still being required to pay for a mismanaged program. In fact, over $630 million from the ratepayers go into the nuclear waste fund each year--without any tangible benefits or results to show for them. 
Our Nation's utility consumers and their pocketbooks aren't just hit once, either. Because of the DOE's failure to act, ratepayers are currently being forced to pay their hard-earned dollars to store waste onsite at commercial utility plants--a burden that would not be necessary had the Energy Department lived up to its legal obligations. 
Take, for example, the situation facing ratepayers in my home State of Minnesota. Since 1982, Minnesota's nuclear energy consumers have paid over $250 million into the nuclear waste fund believing that the Federal Government would fulfill its obligation to transport nuclear waste out of the State of Minnesota. But as time went on and the DOE continued to ignore their responsibilities, utilities in Minnesota and around the country were forced to temporarily store their waste within the confines of their own facilities. When it became clear to many utilities that storage space was running out and the Department of Energy would not accept waste by the established deadline, then the utilities had to go to their States to ask for additional onsite storage or else be forced to shut down those operations. 
For example, ratepayers in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin were forced to pay for onsite storage in cooling pools at Prairie Island in southeastern Minnesota. 
In 1994, with storage space running out, the Minnesota Legislature--after a bruising battle--voted to allow for limited onsite dry cask storage until the year 2002. 
Mr. President, the cost associated with this onsite storage is simply staggering--ratepayers in our service area alone have paid over $50 million for these costs and are estimated to pay another $111 million by the year 2015, in addition to the required payments to the Federal Government, the nuclear storage fund. 
To make matters worse, storage space will run out at Prairie Island in 2002, forcing the plant to close unless the State legislature once again makes up for the DOE's inaction. This will threaten over 30 percent of Minnesota's overall energy resources and will likely lead to even higher costs for Minnesota's ratepayers. In fact, the Minnesota Department of Public Service estimates that the increase in costs could reach as high as 17 percent, forcing ratepayers to eventually pay three times: Once to the nuclear waste fund, again up to $100 million for onsite storage and yet again for increased energy costs. 
And Minnesota is not alone in facing this unacceptable situation. Thirty six other States across the Nation will be facing similar circumstances of either shutting down their energy-generating capacity or continuing to bail out the Federal Government and its failure to act. 
Ratepayers are not the only ones who face serious consequences because of inaction by the DOE; taxpayers are threatened as well. 
Last year, the Federal courts ruled that the DOE will be liable for damages if it does not accept commercial nuclear waste by January 31, 1998. Under current law, these damages will not be paid for by anyone at the DOE, it will go to the American taxpayers--at an estimated cost of somewhere between $40 and $80 billion. Such a tremendous liability burden on taxpayers would make the public bailout of the savings and loan collapse seem small in comparison. 
What's worse is that while our States, utility ratepayers, and taxpayers are being unfairly punished by the Department of Energy's inaction, the Federal Government has been active in meeting the interim nuclear waste storage needs of foreign countries. 
Under the Atoms for Peace Program, the DOE's has resumed collecting nuclear spent fuel from a total of 41 countries. In fact, since last September, the DOE Savannah River facility had already received foreign spent fuel from Chile, Columbia, Germany, Switzerland, Sweden, and Canada. 
Ultimately, as I learned during a recent trip to the Savannah River site, up to 890 foreign research reactor cores will be accepted by the DOE over a 13 year period. 
In addition, our Government is actively helping other countries reduce their nuclear waste stockpiles. With the Department of Defense spending up to $400 million on designing and constructing an interim nuclear waste storage facility in Russia to help dismantle the cold war threat, the world will certainly be a safer place. 
Now, Mr. President, as a Senator who is concerned about our national security needs, I understand the rationale behind reducing our international nuclear dangers. 
But, what I, and many others cannot comprehend is how our Government has made it a priority to help foreign countries with their nuclear waste problems while simultaneously ignoring the concerns right here in our own country; not only that, but denying it has the responsibility and is going to court to stop it. 
It seems clear to me that while States, utilities, and ratepayers have kept their end of the bargain, the DOE has not done its part. And that sends the wrong message to the American people about trusting the promises of the Federal Government. 
Maybe that's why the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, 46 State agencies and 36 utilities have joined forces in a lawsuit to stop ratepayers' payments into the nuclear waste fund and to escrow $600 million that will soon go into the fund. 
For too long, our States, utilities, and ratepayers have acted in good faith, relying upon the Federal Government to live up to its obligations. Evidently, they have had enough of the DOE's excuses for inaction and have proposed their own recourse. 
This issue has created strange bedfellows as well. In a recent interview, former DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary agreed that action on interim site is needed as soon as possible. 
It's unfortunate that Secretary O'Leary waited until she was free from the administration to openly support interim storage, but I think her comments point not only to the need to resolve the interim storage impasse but also the political nature of this issue--again, I say the political nature of this issue. It is not science or technology, it's politics. She specifically stated that certain high-ranking officials connected with Vice President Al Gore see this issue in terms of politics, not policy. 
In addition, the former head of the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management under the Clinton administration, Daniel Dreyfus, believes the DOE must move to meet the January 31, 1998, deadline. 
Key labor unions have even joined the fight to restore the DOE's promises. 
J.J. Barry, president of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, recently wrote me, saying  
I am calling on you and your colleagues to put partisan politics aside for the good of our nation and America's workers and their families. We must address this problem now or else face serious economic and environmental consequences later. Please support passage of S. 104. 
I am also pleased that we have received the support of the Building and Construction Trades Union in this effort.

Mr. GRAMS. Despite this widespread, bipartisan support for our efforts to resolve the storage problem, the White House, under the dictates of Vice President Al Gore, still has not offered an alternative to either our bipartisan legislation, which they oppose, or the failed status quo. 
The American people deserve leadership from the Clinton-Gore administration, not just the consequences of Presidential aspirations. 
If such leadership will not come from the Clinton-Gore administration, then it will come from Congress. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, Senator Larry Craig and I crafted a bipartisan proposal, S. 104, identical to legislation supported last year by 63 Senators. 
We have put this proposal forward as a good faith effort to help resolve this situation for the sake of protecting our environment and the legitimate interests of our ratepayers and taxpayers. 
As I've stated, Congress has an obligation to protect the American public from the estimated $40 to $80 billion they face in liability expenses. 
Our bill will reform our current civilian nuclear waste program to avoid the squandering of billions of dollars of ratepayers' and taxpayers' money. It will make our environment safer, eliminate the current need for on-site storage at our Nation's nuclear plants, keep plants from shutting down prematurely due to lack of storage space, and keep energy prices stable. 
Our legislation also assures that transportation of nuclear waste will continue to be conducted in a safe manner. In fact, there have already been 2,400 shipments of high-level nuclear waste in our Nation, including numerous shipments of naval spent fuel. The safety record of these shipments speaks for itself. 
There are many other aspects of this bill which will help resolve the crisis facing the American public. Today, we on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will take a giant step forward in moving that bill closer to Senate passage. 
I applaud my distinguished colleague from Alaska, Chairman Murkowski, for his efforts in moving ahead with this much-needed, historic legislation. 
Keeping in mind the Clinton-Gore administration's stated opposition to our legislation, I took the opportunity to ask Secretary-designate PenAE6a for any specific, constructive alternatives he would propose to resolve this issue and help the Federal Government meet its legal obligations. 
Mr. PenAE6a's failure to offer specific responses during an Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing prompted me to send a letter to him asking for a detailed response outlining the specific steps he would urge to meet the January 31, 1998, deadline. 
After exchanging a series of letters with Mr. PenAE6a, I have become completely unsatisfied with the lack of specificity in his responses to my questions. While I appreciate Mr. PenAE6a's stated willingness to work with us toward an eventual resolution of this issue and his belief that this is a federal problem worthy of a Federal solution, I believe the American people deserve more. 
They deserve specific answers from an administration that has buried its head in the sand and an independent leader at the helm of the DOE who will affect a change in policy. 
I have concluded that at this point in time, no one recommended by the Clinton-Gore administration to head the DOE will be allowed to lead. 
For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to read a portion of Mr. PenAE6a's letter dated March 6 that best illustrates my point. 
Mr. PenAE6a writes: 
I cannot, however, outline for you specific steps for meeting the January 31, 1998 date. The Department of Energy has indicated to the court and in responses to the Congress that there is no set of actions or activities that could be taken under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to enable the Department to begin receiving spent fuel at an interim storage facility or a repository on that date. 
Frankly, Mr. President, as an elected representative of the ratepayers who have had over $6 billion thrown away by a department without a single answer to their problems and as an elected representative of the taxpayers who will ultimately assume tens of billions of dollars in liability if progress is not made, I find that answer insufficient and devoid of the leadership we so desperately need at the DOE. 
I believe that Mr. PenAE6a is a decent and honorable man, but I also believe that he has not provided the needed answers or displayed the leadership necessary to help resolve this pressing national issue. 
Even though I shall do my best in working with him in the future, I cannot, in good conscience, today vote to confirm Mr. PenAE6a to be our next Secretary of Energy.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as the Senate further deliberates on the nomination of Federico Pena to become the next Secretary of Energy, I rise again to discuss an issue of paramount importance to our Nation's ratepayers and taxpayers: nuclear waste storage. 
While I have already discussed on this floor the long history of this debate, I believe a brief review of this history is warranted. 
Since 1982, energy consumers have been required to pay almost $13 billion into a trust fund created to facilitate the disposal of our Nation's commercial nuclear waste. 
In return for such payments, nuclear utilities and their ratepayers were assured that the Department of Energy would begin transporting and storing nuclear waste in a centralized Federal repository by January 31, 1998. 
This deadline is less than a year away. Over $6 billion of the ratepayer's money has been spent by the Department of Energy, with very little progress being made by the Department in living up to the Federal law which requires the DOE to accept commercial nuclear waste. In fact, late last year, the DOE politically punted their problem by notifying utilities and States that it would not meet the deadline, despite a Federal court's ruling that it must do so or be liable for substantial damages. 
Since then, the Department has failed to set forth a single, constructive proposal to meet its legal obligations, thereby threatening the interests of ratepayers and ultimately the taxpayers. 
Who will be most affected by the lack of DOE action? Obviously, ratepayers come to mind. As I have stated before, our Nation's energy customers have already paid almost $13 billion into the Nuclear Waste Fund. 
At the same time, since the DOE has not met its obligations to accept nuclear waste, utilities and ratepayers have paid and will continue to pay for onsite storage at over 70 commercial nuclear powerplants. In other words, ratepayers are being hit twice because the Department of Energy has failed to meet its legal obligations to the American people. 
In addition, the Energy Department's failure to move nuclear waste out of the States affects not just our Nation's consumers; it compromises our taxpayers as well. 
Last year, the Federal courts ruled that the DOE will be liable if it does not accept commercial nuclear waste by January 31, 1998. But under current law, no one at the DOE itself will have to pay the damages--that bill will go to the American taxpayers at an estimated cost of 40 to 80 billion taxpayer dollars. This staggering and irresponsible potential damage liability and the DOE's reluctance to provide specific answers to resolve this situation should be an affront to the President, the Vice President, the Congress and more importantly, the American taxpayer. 
To make matters worse, DOE officials under the Clinton-Gore administration have not only avoided specific responses to this fiasco, but have openly indicated that the States--not the Department--have the responsibility to address the problem in the absence of action by the Federal Government. In other words, in the last hours, the DOE is saying that it will not meet its responsibility and is tossing the ball to the States and the ratepayers to handle the DOE's mistake. 
For example, in a recent hearing before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, DOE Under Secretary Thomas Grumbly argued that nuclear waste storage problems facing States like Minnesota are not the Federal Government's responsibility. 
Mr. President, I find that attitude completely arrogant, devoid of the facts, and a threat to the viability of long-term energy resources for the American public. In 1982, States, utilities and through them, ratepayers, signed a contract with the Federal Government to dispose of commercial nuclear waste, a contract upheld by the courts last year. 
With that understanding, States planned for limited onsite temporary storage capacity, relying upon the Federal Government's fulfillment of its contractual obligation. 
Yet, as the years passed, it became apparent that the Federal Government would not keep its word, prompting threats of potential energy crises in States with limited storage space. 
For example, the depletion of storage space in my home State of Minnesota will mean that one of our utilities will lose its operating capacity by 2002 if the Federal Government does not act soon. This plainly means that consumers in Minnesota would not only lose 30 percent of their energy resources but would also have to pay higher energy prices--estimated as much as 17 percent more--as a result of Federal inaction. 
Therefore, ratepayers will not get hit just once or twice, but potentially three times, if a resolution is not found on a national level. 
The crisis facing both our ratepayers and taxpayers is simply unacceptable. The American people do not deserve excuses and inaction; they need real answers from the Clinton-Gore administration. They need leadership on this issue--not a crass political debate arising out of Presidential politics. 
With that in mind, I took the opportunity to ask Secretary-designate Federico PenAE6a of his specific and definitive views to resolve this issue. 
Since I believe the American people deserve answers from their leaders, I sent a letter to Mr. PenAE6a asking for a detailed response outlining the specific steps he would urge to meet the January 31, 1998, deadline.

Mr. GRAMS. After this exchange of letters, I still felt troubled by Mr. PenAE6a's inability to provide specific answers about how he and the Clinton-Gore administration intend to resolve our Nation's nuclear waste storage problem. 
Because I have not received a sufficient response to date, I objected to an effort to expedite full consideration of Mr. PenAE6a's nomination late last week. 
Since that time, however, I had a telephone conversation with the Secretary-designate over the nuclear waste issue. While I am still concerned with his continued lack of specific answers, I was pleased to hear Mr. PenAE6a agree with me and the Federal courts that any resolution of this issue ultimately involves Federal responsibility. Contradicting what DOE Under Secretary Grumbly stated before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee last month, Mr. PenAE6a provided verbal assurances of his commitment that our nuclear waste storage situation is a Federal problem worthy of a Federal solution. But what that means is taxpayers will still be asked to pay extra for the DOE's failure to do its job, and it creates the possibility of taxpayer liability high enough to make the public bailout of the savings and loan collapse seem small in comparison. 
While I am not completely satisfied with Mr. PenAE6a's overall incomplete response to this quickly approaching crisis and will vote against his nomination based on his inability to provide specific answers, I will not object to moving his nomination forward for the sake of advancing this debate. 
For this reason, I hope that as the new DOE Secretary, Mr. PenAE6a will play an active role in pulling the administration's head out of the sand and becoming a constructive player in this debate. 
Specifically, it is my hope that Mr. PenAE6a will show the necessary leadership and push the administration to support the common-sense solution crafted by Senate Energy Chairman Frank Murkowski, Senator Larry Craig and myself. We will mark up this bill in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee tomorrow, and I believe the chairman will deliver a bipartisan resolution. 
With the January 31, 1998 deadline fast approaching, the administration and Congress owe the States, ratepayers, and the taxpayers nothing less than the assurance that promises made by the Federal Government will be promises kept.  
Exhibit 1 Washington, DC, March 4, 1997. 
Mr. Federico PenAE6a, Secretary-designate, Department of Energy, Washington, DC. 
Dear Mr. PenAE6a. As the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee further deliberates on your nomination as Secretary of the Department of Energy (DOE), I'm writing to solicit your views on recent comments made concerning our nation's failed commercial nuclear waste disposal program. 
As you know, the DOE has announced that it will be unable to meet its legal deadline of January 31, 1998 to begin accepting commercial nuclear waste despite a mandate by a federal court and the collection of over $12 billion in ratepayer's funds. As a result of this failure, the Court of Appeals will decide the appropriate amount of liability owed by the DOE to certain utilities, possibly putting taxpayers at risk because of the Department's lack of measurable action. Meanwhile, the federal government continues to collect and transport foreign-generated spent fuel for interim storage without any apparent technical or environmental risks. 
In light of these activities, it was no surprise that former DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary recently contradicted the Clinton Administration's longstanding objection to resolving the centralized interim-storage impasse for our ratepayers and, ultimately, our taxpayers. Her comments on the need to move forward with a temporary waste storage site upon completion of the viability assessment at Yucca Mountain reflect the bipartisan, common-sense reforms contained in S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration has ignored this reality by failing to become a constructive player in this process. 
Although I am disappointed that Mrs. O'Leary's comments came after her tenure as Secretary, I applaud her courage in expressing her views honestly and thoroughly. I strongly believe that the next DOE Secretary must provide the committed leadership necessary to resolve this critical situation while in office. With this in mind, I want to know your specific thoughts on Mrs. O'Leary's comments that the DOE should move forward on a temporary nuclear waste storage site next year at Yucca Mountain if a viability assessment is completed at the permanent site. If you disagree with Mrs. O'Leary, I want to know what specific alternatives you would propose to meet the federal government's legal obligation to accept nuclear waste by January 31, 1998. 
For too long, our nation's ratepayers and taxpayers have been held hostage to what has become a political debate. They deserve better and, more importantly, deserve an immediate solution to this issue. For that reason, I expect a specific, constructive response to my questions before the Senate votes to confirm your nomination. 
Sincerely, 
Rod Grams, U.S. Senator. 
 March 5, 1997. 
Hon. Rod Grams, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator Grams: Thank you for your letter of March 4, 1997 concerning the Department of Energy's civilian nuclear waste disposal program and the comments made recently by former Secretary Hazel O'Leary. I have not spoken with Secretary O'Leary about her remarks and, therefore, am not in a position to comment on them. 
As I stated when I appeared before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, I am committed to working with the Committee and the Congress toward resolving the complex and important issue of nuclear waste storage and disposal in a timely and sensible manner, consistent with the President's policy, which is based upon sound science and the protection of public health, safety, and the environment. 
I am very cognizant of the Department's contractual obligation with the utilities concerning the disposal of commercial spent fuel, and, after confirmation, I also expect to meet with representatives of the nuclear industry and other stakeholders to discuss the Department's response to the recent court decision and the consequences of the delay in meeting that contractual obligation. 
As Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles emphasized in his February 27 letter to Chairman Murkowski, the Administration believes that the Federal government's long-standing commitment to permanent, geologic disposal should remain the basic goal of high-level radioactive waste policy. Accordingly, the Administration believes that a decision on the siting of an interim storage facility should be based on objective, science-based criteria and should be informed by the viability assessment of Yucca Mountain, expected in 1998. Therefore, as the President has stated, he would veto any legislation that would designate an interim storage facility at a specific site before the viability of the Yucca Mountain site has been determined. 
In conclusion, I want to strongly emphasize again that I am committed to working with you and other members of the Committee and the Congress on these difficult issues. 
Sincerely, Federico PenAE6a.  
 Washington, DC, March 5, 1997. 
Mr. Federico PenAE6a, Secretary-designate, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC. 
Dear Mr. PenAE6a: I received your letter, dated today, in response to my most recent questions on our nation's nuclear waste policy. Although I appreciate the timeliness of your response, I am still concerned about the absence of specific proposals from you on how best to resolve this important issue. 
In your letter, you wrote that the Clinton Administration `believes that a decision on the siting of a storage facility should be based on objective, science-based criteria and should be informed by the viability assessment of Yucca Mountain, expected in 1998.' Frankly, this response states nothing more than the position you have taken in the past, leaving questions about whether the viability study can be completed in time for the DOE to realistically accept waste by the legal deadline on January, 31, 1998 and what can be done to meet the deadline if the permanent site at Yucca Mountain is not determined to be viable. 
I certainly hope you can understand my concerns, given that you yourself have publicly admitted that following this track would make it impossible for the DOE to meet the January 31, 1998 deadline. 
More importantly, you did not answer my central question regarding what specific, constructive alternatives you would propose in order for the DOE to begin accepting waste from states by January 31, 1998, as outlined in statute and ordered by the courts. 
With that in mind, I would again request a specific response from you--prior to the Senate vote on your confirmation--to the following question: given that the current Administration position would result in the failure of the DOE to accept waste from states by January 31, 1998, what specific, constructive alternatives would you propose to guarantee that the DOE will meet this legal, court-imposed deadline? 
I look forward to your response. 
Sincerely, 
Rod Grams, U.S. Senator. 
 March 6, 1997. 
Hon. Rod Grams, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC. 
Dear Senator Grams: Your letter of March 5, 1997 asks me to outline the specific, constructive steps that may be taken to guarantee the Department of Energy will meet its contractual commitments to begin taking nuclear waste discharged from civilian nuclear reactors on January 31, 1998. 
Let me say again that I am committed to carrying out a responsible strategy for disposing of nuclear waste. I will work with you and your colleagues toward that end, consistent with sound science and the protection of public health, safety, and the environment. I cannot, however, outline for you specific steps for meeting the January 31, 1998 date. The Department of Energy has indicated to the court and in responses to the Congress that there is no set of actions or activities that could be taken under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act to enable the Department to begin receiving spent fuel at an interim storage facility or a repository on that date. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has itself recognized that compliance with the January 31, 1998 date is not possible under the law or even under the Committee's bill reported in the last Congress. 
In recognition of this state of affairs, I have indicated that following confirmation I intend to meet with representatives of the nuclear utility industry and other stakeholders to address the consequences of delay in DOE's meeting its contractual obligations and the Department's response to the recent court action. 
Again, I wish to emphasize my pledge to work with the Congress in addressing this matter, consistent with the President's policy. 
Sincerely, Federico PenAE6a.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of our Nation's taxpayers and ratepayers in seeking to reaffirm the promises made to them by the Federal Government well over a decade and a half ago. Given that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee this morning reported out the nomination of Federico PenAE6a to be the new Secretary of Energy and that full consideration by the Senate on his nomination is likely to occur soon, I find it both necessary and timely to reignite today the debate on our Nation's nuclear waste storage problem. 
Since 1982, our nuclear energy ratepayers have been required to pay over 12 billion of their hard-earned dollars to the Federal Government. And that was in exchange for the promise to transport and store commercially generated nuclear waste in a centralized Federal facility by January 31, 1998. 
Unfortunately, this obligation has never been met by the DOE, which has already spent over 6 billion of those ratepayer dollars, yet has little to show in exchange for that massive investment. Today, our ratepayers continue to pay into the Nuclear Waste Fund, as well as for on-site storage at commercial nuclear facilities across the Nation, including the one at Prairie Island in southeastern Minnesota. 
So now ratepayers are being asked to pay twice for the storage of nuclear waste. 
Even as 41 States wait for the Department of Energy to fulfill its promise to begin accepting domestic nuclear waste, the Federal Government continues to accept, transport, and store spent nuclear fuel from Federal facilities and foreign research reactors. For national security reasons, the Federal Government is even helping to pay for an interim storage facility in Russia. 
Yet, Mr. President, despite the strides we are making toward interim storage of foreign and Federal waste, the situation has grown critical for our own nuclear utilities and ratepayers. 
For example, even though the Federal courts have ruled that the DOE will be liable if it does not accept commercial nuclear waste by January 31, 1998--thereby putting taxpayers at risk for the Federal Government's inaction--the DOE has shrugged off this legal mandate, claiming that it will not be able to meet the deadline. Even worse, the DOE has yet to recommend the specific action it would take in order to accept any of our commercial nuclear waste. 
So again, it can accept foreign or Federal nuclear waste, transport and even pay for interim storage in Russia, but yet our Government says it cannot handle what it is under contract and obligation to do for our nuclear waste. 
I find this very troubling, particularly for my fellow Minnesotans, who stand to lose up to 30 percent of their energy resources if a solution is not found soon. Mr. President, the clock is ticking. 
In 1994, the Federal Government's failure to live up to its promise of accepting nuclear waste sparked a prolonged and controversial debate in the Minnesota State Legislature over whether to continue on-site storage at Prairie Island. While the legislature eventually voted to extend storage capacity until 2002, it would not have been forced to do so had the DOE met its legal obligation to begin accepting waste from Minnesota. 
At every turn, the DOE's response to this growing problem has been one of sheer arrogance and inaction. For example, when asked by me at an Energy Committee hearing how the DOE expected to resolve the situation facing Minnesota, DOE Undersecretary Thomas Grumbly argued that the problem was a State issue, in spite of the fact that the Federal government signed a contractual, legally binding agreement with utilities and the States to accept their waste by January 31, 1998. 
He said, take that back to the States. That is your problem, not theirs. 
In other words, now that the DOE has elected not to meet its responsibility, it has simply buried its head in the sand in a brazen attempt to avoid accountability. Instead of taking action, the Clinton-Gore administration is making excuses--trying once again to take a national policy problem and turn it into a crassly political debate. Unfortunately, the losers of this cynical gamesmanship are the American people. 
Maybe that is why 46 State agencies and 36 utilities recently sued the Department of Energy to stop requiring future payments into the Nuclear Waste Fund and to escrow over $600 million in current payments. If the Clinton-Gore administration does not wake up and take action, this lawsuit will mark only the beginning of a costly legal process to force the Federal Government to own up to its responsibilities. 
Because obviously, if a solution is not reached now, taxpayers, consumers, and those who care about the environment will be left stranded. That is the reality--and some of those who once argued the loudest against resolving this issue have come to the very same conclusion. 
For example, last month, former Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary contradicted Vice President Gore's longstanding objection to meaningful action on this issue. Her comments on the need to move forward with a temporary nuclear waste storage site after the completion of a viability assessment at Yucca Mountain reflected the national will to resolve this issue. 
Although I am disappointed that Mrs. O'Leary's honest assessment came after her tenure as Secretary, I strongly believe the next Department of Energy Secretary must provide the commitment, the leadership necessary to immediately resolve this critical situation. 
Again, it is not a technical problem. It is not a problem of science. It is a problem of political will to be able to make that political decision within the administration to accept this responsibility and to provide the answers. 
With that in mind, I, like many of my colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, took the time to ask Secretary-designate PenAE6a his views on resolving this issue. Unfortunately, he failed to give specific and definitive answers to our questions during his confirmation hearing. 
Because I do not believe the Senate should confirm Mr. PenAE6a's nomination before we have received specific answers, I sent a letter asking Mr. PenAE6a for a detailed response outlining the exact steps the department plans to take in order to meet the January 31, 1998, deadline. 
Yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. PenAE6a that failed to articulate any specific solution. So in response, I again sent him another letter reiterating my question, and I hope to hear back from him today.

Mr. GRAMS. Today, when the Energy and Natural Resources Committee took up Mr. PenAE6a's nomination, I voted `present,' as I had announced I would several weeks ago. 
As the author of legislation to eliminate the Department of Energy--legislation prompted, in part, by the nuclear waste fiasco--I had decided that I could not in good conscience vote for Mr. PenAE6a's nomination to head up a department that should not continue to exist. 
Yet, at the same time, I did not want to cast a vote that would be misinterpreted as a vote against Mr. PenAE6a personally. 
Since then, I have grown increasingly troubled, however, for the reasons that I have outlined here today, by Mr. PenAE6a's inability to provide specific answers about how he and the Clinton-Gore administration intend to resolve our Nation's nuclear waste storage problem. 
Again, he has to get these answers from the administration. And it is Clinton-Gore that have to make these decisions. 
We in the Senate have our own proposal, and that is our bill S. 104. That is the Murkowski-Craig-Grams bill, which won the support of 63 Senators last year. 
As a Senator representing Minnesota ratepayers who already have paid over $250 million in exchange for no tangible benefit, representing taxpayers who may be held financially liable for the Federal Government's failure to act, and representing citizens concerned about protecting our environment, I believe that the Senate must not rush ahead in confirming Mr. PenAE6a's nomination before we receive from him a specific and constructive response to our questions. 
Now, while I hold out hope that we will receive such answers from Mr. PenAE6a in the immediate future, I am willing to work with my colleagues in ensuring that a final vote is not taken before a specific, constructive response is given. Accordingly, I would object to any unanimous-consent agreement to bring up Mr. PenAE6a's nomination for a vote at this time. 
The Senate cannot simply allow itself to be lulled by vague promises to work together on this issue. Fifteen years of unfulfilled promises should have taught us that lesson. 
Again, with the January 31, 1998, deadline fast approaching, we have our own responsibility to the American people to ensure that the obligations of the Federal Government are satisfied. We owe them nothing less.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I want to congratulate my colleague from Utah on all the great work he has done during this very, very important debate on the balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, if recent history is any indication, we know that promises are never going to balance the budget, good intentions are never going to balance the budget, renewed commitments are never going to balance the budget, and pledges of cooperation are never going to balance the budget. Left on its own, we know that Congress itself will never balance the Federal budget. 
In the 1 minute that I spend delivering this statement, the national debt will increase by more than $500,000. In the past 24 hours, it has grown by over $721 million. Over the last three decades, the national debt has mushroomed to more than $5.3 trillion. The question you have to ask is, where will it stop? At what point do we say enough? 
What will it take to convince Washington that we are strangling the financial future of our children and our grandchildren with the noose that is being knotted by our very own hands? Mr. President, after all the promises, intentions, commitments, and pledges have failed, our last best hope rests with passage of the balanced budget amendment. In the name of America's children, I urge my colleagues to vote yes. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to again express my strong support for the balanced budget amendment. 
I want to thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee for providing a forum which has encouraged debate on all sides of this critically important issue. The public has been well served by these many hours of discussion. 
Mr. President, let me describe the need for the balanced budget amendment by comparing it to a situation to which many Americans can relate. 
By repeated abuse of a high-interest credit card, your debt is rapidly mounting until you reach the point of maxing out. You're barely paying enough to cover the minimum monthly payments--let alone make any dent in the principal--and your debts threaten to consume the entire family budget. 
With every available dollar being funneled into your credit card payments, there is no money left over to meet your daily needs or invest in your family's future. 
You, the overextended consumer, are left with only two viable options: Either file for bankruptcy or drastically cut your spending. 
If you're so far in debt that you see nothing in your future but despair, you may seek out the help of a credit counseling service. I guarantee they'll take one look at the horrendous mess you've created and demand you come up with an immediate plan for climbing out of debt. 
They'll tell you there are only three options that will return you to financial solvency: Discipline, discipline, and discipline. 
Now imagine that scenario multiplied several trillion times, where the reckless consumer is not an individual but the Federal Government itself. That's very much the predicament the United States will soon face. 
As Washington continues to spend dollars it does not have, each annual budget deficit is added to the balance of the overall national debt. 
The national debt today stands at $5.3 trillion, or $20,000 for every American man, woman, and child. 
The debt is increasing by $721 million every day, and $1 in every $7 Federal tax goes to service just the interest on a debt so massive. 
If an individual acted with equal irresponsibility, the consequences would be severe. 
The Federal Government, however, simply writes another IOU in the name of our children and grandchildren and keeps right on spending, demanding services today that it wants our kids to pay for tomorrow. 
In recent years, the credit counselors--in this case, the American taxpayers--have been scrutinizing Federal spending and demanding that the Government be accountable for every tax dollar. 
But instead of hearing `discipline, discipline, discipline,' Washington somehow hears it as `spend, spend, spend.' And spend it does--even when every ounce of common sense demands that it should not. 
Despite all the recent talk about controlling Federal spending, there is no reason to believe Washington has fundamentally changed its ways. 
Without the constitutional protections of a balanced budget amendment, the outlook for our fiscal future is grim: The national debt will continue to explode, America will eventually run out of IOU's, and a bankrupt nation will surely follow. 
For an entire generation--more than three decades--Washington has talked about eliminating the deficit. `[My program] is the surest and soundest way of achieving in time a balanced budget,' said President John F. Kennedy in his State of the Union Address in 1963. 
That sentiment has been echoed by every President since Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton. 
The fact that we haven't balanced the budget since 1969 demonstrates that talking about balancing the budget is far easier than actually doing it. 
Many budget balancing plans have been proposed over the years, yet even the most well-intentioned of them have not brought about balance, just larger deficits. 
The pervasive growth of government makes it painfully obvious that in a government where politicians exhibit compassion by spending other people's money, we cannot be assured our budgets will ever balance without the moral authority of the Constitution to enforce it. 
The latest budget proposal from the White House illustrates the real need for a balanced budget amendment. 
Although President Clinton's plan is billed as being balanced, it really isn't--the deficit would increase next year and early reports from the Congressional Budget Office say the Clinton plan would remain about $80 billion short of balance in 2002. 
Seventy-five percent of the President's deficit reduction would not occur until after the year 2000, meaning the Clinton administration will never have to make the tough choices it will take to eliminate the deficit. In other words, talk about it but leave it up to somebody else to do it. And most disturbing, instead of cutting spending and asking Washington to sacrifice, the President's budget raises taxes by $76 billion and asks, once again, that the taxpayers step forward and sacrifice. I can think of no more compelling justification for enacting the balanced budget amendment. 
Despite guarded optimism in Washington about reaching agreement this year to balance the budget, surveys show most Americans do not believe the deficit will be eliminated by the target date of 2002. They realize that all the laws, goals, plans, and pledges may not be strong enough to hold back the tide of rising deficits. 
Even if the budget were to be balanced in 2002, there is nothing to stop a future, less-vigilant Congress from picking up where the big spenders left off. The constitutional protections guaranteed by the balanced budget amendment remain our best hope of enforcing future fiscal restraint. 
Mr. President, I am greatly disappointed by the efforts of some of our colleagues who have chosen to use Social Security as a shield to disguise their opposition to the balanced budget amendment. Most of us have come to the conclusion this is nothing more than a transparent political ploy to defeat the amendment, while playing to the fears of senior citizens by demagoguing the Social Security issue. 
I have absolutely no doubt that if the Social Security concerns were erased today, another problem with the amendment would crop up tomorrow, and we would once again find ourselves in the position of being a single vote short of passage. This is already evident through the lineup of amendments we have been considering the last few weeks. 
I wonder if my colleagues are aware of the massive tax increase the American people would be forced to accept if we did indeed factor Social Security surpluses out of the budget process. 
Between 2002 and 2007 alone, the tax hike required to bring the budget into balance would amount to $706 billion. Yes, $706 billion: That dwarfs the record-breaking $265 billion tax increase President Clinton ushered through Congress in 1993. 
As their share, taxpayers in my home State of Minnesota could face a total Federal tax hike of about $12 billion. That is an average household tax increase of $1,085 per year. And again, that is just from 2002 to 2007. 
Mr. President, Social Security is facing serious problems, and reforms are needed to ensure that retirement benefits will continue to be available to all Americans. But taking Social Security off budget does nothing to help the trust fund remain solvent. 
We all know that, by law, any Social Security surpluses must be invested in Treasury securities. Without serious reform, as long as the Government is allowed to grow and to continue its deficit-spending ways, it will still borrow from the trust fund, leaving nothing but IOUs to future beneficiaries. 
Therefore, first and foremost, we must overhaul the way Washington spends taxpayer dollars by imposing some constitutionally mandated fiscal discipline. We must pass the balanced budget amendment and we must take appropriate actions to protect and preserve the trust fund. 
While I understand the arguments of those who have supported the various Social Security amendments during this debate, a more reasonable approach would be to take Social Security off budget after the budget is balanced. Congress should begin considering legislation that ensures Social Security benefits will be payable for the current and future generations, stops the use of trust fund surpluses on other Government programs, and puts real assets in the Social Security trust fund. 
For now, let us face it: we will never achieve a balanced budget if Social Security is taken off budget and omitted from our deficit calculations. President Clinton himself has come to that very conclusion. 
Mr. President, a bipartisan coalition in Congress is committed to passing a balanced budget amendment in 1997 because we believe the taxpayers deserve a responsible Government that pays its bills and saves for the future. 
We also support passing the balanced budget amendment in 1997. 
Ending deficits and lowering the national debt will free up public and private resources for more productive and innovative uses in the global economy of the 21st century. On a more personal level, working Americans will benefit directly when a balanced budget leads to lower interest rates that could save a middle-class family about $125 a month in lower mortgage, car, and student loan payments. 
The 105th Congress has a historic opportunity and obligation to leave a legacy of responsible governing for the generations to come. The path is well marked: To one side leads the road to bankruptcy and America's fiscal ruin; to the other, the path of political promises which may or not be kept; while directly ahead lies the trail of discipline, discipline, discipline we must--pursue the road to prosperity and accountable governing marked by passage of the balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor.  
Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am also pleased to be here this morning and to join with my colleagues in introducing the Medicare Payment Equity Act, as the Senator from Wyoming has just outlined. The passage of this legislation, I believe, is critical in righting the wrongs in the Medicare system against States like Minnesota, Kansas, Wyoming, and some of the other more rural States in the country. 
There are three points I would like to emphasize, just to add to what the Senator from Wyoming has already said. First, again, to reiterate, the Medicare reimbursement formula is just plain unfair. While every American pays the same payroll tax to the Medicare trust fund, Minnesotans find themselves with the second-lowest reimbursement rates in the Nation. By the way, every county in Minnesota falls below the national average in the terms of Medicare reimbursement. 
Second, the Medicare reimbursement formula discourages quality health care. My State of Minnesota has been consistently recognized throughout the Nation as one of the most innovative, one of the most efficient and cost-conscious States in the terms of health care. Yet these very same qualities, the traits which should be encouraged, not discouraged, have skewed the Medicare formula against our providers and also against our beneficiaries. 
Finally, the Medicare reimbursement formula discriminates against senior citizens who live in rural areas of America. These older Americans already face fewer health care options than those who live in urban centers. That is due to the lower reimbursement rates received by health plans. However, there is no incentive for them to offer managed care services. So that means fewer choices for the senior citizens who are living in rural parts of the United States. 
So, Mr. President, the system needs to be changed and that is exactly what our legislation does. By making fundamental corrections to the Medicare reimbursement formula, this bill will restore equity, it will help to expand access, and will also help to ensure a greater array of health care choices to beneficiaries in States like Minnesota as well as across rural America. It will change the system, and I am very proud to join my colleagues in introducing this very important piece of legislation. 
Again, I am pleased to be here to join my colleagues again in reintroducing and supporting the Medicare Payment Equity Act. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today and I want to pay tribute to the University of Minnesota basketball team, who last night clinched their first Big Ten title in 15 years. 
As you know, the Golden Gophers defeated the Michigan Wolverines 55 to 54, in a hard-fought, come-from-behind victory. Down by four with under a minute to play, the Gophers' confidence, determination, and faith led them to victory. This is truly an accomplishment that all Minnesotans can be proud of. Under the leadership of coach Clem Haskins, the Gophers have shot, rebounded, and passed their way into the national spotlight as a team to be taken seriously in the upcoming NCAA tournament. 
With the great play of senior guard Bobby Jackson, junior guard Eric Harris, junior forward Sam Jacobson, and senior co-captain centers John Thomas and Trevor Winter, along with the rest of the Big Ten championship team, the Golden Gophers have set a school record 25 victories in a single season, with three regular season games to play. Among the notable accomplishments this team has achieved have been their two victories over Michigan, an overtime victory over Indiana, and a season sweep over our border rival Iowa Hawkeyes. This team has been on a mission all year to gain respect, not only from the Big Ten but also from the Nation, after having all its starters returning from last year from a team that was not invited to play in the NCAA tournament. As you can see, these Golden Gophers took matters into their own hands and earned the qualifying bid from the NCAA by winning the Big Ten title outright. 
From the land of 10,000 frozen lakes, this Minnesota Golden Gopher basketball team has provided warmth and excitement to fans statewide in an otherwise very cold and long Minnesota winter. Again, Mr. President, I want to congratulate Clem Haskins and his Big Ten championship team from the University of Minnesota, and wish them all the best in their final regular season games and when they go for it all in the upcoming NCAA tournament.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Burns' legislation, the Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1997 and am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the bill. 
This is important legislation which will create the proper balance between encryption technology export interests as well as national security interests. The administration's encryption policy was disappointing to me, since it tipped the balance too far in the direction of security and law enforcement concerns, risking important privacy rights of producers and users of cncryption technology. 
Again our Government has found itself in the position of creating unilateral export controls that will do only one thing--essentially terminate export opportunities for U.S. companies. To limit U.S. companies from exporting encyrption technology at 56 bits without a costly key recovery system will simply price us out of the market. Many of our allies are ready to sell far more sophisticated technology without a key recovery system. It's not hard to see who will pick up most of a growing encryption technology global market. 
Also, key recovery is not needed for encryption technology sold domestically or imported. If U.S. companies are forced to sell only the technology including the key recovery for cost savings reasons, it's also not hard to see how quickly the domestic market will dry up in favor of imports. The solution is not import controls. The Burns bill is the solution that 18 Senators of both parties have supported today. 
Senator Burns' bill protects national security interests. It would not allow exports over what is available from our allies. It also allows Commerce to prohibit specific exports where there is substantial evidence the technology will be diverted or used by terrorists, drug dealers and other criminals. Further, it creates an Information Security Board designed to get industry and law enforcement interests together to address this important issue. 
I am sensitive to law enforcement and national security concerns, but the holes in the administration's policy are enormous and smack of politics more than sound policy. Criminals and terrorists will simply not use U.S. technology, or they will find a way to circumvent the key recovery system. Also, they can use encryption technology within the U.S. without the same scrutiny. 
Senator Burns has described the many problems and questions raised by a key recovery system held by a third party, so I won't belabor them. But the privacy concerns are real. I can't imagine why users would want to buy a product that simply puts at risk unwarranted release of the encrypted material. No matter how many protections can be built into the key escrow system, there is no way to avoid some misuse or abuse of the system. 
Senator Burns should be congratulated for his effort to correct this policy. I applaud his efforts and strongly support them as chairman of the International Finance Subcommittee of the Banking Committee which has jurisdiction over many export control issues.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, to introduce the Dairy Fairness Act. In short, this bill repeals the provision in the 1996 farm bill creating the so-called Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. 
Senator Feingold and I offer this legislation with 10 other colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, for two basic reasons: Fair process and sound policy. The compact sets a very dangerous precedent by violating both. Let me be specific, first regarding process. 
Back in the 103d Congress--to give history--the Senate Judiciary Committee held a business meeting to consider the compact, without the benefit of a prior public hearing, and reported the bill to the floor. The full Senate never considered it. A House Judiciary subcommittee held a hearing on the proposal, but eventually sent it to full committee without a recommendation because the vote was evenly divided for and against the compact. The bill died in full committee. It is important to note that the official Department of Agriculture witness at the House hearing stated the administration had no position and twice stated that, we believe this is a matter that warrants further review and consideration. 
In the 104th Congress, the compact was the subject of not one single hearing in either the Judiciary Committee or the Agriculture Committee of the Senate. Nor was it the topic of a single hearing in counterpart committees in the House. The importance of all this is that veteran lawmakers knew, at best, that the Department of Agriculture was not sure about the compact. And, 11 freshmen senators and 87 House freshmen knew little-to-nothing about the compact because of the lack of any public record. 
Despite this, the compact was exhumed from its crypt and found its way into the Senate's version of the farm bill. Fortunately, many of my colleagues and I led a successful bipartisan effort to strip the compact from the farm bill. The House had never included the compact in its version. 
Now, here is the kicker. The compact never had ample consideration in the 103d Congress. It never had a single hearing in the 104th. The compact was not included in the House version of the farm bill. And, it was stripped out of the Senate's version. But the compact came back to life in conference. It was included in the 1996 farm bill and, due to time constraints on passage of farm legislation, as we know, the compact became law. 
Now, my purpose in reciting this litany of events is not to disparage the respective committees for not considering the compact. They have their priorities. Nor do I mean to disparage those in the conference committee for agreeing to the compact. 
They worked hard to present a timely and--aside from the compact--excellent farm bill for farmers who were already making planting decisions, if not already planting at the time the bill was passed. 
Now my point is best summarized by the late Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes who said that `the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes can be carried out.' 
I would like to think that my colleagues in what's been called the most deliberative body in the world would want nothing less for the compact or any other proposal. Unfortunately, the compact never faced the test and, as a consequence it has never been accepted. 
Mr. President, there is no doubt about it, the compact circumvented a very important process. 
In regard to policy, the scenario does not improve. In a nutshell, the compact would permit a six-State compact commission to fix prices for that region's dairy producers. Yet, simple economics tells us that the higher minimum price set by the commission will result in even more milk production in the six-State region--which is great news for producers in those six States. But the overproduction will undoubtedly further depress producer income for every other region of the country. 
Unfortunately, as many of my colleagues know, producer income nationally is already so depressed that the Secretary announced some emergency steps to correct the problem including the purchase of $5 million in cheese and advanced cheese purchases for the School Lunch Program. In the Midwest, it's reported to be so bad that small- and mid-sized producers aren't even recovering the cost of production. But despite all this, the compact will drive national dairy prices down even further in 44 States in order to boost producer income in 6, even though the 6 have traditionally received higher class I prices in the first place. 
The compact is patently unfair. The inequity it creates for dairy farmers in 44 States is exactly the problem the Framers of the Constitution thought Congress would protect against in providing us with the power to regulate commerce among the States. 
Now, I understand that even more States are pondering the idea of a compact of their own. I cannot underscore how destructive this course is: using government-condoned, anticompetitive programs to the disadvantage of other domestic producers in other regions of the country. In an era of freer and fairer trade, I find it very troubling that what we don't want to do with our foreign competitors, we're now doing to ourselves. That's no way to encourage a national industry and that's no way to compete abroad. 
Of course, it is not just dairy producers who are hurt by the compact. According to Public Voice, a leading consumer advocacy group, the compact will cost New England consumers over $300 million in just 3 years, especially affecting the region's poor, and drive up the cost of Federal, State, and local food nutrition programs. Indeed, the St. Paul Pioneer Press, the Washington Post, the New York Times, and the Boston Herald--whose employees as New Englanders are ostensibly served by the compact--have called it `noxious,' `absurd,' an `ugly precedent,' and the `OPEC of milk.' 
The compact is being challenged in Federal court. In fact, last week, the court issued an order allowing the Secretary of Agriculture 45 days to bolster his arguments for the compact before the case proceeds any further. But what was most telling was the tenor of the order and I'll offer just an excerpt. The order reads:  
As the Court tried to make plain in its December 11, 1996 Opinion, [the court] could not even tell whether anyone at the Department of Agriculture had read all the comments in the administrative record or just counted them since the only expressed reason . . . for his finding of compelling public interest . . . was that 95 percent of the comments . . . supported the implementation of the Compact. But, a simple head count will not do . . . particularly in view of the numerous concerns the Secretary himself expressed [about the Compact]. Those concerns, expressed in four paragraphs, overshadow the four reasons, expressed in two sentences, that the Secretary gave for finding a compelling public interest.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, in short, a Federal judge cannot even find the merit behind the compact. But, despite earlier misgivings, the Department seems resigned to embarking on what appears to be the herculean task of making some sense out of the compact in order to save it from a court. 
Now, Mr. President, I believe this Congress has a unique opportunity to save an overcrowded court some time, help the Department focus its energies on the consolidation and reform of milk marketing orders, and do it all while guaranteeing New England consumers and dairy producers in 44 States a little fairness. We can do this by passing the Dairy Fairness Act. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
I see some of my other colleagues who have helped sponsor this legislation, including Senator Kohl and Senator Feingold, are on the floor, and I yield some time to them if they would like to add their support to this bill.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit this morning about the balanced budget amendment and really how important it is to our children, our grandchildren, and really to the future of this country. 
As a nation, we find ourselves at a very critical juncture. The choices we face today are stark: It is either stagnation or growth, poverty or prosperity, hope or hopelessness for our Nation's children. Throughout the history of this world, great nations have risen and great nations have fallen. Many have perished simply as a result of one fatal fiscal miscalculation at a critical time--a time at which we find ourselves today. 
We must move forward because we have a moral obligation to pave a trail and to light the way. Yet, a single misstep as we enter into the 21st century could cast our children off the path and into darkness. 
Now, despite the improvement of our short-term fiscal outlook in the past decade, we face great danger from the fiscal imbalances ahead that swing over us like a sword dangling from a thread. Without a balanced budget amendment to address these risks, I am afraid that the national debt will destroy this Nation. 
The debt today stands at over $5.3 trillion, and the cumulative damage of the national debt to the economy over the past 40 years has been enormous. Our Nation has fallen from its perch as the world's greatest creditor to become the world's greatest debtor Nation in history. 
A child born today enters the world already $20,000 in debt and faces an additional $1,300 every year just to pay the interest on that debt. 
By the year 2007, the national debt will rise to $8.5 trillion, and children born then will inherit a share of nearly $30,000. That is $30,000, whether poor, middle-class, or well off. Every child in every household in this land is affected. 
Now, as historian John Steele Gordon writes in his new book, `Hamilton's Blessing: The Extraordinary Life and Times of Our National Debt,' the size of the debt itself is not the problem--it is the fact that we have run it up to such extraordinary levels without justification. 
Gordon's research shows that in the first 184 years of our independence, the Nation borrowed a total of $300 billion to fight the wars that made and preserved our Nation. But he goes on to say that, in the last 36 years, we have taken on more than 17 times as much new debt--at first, in an attempt to maximize economic output, but in recent years, as he explains, no good reason whatsoever has been the cause behind this. 
Mr. President, the imbalance between the Government's entitlement promises and the funds it will have available to pay for them will alone bankrupt this Nation. 
Now, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform has warned us that in the year 2012, projected outlays for entitlements and interest on the national debt will at that time consume all tax revenues collected by the Federal Government. In 2030, projected spending for Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and Federal employee retirement programs alone will consume all of our tax revenues, leaving nothing to educate our kids, to keep their streets safe, to cure their diseases, or to protect the environment. 
Shortsighted politicians repeatedly refuse to make tough choices, and the knowledge that we have no clear public policy 
to address this imbalance darkens our future even more. 
Although the solutions to our problems are anything but simple, we must not shy away from them any longer. The balanced budget amendment will force Congress and the administration to work together to defuse this time bomb. Without it, the deficit spending will continue, and that is despite all the rhetoric from both Congress and the White House to the contrary. 
Even if we indeed balance the budget through a statutory requirement, we all know that this is not a guarantee that our budgets will balance in the future. Our national debt will take several generations to eliminate now. We not only need the will to balance the budget, but we also need the means to follow through, to keep the budget balanced, and to begin to return the borrowed money. We need the balanced budget amendment. Talking about the protection of our children, without addressing the long-term risks that are poised to imprison them is corrupt. 
Mr. President, I have heard my colleagues many times on the other side of the aisle this week raise the word children as if it were a protective shield. `We can't enact the balanced budget amendment,' they say, `the education of our children will suffer.' `We can't enact the balanced budget amendment, the nutritional health of our children is at stake.' `We can't enact a balanced budget amendment, our children's medical needs will go unserved.' 
They have also used the phrase that we have attacked children because they are the path of least resistance. Well, we know the work that we undertake every day in this Chamber has a profound effect on every American child, just as it affects every taxpayer, every working family, and every senior citizen. I am certain there is not a single Senator in this Chamber who would deny a child a good education, deny a child a hot meal, or deny a doctor's tender care. 
Yet, through our own greed, we have denied that very same child a future free of a debt that they did not incur and which they do not deserve to bear. 
Now, I ask you this, Mr. President: Who was protecting our children while Congress amassed a debt of $5.3 trillion? Those children were not here to be able to say don't do that. We took the path of least political resistance when we put our children into debt. They did not have a voice on this Senate floor to stop us from doing that. 
Who stood up for America's children while Congress signed their names to a mortgage that they will never be able to escape? 
Who came to the floor of this Chamber crying out for the children when we sacrificed their financial security for another piece of pork, or another Federal program? 
I will tell you this, Mr. President. The same Senators who today raise the shield of children as their argument against the balanced budget amendment were nowhere to be found when America's children needed them most. 
Only the balanced budget amendment will protect our children from the suffocating excess of a Congress free to spend dollars that it does not have. 
So, Mr. President, the legal authority of the balanced budget amendment will ensure that we do not drown our children in a sea of debt. The moral authority of a higher power demands that we do nothing less. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the remainder of my time.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Depository Institution Affiliation Act, which has been drafted by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato. This landmark piece of legislation will modernize the archaic laws that govern our financial services industry. Passage of this legislation will benefit consumers, increase the availability of venture capital for job creation, and bolster the international competitiveness of America's financial services industry. 
There is a clear need to modernize the outdated laws that govern America's financial services industry, because financial services play a vital role in our daily lives. We take out loans to go to college, to buy a car, and to purchase a home. We buy insurance to provide greater security to ourselves and our families. We make investments throughout our life so that we may retire in comfort and dignity. 
Today, technological advancements and increased innovation in the delivery of financial services make it easier than ever for consumers to get loans, purchase insurance, and invest their earnings. Unfortunately, our archaic and burdensome laws governing financial institutions continue to discourage, rather than encourage, such advancement and innovation. 
The laws to which I am referring are not those governing the safety and soundness of financial institutions, such as setting minimum capital requirements or requiring periodic oversight by Federal or State regulators. Safety and soundness laws and regulations are beneficial and necessary, as they enhance the security of the consumer whenever he or she deposits money in a bank or purchases an insurance policy. 
The outdated laws to which I am referring are the laws that create barriers to competition by artificially compartmentalizing the three major sectors of financial services--banking, securities, and insurance. For example, under the Banking Act of 1933, more commonly known as the Glass-Steagall Act, banks are generally barred from directly investing in corporate securities, underwriting new corporate issues or sponsoring mutual funds. Under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, securities underwriters, insurance underwriters, and nonfinancial companies are generally prohibited from owning banks or being owned by a bank holding company. 
These outdated financial institution laws hurt consumers by artificially increasing the costs of financial services, reducing the availability of financial 
products, and reducing the level of convenience in the delivery of financial services. These laws hurt small businesses--an engine of job growth in the American economy--by artifically limiting the amount of equity capital available for expanded activity. These laws weaken the international competitiveness of America's financial institutions by prohibiting them from offering the range of financial services that foreign financial institutions may offer. 
It should be noted that the Glass-Steagall Act--which created the compartmentalized structure of financial services that we have today--was based upon the false premise that the massive amount of bank failures that occurred during the Great Depression was caused by the securities activities that these banks conducted. However, just the opposite is true: Diversification in financial services actually increased the safety and soundness of the banks. Between 1929 and 1933, 26.3 percent of all national banks failed. However, the failure rate for those banks that conducted securities activities was lower. Of the national banks in 1929 that either had securities affiliates or had internal bond departments, only 7.2 percent had failed by 1933. The message from these statistics is clear: We should encourage competition and diversification, not discourage it. 
Last year, Congress passed a bipartisan and comprehensive legislative initiative to reform the Telecommunications Act and stimulate competition and innovation in the telecommunications industry. Similar action is needed this year to stimulate the growth and global competitiveness of our financial services industry. 
The Depository Institution Affiliation Act creates a new Financial Services Holding Company structure that will permit banks, thrifts, securities companies and insurance companies to affiliate and cross-market their products. This structure will do this while maintaining consumer protections and the safety and soundness of the Federal deposit insurance system. 
This legislation will greatly benefit consumers. The D'Amato bill's termination of affiliation restrictions will significantly increase competition in the financial services industry. Consumers' costs in the purchase of insurance, securities and banking products will be lowered. The bill's termination of crossmarketing restrictions will increase consumer convenience, as consumers will be able to do one-stop shopping for all of their financial services needs. The D'Amato bill does all of this while maintaining the statues and regulations that protect consumers from fraud and discrimination. 
This legislation will maintain the safety and soundness of the Federal deposit insurance system. The D'Amato bill protects banks from being affected by affiliate and holding company insolvency by implementing firewalls that prohibit affiliates from raiding the insured bank. As added protection, it requires that if a bank becomes anything less than satisfactorily capitalized, the Financial Services Holding Company must immediately divest of the bank. 
This legislation will provide for competitive equality among all financial services providers. Its provisions have been carefully crafted to provide a level playing field for banks, thrifts, securities companies and insurance companies. This charter up approach will permit all of these companies to become Financial Services Holding Companies, and will not prevent current financial institutions from conducting any activities that they currently conduct. 
In closing, I look forward to supporting Chairman D'Amato in his efforts to pass financial modernization legislation. It is my hope that 1997 will be the year that we join together and create a bipartisan bill that will reform our laws so that America's financial institutions will be able to compete, innovate and grow to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as the new chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations, I am pleased to offer my support for the nomination of Bill Richardson to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. 
Many of us have followed Congressman Richardson's globe-trotting missions to assist captured Americans in hostile circumstances. I want to express my personal appreciation for the successful effort he made two years ago to obtain the release of Bill Barloon in Iraq, since Mr. Barloon's brother lives in my home State of Minnesota. 
We were very grateful. I have no doubt that the lessons Bill Richardson has learned from these missions, which one newspaper dubbed `daredevil diplomacy,' will serve him well at the United Nations. Often, it seems the United States must use just the right mix of aggressive persuasion and diplomatic negotiations to convince the other 184 member states at the United Nations to go along with even minor reforms. 
As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have long had an interest in the reform and revitalization of the United Nations. But late last year, I was given the opportunity to become personally involved in some of the controversial issues surrounding this body when President Clinton appointed me to be a congressional delegate to the U.N. General Assembly. 
From October to December, I made three trips to the United Nations to participate in its activities. These included not only meeting with a wide range of U.N. officials and representatives from other nations, but also speaking before the U.N. budget committee--known as the Fifth Committee--and also the General Assembly itself. 
This experience reinforced my two key beliefs about the United Nations. First, that a properly structured United Nations can be a useful international forum and a vital tool for American foreign policy. And second, that it is also an unbelievably complex and bureaucratic organization which is crying out for an overhaul. 
Last month, I was encouraged by the visit to Washington of the new U.N. Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, and by his assertions to Congress that additional reforms are in the offing. I know many of us look forward to reviewing the reform package he has promised to develop by September of this year. 
During both his public testimony and in a private meeting with me, Bill Richardson pledged unprecedented consultations with Congress on U.N. issues. I deeply appreciated that promise and know that Mr. Richardson, as a member of Congress himself, understands the importance of genuine interaction between the executive and legislative branches on foreign policy. 
In that vein, there are some matters at the United Nations that I believe require immediate attention and I hope to begin working promptly with soon-to-be Ambassador Richardson to address them. 
To begin with, I am alarmed by the lack of resources currently being made available to the U.N. Inspector General, known as the Office of Internal Oversight Services, or the OIOS. This office is one that would not exist without American advocacy and, I might add, without the pressure of legislation mandating that some United States contributions to the United Nations be withheld until it was created. 
The OIOS is charged with rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement at the United Nations. According to the Undersecretary-General who runs the office, it does not always receive the cooperation it needs from all U.N. staff and member states. 
This is unfortunate because the purpose of the OIOS is to save money and make more effective use of U.N. resources. All member states should remember that money wasted is money that will not help meet the goals of programs that they themselves mandated the U.N. undertake. 
My immediate concern is that the budget of the OIOS has been cut dramatically this biennium, including a reduction of $700,000 just in 1997. It also has 12 posts which have not been filled, giving it an especially high vacancy rate for U.N. offices. In fact, my understanding is that the OIOS has only about 10 trained investigators to handle the massive job of U.N. oversight. 
Not only is this simply unacceptable, but it causes us to question whether the U.N. Inspector General's office is truly independent. 
Now I hope one of Mr. Richardson's first priorities will be to sit down with Secretary-General Annan and figure out how to bring the OIOS up to full strength. 
This means not only filling vacant posts for 1997, but making sure there is funding in the 1998-99 budget outline to continue those posts into the next biennium. It also means making sure the OIOS has sufficient resources to support the activities of its investigators. 
We have heard enough excuses on this issue and it's time for it to be resolved. The United States has declared that one of its reform goals is to expand the U.N. Inspector General's authority to all agencies and programs throughout the U.N. system. I strongly support this reform goal, but question how it can be accomplished when the OIOS is having great difficulty meeting its current responsibilities. 
Another issue which has caused deep congressional concern is the loss of the U.S. seat on the U.N. Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, known as the ACABQ. 
This is the first year since the founding of the United Nations that the United States has not had a position on this crucial budget committee. Without this seat, it will be even more difficult for the United States to get access to important technical budget information at the very time we are trying to enforce fiscal restraint and a no-growth budget at the United Nations. 
I would recommend Mr. Richardson take three important steps with regard to the ACABQ: First, he must make sure the U.S. mission to the United Nations and Congress will continue to have access to important budget information whenever necessary. 
Second, he should ensure that any matters involving the commitment or reprogramming of U.N. funds are considered in the General Assembly's Fifth Committee, on which the United States still has a seat, rather than only by the ACABQ. 
Now third, it is clear the United States must regain its seat during the next elections for the ACABQ in 1998. Given the stunning loss of the last U.S. candidate, Mr. Richardson and the State Department need to fully consult with Congress before nominating our next ACABQ candidate. 
Mr. President, before I close, I want to say a few words about the major U.N. issue facing Congress this year, which is the President's request for $1 billion to pay United States arrears to the United Nations. 
Given what I understand so far of the President's plan--and I still have yet to see anything on paper from the administration--I must express my disappointment with his U.N. reform proposal. 
First of all, I am dismayed by the reluctance, if not outright refusal, of the administration to link incremental payment of U.S. arrears to specific U.N. reforms mandated by law. Clearly, this general approach has been successful on a series of reforms ranging from the creation of the U.N. Inspector General to the ongoing implementation of a no-growth budget. 
Second, I am concerned the administration is focusing narrowly on simply reducing U.N. budgets and assessments to the United States. While I agree that mandating budget reductions can force U.N. bureaucrats to prioritize funding and programs, this is only part of the picture. 
There are a whole series of management reforms that also deserve to have the leverage of U.S. arrears behind them. The point is that we don't just want a less expensive United Nations, but one that is more manageable and efficient. 
Third, I have reservations about the President's request for $921 million as an advance appropriation for fiscal year 1999. These reservations are heightened if such funding will not be legislatively conditioned on mandatory reforms. 
My personal view is that this appropriation should not be rushed through Congress just so the President can have it in his pocket for safekeeping. We should consider this funding in the normal authorization and appropriations process so that it can be examined in the context of all budget priorities. 
I understand that Secretary Albright will be coming to Congress tomorrow to discuss the President's proposal so I will defer other comments until after that meeting. However, as an opening bid in the negotiations over how to resolve U.S. arrears and guarantee U.N. reform, the administration's plan seems to be falling short. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I hope negotiations between Congress and the administration can proceed quickly so that we can begin discussing a serious, comprehensive U.N. reform agenda. To that end, I look forward to working with our next United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, on a close and productive basis to strengthen the relationship between the United States and the United Nations.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
I commend the chairman, the Senator from Utah, for all the hard work he has done on this amendment. 
Mr. President, it was 2 years ago I rose as a freshman Member of this body to express my strong support for a constitutional amendment to balance the Federal budget. `There is no question that Congress must pass a balanced budget amendment and send it to the States for ratification.' That is what I said here on the Senate floor. 
I thought that with the will of the American people behind us, at that time we had every reason to be optimistic about its passage. 
Well, here we are again, 2 years later, debating the same question we debated in 1995. And I am here once again to call for the passage of the balanced budget amendment. 
We have already heard many of the arguments in support of Senate Joint Resolution 1, and I will not use this opportunity to repeat them all. But let it simply be said that there are indeed many. 
However, the release of the President's budget just this morning illustrates just how difficult it is to produce a balanced budget void of gimmicks and accounting tricks, and illustrates the very real need for the balanced budget amendment. 
Mr. President, this morning we got a first glimpse of the President's budget for fiscal year 1998. After a quick review of this massive document, I must say my initial feeling has been mixed. 
On the one hand, I am pleased that the President has agreed to many of our goals, such as a balanced budget by the year 2002, tax relief for American families, and Medicare reform, and a strong national defense. 
On the other hand, I am very concerned about what I see as serious flaws included in the President's plan. 
Let me begin my observations with the President's education proposals, which he described in his State of the Union Address as `My No. 1 priority for the next four years.' 
The President proposes $51 billion for education spending next year. That is an increase of 20 percent, rising to nearly $60 billion by the year 2002, a 40-percent increase. 
This includes $36 billion in tax incentives for education and training; $5 billion for school construction; $1.2 billion for a new reading program; and increased funding to connect schools to the Internet. 
Mr. President, we all agree that there exists a strong correlation between education and steady economic growth. 
Investing in the skills and abilities of the future U.S. work force will enable us to achieve and maintain high levels of knowledge and productivity in the workplace--helping to improve our standard of living and ability to remain globally competitive. 
However, the core question is not whether the Government should invest in education, but how those taxpayer dollars should be spent--and, ultimately, whether more spending is the answer to our education problems. 
The United States has outspent every other G-7 country in education and leads in the attainment of secondary and university degrees. Our total government spending in all levels of education as a percentage of GDP has increased from 4.8 percent in 1985 to 5.1 percent in 1993--the highest among the G-7 countries. Eighty-four percent of our population successfully completes secondary education--once again, that is the highest among the G-7 countries. Twenty-four percent of our population receive a college or university diploma, a percentage more than twice that of Germany, the United Kingdom and France. It is significantly greater than that of Japan. 
Despite hundreds of billions of dollars in education spending and hundreds of Federal programs, American students continue to perform poorly compared to students in other countries, particularly in terms of basic science and math skills. The science and math scores of our students are the lowest among Canada, France, Italy, Switzerland, Taiwan, and Korea. Our Scholastic Aptitude Test scores among college-bound students have barely increased over the last decade, and remain below those scores attained in the 1960's and 70's. 
We are spending more and achieving less. Clearly, this proves that spending more money on education is not the solution. If it were, the United States would have long been No. 1 in the world in attaining academic success. Unfortunately, throwing more money at the problem appears to be this administration's only solution. The administration would do well to look at my State of Minnesota, where a recent study conducted by the St. Paul Pioneer Press showed that the school districts with the highest per-student spending produced test scores that were among the lowest. 
The President's education plan fails miserably at addressing the real issues that face our Nation. This is unacceptable. We must dedicate ourselves to improving our education system, but we must do it right. 
First and foremost, in my view, an honest education budget should be one that restores and revives our traditional values in American education: It should ensure our current resources are used efficiently; it must have incentives built into Federal programs to reward students as well as teachers who improve their performance; it must focus on improving basic science and math skills of our primary and secondary school students; it must ensure a crime- and drug-free learning environment; it must ensure that taxpayer dollars are actually helping educate our youth. 
Now let me turn to the President's tax proposals. I am pleased the President has acknowledged the tremendous good we accomplish by allowing working families to keep a little bit of their own money through the child tax credit. The President has moved one step closer to the $500 per-child tax credit my Republican colleagues and I have long been advocating, and we welcome him on board. However, there still exists a big gap between his proposal and ours. 
First of all, the President's child tax credit has too many limitations. For instance, the President extends his tax credit only to preteen children, those under 13 years of age, taking away the tax credit dollars just when families need them most. 
In the President's budget, the tax credit begins at only a $300 per-child for the first 3 years and is finally increased to $500 in the year 2000. Moreover, the President's plan begins phasing out the tax credit for families with a combined income of $60,000, with more limited credits for families making as much as $75,000. Finally, the President's tax credit would not be available unless deficit reduction targets are met. 
Now these limitations greatly dilute the purpose of child tax relief. The extensive debate we have undertaken in the past 2 years over fiscal policy has helped us understand that working families are indeed overtaxed. In fact, families today spend more on taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined. A $500 per child tax credit--without limitation--is more appropriate and necessary to allow families to make more of their own spending decisions. 
As a long-time advocate for tax relief, I would prefer a zero capital gains tax on all investment incomes. While I do applaud the President's proposal to provide a capital gains tax cut for homeowners, his plan is really just a small step forward. It is hard to justify the exemption of this type of investment gain from other investments, such as the individual who chooses to live in a relatively modest home and invest in stocks and perhaps the formation of a small manufacturing company. Why should those individuals be taxed more harshly than those who invest in a personal residence? 
In my view, a general cut in the capital gains tax must be provided to encourage savings, and to treat all investors equally. The current tax system discourages national savings and investment, which will adversely affect our long-term economic growth. Fundamental reform is needed to change the system. 
The President's budget includes tax cuts totaling $98.5 billion, with most of it going toward the family tax credit, education tax subsidies, and expanded IRA's. However, the Clinton budget proposes new tax increases targeted at airline passengers, small and large investors, and the Nation's job providers totaling some $76 billion. We can do the math ourselves: The President's budget leaves a net tax cut of just $22.4 billion. I do not believe that is what the American people intended when they re-elected the President to a second term. 
Another serious concern lies with the President's proposed new entitlement spending. If the President is serious about adding another $60 billion in new entitlement spending, he must show us why we need new spending programs when we have yet to repair the ones we already have. 
Finally, Mr. President, I remain concerned about the economic assumptions the White House has relied upon in drafting its plan, which are significantly more optimistic than the projections of the Congressional Budget Office. The President's budget has not yet been scored by the CBO. Once it is, it may very well be $70 billion short of our deficit targets. 
President Clinton came here to Capitol Hill just over one year ago and stood in the House Chamber to declare that, `The era of big government is over.' I am afraid that sentiment is not reflected within the 2,418 pages of the President's budget. I had hoped for bold steps from the President in addressing the very real need to control the growth of the Federal Government. But what we received today were more like baby steps, the first tentative wobbles of an infant. Under the President's budget, Washington will actually spend 3.5 percent more in the next fiscal year than we are today. While the President's budget appears to reach balance in 2002, more than 60 percent of his deficit reduction are slated to come after he has left office. Leaving those tough decisions not to the Clinton White House, but the administration of the Nation's next Chief Executive. 
Mr. President, I commend the President for the blueprint he has prepared for us, and I look forward to working with him and my colleagues to improve on and implement these historic changes in our Government. In the administration's budget, we have before us a good foundation on which to build that bridge to the 21st century the White House is so fond of speaking about. But without addressing some of the serious concerns I have outlined today, I am afraid that bridge may collapse before we are able to cross it. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I introduce legislation aimed at improving government as we know it. The Department of Energy Abolishment Act of 1997 comes after nearly two decades of debate. The basic question has always remained the same: Why should we expend taxpayer dollars on this Cabinet-level agency? And today, we ask the same question. 
Following a year's worth of discussions on the blueprint I am putting forth, much progress has been made. When the 104th Congress began to tackle this issue, we looked at three main issues. First, we examined the fact that the Department of Energy no longer has a mission--which is clearly reflected by the fact that nearly 85 percent of its budget is expended upon nonenergy programs. Next, we studied those programs charged to the DOE and reviewed its ability to meet the related job requirements. And finally, we looked at the DOE's bloated budget in light of the first two criterion--determining whether the taxpayers should be forced to expend over $16 billion annually on this hodge-podge collection. 
Nearly a year later, this Nation continues to grow increasingly dependent upon foreign oil--in total contrast to the DOE's core mission. Even in light of this administration's focus on alternative energy, the DOE expends less than one-fifth of its budget on energy-related programs. And after examining key DOE mission programs, such as the Civilian Nuclear Waste program, it is clear that the goals of those missions are not being met. 
So we are challenged to either accept the status quo or move to change it. I must admit that the status quo may be easier in the short-term. But in the context of the proverbial big picture, we cannot afford to turn our backs. Besides the fact that it is the role of Congress to oversee taxpayer expenditures and ensure a fair rate of return on their investments, this Nation is faced with a national debt in excess of $5.3 trillion. 
However, gaining consensus on the need for change is easier than effecting such change. So, last year I worked with the Senate Task Force on Government Agency Elimination to develop a blueprint. Under the direction of the former Senate Majority Leader, Senator Dole, I worked with Senators Faircloth, Abraham, and Stevens to study proposals on the DOE. 
After months of discussions with experts in the fields of energy and defense, we introduced legislation--legislation which is the core of the bill I am introducing today. 
Let me be the first to state that the ideas contained within this bill are not all of my own. Just as the idea to eliminate the Department of Energy is not a new one--since its creation in 1978, experts have been clamoring to abolish this agency in search of a mission. This bill represents the comments and input of many who have worked in these fields for decades, but like all things--I consider it a work in progress. 
As many of our colleagues will recall, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing on this very bill last September. During the hearing, we received testimony from such distinguished witnesses as the Former Assistant Energy Secretary Shelby Brewer and the Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger in support of the proposal. Having either directly run these programs, or relied upon them, they provided strong firsthand evidence as to the detriment of leaving things as they are. 
The committee also received testimony from the current Acting Secretary and then-Assistant Energy Secretary, Charlie Curtis, who testified in support of improving the delivery of the Department's missions, at lower cost, for the benefit of the American people. His testimony focused upon how the DOE was working to improve its efforts to fulfill various missions, and how changing horses midstream would derail the DOE's efforts. In his remarks, Mr. Curtis dismissed the DOE Abolishment Act because the DOE did not believe it appropriate to entertain matters of this moment and complexity in the context of a bill which has as its proposed objective changing the organizational structure and fate of the Department of Energy. 
What the DOE fails to recognize is that the conclusions--to abolish the DOE--arise from an analysis of the Department's activities, rather than from any antigovernment ideology or mere desire to reduce government spending, as pointed out by Dr. Irwin Stelzer of the American Enterprise Institute. Supporters of the DOE Abolishment Act have always agreed that there are core functions performed by the DOE which must continue to be done, but the DOE has yet to provide a compelling argument as to why the DOE itself must continue to exist or successfully respond to our reasons for its elimination. 
But Mr. Curtis' objections are understandable when placed in the context of remarks by Nobel-prize economist, Dr. Milton Friedman: `The Department of Energy offers an excellent example of a major difference between private and government projects. If a private project is a failure, it will be closed down; if a government project is a failure, it will be expanded. * * * It is in the self-interest of the Government officials in charge to keep the project alive; and they always have the ready excuse that the reason for failure was the lack of sufficient funds.' 
So today, I am joined by my colleagues, Senator Abraham of Michigan, Senator Ashcroft of Missouri, Senator Faircloth of North Carolina, Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas, Senators Kyl and McCain of Arizona and Senator Stevens of Alaska, in reaffirming congressional intent to change the Department of Energy as we know it. 
Under the Department of Energy Abolishment Act of 1997, we dismantle the patchwork quilt of government initiatives--reassembling them into agencies better equipped to accomplish their basic goals; we refocus and increase Federal funding toward basic research by eliminating corporate welfare; and, we abolish the bloated, duplicative upper management bureaucracy. 
First, we begin by eliminating Energy's Cabinet-level status and establish a 3-year Resolution Agency to oversee the transition. This is critical to ensuring progress continues to be made on the core programs. 
Under title I, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC] is spun off to become an independent agency, like it was prior to the creation of the DOE. The division which oversees hearings and appeals is eliminated, with all pending cases transferred to the Department of Justice for resolution within 1 year. The functions of the Energy Information Administration are transferred to the Department of the Interior with the instruction to privatize as many as possible. And with the exception of research being conducted by the DOE labs, basic science and energy research functions are transferred to Interior for determination on which are basic research, and which can be privatized. Those deemed as core research will be transferred to the National Science Foundation and reviewed by an independent commission. Those that are more commercial in nature will be subject to disposition recommendations by the Secretary of the Interior. 
The main reasoning behind this is to ensure the original mission of the DOE--to develop this Nation's energy independence--is carried out. With scarce taxpayer dollars currently competing against defense and cleanup programs within the DOE, it's no surprise that little progress has been made. However, by refocusing dollars into competitive alternative energy research--we will maximize the potential for areas such as solar, wind, biomass, and so forth. For States like Minnesota, where the desire for renewable energy technologies is high, growth in these areas could help fend off our growing dependence upon foreign oil while protecting our environment. 
Under Title II, the laboratory structure within the DOE is revamped. First, the three defense labs are transferred to the Defense Department. They include Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. The remaining labs are studied by a nondefense energy laboratory commission. This independent commission operates much like the Base Closure Commission and can recommend restructuring, privatization, or a transfer to the DOD as alternatives to closure. Congress is granted fast-track authority to adopt the Commission's recommendations. 
Title III attempts to assess an inventory of the Power Marketing Administration's assets, liabilities, and so forth. This inventory is aimed at ensuring fair treatment of current customers and a fair return to the taxpayers. All issues, including payments by current customers must be included in the General Accounting Office's [GAO] audit. 
Petroleum reserves are the focus of title IV. The Naval Petroleum Reserve is targeted for immediate sale. Any of the reserves that are unable to be disposed of within the 3-year window will be sold transitionally from the Interior Department. With the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, it is transferred to the Defense Department and an audit on value and maintenance costs is conducted by the GAO. Then, the DOD is charged with determining how much oil to maintain for national security purposes after reviewing the GAO report. 
Under titles V and VI, all of the national security and environmental restoration-management activities to the Department of Defense. Therefore, all defense-related activities are transferred back to Defense, but are placed in a new civilian controlled agency--Defense Nuclear Programs Agency--to ensure budget firewalls and civilian control over sensitive activities such as arms control and nonproliferation activities. 
And the program which has received much criticism as of late, the Civilian Nuclear Waste Program, is transferred to the Corps of Engineers. This section dovetails legislation adopted by the Senate last Congress. A key element is that the interim storage site is designated at Nevada's test site area 25. Building upon legislation I introduced last Congress, the GAO is directed to recommend privatization options and provide cost saving estimates for the overall program. 
For 35 States, including my home State of Minnesota, timely resolution to the nuclear waste issue is essential. The continued impasse over the designation of interim and permanent waste sites implies additional slippages in the DOE's legal requirement to accept nuclear waste by 1998. Minnesota stands to lose nearly 30 percent of its energy resources shortly after the turn of the century, but 34 other States face similar crisis. Having paid over $250 million into the Nuclear Waste Trust Fund, Minnesota's ratepayers want resolution, not the continual foot-dragging we have seen from the DOE. And when we look at the $12 billion collected to date in contrast to the lack of progress over the past 15 years, it is clear that the status quo is not working. That is primarily the impetus behind today's announcement by the Nuclear Waste Strategy Coalition that they are petitioning the Courts for approval to stop payments to the Nuclear Waste Trust Fund. Until the Court order in July, the DOE even denied accountability for the program. It is time for a change if we want results. This legislation provides that change. 
Overall, outside models estimate savings between $19 and $23 billion in the first 5 years, and approximately $5 to $7 billion annually thereafter. This is in sharp contrast to the former Secretary's Strategic Alignment Initiative, which boasts unconfirmed savings of $14 billion but no savings in the outyears. 
In introducing this bill, our goals are to build upon the issues raised during last year's hearing; to hold additional hearings in conjunction with those who have expressed concerns over the Department of Energy--including Senator Brownback of Kansas, chairman of the Government Affairs Subcommittee on Government Management Oversight; and, to move forward on implementing a widely supported proposal. And, in the coming weeks, Representative Tiahrt of Kansas will be introducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives in the near future. 
Contrary to proponents of the status quo, the momentum is far from being derailed. In fact, if we were to look at the Department of Energy's own Report on External Regulation issued in December 1996, even its own working group recommended transferring the regulation of its nuclear facilities to outside entities. The report concluded that by through external regulation, and adoption of the private sector's safety culture, program safety and public confidence would be greatly enhanced. We agree. And we would like to see such concepts applied across the board to DOE's programs--and the DOE ultimately eliminated. We welcome any input to that end from the administration. 
And so looking back over the past year--examining how the debate has transformed from one of whether or not to maintain the status quo, to one of how to change it--I am encouraged over the progress we have made. Today, we mark the beginning of the debate on achieving our goal of streamlining government and improving the delivery of government services at lower costs to the American taxpayers. One year from now, it is my hope that we will be working toward the implementation of a restructuring plan on the Department of Energy.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today, with the support of my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, to introduce an important health care proposal that is designed to improve our emergency medical system and to ultimately benefit our constituents who depend on these services. The area is one I believe has not received the attention that it deserves. 
In a nation where some 268,000 Americans turn to the 911 emergency response system for help every single day, our population relies on the readiness, efficiency and the quick response of our emergency medical system. It is something on which the American people have come to depend, a service we nearly take for granted. We don't know when we need it, but we want it to work well when we do. The men and women who risk their lives in delivering emergency care are true heroes, yet their desire to improve the services they provide is rarely recognized by Congress. 
The nightly news is filled with the stories of local emergency response problems. You may recall the tragedy in Philadelphia in 1994 when a young boy died on the steps of his church after being beaten. It took police 40 minutes to respond after the first 911 call was received. 
Here in the District of Columbia, some residents have waited for more than 25 minutes before an ambulance responded to their 911 medical emergency. Far too often, Congress fails to respond until there is a national crisis, but we can't afford to wait for a crisis to occur before we respond to the needs of our emergency medical system. Patients' lives are at risk if Congress doesn't begin to help the system become more efficient. 
Currently, emergency medical service providers are not consulted when Washington is formulating national policy which affects their ability to respond in a timely and in an efficient manner, and there is no coordinated Government focus on EMS, no collection of national data and statistics which I believe would help Congress and the administration develop more effective policies to help improve EMS. 
Furthermore, there is no lead EMS agency to provide guidance and direction to Congress and the States when implementing Federal policies concerning Medicare reimbursement issues, emergency management planning, or the effect of Federal regulations on EMS providers. This lack of coordination often negatively impacts providers of EMS and our constituents who rely upon them. 
Later this year, Congress will be reauthorizing the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, for which its supporters will be asking for $26 billion in transportation spending, and yet the emergency medical services communities will likely not have a voice in improving our transportation system. 
That is the very system they depend upon to ensure that when they are dispatched to a patient in need of emergency medical services, the highway design or newest technologies will allow them to respond quickly and efficiently. EMS providers need a seat at the table. 
I find it ironic that we expect so much from our EMS system and yet, when they seek assistance, we continue to ignore their 911 call for help. 
That is why I am today introducing the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act of 1997. My legislation sets out a blueprint for responding to the needs of our emergency medical system and begins to address just a few of their concerns Washington has long ignored. 
First, the Grams-Graham bill will require Medicare to reimburse for ambulance services provided for emergency medical care based on the original diagnosis by a prudent layperson, instead of the ultimate diagnosis determined by health professionals in the emergency room. 
Mr. President, the division of emergency medical services for the city of St. Paul, MN, prepared a list for me of just some of their 1996 emergency ambulance transports that began as a 911 call for help, but were eventually denied payment by Medicare. 
Among the cases where payment was denied include a 79-year-old female, on several prescription medications, who had fallen in the night and was suffering from vertigo; a 72-year-old male, on numerous prescription medications, who had fallen on the sidewalk, had lacerations on his arm, a cut over his right eye, and was confused; and also a 95-year-old female who awoke confused and weak, possibly suffering from a stroke. 
In each of these incidents, emergency services personnel responded to what they believed to be medical emergencies. Even though the cases were ultimately ruled nonemergencies, the EMS providers should have been reimbursed by Medicare for the emergency transport service that they provided. 
As Joseph A. Grafft, EMS Manager for the FIRE/EMS Center at Metropolitan State University in St. Paul noted in a letter to me, `Ambulance providers are not physicians and do not diagnose patients. They deal with presenting symptoms and give care based on these symptoms. The physicians diagnose and make the final determination. Ambulance providers should not be penalized for doing their job.' 
Our bill ensures that Medicare reimbursements are based on the original diagnoses of the 911 callers. At the same time, we do not seek reimbursements for medical conditions that are clearly not life-threatening. 
Second, our bill establishes two separate advisory councils comprised of emergency service providers and others. The first will advise the Health Care Financing Administration on issues pertaining to Medicare reimbursement. The second advisory council will make recommendations to the administration and Congress in regard to improving the efficiency and coordination of our emergency medical system. 
Third, our bill will designate a lead-EMS agency, to be established at the direction of the Secretary of Transportation in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary will make recommendations to Congress as to which functions should be transferred to the Transportation Department in order to streamline and coordinate the EMS system. 
Finally, our bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a national database for the collection of statistics relating to the delivery of emergency medical services within our national transportation system and national emergency response system. 
The Secretary will set forth the appropriate criteria for national data collection in consultation with State EMS agencies to ensure the least burdensome data collection reporting procedures. We would hope this database could be tied to an existing data collection system. 
I believe these four provisions will begin to address a few of the needs that the EMS community has brought to my attention. This bill will allow Congress, the President, as well as State and local officials to have the resources and also the facts they need to make necessary improvements in emergency medical care to patients. 
Dr. Daniel Hankins, president of the Minnesota Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, made that point eloquently in a recent letter to me. He said, `For too long EMS has been forgotten when health care legislation has been proposed.' 
He went on to say, `EMS is a small, but crucial part of the overall health care system. It is in most rural areas the only lifeline for access into emergency care. It is a fragile safety net . . . that is only held together by the dedication of the many volunteers that comprise the EMS system.' 
Mr. President, I am pleased that I am joined today by the senior Senator from the State of Florida in the introduction of this legislation. We are proud to have a large number of organizations--organizations dedicated to improving emergency medical care--supporting our legislation.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President. The Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act is not the answer to all of the problems. But it is the first step in addressing the concerns of a very important segment of both our health care and transportation systems. This bill is a blueprint for further improvements in emergency medical services to help all Americans. 
By introducing today's legislation early in the session, it is my hope that we will call attention to the needs of EMS providers and move forward to a more comprehensive bill, one that addresses additional concerns that are equally important to the EMS community as those we have addressed here today. 
Over the next few weeks, I will be working with EMS providers in Minnesota and throughout the country to look at improving four key areas: regulatory oversight, technology improvements in medicine and transportation, insurance reimbursement issues, and the EMS functions which should be transferred and streamlined under the Department of Transportation. 
Senator Graham has worked tirelessly to ensure that the definition of `prudent layperson' apply not only to ambulance service but also to care provided at emergency departments. In our second bill, it is our intent to include Senator Graham's new language to ensure that patients are not denied reimbursement for emergency care because they failed to obtain proper certification or authorization from their insurance provider. I look forward to working with the American Association of Health Plans, which today announced new policies to clarify how health plans should cover emergency care, in developing an appropriate legislative solution. 
The legislation we introduce today and our subsequent work will be part of an ongoing effort we hope to include in the newly drafted Rural Health Improvement Act. This important overall effort, in which I have also been involved, will help ensure that rural areas are not overlooked in our desire to improve health care delivery. 
So finally, Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator Graham, Senator Thomas, and others in the months and weeks ahead to improve emergency medical services for patients and providers and ensure the most efficient use of scarce tax dollars. The American people expect--and of course deserve--nothing less. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to join with my distinguished colleagues, Mr. Murkowski, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Mr. Craig of Idaho, in introducing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. As a cosponsor of the legislation passed by the Senate during the 104th Congress, I believe this legislation represents the best means of ensuring that the Department of Energy meet its legal obligations to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998. 
Last year, nearly identical legislation was adopted by a strong bipartisan vote in the Senate. And with nuclear waste scattered over some 35 States, including my home State of Minnesota, it was no surprise that the national interest in resolving this issue is strong. However, a variety of factors, including a lack of action by the House of Representatives, led to the demise of the 104th Congress' bill. 
But support for enacting a real solution has never been stronger. Last July, the U.S. Court of Appeals reaffirmed that the DOE continues to have responsibility for permanently storing our Nation's commercial waste. It is no wonder, considering our nation's ratepayers have already contributed some $12 billion; over $250 million from Minnesotans alone. 
Having recently returned from Yucca Mountain, the proposed permanent storage site located in Nevada, I believe much progress has been made over the last year. But after 15 years and with nearly half the nuclear trust fund depleted, there still remains no measurable value and the American public is fed up with empty promises from their Federal Government. They deserve action now. 
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 delivers such action. It provides all the tools necessary to break our interim storage impasse. Furthermore, it provides mechanisms to complete the characterization of Yucca Mountain and gets the program moving out of the current stalemate. 
With 1998 just around the corner, timely action on this legislation is critical. For States like Minnesota, which stand to lose nearly 30 percent of its overall energy resources, action should have occurred last year. And now, with the confirmation of a new Energy Secretary required, and the program in transition, Congress is faced with some tough challenges but our resolve must remain strong. And the introduction of this legislation today is our first step. 
In the coming weeks and months, we will be asking our colleagues to join us in supporting this long overdue legislation. Rarely does the Congress have the opportunity which meets the twin goals of protecting our environment and strengthening our economy. Mr. President, I hope that the support we had last Congress will be even stronger this year. I would encourage my colleagues to add their name today as cosponsors to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997.

Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the bill introduced today by my colleagues, Senator Grassley and Senator Dorgan, to clarify the intent of Congress and to allow farmers and ranchers to use deferred payment contracts without tax penalty under the alternative minimum tax. 
Last year this Congress passed, and the President signed, the most sweeping reforms in agricultural policy in 60 years, giving our farmers and ranchers the freedom to farm. Farmers can now plant for the market, not for Uncle Sam. 
But our commitment to agriculture did not--and cannot--end there. We promised farmers and ranchers regulatory reform, free and fair trade, market-oriented tools to better manage their risk, and tax relief. Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service has caused us to radically depart from this commitment in regard to tax relief. By ruling that producers are subject to tax liability on deferred payment contracts in the year the contract is signed, instead of when he or she actually receives the payment, the IRS has dealt American agriculture a very serious blow. 
Cash-based accounting, as it is often called, is extremely important to Minnesota farmers because incomes fluctuate so radically from year to year depending on what Mother Nature decides to unleash on us. This is especially important in my home State of Minnesota because, as many of you know, some say it is the land of 9 months of winter and then 3 months of poor sledding. 
But adding further to the importance of cash-based accounting is the fact that farmers and ranchers are only paid once or twice a year. Understandably, many farmers and ranchers like to receive their payments in installments. And that is much the way school teachers do over the summer months. Getting paid in increments can ease their cash flow problems that might otherwise occur. 
Congress, to its credit, has always understood these unique circumstances and therefore always intended agriculture to have the benefit of cash-based accounting. As late as 1980, Congress reaffirmed this. But according to the IRS, this all changed in amendments to the Tax Code in 1986. I disagree. Without rehashing all of the arguments of why this decision is in error, let me offer just one. 
As one Rutgers University tax law professor observed, had this been the intent of the proposed changes to the Tax Code in 1986, surely there would have been large-scale opposition at that time. And, no doubt, the opposition would have been spearheaded by Senator Grassley, who sits on the tax writing committee. But there was not a word about it. Maybe that is why it took the IRS a decade to find out why. 
None of us want to point fingers at who is responsible for this mistake. We only want congressional intent carried out. If the most efficient way of accomplishing this end is to pass legislation to clarify things, then that is what we should do. 
Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill. I commend Senators Grassley and Dorgan for their leadership on this issue. I urge timely consideration and passage of this extremely important bill.

Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for helping us in supporting this bill. 
Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation, together with Senator Hutchinson, my distinguished colleague from Arkansas, a bill to provide the $500 per child tax credit for America's working families. We are pleased, as I said, to be joined by Senator Nickles, along with Senators Kyl and Coats, in introducing this bill. 
The November election sends us a very clear message that the American people want us to work together, to work together in a bipartisan manner, to balance the Federal budget, control the growth of Government, and to restore its accountability. While we see the tax burden increase on the middle class, working families need our help, and it is time that Congress and the President come together to deliver it. 
Since the opening days of the 105th Congress, a renewed spirit of cooperation has settled in over Washington. Instead of the partisan politics that have often and too often exploited our disagreements, the talk from the Capitol Building to the White House has centered on creating consensus. Just yesterday in his inaugural address the President affirmed this commitment when he said, `The American people returned to office a President of one party and a Congress of another. Surely they did not do this to advance the politics of petty bickering and partisanship, which they plainly deplore.' 
While a sign of that new commitment, I believe, is the strongest and the most compassionate statement this Congress and this President can make in 1997 on behalf of working families is to cut their taxes and to leave them a little bit more of their own money at the end of the day, the extensive debate that we have undertaken in the past 2 years over fiscal policy has helped us to understand that working families are indeed overtaxed. 
The child tax credit is appropriate and necessary to stimulate economic growth and to allow families to make more of their own spending decisions. The people of Minnesota sent me to Washington with their instructions to make the $500-per-child tax credit a top priority. Like struggling men and women nationwide, Minnesotans have seen what our outrageous tax burden has done to their families over the past 40 years. It is far from merely being a fact of life. Taxes today dominate the family budget. 
There is no better argument for tax relief than to consider that taxpayers today are spending more to feed their Government than they are spending to feed, clothe, and shelter their families. When we debated the $500-per-child tax credit in the last Congress, some of my colleagues expressed their concern that any tax relief now would jeopardize their efforts to balance the Federal budget. Balance the budget first, they said, and then cut taxes later. Their concerns missed a very important part. The budget will never be balanced or stay balanced until we decide that it is the people who should prosper under it and not the Government. 
Recent economic data reveal that despite a shrinking Federal deficit, the Government is in fact getting bigger, not smaller. Government spending and taxes continue to soar, and total taxation now claims the largest bite in the Nation's 
income in history. Without significant policy changes, the deficit will begin climbing again in fiscal year 1998 and reach over $200 billion by the year 2002. 
By enacting the $500-per-child tax credit we can begin turning back the decades of abuse which taxpayers have suffered at the hands of their own Government, a Government often eager to spend the taxpayers' money with reckless regard. The $500-per-child tax credit is the right solution because it takes power out of the hands of Washington's big spenders and puts it back where it can do the most good, and that is in the hands of families. 
Nobody outside of Washington's insulated fantasy world really thinks the Government can spend the family's dollars more efficiently than the family would. By leaving that money in the family bank accounts, taxpayers are then empowered to use it to directly benefit their own household. They can make the best decisions on how to spend those dollars. Beyond the direct benefits, families' tax relief can have a substantial and a positive impact on the economy as a whole. 
It was John F. Kennedy who observed that `an economy hampered with high tax rates will never introduce enough revenue to balance the budget, just as it will never produce enough output and enough jobs.' President Kennedy was able to put these theories to work in the early 1960's when he enacted significant tax cuts that sparked one of the few periods of sustained growth that we have experienced in the last half century. 
It was 20 years later when President Ronald Reagan cut taxes once again that reinvigorated the economy, which responded enthusiastically with 19 million new jobs that were created, and take-home pay grew 13 percent between 1982 and 1996. It is now President Clinton who has the opportunity to work alongside Congress as we cut taxes and generate a new era of growth in the economy and prosperity for American families. I am encouraged by his public cause for family tax relief, and in particular his words in support of the $500-per-child tax credit. 
With the President truly committed to working with us, there is every reason to believe that a plan that will balance the budget and reduce the tax load for working families will pass this Congress and be signed into law this year. We made a promise to middle class Americans that we would cut their taxes. We laid the groundwork for the $500-per-child tax credit in the 104th Congress, so now in the 105th it is time that we put aside politics and deliver on the promise. 
So I ask that S. 9 be introduced and properly referred.
